<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great for under the eyes.  Seems to help with wrinkles and dark (purple) circles under eyes.</li>
    <li> I can always tell when I have forgot to use this serum, as my skin is not as radiant &amp; firm.  Excellent Vitamin C serum!  There are many on the market, but very few that actually deliver the results they promise.</li>
    <li> My skin looks brighter and smooth!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any benefits but none of the topical Vitamin C that I&#x27;ve used really did produce benefits.  I usually have a reaction (red bumps) when I use it on my face but it works okay on my neck and chest.  Probably will not use any topical Vitamin C (but will stick with Retinol and absorbent creams).</li>
    <li> I started using this along with an anti-aging firming serum so I don&#x27;t know which one is REALLY working or if they&#x27;re both doing the job, but I have never had such smooth, clear skin.  I have had acne-prone skin, discoloration, and large pores and these 2 products have really made a difference in my skin.  I still don&#x27;t have perfect skin and I still have pores that are pretty dominant, however, I have never been happier with the texture and tone of my skin.</li>
    <li> great for your skin- nourishes and repairs....I keep getting asked if I do Botox...NEVER!</li>
    <li> A must purchase! I have been using this product for about  2 weeks, and the redness in my face has reduced dramatically.</li>
    <li> Noticed some spots have cleared a little bit, still using it religiously morning and evening.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle. I dont see any difference at all. But I didn&#x27;t have any adverse reaction to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using various brands of vitamin C serums for years and this is the worst.  I just finished a bottle of Obagi 20% vitamin C serum before I started using OZ and my skin went from radiant to dry and sallow in about a week.  There is no tingle at all, telling me that although this product contains a vitamin C that is &amp;#34;20%,&amp;#34; that it is incredibly diluted with other ineffective ingredients.  I&#x27;ll be tossing it and buying one that works.</li>
    <li> saw difference in a few days !  ..  I exfoliate every few days  ..  less wrinkles, more even tone, softer brighter skin  ...  will buy again !</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for 8 months and absolutely love it! I had an age spot on the side of my face that was getting very dark and hard to cover with concealer. Am pleased to say that it has faded so much that it is now barely noticeable. My skin is smoother, more vibrant and skin tone has evened out. Had tried other more expensive serums but didn&#x27;t like the tacky sticky feeling that would make my skin itch. This serum absorbs quickly and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I really do believe it is THE BEST VITAMIN C SERUM ever and cannot live without it! Try it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and really makes my skin smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> My beauty salon suggested that I should start using Vitamin C Serum.  Right now I&#x27;m using Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C.  My next purchase will be the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> this is a wonder product.  My face is smoother and have soft touch to it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for the past 2 months and I definitely saw an improvement in my skin its a great product and will recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> In literally one weeks time this serum has dramatically changed my skin...I went back after the third day and purchased the toner &amp; eye gel as I am so impressed with the results of this serum.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used yet. A must in my daily skincare regiment!</li>
    <li> I use this serum every night. It makes my pores feel smaller, my face tighter and smoother. When I wake up in the morning, it is still tight and NO oily feeling whatsoever! Not even in the T-zone. This stuff feels great and is affordable too. I, for one, am a dedicated user.</li>
    <li> I never purchased this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Notice a difference instantly</li>
    <li> I have purchased this serum multiple times! Feels great on the skin and can see firmer skin and fewer wrinkles after using.</li>
    <li> Great anti aging serum for all skin types. Absorbs into the skin nicely and without a greasy feel on your skin. If you are looking for antioxidants for your skin, this is the product perfect for that! My skin was instantly brightened and looked flawless even without makeup on. I found using this serum at night was best.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders!  Every month I break out on my chin due to my monthly menstrual cycle.  I have NOT broke out AT ALL since I have been using this.  My face feels wonderful and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin.  I love it!  NOTE:  PLEASSSSEEEE  STOP GOING UP ON THE PRICE!!!  As of 9/30/15 it is almost $10 more than what I bought it for! :(</li>
    <li> Love all the oz products.. A staple in my beauty regimen</li>
    <li> I am really loving the results I have seen with the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum!!</li>
    <li> I can really see a difference in my skin, and the price is much lower than some of the other companies.</li>
    <li> great product. Have used others for 8 years, now switching to OZ</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one week and I can see the difference it has made. I have a healthy glow that I love and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is really good, a little goes a very long way my face was really even and flawless looking. Please don&#x27;t stop or discontinue this product. You have a customer for life</li>
    <li> This all-natural moisturizer is amazing! After just one week, I could really tell a difference in my skin- it feels smoother, softer &amp; lines have softened without any heavy residue.  I am so happy to have found an effective serum that is also cruelty-free!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My skin has never been so hydrated but not greasy, soft and smooth.  I have been using the product for about 5 months and I really see a difference in clarity, texture and moisture.  THANKS, OZ NATURALS</li>
    <li> I use this serum daily.  I love the way it goes on smothes, and dries fast.  I use it before I use the sea infulsd moisturizer.  My skin looks wonderful.  The wrinkles are less visible the dark spots on my cheeks are much lighter.</li>
    <li> Love this, and you get so much product for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It&#x27;s very watery, as it&#x27;s supposed to be.  I cant really tell a difference in my face.  All my age spots look exactly the same.  But I KNOW Vitamin C is great for your skin and has been shown to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read in multiple places that vitamin C can reduce age spots.  I have a large one on my arm. I has become minutely smaller and has changed shape. At some point I&amp;#34;ll try to post a picture.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum online few months ago as per a friends suggestion..its a miracle for me..i used to have hyperpigmentations acne scars and also immature acne...i have seen improvement in few days use..my face started looking more fresh and bright in the mornings.it worked as a repairing serum for my face..now i can use less makeup on my face...i reccomend this..i will buy this again..</li>
    <li> It really works! I have noticed in my pictures that my skin appears more radiant, smooth, plump, and youthful. LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve used so often that I am now on my second bottle and won&#x27;t be switching back to any other serum</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Just as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a month and have noticed the change. my skin is firmer and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Can actually feel it working.</li>
    <li> I love the serum. It is lightweight and you can see results in less than a week. Really unbelievable results.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Vitamin C serum. I have used very expensive brands from the Dermatologist office and I prefer this Vitamin C serum. I was traveling and forget to pack this necessity and couldn&#x27;t wait to start  using it again. If you follow a skin care routine and use this everyday you will see a difference in your skin. It&#x27;s a great product at an affordable price, no gimmicks here and made in USA. The packaging is very simple, which I also like!</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I look any younger.. I am young.. However I notice my skin tone is a lot brighter and youthful?.. Definitely will be using this on a consistent basis. I don&#x27;t know how people get away with applying tiny drops.. I am a guy, I just use as much as the dropper will pull and pour it onto my palm. Rub in both hands and apply on face. Very quick drying. You need to apply a moisturizer afterwards, just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the other Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid/Vit. C that is a lower percentage and I have to say this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to-- makes your skin glow, look healthy and takes years off! I had not seen my mom in weeks and when I came to visit her, she raved about how my skin glowed and looked healthier than it had in a long time. This coupled with a regular skin care routine has really made me happy with my skin. The best part is that it has more natural ingredients (none of that store bought stuff), does not have any drying agents in the serum and works beautifully for my acne prone, sensitive skin and rosacea. Will be buying again and again!</li>
    <li> So far so good, use it daily and my face looks clearer. My skin more smooth.  I will purchase again. Dark bottle is added plus and lets you know that people making product know Vitamin C is Light sensitive.  All women should consider adding to skin care regime.</li>
    <li> Only been using it three days now and seen great improvements already ,I used it with the derma roller....breaks out have drastically reduced,so I could just imagine how great my skin would look in a month time of continuous use..(trinidad)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 4 days and see a slight difference already./ Checked with my dermatologist about vitamin C serum and he recommended it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using this Vitamin C Serum, I noticed the lines on my forehead is lessening. I will keep using it. It&#x27;s the best serum I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum at Dec, 2013.  At that time, they gained almost all 5 stars reviews and No. 1 sale at it&#x27;s category.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, their price are attractive, I think worth for a try. As I live in HongKong, so need to ask a friend to ship to me.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the serum made my skin very dry  and more sensitive to sunshine. There&#x27;re some brown spots developed on my cheeks after using this for 2 weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d returned them to OZ and got their refunds. But, could not compensate my skin being irritated and the expensive shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 20 years old but my skin is already feeling right and tight</li>
    <li> did nothing for me - used the whole bottle, and noticed nothing. seemed too thin as well for a serum, like it was watered down or something. wont be buying again : (</li>
    <li> I read the good reviews, knew the product INGREDIENTS work so ordered it. I DID MY RESEARCH ABOUT INGREDIENTS BUT NOT BRANDS, UNFORTUNATELY.    The $ is higher than the ad as it is by the ounce the price listed--which was my 1st clue I should have passed. I have used this plus the OZ hyaluronic acid serum and see NOTHING. NO-THING at all. NO CHANGE AT ALL.  WASTED MONEY  Sorry all you great reviewers. You must be hired by the company.  **THE COMPANY CONTACTED ME AFTER 30 DAYS AND SUGGESTED AMAZON REFUND MY MONEY? AMAZON IS GREAT BUT NO REFUNDS AFTER 30 DAYS--AND WHY SHOULD THEY REFUND ME? YOU ARE THE SCAM!</li>
    <li> This serum actually helps my face since my face is clearing up after using this for a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have been using thei OZ Vitamin C serum for a couple of months. The other day I went to the local movie theater with my son had to &amp;#34;prove&amp;#34; I was eligible for  a senior citizens discount. My skin has improved tremendously from using this and their other skin care products.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, love the light texture and what it does to brighten up my skin. I was skeptical before buying and had never used a serum before but after reading about the ingredients and browsing reviews, I took a chance. So glad that I did. If you have combination skin, this one is better, and if you have drier skin, try the hyaluronic acid version with the green label.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Lines and wrinkles diminish quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin C serum I found on Amazon~ :D</li>
    <li> I love this product. With the first use i noticed a difference. Just went back to buy the hyaluronic. Great company and wonderful customer service. I needed advice on a serum and received a helpful email back quickly.</li>
    <li> Love it, I will always use it, I get a great price, Great product and fast shipping. Thanks Guys</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff! Really light and very effective :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 months and when the bottle is empty I will order another.  I really feel it had improved my skin, which is significant at age 63!</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought this was nice, it went on smooth and dried very quickly, however, after using it a while, I have developed a rash from it, which is obviously a problem. I cannot continue to use it, and hope my skin will balance out again quickly.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals vitamin C serum is an amazing product. Once I started using it my skin felt softer and looked more radiant than before. I have tried other brands in the past but did not see any results. I have sensitive skin so needed something that was natural with no harsh chemicals. I feel that this products delivers in it&#x27;s claims and I definitely pls to repurchase.</li>
    <li> good product and on time delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product, noticed improvement in my skin after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;Fine lines diminishing and acne clearing up.</li>
    <li> I actually am using the serum in the green bottle.It has hyaluronic acid. Good for older or more damaged skin. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week, but I honestly can say I see a difference in fine lines I had around my mouth and chin. I&#x27;m 65 years old and have, without exaggeration, tried dozens of skin products. I have a drawer full of things that promised the moon and delivered not-so-much. The deeper creases around my eyes and mouth are considerably less noticeable and seem softer. I think I love this product. Please don&#x27;t be confused by the name, this product has nothing to do with Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum on my face for at least a year.  I cannot imaging &amp;#34;facing&amp;#34; the day without it.  I am 59 and barely have a line in my face anymore.  Not only does this serum make my skin glow, it tightens my pores and makes my skin look so plump and healthy.  I often put if on my face at night, too, before applying Retin-A.  This is one product I simply will not let myself run out of.</li>
    <li> I will never, never stop using this product.  Found it by accident a few months ago.  The best there is!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product recently and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> this product doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sensitive and is very light weight for my oily skin !</li>
    <li> goes on very easy, hope it works......fast shipping....</li>
    <li> Love this face serum!  Use it in the morning under moisturizer.  Has definitely helped evened out my skin tone and has not made me break out which is a major accomplishment!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great stuff. It&#x27;s my second bottle. Put it on in the morning &amp; watch it capture moisture from the air and give you a fresh glow! I&#x27;m 53, if you are younger, this will really wow them..</li>
    <li> Its Made In The USA, 100% Vegan, Cruelty Free, NON-GMO Ingredients, No Alcohol, and No Parables. I have been breaking out I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this product or something else but I worked though it and used it to do this review as truly as I can. The product made my skin feel really dry and I could feel it going into my face. It drys really fast which I liked and I can see I different in my forehead which is the only place that&#x27;s not breaking out or dry as everywhere else. I think my face maybe dry because I didn&#x27;t have moisturizer to use with the product. After the product absorbed into my skin my skin feel smooth. I don&#x27;t believe the product did anything amazing to my face I have tried some that made my face look prefect and break out free this one didn&#x27;t do that. It did help with some fine lines I was having around my temple area. I feel like in may have helped where I had a break out on my neck area which wouldn&#x27;t go away for a year. I am starting to get a few small brown colored spots on my face and people say it helps they but I don&#x27;t see a difference which I only used it for a week.The break outs I had before using the product cleared up but as soon as they cleared up I got twice as much and the only thing I have used is this product.I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to find products that work for me so I&#x27;m glad I tried before I thought about buying it. I got the product to review and give back my honest biased opinion.</li>
    <li> Didnt change anything</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had for a few days, but I think it is going to really make a difference.</li>
    <li> So far this product is great</li>
    <li> its a very light weight serum! ill def like to try their other products</li>
    <li> My skin is tighter and glowing! It lasts because you only need a drop. I will reorder whenever the bottle is nearly empty.</li>
    <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change</li>
    <li> A good vitamin serum is a must to keep your skin glowing. When I go without, my skin looks dull. Those skin cells are not turning over fast enough.  I have tried many over the years and received good results. Skincare keeps advancing at a fast rate and every year we hear about the next big thing. Vitamin C  is a proven ingredient that delivers results and until recently cost a pretty penny to get a high enough level of vitamin c to make a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard good things and positive reviews about Oz Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum so it was a no brainer when I went to buy my next bottle. Oz Naturals 20% Serum uses a clinical strength 20% vitamin C and a vegan hyaluronic acid. It also has vitamin E and ferulic acid. The is the perfect cocktail of ingredients for my skin.  I absolutely love the vitamin E because it gives you the moisture needed to keep your skin soft. Some serums have left my skin dry, this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to see results. My skin is very dry and using the serum everyday has given me the youthful glow we all want. If I get lazy and not use a serum, my skin quickly starts to dull. Using a serum constantly, is the only way I have been able to get rid of the discolorations I am dealing with on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the serum.</li>
    <li> This product when delivered as ordered works extremely well. I am just recognizing that my last order was replaced with a product that does not include vitamin E and ferulic acid and I received two bottles instead of one. I really would love to get the correct order immediately and if necessary I can return the unused bottle of the product which only contains the hyuloronic acid, amino blend and 20% vitamin c. I was really concerned that my experience was not as expected with this bottle when suddenly I double checked the bottle and  realized why. I am adding a photo of what was received.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectation and will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> This product is bunk.  It is not the real thing.  If it is too good to be true, it is too good to be true.  I found the real product (Vitamin C with Ferulic acid) and it $150.00.  That is the difference between the bunk and the chunk!</li>
    <li> I decided to give this product a try but I was doubtful it would do as outstanding as the other reviews let on. I have only been using it for a few weeks and I am stunned by how wonderful this product is.  I was starting to get a few small brown colored spots on my face and now I don&#x27;t even see them. I am serious!. When I noticed that this morning that is why I had to do a review. My skin looks smoother. I have fine lines around my mouth and eyes and they are so subdued. I still see some but they don&#x27;t jump out as before and I am almost 60 so you expect to have some. This product is almost a miracle. I have never been so pleased and satisfied and thankful for a product to do with anti aging as I am with this. I also bought the moisturizer and that is wonderful as well. But I have not used that product every day yet. The C I use every morning and evening. It only takes such a small amount too. This is the best product I have ever used, for real.</li>
    <li> Just started using, so I am not sure of the product yet.</li>
    <li> Love love this product! Love the way it makes my skin look and feel. Will be purchasing the product again and again!</li>
    <li> Made me break out bad</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost a month now with not much difference.  Definitely not wowed for the price, and won&#x27;t repurchase.  This did lighten my skin a tad, but did not lighten the two dark spots on my cheek or the dark swatch on my forehead left from pregnancy, so now they&#x27;re even MORE prominent... Grrrr!</li>
    <li> The serum I got smelled bad. My sister had order another one which I used while I was staying with her and that one seemed great and had a really nice smell to it, thats why I decided to buy it!</li>
    <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Naturals vitamin C serum many times ..I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 month and feel that it does improve the quality of my skin appearance. I use it morning and night. my skin is smooth and bightening .I really love this product !</li>
    <li> LOVE this serum!! It drys quickly and feels great on the skin. Second time buying this and I love it!! I use Vitamin C serum regularly and it has helped my skin stay clear, and after it dries it almost makes your skin feel a little tight, like you really can tell it&#x27;s helping your skin feel younger and nourished. It is amazing and it&#x27;s so affordable, I wish I had discovered sooner. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores looked smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made &amp; Sold by: OZ Naturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order date</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It really plumps the skin up and make it more youthful! I definitely see an improvement in my skin elasticity and texture. I am asked if i have done any procedures or injections to my face (lol! I never have) I use the eye cream and Youth cream all together. I have sensitive skin and all oz naturals products agree with my skin :)</li>
    <li> I tried this product out as a free sample to review, but I am sure glad that I did. I noticed a difference after only one day. I put it on at night and wipe up to a fresher face. It really makes your skin look brighter and lively. Sorely keeping as a fixed component in my routine.</li>
    <li> Upon first use of this product, I felt a nice firmness to my skin, similar to the effect of a toner without skin irritation. After only 10 days of using this serum, areas of discoloration on my skin began to appear less noticeable. I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> This serum has done a beautiful job at reducing the redness that I have on my face as well as just clearing it up. That being said, I do drink healthy, drink plenty of water and moisturize daily.</li>
    <li> I love the Oz Naturals products.  This is a reorder  of the Vitamin C Serum. I am completely  satisfied with  the  product.  The seller was prompt and I  am  pleased with  their service.</li>
    <li> been using it for past two weeks for far haven&#x27;t seen the changes in dark spots. maybe it works slowly, if I see any difference, i will correct my review and stars i gave for this product</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. YOU WILL NOTICE RESULTS IN JUST A FEW DAYS:)</li>
    <li> I am currently using OZ Natural Hyaluronic acid serum + Vitamin C serum (morning) and their Retinol serum (evening).&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, the texture of my skin slightly improved: pores have shrunk and the skin is smoother. Not bad but nothing revolutionary. Really.&lt;br /&gt;So, because I am using a combination of 3 OZ Naturals products, it is a bit hard to give a precise feedback on 1 product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;Each morning, I use first this one, then this the Hyaluronic serum and a day cream. I feel Ok with the discrete results I obtain from these inexpensive products but I must say that it is the first time I am taking care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;To resume my point: cheap price products for not very significant result: Fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else: One think to know: I&#x27;ve been attracted to buy OZ products because they have a great amount of very good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;Because when you buy something from them, they send you emails that encourage you to leave a good comment. When you do, they send you free samples! Nothing to see with the quality of their products that, to me are &amp;#34;so-so&amp;#34;as I already explained. I never played that game because I don&#x27;t find it fair.&lt;br /&gt;To resume: good comments &#x3D; free samples... and what about product real quality??</li>
    <li> All around amazing serum.  I&#x27;ve used product that cost 5x this and didn&#x27;t see the results I get with this. I hope they never change the formula! That&#x27;s my only fear!</li>
    <li> It make my skin very smoothing</li>
    <li> When I first received this product in the mail I was so confused on how to use it and what it would do.  I have used it for the past month at least 3 times a week, with makeup and before makeup, and I can feel the difference when I use it.  Applying it can be a bit difficult because of the fact that it is a serum, so what I would do is just put four drops all over my face (both cheeks, forehead, chin, and neck).  You really have to make sure to do one at a time because it dries up pretty quickly on your face.  What I loved the most about this product is that from the moment you put this on in the morning until the end of the day, you&#x27;re face will still look awake and not tired.  The one thing that I did not like is that my skin was oily at the end of the day.  I know it was not any makeup I used because I even wore it without makeup but because I do have combination skin where sometimes I get really oily and sometimes not, this did happen to me.  I also pick at my face often which is not good at all but whenever I get a pimple, I have to pop it immediately (don&#x27;t we all?), and I usually get scars.  Lately, I have realized that a few of these scar marks on my face have lightened up a little and I am sure it is because of this product.  It is the only thing that I have added to my skincare routine so definitely a THUMBS UP to them.  Overall, I though that this product was awesome!</li>
    <li> Feels like water.  Smells like water.  Tastes like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly am bewildered, because since I&#x27;ve used this,&lt;br /&gt;my wrinkles around my eyes seem to have gotten deeper and bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for several months now.  I was sure it would work well&lt;br /&gt;because of all the rave reviews.  Maybe the OZ company figured out a way&lt;br /&gt;to purchase verified Amazon reviews?&lt;br /&gt;I know you can purchase reviews on fiverr.com.  So who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know what witch hazel tastes like (when I was about 6 years old, I took a big gulp of it,&lt;br /&gt;thinking it was water).  I know what aloe tastes like.  I know what vitamin C tastes like.&lt;br /&gt;All the above tastes bitter or bad.  This tastes like water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, fortunately, I had this old tub of $5 stuff I got from Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I put that on, and the next day, the deep crevasses I got from OZ Naturals serum were gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a generic, Equate brand of Loreal&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Advanced Reviving Advanced Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Eye Day/Night Cream.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;That $5 little Walmart generic tub of cream WORKS.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this for about three three weeks and I can already see results. I use this with the Derma roller and DDF facial wash (what is great too). With these three things combined my skin has been glowing and most importantly my acne scars are fading. Only reason I have not given it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s still early days.</li>
    <li> I received my product on time however the bottle may have leaked in transit as it was only half full. :( thankfully a little does goes a long way and the product does not feel sticky on the skin. I am your typical cleanse , tone , exfoliate , moisturizeddaily type of gal. I am not sure if I should apply after my toner and before my bha exfoliant or after my exfoliant. I always read reviews first and I was drawn to the large amount of positive feedback. I am prone to acne, iI love this prpricy so far but am really hoping its safe for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> Save your money......all these OZ items are too expensive and do nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought tons of this product based on the reviews on Amazon. I even bought some to give as a gift. However, it&#x27;s like water to me. I also bought the other vitamin c serum before (TruNatural) and I thought I would give this a try because of thousand of reviews. I was wrong. After using it for awhile, I don&#x27;t see any different and search for the 1 star review. Some ppl actually tastes the product. I also gave it a try. It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything. I had a little bit of the TruNatural Vitamin C serum left and also gave that a try. Yet, TruNatural gave more stronger taste. So either that OZ Naturals isn&#x27;t as strong or it&#x27;s just like water. I am so disappointed because I didn&#x27;t just bought it for me but for my friends and family as gifts. I should have use this beforehand. I just thought it gives the same effect like TruNatural Vitamin C serum did when I first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I used my bf&#x27;s account to buy this in case you wonder about the name. I am a female. Age: 21.</li>
    <li> This serum has made my face incredibly soft! Completely reversing the results from my demanding jobs! Can&#x27;t wait to try more products from them!</li>
    <li> It is probably my most favourite serum ever! I think it is suitable for all skin types. It is so lightweight and it&#x27;s great even as a make-up primer.</li>
    <li> Ineffective product, and in fact it made my skin look very dry.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this Serum.  Tried others, but will be going back to this.  I love the thickness....easy to spread over your face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not great but not horrible either. I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin at all &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for a while.  It does provide some hydration &amp; moisture &amp; doesn&#x27;t make me breakout - so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used vitamin C serums for years ranging from $20 to $120. I know you typically get what you pay for but you might as well splash a drop of water on your face. It&#x27;s runny, has zero smell and typically you can smell the vitamin C in your serum. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Allure Magazine says this is the best in beauty and I kinda have to agree! I have been using a lot of products lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum is a wonderful serum that I feel likes my skin feeling smoother and more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say this VITAMIN C SERUM is guaranteed to leave my skin radiant and more youthful looking by neutralizing free radicals &amp; is proven to stimulate collagen &amp; reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  I can literally say that I think it does all that and then some. I have been using it all over my face but especially my eyes and forehead which have become more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy putting it on. It is like the perfect butter for my bread. It looks like it would be a greasy oil because of the container. That is literally what I expected. It is not that at all. It is not oily!  I just drop a drop onto my finger and apply to my face. I section my face into four different areas and use 4 drops every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C is the main ingredient which has been proven to decrease sun damage while minimizing scars, fine lines and wrinkles. More importantly it stimulates collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid hydrates and smooths your skin. I was worried to try it at first. Hyaluronic acid. The word acid makes me think it would be harsh or burn my skin. I used a very small amount on my cheek at first. No problem there so I continued by applying it to one side of my face. It has never burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amino Blend promotes skin circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Jojoba Oil is oddly enough not oily. It is a a liquid wax that resembles human sebum (the oil that keeps your skin and hair smooth and supple) and is proven to smooth your skin&#x27;s texture. I love it and will look for it from now on in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can literally see a difference in my fine lines. I am going to start concentrating around my upper lip where I have noticed a lot of fine lines over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It  does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by it and will be ordering again when this one is gone.again when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great serum. It goes on easily, and is very light, it absorbs into your skin almost instantly! It&#x27;s not at all greasy so you can wear it under your makeup with no problem. Read my full review here http://bit.ly/1GBppEM</li>
    <li> Its been a week since i have been using this. My husband and i can visibly see the difference in my skin. I was scared of using this product as i have a very sensitive, oily and acne prone skin. My skin is showing positive results and I am happy so far :)</li>
    <li> Like the feel and I may notice a little change but at my age (over 70) any change is welcome..price is good.</li>
    <li> I use this as a substitute for a similar Obagi product that is significantly more expensive. Also, the trick with all these bottles that come with a dropper is to not use it - your product will last much longer.</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum is an all natural product which I like.  After ordering I received a email with information and directions how to use product.  It also has 20% vitamin C in serum.  Since I am over 50 this is a great anti-aging product.  I have oily skin and this is not greasy at all.  My skin looks more smooth.  The serum is very light and thin mixture.  I apply toner first, then put a small amount on my neck and face then moisturizer when it dries.  Vit C also helps with Free Radical damage to make my skin look better. I did receive this product to do a review and give my honest unbiased opinion. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Better product then the Obagi C. No joke. I tried it after reading all the reviews and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> great stuff. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. Even with using a good moisturizer after applying the serum it dried my skin out so much it was flaking. Not impressed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this product exactly does to my skin, but it just generally looks better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product also based on the reviews. After the first day my skin looked like I broke out in freckles. It has been two weeks and have seen no improvement. Will not buy this product again. Will  go back to another C serum I used previously.</li>
    <li> Great product and will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD UNDER MOISTURIER IN THE MORNING</li>
    <li> Not sure I would reorder - from what I can research it doesn&#x27;t have pure ascorbic acid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference very quickly, my skin seems to be a little smoother.</li>
    <li> I wait to finish the bottle to write a review. It&#x27;s almost empty now. It&#x27;s a cute small bottle but I have been using it for 3 months. The price is not too bad for this small bottle. I applied 2-3 drops on my face each morning and evening. I feel fresh and it&#x27;s easy to absorb. I really like the feeling that makes my skin soft and moisturized. I have no winkle at mid 20 so anti aging has no result. I have a little scar (not obvious) due to pimples but I dont see any result after using it. I will buy another bottle and will see if there are any result.</li>
    <li> Started off using this  product. Others talked about the &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; or a fresher looking face, well, that is true. I get complements....seems like every week.  Now  that I just was diagnosed with Cancer, I will continue to use this product.  If just my face looks good while I battle this Tumor, it will be money well spent.  I Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen a product with this many positive reviews. And yet, I can&#x27;t understand the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have put water on my face and gotten better results. Used the entire bottle as directed with absolute ZERO results. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It comes in a nice, very handy glass bottle with a dropper. The serum itself gets absorbed incredibly fast and without a trace. My regular moisturizer put on top of this serum acts as if I put it on an absolutely clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it for long, but it seems to me that my skin got a bit brighter and smooth. This serum also does a good job fighting first wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a good product for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I used to spend over $100 for a vitamin C serum so I am very skeptical about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried many expensive skin care products including La Mer.  I see no difference for my skin using expensive skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle and brings no harm for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am in late 40 and I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles on my face.&lt;br /&gt;So I normally cannot tell the big difference of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;But it is very gentle and I feel my skin is brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy the second bottle.</li>
    <li> awesome serum...I definitely notice a difference...my face absorbs moisturizer better and my skin looks more hydrated.</li>
    <li> No improvement in skin</li>
    <li> I love this product it works unlike many expensive products in expensive department stores.</li>
    <li> Love it, my brown spots are gone!</li>
    <li> Made absolutely no change and I have good skin to begin with.  Very disappointed and will not order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Stone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C additions to face products, and I&#x27;ve always had a great result with them. I&#x27;m particularly fond of the OZ naturals line, because it is so much more cost effective than other lines (think Philosophy), does the same thing, and keeps money in my pocket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive a lot of skin care products for review. There are few I can recommend as wholeheartedly as the OZ line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin (which isn&#x27;t sensitive) is brighter and more glowy. Looks as good as the Philosophy anti-aging Vitamin C, for a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased of this serum, and it&#x27;s pretty rare for me to repurchase a beauty product, as I am a TOTAL product junkie and love trying new things. This serum is wonderful, my face feels so soft and is absolutely glowing.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am 67, have been in the sun all my life and this stuff is pure magic!  My face hardly has any lines...just a tiny few near my eyes, but nowhere else thanks to this amazing product!  I love this stuff....my complexion is so smooth I have had people think I am in my early 50s and lived protecting my face all my life...Heck...I never protected my face and should have...but this product is working miracles on a face that should be so sun damaged I should look like a prune!</li>
    <li> I have an oily/combination skin and use Paula&#x27;s choice RESIST line of products. My skin is in top condition, and free of any and all blemishes. I saw the amazing reviews for this product by many and decided to add it to my skin care routine. I started using both Vitamin C serum http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DPE9EQO/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and Hyaluronic acid http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7DYBX0/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 and my skin started breaking out severely. I used both serums together, one after another as suggested by several reviews here, one in the morning and one in the night etc., but skin would break out severely within a night. If I stopped the serum, my skin would return to normalcy. I really wanted to like the serums but one of them is causing severe breakouts to my skin. I am not sure which serum is causing the problem, but those with acne-prone skin, better be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several reviewers said this product does not clog pores and is safe on oily skin but in any case, I simply cannot use these serums.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle!  I am pregnant and can not use retinol at the moment.  My doctor approved of this product after taking it to her at one of my appointments.  My skin is softer, dewier, and I notice more a more even tone all over.  Here is the plus:  My wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a miracle product as it does not contain retinol; however, this product has exceeded my expectations in results.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!  Arrived one day early!</li>
    <li> Great product change the texture of my skin, my skin look more glowing moist and healthy.</li>
    <li> great product works over a period of time</li>
    <li> I use this along with hyaluronic acid and it works great together.. Smoother healthier liking skin in only a few weeks</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> It was not so good for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I can&#x27;t resist trying new skincare. The ingredients alone had me excited, because I have sensitive acne-prone skin. It&#x27;s hard to find a quality serum that contains calming properties, such as witch hazel. For reference, I use the Missha Green Tea Latte Cleanser, followed by Lush&#x27;s Tea Tree Toner spray. After those, I patted on a few drops of the Vitamin C serum until it was completely absorbed (which was surprisingly instantaneous). I follow up with Aveeno Clear Skin moisturizer. So far, I have noticed my skin is amazingly soft and smooth. It did nothing for my acne scars, but I&#x27;m not expecting it to with just one use. My skin has felt...calm? For lack of better words. Just very soft and normal, which is hard to come by with my skin. So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this product. I see this bottle lasting me a couple of months. I&#x27;ll also incorporate the serum into my skincare, just to get a full and complete opinion.</li>
    <li> used, but do not see any difference in skin.....</li>
    <li> If I use it two days in a row my face has a fine rash.</li>
    <li> Love this&lt;br /&gt;Stuff !! Use before you moisturize a little goes a long way love this !! Will be using with my derma roller tonight</li>
    <li> still trying it...not to bad but nothing spectaculat.</li>
    <li> I was given two Oz Naturals products to review, THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face and THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin. Both are do not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using both serums on December 14. Before using these serums my face was dry and flaky. My skin had a dull look to it. After using the products for two weeks my skin started to flake more around the nose and break out more on my chin and forehead. I messaged the company asking if this was normal and they were kind enough to explain the reaction and that it was the normal process of my skin detoxing from the chemicals I used on my skin before and that after 30 days things should clear up. I did notice my skin clear up and look brighter, the skin around my nose is still flaking though and I was hoping that would stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are easy to use, just use a small drop on your fingers and gently smooth into the face. The Hyaluronic acid serum is clear and is a thicker serum. The Vitamin C serum is clear and is more runnier. Neither really have any scent to them, at least not any that I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you trying this product out. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it might or might not work for you. You never know until you try.</li>
    <li> great product! doesn&#x27;t smell, works as advertised, I am very pleased with the quality! Skin feels amazing and appears looking younger. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Very drying to skin. Not best product to use in the winte</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have only been using it two weeks and I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin texture and tone. I do put on my regular moisturizer first, because it can be drying. I use it morning and night, and I&#x27;m able to put my makeup on over it with no problem. It&#x27;s on my &amp;#34;Hit List&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Serum applies well.  Put on droplets to the forehead, cheeks and neck area.  Applies smoothly.  Cover with moisturizer if your face gets too dry.</li>
    <li> i was just started using. i kept in my purse. it spilled all over in my purse. that rubber thing on top doesn&#x27;t close well one you open it.</li>
    <li> bought it for girlfriend, she loves this!</li>
    <li> I love this--works great.</li>
    <li> been using routinely for over a month. have not noticed a change in my dark spots</li>
    <li> This product is an absolute joke. Do not buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, this is my second time trying to post a review like this. My first one was flagged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To consumers: Please understand how much effort this company has put into creating false reviews and hype. Once you spend a little time reading them (something I wish I had done before purchasing and returning) and comparing the quantity of reviews to similar products from more established brands, their effort to mislead us is pretty transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO AMAZON: This type of behavior from sellers should absolutely be prohibited and monitored better. Consumers have enough to study and compare to make smart purchases. We shouldn&#x27;t have to wade through this type of overtly disingenuous marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those of you reading this who are looking for a quality vitamin C serum, I will say that I&#x27;ve purchased multiple bottles of the Ole Henriksen Truth Serum from Sephora. It&#x27;s an OK serum in general, but it&#x27;s only masquerading as a true vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s not harmful by any means, but it&#x27;s not really helpful either. After I realized I had been wasting money, I actually looking for a more affordable and effective replacement when I purchased this product. After receiving this low quality item and doing a little more research, I realized that my search wasn&#x27;t over. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research since about vitamin C serums and the best one I&#x27;ve found is from a Korean company called OST. It&#x27;s very strong, so while it has lightened my scars and improved overall healing, it has adverse effects too. If used too frequently it will irritate and dry your skin out. I still haven&#x27;t found the right balance, so I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase. I&#x27;m only recommending it because it&#x27;s been the best out of everything I&#x27;ve tried. The search continues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now, and I see no visible difference at all. I seriously believe I may have received a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; like some of the other reviewers had mentioned. I too have used other Vitamin C serums, but this one has no trace of any ingredients at all. It seems like I&#x27;m just putting water on my face. I&#x27;m all about natural products, but this just seems a little too watery for me. If the first ingredient is an herbal fusion, as listed on the bottle, I would have to think there would be at least a little smell right?? I&#x27;m not convinced that I got what I paid for. May have to return my unused portion.</li>
    <li> I love this Product! Have gone thru Three bottles &amp; I like what it does to the skin on my face!  Need to re-Order soon!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen results yet</li>
    <li> after about one month, I can see a difference with less visible lines around my mouth and neck area!</li>
    <li> I like the scrum, but the bottle and stopper, are hard to use. Cheap bottle.</li>
    <li> So far is good. Four days of using it.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try an affordable Vitamin C serum.  What a difference it makes in just a few short weeks!  Face and neck are smoother with a tighter texture.  Have reordered already once.  Am hooked!</li>
    <li> My wife has used the Vitamin C Serum on her face and it has greatly reduced the wrinkles and makes her look younger.  She loves it and wants some more!  This product has made my wife happy and more is on order.  I could not be happier with the Oz Natural Products.</li>
    <li> This serum really delivers. It definately lightens pigmentation from sun exposure. Evens out skin tone and skin looks plumped up and youthful. I used it at night and during the day with no irritation. Great product and you will definitely see results soon.</li>
    <li> This serum seems to be lightening my dark spots. It took under a month to start noticing. I follow it with the youth revitalizing moisturizer. Love the natural products that go into making these beauty treatments. Leaves my skin soft and even.</li>
    <li> I love this! making my face nice &amp; glowy!</li>
    <li> it has very good review. But I don&#x27;t really think it works on me. My skin does not really improve that much.</li>
    <li> Liked the hylauronic serum but this bottle had no label on it and did not do anything. Back to my Dr. Gross vitamin c. It&#x27;s expensive but works.</li>
    <li> My skin seems to love this stuff.  It just soaks right in.  I use it in combination with the derma roller.  The serum has a nice little tightening effect, and the derma roller increases absorption by 1000 x (they say).  I&#x27;ll likely buy more soon as we are back to normal after Christmas expenses.</li>
    <li> Impressive Little Bottle! Since adding this serum to my skin care routine, my skin seems brighter and smoother. My skin tends to be on the sensitive side and I had no problems. I really like the thinner consistency as well, it just works perfectly with my toner and moisturizer. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to receive this product for review!!</li>
    <li> Works well on my face.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this by accident.. thought I was buying CE Ferulic..&lt;br /&gt;Did not want to return it so I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this.. not oily.. absorbs well..&lt;br /&gt;I do like this ..I just really  like this my &amp;#34;other Fav&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I thought it was just me. The new formula doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I even use it on my hands. Love it.</li>
    <li> does not improve your skin nor wrinkle condition at all.</li>
    <li> No change after months of use!!!! Feels like water!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because I have only had it for a week, but I love that my wrinlkles already seem to have a smoother look  and not so deep. I am expecting it to do even better as time goes on. I put it on my face and then put a night cream over it. The price id good also.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have sensitive acne prone skin and I was nervous to use this at first, I have heard many great things about how it improves texture and brightens your face so I decided to give it shot... I absolutely love it! It has improved the appearance of my skin and has not caused any irritation or breakouts. Great price too!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing magical product , I used this for 2 weeks and it really help in reducing the sun pigmentation on my face and smooth the skin.</li>
    <li> This is clearly the best vitamin C serum an the market. What I like BEST is that it does not go off in 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Great product ..., it seems to give my skin a glow</li>
    <li> The serum made my skin oily and dark. My skin started to break out after 2 uses. Hence returning the product.</li>
    <li> not impressed at all..&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again, there are too many others out there that actually work.. this one unfortunately does nothing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks.  I do not see any improvements on my skin except that it made my skin more oily than before.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> this gets used up way too fast. already halfway in the bottle. i think it&#x27;s working..not sure. at least its not making it worse or breaking out..</li>
    <li> Works great especially when combined with retinal A cream</li>
    <li> I LOVE Vitamin C. I LOVE Hyaluronic acid. Why not combine them with Amino acids?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells so raw and amazing. I already love OZ Naturals products, so I was more than happy to get to try this one! I LOVE serums because when I apply them before my moisturizer, my moisturizer works so much better than it does by itself! This serum was even better than I expected. I noticed that my skin felt a bit more firm, and the fine lines were just a teeny bit less apparent after using this for only a week. At this point, you&#x27;ll have to pry it out of my fingers to get my to stop using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also super excited that this product is all-organic AND cruelty-free, and it offers a money-back guarantee! If you don&#x27;t like it, just contact OZ Naturals, and they WILL take care of you! This is a company that cares about it&#x27;s products, customers, and the environment. Don&#x27;t believe me? See for yourself!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this new ingredient. It makes my skin really sticky and hard to apply make ups. I prefer previous versions.</li>
    <li> Skin type: sensitive with slight rosacea&lt;br /&gt;age: 57&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum comes in a small clear bottle with a dropper style application. The serum is fine for daily use and though targeted for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin, it&#x27;s for any type of skin. No parabens or alcohol; doesn&#x27;t clog pores. A thinner serum than some and absorbs very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do so love this serum - I&#x27;ve used another OZ Natural product and was just as satisfied as I am with this serum. I put a few drops onto my fingertips and work the product into my skin. I suggest that you apply it to your face in sections, because it does absorb very very quickly into your skin. So, for example, I will apply to my forehead and cheekbones, and then add a few more drops to massage into the rest of my face. With what&#x27;s left on my fingertips, I massage into my neck--sometimes I add a little water before massaging into my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is that my skin feels and looks amazing. There is no stinging or redness - something I have to be careful of with a product because of my rosacea. However, I also have weird skin that still breaks out even at my age, so some products are just too oily for me - not so with this Oz serum. I often use it morning and night, but mostly at night. It&#x27;s fine for under make up, or to use alone, but I prefer to add a moisturizer over it, for it does sink so well into the skin that it does beg for a bit more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be looking for more Oz Natural products, for they suit my skin type, and leave my skin looking amazing without any irritation or breakouts.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my face!</li>
    <li> If this product is to make my skin look smooth again, it is working</li>
    <li> After 30 days, don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this serum makes my skin so smooth and soft I had got alot of compliments about my skin I&#x27;m only 32 I always had beautiful skin but I just love the way this makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Not worth the hype. I&#x27;ve used this consistently and I don&#x27;t see the results everyone is raving about.&lt;br /&gt;I expected a brighter complexion due to the Vitamin C, but I&#x27;ve received better with Murad products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beauty fanatic and have weekly/monthly spa visits. Will not buy this again...</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin looking dewey and soft, even after applying makeup on top.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!! I was expecting somthing that felt a bit oily on my skin, but this is wonderful and not oily.  It feels very refreshing and hydrating, my skin just soaks it up.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  fades acne scars, evens skin tone over time.  gentle for sensitive skin.  use only once a day.  i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My dark spots have been fading and my skin is generally brighter. i can&#x27;t wait to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I never felt the effect of this product after using it for a month.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My skin is soft and more even toned!</li>
    <li> I was asked to try this product and write a review.  I can see some difference since starting it about three weeks ago.  My skin is more firm and my red spots seem to have lightened up a bit.  I think after using it for a while longer I will see more changes.  I cannot give it a 5-star because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, but was asked to put my review up now, so I can only work with a 4 star for this.</li>
    <li> My skins absorbs the oil so fast, I definitely feel like its feeding my skin. I like to put it on after toner and before face lotion.</li>
    <li> So far really happy with this purchase. The dark spots on my face seem to be fading after a week of using the serum. I hope after a month I get to see the full benefits of it!!</li>
    <li> I love all four Oz Natural products that I am using.  I first started with the Vit C and HA Serums after doing extensive research on &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products.  I had been using expensive anti aging products for 20+ years and all of sudden I didn&#x27;t want all the extra ingredients they put into the products going on my face.&lt;br /&gt;So I found the Oz Naturals web page read about their products and the rest is history ( I hadn&#x27;t a clue they were on Amazon).  Back then they were only offering a few products.  So happy they are expanding, quickly, to other products.  This is a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my other reviews as I go into more detail on the level of satisfaction per product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good Vit C serum and it delivers on what it&#x27;s designed to do:  it keeps my skin bright, toned and I like the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Since changing from the other products to the OZ Naturals.... YES there is a difference in my skin.  I am happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review is helpful.</li>
    <li> Works great. Gives healthy glow. Just bought again.</li>
    <li> Works a wonder Ima male 18 years old don&#x27;t have no real problems but I can defiantly see my skin becoming a lot more smoother I used to put on a little cocoa butter on my face before I went to bed but It cloged up my pores then I went to coconut oil but I&#x27;ll make my face too oily in the morning so finally I went to this and no more cloged pores and no oily residue afterwards defiantly glad I know about this and after a week or so you&#x27;ll see and feel the difference.</li>
    <li> Great results! I love it!</li>
    <li> great product- can really see a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 2 weeks and I love it!!! As a young teenager I thought tanning beds and lying in the sun was a great idea. But I was very wrong. I now have sun damage on my cheeks and forehead. This serum has lighten my sun damage and has made my face brighter. I have tried tons of expensive creams and serums and nothing has worked like this. I will definitely be keeping this product in my cabinet forever. I was given this product of review but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am now on my second bottle of the Vitamin C Serum and I am seeing more results.  Dark spots continue to lighten and red areas shrink.  I sometimes use only sunscreen during the day skipping foundation altogether.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product! It smelled great and the dropper made it easy to apply. It was a tiny bit funnier than most of the serums I use, but it was easy to spread accross my face. This product is also 72% organic. I haven&#x27;t found too many at a reasonable price that are so this product won me over. I did receive a discount for a review,but I will be getting this again! After three days of use I can already tell a positive difference in the red areas around my cheeks.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  It helps smooth the skin, gives clarity and I love it!</li>
    <li> Terrible product. First application burned my face like acid. Useless.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product at all, I use the serum for two days and it break me out. It doesn&#x27;t  feel like a serum at all more like water base.</li>
    <li> The results are not extreme but I do see some improvements in my skin tone. Good for people who have sun damage.</li>
    <li> Only had a few weeks but it seems to be doing what is promised.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and Oz Naturals vitamin C serum didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it is 72% organic because I don&#x27;t need or want a bunch of chemicals on my skin. I use this product on my face, neck, and back. I use this serum to brighten up my skin and to help with acne. After using this serum my skin appears brighter and it does seem to be helping with my acne. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this serum when applying it to your skin. It absorbs easy and fast into your skin. Also it leaves my skin so soft like my skin is a fluffy cloud. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily or greasy. It has a very light scent in the bottle and when I apply it to my skin I can&#x27;t smell it. Overall I really love this vitamin C serum because it works and leaves my skin very soft. I was able to get this serum for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> For the first few weeks I used this (w/ the moisturizer), it was GREAT!  But then, my chin started breaking out like a 16 y/o.  It was HORRIBLE!  I haven&#x27;t had acne since I was a 16 y/o (I&#x27;m now 38).  Once I stopped using the product, my skin cleared up.  Bummer, b/c it did improve my complexion, but it&#x27;s not worth it when your chin has zits all over it.</li>
    <li> I also use this with elite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product about a week. I&#x27;m 60+. Have been having issues with really dry chin area,this seems to be helping to correct that issue. It also seems to be plumping up grooved lines at corners of mouth and upper lip. I like it&#x27;s absorbency and it does well along with moisturizer. Will continue using, am anxious to see what next changes may be.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve always been told I look younger than my actual age, but as of late, I&#x27;ve noticed father time creeping up on me. I have been using this a little more than a month now. And truthfully, I kinda wish I&#x27;d taken some before pictures. It&#x27;s taken a good 4, 5 years off. I tried it with a dermaroller, and after that tragedy, I decided to just apply the serum after a really good exfoliation. So, here goes: I wash my face with a loofah and some exfoliating wash then, I apply the serum mixed in with extra virgin olive oil (it tends NOT to break you out). I use a cotton swab for the application. I read something about how olive oil is easily absorbed into the skin, and with the serum causing a drying, tightening feeling, I needed the additional moisture. The two work well together. My skin looks more luminous, some dark marks faded, and the (beginning) dark circles under the eyes went away. It didn&#x27;t clear up I noticed the super old scars, but the more recent ones definitely faded. And using this every other day, 5-8 drops at a time, I&#x27;ve gone through about half the bottle, if that gives you an idea.</li>
    <li> This one is really work on my face, so I bought more for my sister and mom. They says it&#x27;s good too!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant of purchasing this serum after reading the negative reviews.  I have been using it for about a month now.  I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference in my skin yet, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the serum.  I like applying it after I use my derma roller.  Hopefully after continued use I will see more of a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this product it helped alot on my break out and reduced my acne scars</li>
    <li> It is ok, Doesn&#x27;t leave a oily feeling on face or anything</li>
    <li> I just tried the Oz Naturals Eye Gel with great success and simultaneously used the Vitamin C Serum for the rest of my face. The results: younger, healthier looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I see the word serum, I always think of something thick and goopy! This looks like water but the consistency is much thicker; not as thick as a gel but thick enough. It comes with a dropper that you just put on your fingertips and rub on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is actually perfect; not too thick and not too thin. It&#x27;s easy to evenly distribute on the face and absorbs pretty quickly without any residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference probably about a week after using it. My face just looked fresher, younger and not at all oily or shiny. I used to use traditional lotion type moisturizers for my face but I&#x27;ve found I really prefer just using the serum. My face looks better than it has in years so I don&#x27;t feel like I even need to use moisturizer in addition to the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum has given me healthier skin in a matter of weeks and has now replaced my previous product as my skincare of choice.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results at all from this product.</li>
    <li> This is very good on my skin  it does not dry sticky and it really works and it is affordable so I am able to buy it. I will reorder this.</li>
    <li> Bottle needs improvement!&lt;br /&gt;Probably black rubber will ruin the quality of the serum when they come in contact.</li>
    <li> I like the feel on the serum but I have only used it for do 2 weeks and I do see a difference but I use a lot of different creams on my face so I&#x27;m a guinea pig and I&#x27;m trying different solvents. Pure vitamin C is a good start I also add vitamin e and retinol. I need to use for a few more weeks to see results, but I &#x27;m happy with the Vitamin C and probably would purchase another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for just a couple of days and I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks OZ Naturals for the quick shipment and for helping improve my skin.</li>
    <li> First of all...I won&#x27;t even start with how unprofessional the company was? If you want more info and You are a Real person and not a fake one you can email me. This Vitamin C Serum is the worst I have ever tired hands down!! It made me break out all over my face, I&#x27;m sorry to say these are not good ingredients. Please Do Not order if you do you will throw your money in the trash!! If you want to purchase the right Vitamin C Serum it&#x27;s called Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum for Face 20% - With Vegan Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin E...this one is Pure quality!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review  product when i just started using it and cannot see any results - this takes time.  I did receive this product on time and with no problems.  I sure hope it helps my skin but then i am 61 years old and am realistic in realizing that it&#x27;s hard to reverse the aging process.  Slowing down this process is the best i can hope for.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely wonderful. Skin condition improved in three uses.</li>
    <li> Skin looks great even after quite a short time of using it...</li>
    <li> I use this product along side with vitamin C serum, I can&#x27;t live without it! Will be ordering more, thank you. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no staining on my face or pillow slip. Brighter complexion</li>
    <li> I have a sensitivity to this product, it makes my face very, very dry. I am now trying to use as little as possible, as I have read that is the key for some people. I&#x27;ve also read it&#x27;s essential to use an extra amount of a moisturizer when using this. I don&#x27;t want to give up on this product, as I know it&#x27;s a &#x27;key&#x27; element in an anti aging, daily skin care ritual.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum - like a mini facelift in a bottle! It&#x27;s fantastic, can be used during the day and night, but if used during the day, be sure to use a good sunscreen - SPF 30 at minimum. Consistent use of this serum has made my skin soft, supple, radiant and glowing. I&#x27;m 31 years old, but people always say that I look 26! The serum has also helped to even out and lighten my skin tone. I&#x27;m very happy and will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and am very pleased with the results.  I am in my 60&#x27;s and didn t think anything could  make a difference in my complexion, but this product does seem to help with brightening up the appearance of my skin.  I will be buying more when this runs out and I have told a friend about it.</li>
    <li> Great product works better than I expected to, will definately recommend this product, previous reviews were very helpful to me</li>
    <li> My skin is so pale and dull, I do not have acne or any skin problems, but rather just dull skin. Therefore I do not need foundation but I cannot leave my house without bronzer because naturally my skin has no life to if. I found this Vitamin C serum online and decided to try it because I have tried so many products so why not another. HONESTLY THE BEST THING. I can go without makeup because it makes my skin look HEALTHY AND GLOWING. I look so awake! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it and already notice improvement in my skin and significant moisture retention-great!</li>
    <li> Bought this item because I loved their super youth moisturizer. I really dislike this item because it seems that you are using water. I have been using another vitamin c serum sold here at amazon and loved it.. But I figured to try this less expensive one.. Mistake! Wish I could return !</li>
    <li> So far, I like the Vit c.  I use it on my legs first then moisturize.  I am hoping it helps my knees because the skin around my knees has wrinkles.  I think this happened over night because I didn&#x27;t see that coming.  I work out at the gym and run.  I&#x27;m 48 soon to turn 49.  I have been told that there is nothing that can be done to fix this issue.  I&#x27;m hoping I can prove them wrong.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin but after using this my face feel soft and fresh I like it</li>
    <li> This is a great serum to use on your skin after your shower in the morning. It is really effective on your skin to lose the beginning of aging or to protect against the ravages of pollution on your skin.</li>
    <li> Feeling of tight skin when dried on face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and have never looked my age until recently. I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines or wrinkles but my neck and jowls have begun to sag and it is to the point that I actually told my husband last week that I was going to look into a lifestyle lift. I saw this product and read the reviews and thought I would give it a chance first. I started using this product in combination with retin a 5 days ago. Today I looked in the mirror and saw immediately that my sagging neck was a lot less noticeable. I thought it was probably the lighting but nope. There is already a smoothness to my skin that was not there last week. I&#x27;m extremely hopeful and can&#x27;t wait to see the 30 day results!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It makes my face glow. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and I notice the biggest difference , my under eye bags are lighter, and the lines under my eyes are less noticeable like the skin is tighter.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Vitamin C serum and I LOVE it. I can tell that my skin is brighter and more even after using it. I actually bought this product on a whim based on the significant number of high reviews and am glad I did. I&#x27;m not a high maintenance skin care person, but think this is definitely worth including in my (and your) routine!</li>
    <li> Not sure if its working but it could be a combination of this and other products I use that have improved the appearance and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any results yet! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.-</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that I am disappointed.  I have used half of the bottle following the directions perfectly wanting the best result possible.  Just being truthful.</li>
    <li> I received these items with high expectations.  I have been using the,m for approximately three weeks now and I wish I could say they have changed my life, but ...I can honestly say that these three products:  OZ Naturals - THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin - Clinical Strength,  OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum- Clinical Strength 20% Vitamin C with Vegan Hyaluronic Acid and this product have produced minor results in my facial appearance.  I have used Olay products for years and see no difference between these three items and the Olay regenerist products I use normally.  I wanted to be able to give this a 5 star review, but in all honesty I cannot. I just feel it is not any better or worse than what is already on the market. I was hoping that at least one of these items might help to reduce the dark circles and puffiness around the eyes, but they do not do either.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this.  So far I have not noticed anything dramatic.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about two weeks once, sometimes twice a day. I am not sure I see a significant difference in my skin but I am only 28 and using this for more preventative treatment so I am hoping it will help in the long run!</li>
    <li> Until a representative with OZ Naturals contacted me requesting I review their anti-aging face products, I was a faithful consumer of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine and Immortelle facial products.  In fact, I was completely addicted to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine Oil, which has similar ingredients as OZ Naturals&#x27; hyaluronic acid serum.  I love the way the Divine Oil makes my skin feel soft, supple, and youthful.  What I don&#x27;t love?  L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s $120 priced tag for its small bottle of Divine Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum also leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, supple but at a fraction of the price. I applied the Hyaluronic acid serum to my face after washing it before bedtime. The next morning, my face looks less wrinkled and has that slightly flushed glow reminiscent of sometime in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I prefer the scent of L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Divine Oil over the scent of OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it&#x27;s not worth paying the exorbitant price difference.  I also like L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s pretty bottle more than the OZ Natural&#x27;s plain bottle because it looks nice on my make up stand, however, again it&#x27;s not worth the price.  OZ Naturals is a bargain Antiaging product that actually works!</li>
    <li> Ok, this product is not going to give you a face-lift, but it definitely makes a very positive improvement.  I love smoothing it onto my face and neck in the morning and watching my skin instantly look smoother and healthier.  I&#x27;ve always moisturized and taken good care of my skin since I was a teenager, but at age 58 I have puffiness around the eyes, some well-established lines and an annoying loss of firmness along the jawline.  This product doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but the improvement is very noticeable.  I inadvertently allowed my last bottle to run out, and I&#x27;m rushing to replace it!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My skin has been looking very nice. I use it with my moisturizer. Your skin will feel dry when you first put it on so you must use the moisturizer. I have gotten compliments on my skin. I researched it and it had been given high reviews.</li>
    <li> Great for laugh lines around the lips and on my neck.  I do find I neglect the area below my chin line but when my face area, especially around me eyes, improved with the use of other Oz Naturals products that my neck area did  not look as nive.  I have used this for 2 weeks and add Moisturizer and my skin looks healthier, more toned.  I will continue to use this and remark on how things look in a few more weeks. I also like these products because they are cruelty free.  That is a huge added bonus for me.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and leaves shining on the face.</li>
    <li> Seems to really work.  I use it on my forearms for sun damaged skin.  They are looking surprisingly better with minimal treatment.  FB</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this...like any other skin care product. This is recommended after a cleanser and toner and followed by a moisturizer. It goes on the face, neck, shoulders and upper back and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the clarity of my skin. I pair it with the aveeno skincare line and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> have been using for a month and found that my skin has become soft and tender, just look younger. I would like to recommend this product to women over 40.</li>
    <li> I will be the first to say, I don’t know a lot about this types of products and I am not any kind of skin care expert by any means but these are my observations with using this after a few days use.  Granted this is for your face, but I initially tried this out on the top of one of my hands to see if there was any visible difference of the skin between both hands as I figured that was a good way to see if there was any difference or a placebo effect.  The serum I put on my hand absorbed quickly and without any greasy residue.  I have very sensitive skin but this did not irritate or burn my skin.  Surprising to me after I applied it, I could immediately tell the difference between my hands.  The one I applied the serum on felt softer and looked smoother with less wrinkles than the hand I didn’t apply this on.  So after these initial encouraging results of my unscientific test, I have been using on areas of my face and neck.  I cannot say at this point that this is any kind of miracle product but it does seem to work.  I will update my review after some long term use and will reserve final judgment of the product after I have used for a greater period of time.  For now though I am rating it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used many Vit. C+E products.  This one seems to work better than most.&lt;br /&gt;It also saves $$ because it has the Hyaluronic added.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love OZ Naturals Vitamin C. It makes my face feel so good. I received it very quickly and the customer service is great. I received an email with instructions how to apply it.  I know you will love it too.</li>
    <li> i m down to half bottle now, don&#x27;t see any result yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered my product from OZ naturals. I have used Vitamin C for a while and love the results on my skin. The product from OZ Naturals stacks up well against the competition. I am very happy with the product. But, I am even happier with the personalized customer service. Their service is OUTSTANDING. I received the item quickly and received immediate follow-up and a personal email exchange. I will DEFINITELY order from OZ Naturals again.</li>
    <li> Amazing serum feels very comfortable on skin and very good price for it!!vit C very good for the skin the best!</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all and can already see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a week but I have not noticed any changes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new formula at all. The first time I put it on it felt thicker and had put too much because I was expecting it to have a water consistency like before. It took a lot longer to absorb into my skin and then felt like I had a mask on. When it finally dried my skin started to feel tight and so dry that white dry patches started to appear and that&#x27;s never happened to my skin before. I had to keep applying blue lotion I bought from the Oz collection as well to make the white dry patches go away and for my skin to not feel dry anymore. I don&#x27;t like what you did to the serum and the vitamin c cleanser either I might add. They are not the same and I start to get acne here or there with the cleanser. Don&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken....</li>
    <li> I havent seen any improvements on my skin but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 months now. I have sensitive skin so I only use it at night.  My skin is smoother, I have less fines lines, and people that I&#x27;ve just met, tend to think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am. (I&#x27;m 39 years old). I have some discoloration on my forehead, I hope with continued use this serum will fade and even out my skin tone. If it does I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars instead of 4!</li>
    <li> I use this serum twice daily. Definitely an improvement in my skins tone and texture since using. Almost done with firth bottle and Intend on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom because of all the 5 star reviews and really hoped this would be a serum my mom would love. Unfortunately she claims she sees no different and this is the 3rd time I purchased this for her. She has been using this serum now for 3 months and I hope she will tell me good news. My mom tried two of there other products and she just started to using them 2 months ago hopefully she will tell me good news I really want to finally find the right product for her :)</li>
    <li> I would say the only way to know that this is not doing anything would be if I didn&#x27;t put anything on my face and then compare both results.  Not a simple thing to do.  We keep trying to look beautiful for those special people that look at us regularly.  It has not had any negative effects and everyone knows Vitamin C is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I like this. I use it under my eyes and on fine lines around my face. You need to use this consistantly to see results.</li>
    <li> So far with continued use, i have seen some difference in scars.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great product! thank you</li>
    <li> I never realized that I didn&#x27;t have an even tone until I began using this.  When I tried this, it was because I wanted to test the &amp;#34;more youthful glow&amp;#34; and just ignored the claim of creating an even tone.  Oz Naturals does not disappoint.  Within in a week I began to notice the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; but it was far better than I had expected. And then the biggest surprise was the even tone that had a youthful glow! Like I said earlier, I had no idea I didn&#x27;t have an even tone until now! And the glow! This serum does not have a scent and is a little thicker than water. It is easy to use and by the end of the first week of use, one can see a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and I honestly can say that I have not ever used a product that has shown results like this.  AND- they don&#x27;t test on animals! yay!</li>
    <li> Trademark is not placed in fine line, make me wonder is that really comes from professional manufactory?</li>
    <li> After a facial, the korean lady told me she was putting Vit C on my face.. Felt &amp; looked great for days after, so I bought this product. It is amazing !! I use it almost every morning after putting toner. &amp; then follow it up with an spf moisturizer. In recent days, I&#x27;ve been told that my skin is glowing! My skin does look much better in pictures, I&#x27;ve got a more even skin tone &amp; have been breaking out in pimples much less. I plan to become a regular. It makes sense that that the serum has an expiry date clearly marked too. There - I&#x27;ve shared my secret with the world! Thank you OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> Made me look so much better. No greasy feel and it was reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> Omg this stuff was amazing. I had an injury to my forehead and used this twice a day!!  Everyone was impressed</li>
    <li> ..... My face looks and feels healthier as soon as I use it ... I love the way it feels ...</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference within the first 2 days of using this product. I use OZ naturals almost exclusively because of their natural approach. I use this in conjunction with their vitamin c face wash.</li>
    <li> Used an entire bottle over a three month period. Just so-so results. Wearing sunblock helps better than this product. Didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my hyper pigmentation. On to the next thing!</li>
    <li> The serum was good I love it 57 years old and people tell me I have great skin.  thank you Lila Sharp</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time but I like what I see and feel. The personalized emails from their reps on how to use the product is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I use this serum  after my cleanser, and toner, ( also from Oz). My face just looks and feels younger. It won&#x27;t work overnight, but the damage was not done overnight  either. So patience and routine along with Oz products helps.</li>
    <li> As a 70 year old it was surprising to see the rash of pimples this raised. I&#x27;m going to try this and the OZ retinol moisturizer on my hands and arms to see if it&#x27;ll at least help age spots ...</li>
    <li> I did not see or feel a difference in using this product.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with this product, have been using it for couple of days. Didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> A bit &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; not what i expected it to be for a serum based product. I finished the first bottle and on my second...so far its doing well. I have asian skin type IV. I hyper pigment really easy. Mainly from sporadic break outs. So this has slowly helped</li>
    <li> The gel is very nice, neither thin nor thick. I like to use the toner to prime for the serum. Feels good next day.</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference in my skin whatsoever. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, if I skip  a day  Ican see the difference I have used it for many months. I have repeat orders on this product.</li>
    <li> Yes that the best vitamin c serum I order another one now. it make my dark spot lighter</li>
    <li> My skin feels a lot better and a lot tighter. I also recently purchased the indian healing clay mask and derma roller. These three things have completely changed my skin for the better.</li>
    <li> so far I think this serum is pretty great.  It takes time for new skin care products to really show what they are going to do but my skin is brighter, smoother and firmer.  worth it!!!</li>
    <li> I been using it for over a week. I did not notice any.</li>
    <li> Seems to really work...helps to make my skin more smooth.</li>
    <li> It was alright, not as good as reviews say but that&#x27;s my opinion!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It evens my skin tone and works well. I purchased it because of the multiple internet reviews stating it was a good product. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Has been using it for more than a year now along with Hyaluronic Serum. Use it few times a week at night. Noticed the results - the skin is clear, pores are minimized, less discoloration and majority of sun damage spots are gone. Skin is deferentially looks fresh and young (i am in mid 40th)</li>
    <li> I received this free to review on my blog and here is what I had to say: I have used other vitamin C serums before but OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum is the only one that has refined my pores besides leaving my skin radiant and youthful.  When I now look into the mirror, I look like I am my daughter’s sister instead of her mother.</li>
    <li> Applied it religiously 2x day and sadly saw zero difference on my face.</li>
    <li> I use this before using a retinol A cream I get from Puritan&#x27;s Pride.  I typically don&#x27;t like to hype beauty products because not everything works for everyone.  My skin is somewhat sensitive and a little on the dry side (which is why I like the retinol A with this). The Vitamin C serum firms the skin and reduces fine lines. I noticed a difference rather quickly.</li>
    <li> I just started using thus opinion yet</li>
    <li> See a difference and use at least once daily with Hyaluronic acid</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product did anything for me</li>
    <li> Excellant product , i will reccomand this product . works very well and help skin better shine . It feels more yonger skin and fair enough , using everyday while sleeping will help out definetely .</li>
    <li> I am writing this review after using it for about 3 weeks. Its kind of Okay. Earlier I used timeless cosmetics Vitamin C serum and that felt effective.I wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> Spots are fading away and skin looks great .  Skin feels great also..  Just use a few drops for whole face.......</li>
    <li> I use this after a clarifying/exfoliating toner (I use Lancome) and I love what it does to my skin! I follow it with OZ Naturals Super Youth retinol moisturizer.The combination has worked to keep my skin clear (I still break out at 50) and lighten dark areas, lessen the appearance of wrinkles and the lines around my mouth, and brighten my skin! I love the OZ products and would recommend this serum-it&#x27;s super light and absorbs quickly! Wait five minutes, then apply the Super Youth!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any anti-aging results from the use of this product nightly for the length of the bottle. I made a homemade serum with stronger concentrations of both Vit C and hyaluronic acid for 0.1% the price and have had a reduction in forehead fine lines after 2 weeks and an incredible dewy look after application.</li>
    <li> Usually when I get a zit, the scar stays there for ~9 months. I&#x27;ve previously tried cocoa butter, and other fading products which have sped up the healing process, but this has by far been the best. I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months, and my acne scars faded almost completely in just 2! Was so amazed.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did not work with me, I did not notice any result</li>
    <li> To be fair I must say that I am blessed with good skin to begin with so there is not a lot for this serum to do. That and I have been very good to my skin. I haven&#x27;t worn make up since I was in high school and I am only 42. I do live is a harsh environment and my skin has in the past seen a lot of sun. I am also an ex smoker. That being said I only have a very few fine lines and my face occasionally gets dry. I am in a position where I do not always have the luxury of taking the best care of myself due to physical disabilities. This serum makes my skin feel so good. My husband has always told me I have the softest skin and now he says it is even softer and has a glow. It is not only about how it looks but it feels so luxurious. I feel like I have the face of a 20 year old again. It doesn&#x27;t quite look that young but I don&#x27;t need it to. It feel unbelievable and it looks good too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my 63 yr. old face for three months, once a day, as recommended by my Dermatologist. The results were gradual, but it tightened my pores and evened out the shades on my face, I thought. Then, I ran into a friend that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while, and he said, &amp;#34;Wow! You&#x27;re radiant. What did you do? You look different.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just good genes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hahahaha</li>
    <li> I always got a skin trouble whenever i use Vitamin C. But, i did not have any problem since i use OZ naturals &#x3D;) It is great product!</li>
    <li> Good so far, been using for a month... waiting to see if noticeable difference in skin. I&#x27;ve read that vitamin C is great to help make your skin look younger.</li>
    <li> This was a great find for me. It helps soothe eye bags, gives radiance back to skin, and softens your skin. I was lucky enough to try this free.</li>
    <li> In just the first week I noticed a marked reduction in the discoloration spots on my face from scars. It absorbs quickly, not sticky and no odor.  I&#x27;ll gladly order more. Oh, I should mention, I occasionally (once a week) use a facial needle roller in tandem with this serum. It helps break down the scar tissue as well as generate new cell growth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I just turned 30, but I see that the serum is helping with the very fine frown lines. Also, the sopts I developed on my face after I had my kids seem to be fading. It is very gradual, but I see the change one month after using it. That was an unexpected but welcome side effect.</li>
    <li> Love love this product</li>
    <li> My item arrived promptly and I love it!</li>
    <li> I could not see any change at all in my skin, and I used the whole bottle waiting for some kind of improvement. :(</li>
    <li> Enjoyed it. Have been trying different brands. One of the best</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this with the moisturizer for good results. I&#x27;ve noticed my fine lines have been diminishing.</li>
    <li> I have dry and combination skin tone. I have fine lines underneath my eyes which makes me look older than my age. I am glad with oz Naturals Vitamin C serum. It started showing result after 1 week. I have seen difference in my fine lines and skin tone. It has improved the over all skin texture. It helps the skin to look more youthful and minimize the signs of aging. I am applying this serum once a day before the moisturizer. It takes few minutes to dry the serum. I have used few other products from OZ Naturals and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly satisfied with this serum. Vitamin C serum is great for your skin. Oz Naturals products are natural and are great for all skin type.&lt;br /&gt;These are cruelty free and made in US.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these to any one out there wants to minimize the signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;I received this serum in exchange of my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Great Product, great price!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing I have been using it for like three days and I have seen remarkable changes in my skin, it really does fade sun spots, I had one in the left side of my face and had been using aloe vera for like a month with very mild results, but as soon as I started using this I can say that it has almost faded away completely! I see the reviews were true!!  I have a complaint though, the size of this is TINY, I mean, sell this in a bigger bottle because this miniature doesn&#x27;t contain enough product! and is not convenient for the customer! I was going to give them 4 stars but given the great results I have had in such a small amount of time I decided to give you 5!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals products have a higher percentage of the ingredients that benefit our skin, and have much less &#x27;junk&#x27; ingredients, like dyes, perfumes or fillers and chemicals that we don&#x27;t need. There is no odd smell, and it absorbs quickly, leaving a nice feel and easy to use under make-up. I love ALL of the OZ Natural products I&#x27;ve used so far. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but I can see the difference. I am loyal to my brands (Clinique and Keilh&#x27;s) and I&#x27;ve liked their anti-aging serums. I think this product outshines the other products I&#x27;ve used. I like that it&#x27;s natural and that it only takes a few drops. I put a drop on my forehead, and one on each cheek, every night and morning. I&#x27;m glad that I tried it and I think I&#x27;ll keep using it</li>
    <li> Excellent product so far..I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has made a big difference in my skin. I use it morning and night!</li>
    <li> I started using the serum because of trying the Dermaroller. Within a week I could tell a big difference!  My acne scars and sun spots have faded. My skin tone has even out..even freckles seen to diminish.  Just started my second bottle. I&#x27;m hooked!! I&#x27;m on the trying other Oz Natural products.</li>
    <li> I am an Esthetician and one of my friend recommended me to try this amazing serum. I will always use it instead of other expensive product.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully on my skin. My dark spots are fading already and my skin is so much brighter.</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s definitely thicker and tackier than water!  Notice a different in my skin after just 2 applications!  Skin seems brighter and pores appear smaller. Must have!</li>
    <li> I get promotion by writing reviews but honestly I don&#x27;t like this product</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle and can&#x27;t really tell a difference. May buy another one but not sure</li>
    <li> One of my favorite skin care products!  It should be a staple in everyone women&#x27;s skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this product! In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement with my skin tone and texture. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used vitamin c serum but saw that Dr. OZ was recommending it as an anti aging solution.  I live in a very dry climate and have found this serum to be of tremendous help in not only hydrating my skin but also giving it a much smoother texture.  I&#x27;m seeing fine lines filling in and a dewy glow to my skin.  I highly recommend this serum. :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this from the day it arrived and have not noticed my skin looking any brighter. It does help &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my skin but that&#x27;s about all.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any effect from this serum and have used half of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Skin texture is better&lt;br /&gt;And become more healthy</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum!!! I wish I had found it years ago!! My skin is clearer, smoother, and with a healthy shine after using this product. And for the price...you can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> Third time ordering this product. I usually try a product and end up throwing it away. My sensitive skin reacts very well to this.  It is more clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
    <li> Very light and absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now.  It did not cause dry skin or breakouts however I have seen nothing improvement wise.  Will give it a few more weeks to see if my skin starts looking better and to see if my age spot will fade even just a little but as of now I don&#x27;t feel this product lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and barely any smell. I have been using this at night and am seeing small results but still love the product.</li>
    <li> works, but the bottle is not very big</li>
    <li> I am still deciding whether this product works real well for me or not.  So far so good. I like the ingredients</li>
    <li> I had been using 3-4 bottles of the Truth Serum by Ole Henriksen that costs about $48 for a 1 oz. bottle at Sephora.  It made my skin  smooth and hydrated like no others.  I tried to save some $ by trying this OZ Naturals vitamin C serum that the reviewers have been raved about on Amazon.  It was a wrong decision because I honestly didn&#x27;t feel this product is effective at all after a week of daily use.  It is not the cheapest vitamin C serum on Amazon but I was willing to pay a bit more given the high ratings and positive reviews.  I&#x27;d have saved a little bit if it was about half as effective as the Truth Serum.  I think i&#x27;ll save up and go back to the Truth Serum that had been giving me the consistent, overnight result.  Too bad this product doesn&#x27;t offer satisfaction guarantee or I&#x27;d love to have my money back.  As noted by other reviewers, it is watery, colorless and odorless, which I don&#x27;t really mind if it is effective.</li>
    <li> I will order this product again; it&#x27;s brighten my complexion and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this would be so amazing. I have used prescription products for facial brown spots and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this. I imagine I will have to use longer for better results but this was a great thing to try!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
    <li> Great stuff I&#x27;m using it on my hands the look much better. The spots are almost gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year.  It does not take much for your face, so the small container&#x27;s contents lasts about two months.  That makes it quite a reasonable treatment for your skin.  It does improve my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected--wrapped so it wouldn&#x27;t break.  Love the fact it has the C+E+Hyaluronic Acid all in one bottle (I used to have to buy 2 before I found this one) and as anyone who uses these particular products knows, you skin feels and is Very Smooth and Moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, your skin will love you for it.</li>
    <li> not that pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way my skin feels and the way it looks</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 10 days and I already feel it is working for me.  My skin feels smoother and tighter.  I use 4 drops each time, once or twice a day.  The serum arrived as promised and was well packaged.  Before it arrived, OZ Naturals sent me an email giving me usage direction.  I will definitely reorder from them before of their product and customer service.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my skin after more than a month.</li>
    <li> I reviewed  this product for I love to review. I really like how it made my skin feel. My skin felt clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I like it, I&#x27;m seeing improvement already.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  After using this product for several week, there is no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I did not really get to try this product. Shortly after I opened it I dropped it and it broke to pieces on my tile floor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the best as it says, love it!!!</li>
    <li> I do like this product and believe it does help in lessening the aging process from sun damage and just aging skin in general. I believe it works as well as zo medical.</li>
    <li> Heard good things about vitamin c directly on the face.  Giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for two days and I love the way the way my skin feels thus far.  Hoping to see more results</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for a few weeks and seen improvement in my skin.  Will try to write more later as I see how the product continues to improve my face.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a year or so now and have noticed it keeps my skin soft and reduces some of the dark spots I have from acne scarring. I like that it is light and not oily and I can use it at night. I&#x27;m 29 and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet but have heard from friends that it helps with fine lines and wrinkles also.</li>
    <li> It was certainly waste of money- for all their products.  I see no difference.  I get better results from Aveeno face wash. #justsayin</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals is an amazing product. I see a noticeable difference in my skin and feel it protects my skin well from the sun. I have used products that were not as effective and cost much more.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have been using Retin A but it was drying out my skin.  Since using this product my face looks and feels amazing.  It does not burn, even when applied using the Clarisonic Opal. This product is much cheaper than other lotions/serums I&#x27;ve used making it a great value.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is not compatible with my skin! It is supposed to be ultra hydrating but does the exact opposite for me. After using this and a few other OZ Naturals products my face is more dry than it&#x27;s ever been. Thank goodness for the 30 day money back guarantee!</li>
    <li> Just so-so. I feel like I am putting water on my face instead of a serum.</li>
    <li> love his product so far I feel the fine lines around my eyes getting less noticeable and the ones around my mouth are gone Im 6 so they werent huge but I was starting to notice drier sin than a year or two ago so I decided to start up a skin regimen to postpone deeper wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Easy application and fast drying time allows me to use this product anytime. It keeps my skin smooth and even and seems to prevent most blemishes. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see &amp; feel the difference. My fine lines were gone &amp; my face looked so refreshed. I love love this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but after few days I started to get rashes on my face.</li>
    <li> good ingredient and super natural for your beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> product not discribed</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the claims they made (before and afters) but I was at least expecting something more than nothing by 30 days in.  I brought it because of the ingredients which have been praised on the net.  It just didn&#x27;t make any difference what so ever.  I&#x27;m rather surprised at the high five star marks.  Also I wanted to return it but 30 days had expired and it also was quite difficult to find the exact company to return it to!</li>
    <li> I gotta say. Ive been using this product religiously for about a month now, and have noticed NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE in my skin whatsoever. Same acne scars, same problem areas, same fine lines. Nothing special at all. I would be careful next time about seeing a product with such great reviews. If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is. All these doctored reviews are a disappointment. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum with my mt roller ..or just with my retinol cream which works better for me with the serum..Mt pores are smaller and my skin is looking more youthful..will purchase more when I run out..And the great thing is you only need a little.</li>
    <li> I can see difference in the skin .</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum seems to be making my skin feel and look smoother.  I don&#x27;t need to use foundation anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very fast shipping....Love this product. Very fast shipping....</li>
    <li> Bought this serum for my mom.  She loves it.  It may not be the magic solution to reverse her 62-year-old wrinkles, but it does tone her skin and it&#x27;s a good moisturizer.  It takes more than suggested 1-2 drops to cover the whole face and neck, but the bottle still lasts several months.</li>
    <li> topical vitamin c application is more effective than simple oral supplementation. this helps keep my skin looking radiant and youthful. i only gave it for stars because it contains vegetable glycerin which i removed from my skin care regime some time ago. the combination of ha and vegetable glycerin is overkill as far as humectants imo. if you dont already something like this, get it!</li>
    <li> Had expected better results, may try one more bottle to give a wider results field.</li>
    <li> my wife cannot tell a difference</li>
    <li> So far so good. No dramatic results but I know I&#x27;m doing my face, my skin a favor. Product arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money- use olive oil, sunflower oil and castor oil.  Drink water and eat healthy foods.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic Acid worked better for me.</li>
    <li> Skin really soaks this stuff up</li>
    <li> Only used for a few days but seems to help.</li>
    <li> It make my skin healthy. I really like it</li>
    <li> Been using skinceuticals ferulic for a year and decided to try this after reading great reviews...so far I really like it...less &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; than the skinceuticals.  Only been using it a couple weeks but feel like it is working...great transaction with Craig, also!</li>
    <li> I use this with Ponds Moisturizer at night.  Makes my skin soft and meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> Thx for my Vitamin C Serum. It is the first thing I reach for in the morning. I look forward to seeing results soon. I like the way it feels when I apply it. I am big on Citrusy fragrances; this serum has no scent though.</li>
    <li> My 56 year old husband wanted to try something new for his skin. He is in great shape (in my opinion) and works out every day. We almost always use sunblock when outside or on vacation. His skin is pretty good for his age but he doesn&#x27;t have some fine lines and one &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; wrinkle across the bridge of his nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He heard about vitamin C and asked me to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using it for about a month and we took before/after photos. We don&#x27;t see any difference. He will continue to use it since we don&#x27;t want to just throw it out but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum is very helpful to my skin. I see and feel the results  almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It is wise to use it once a day every day. You will not regret purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to apply.  Supposed to help moisturizers go into the skin easier.  Hasn&#x27;t caused me any acne or facial discomfort.</li>
    <li> GOOD STUFF I GOT THE WHOLE SET OF PRODUCTS NOW LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight, dosent feel sticky nor is it drying. Has faded my dark spot significantly, I now don&#x27;t need to wear foundation everday.</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong stuff I would never buy this again :( didn&#x27;t even have a older to it probably just water :( my own fault !!!!</li>
    <li> I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum didn&#x27;t work out at all :( :( My skin went nuts!!!!! I was excited to try and then I regretted. I really wished my skin would of liked it. Many of my friends use it and love it.</li>
    <li> use this daily every morning !! wil definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> ITS WATERY, NOT IMPRESS,EXPECTING SOMETHING  LIKE A THICK SERUM.WISH I HAD PURCHASE RETINOL INTEAD 58YRS OLD  ALMOST NO WRINCLES, ASIAN COMPLEXION</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Goes on smooth without being sticky or greasy. Great underneath my daily SPF moisturizer. My latest edition to my daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I apply this every night after I clean my face, before my moisturizer. What a difference it has made in the texture of my skin, amazing!</li>
    <li> awesome product makes my skin look much younger and in healthy condition</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my face and neck. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny finish like some serums. Will def reorder.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this was a quality agan oil, it isn&#x27;t.  Keep looking and pass on this one.  This was a pricey lesson that I encourage everyone to avoid.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok.  it&#x27;s lightweight and I like that.  I don&#x27;t see any difference though and I&#x27;ve been using it a while.  Not sure what all the hype is about.  I much prefer plantscriptions by origins</li>
    <li> Using it every night and have noticed a huge difference on my face.</li>
    <li> *received free for honest opinion*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped at the chance to get this serum because of the benefits that vitamin C brings. I used it along with my daily skin care routine and i really like it so far. It is not a strong smell and it has a nice texture (not too runny or thick) I would recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> I Used for the past 4 days and it feels really good, has a witch hazel effect. definitely feels good on the skin, will need to update in a few weeks once ive used it more to give a long term effect review. The application dropper is a good choice for this item becuase it is very thin liquid. so far its helped my skin feel tighter. if given i chance will buy for mother to see how well it works.</li>
    <li> This serum is one of the best facial products I have ever used. I use it almost every night (alternating with Youth Code by L&#x27;Oreal Paris, which I also love), and follow it up with a slathering of Sweet Bee Magic-All in One Healing Skin Cream. The combination is almost magical, I must say. In the past, I forked over a lot of $$ on such products as Cr&amp;egrave;me de la Mer, which, albeit very rich and hydrating, was no better than the products I&#x27;ve listed above. I just love how the OZ Naturals serum glides into my skin and does its thing. It also lasts quite a long time, which is another huge plus.</li>
    <li> This serum is easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now every morning, but can&#x27;t tell any improvement with it so far</li>
    <li> I used this product for about two weeks. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this product. I use about 4-5 drops and pat it across my face, neck and chest.  I&#x27;ve seen some brightness in my skin and noticed my dark spots are a bit lighter.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see how I feel after I finish the bottle. A lot of skin care products take several weeks to really start showing the effects. If you&#x27;re interested in trying this product I&#x27;d recommend it. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse or allergic reactions and have felt it was a good serum.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  My face glows!</li>
    <li> Product has pretty good results. Better than many I have tried from other companies.</li>
    <li> Used for (3) weeks, product developed an odd odor &amp; discontinued use.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 3 days and my face is smoother than before.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product let my skin dry and let my check red, like if was irritated or something.</li>
    <li> The serum feel so nice against my skin! The only downside is the the rubber/squeeze thingy came detached when I opened the bottle. I have been using it by just pouring it in my palm. But I love the texture and that it is almost fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft, smooth and glowing. Reduces appearance of lines. Slowly reduces dark spots/scars, noticed a difference within 1 week.</li>
    <li> Love OZ Naturals!  I use the Vitamin C Serum every day.  Since using Oz Naturals, specifically the Vitamin C serum, I have noticed a considerable difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was provided to me for consideration and possible review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am serious about skin care and rely on serums as an integral part of my routine. OZ Naturals Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum brightens my skin tone, improves texture and the hyaluronic acid helps to hydrate and lock in moisture from my other products. This is a solid performer at a wallet friendly price. I like this product and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for high quality skin care and you are on a budget, try OZ Naturals. I keep several of their products in my skin care rotation and wouldn&#x27;t give them up if you paid me.</li>
    <li> very good. I love OZ Natural products.</li>
    <li> Love it and how my skin feels and looks after using!</li>
    <li> i like this brand better than some of the others. This moisturizes and brighten my skin. The eye gel definitely tightens skin and together my skin looks so much better without using makeup in an attempt to disquisition my 47 year old dark circles, spots and annoying wrinkles. I think this is really making a difference. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now</li>
    <li> Used this serum after using my Derma Roller and loved the results! Made my face feel like silk with only using a tiny bit. I will be using this every morning and night.</li>
    <li> I usually take care of my face with rose water and jojoba oil.  Yet, I had wanted to try something different which may have improved my skin.  So, I purchased this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointingly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin even though I used this product for quite a while.  I surely liked the texture.  However, I ended up return this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to stick to my regular products.  It&#x27;s simple and not costly although I use organic on both rose water and jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 39 years old.  But I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, saggy skin or black heads with the simple care.  People think that I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.  All in all, simple care is the best care for me.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to see if this works.  It really does work because it makes my skin much smoother less rough bumps and less scale dry skin.  I love mixing a tiny bit of this with my foundation.  It really helps then to put a powder over that.  I can use it for my stomach after having my baby.  I love the vitamin benefits too!</li>
    <li> This is great!  After using it nightly for a week, I can already see a new glow to my skin.  I typically use Clinique products but adding this at night has made a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I love it I can used under my makeup I can see my face more healthy I really recommend</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the above product, happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I❤️vitamin c serum now. I literally wake up feeling prettier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading many good reviews, and I am happy with this product, too. Compared to other vitamin C serum, this one seems lighter, does not cause acne, and no funky smell at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is great but my skin feels weird and dry after using it. Therefore I need to put moistures on top of it</li>
    <li> Did nothing I finished the whole bottle saw no difference save your money</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and you only have to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> I was one of those people who washed my face with whatever was sitting by the sink for years, if I even washed it twice a day. I&#x27;ve started using one of those scrubby brushes (I&#x27;m not sure it exfoliates, but it means it isn&#x27;t freezing when you first put water on your face) with Cerave and this twice a day and I think its made a huge difference. My skin just looks more even. I always had good luck with my skin, so I don&#x27;t know how it is for dry or acne-prone skin, but I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my skin and I think it&#x27;s definitely improved it. It sinks right in so it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or gunky like lotion does, so if you&#x27;re not used to foundation, you can still use this.</li>
    <li> huge disappointment i want a refund IT DOESNT WORK I MIGHT AS WELL BE PUTTING WATER ON MY FACE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FEEL ALLL THE REVIEWS HERE ARE FAKENOW</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this C serum is 20% C. Typically C serum at 20% will make my skin tingle and I noticed that this serum doesn&#x27;t oxidize like the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am new to the OZ Naturals line. The attraction for me was the all natural ingredients they use.  I&#x27;m very particular about using hygine products that do not contain harmful chemicals or endocrine disruptors.  I started using the C Serum and Retinol Moisturizer together about three weeks ago and I have to say that I love what they are doing for my skin.  It looks and feels clearer, healthier and smoother than it has in years.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
    <li> Just so so.  will not order again.</li>
    <li> It feels really good, and it&#x27;s non-scented, which I like.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a big change in my skin, but I think I will soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month.  I&#x27;ve had a deep groove in my forehead for years and it seems to be diminishing.  I definitely need mousturizer with the product though.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Would definitely recommend this product! Brightens my complexion and lightens the pigmentations I&#x27;ve from years of sun tanning. Previously I&#x27;ve tried from sk2? la Roche posay, Peter Thomas Roth, Sisley etc. this is still the best by far!</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin feels soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> Was hopeful his serum would be good dor face after reading all the good reviews-after a week have broken out  terribly and stopped using.I have mature skin that rarely breaks out.</li>
    <li> Beyond doubt one of the best serums i have used.</li>
    <li> I have been a believer in Vitamin C for the skin for about two years. I decided to try this brand after all the positive reviews. So glad I did. I have seen results very quickly. My skin tone looks very even and has a healthy glow.  My skin looks so good I can wear nothing but sunscreen and feel very confident. Here&#x27;s how I use the product, in the evening after I cleanse I apply the serum and let it absorb a few minutes then follow with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product is relatively affordable and does the job very well. My skin looks more fair after 1 month use.</li>
    <li> Bought this and after a few weeks of using, my boyfirend starting getting weird spots on his face. His face is pretty clear so when the spots started showing up it was pretty noticeable. He has stopped using this and the spots are slightly lessening, but are definitely still there. Hopefully they completely go away over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  It works well.</li>
    <li> Great stuff; to costly. I feel there&#x27;s too many Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s on Amazon that works just as good for lesser money.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> After a week of using the serum under my moisturizer, it cleared my skin and cut down on my oiliness. Overall, my skin looks healthier, and the natural and organic ingredients improved its appearance. Check out the review at: [...]</li>
    <li> with my oily and super sensitive skin, it&#x27;s difficult for me to find a product that won&#x27;t dry my skin too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have acne and now I deal with reducing the appearance of scars and visible oil glands/ pores, but after using this product for only 3 days my pores are tightening up and my scars are beginning to fade in color.  My skin is softer and this product is light enough to be worn under my facial moisturizer without making me greasy.</li>
    <li> love it..brighten my face.</li>
    <li> Was using for melasma and dark spots. After 2 months, face was broken out with acne. I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out.  I think the performance is good, but I have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this actually does anything. I have a light brown spot on my forehead that I&#x27;m trying to protect from the sun as much as possible, as it gets worse in the sun, and thought this would help, but hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m finishing the bottle anyway.</li>
    <li> This serum is perfect for someone who has sensitive skin like mine, it gives you a little boost to your skin so it doesn&#x27;t look dull. I love to use this in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum since they are a little bit different. Since my skin is very sensitive, this is one of the few serums that I can use without irritating it. So far so good !!</li>
    <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
    <li> I have uneven skin tone and it&#x27;s prone to acne too, pretty depressing skin basically. I have spent so much money trying out all sorts of natural and chemical stuff but sadly nothing has worked. After days of reading reviews about products that will help even skin tone and reduce the appearance of pores, finally landed on this one. I am completely thankful I ordered this. I have been using it for 10 days now and I can visibly see pores shrinking. Even better, my skin glows (this is something I was convinced would never happen). Really feels like my skin is finally breathing happy. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am adding this to my daily facial routine with the hopes of ending my hyper pigmentation issues.  This serum goes on to the skin well so I am able to use this with a moisturizer easily.</li>
    <li> Really a noticeable difference in the firmness and fullness of my skin.  I would highly recommend waiting several hours after shaving, as it really stings if used immediately after.  I think that the bottle should state this to save other guys from that intense moment!</li>
    <li> I  used  this product  for a  1 1/2  year  , it works !</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I have used Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serums in the past and they were not of such a thin consistency.  It was water down and didn&#x27;t not feel like a serum. I used this product for over a month and noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use at night after cleansing my face and after a Toner then I apply this Vitamin C Serum and I include this in daily regimen. My skin is smoother and skin is softer. It is recommended to use every other night for best results. I have not been using it very long but love the results thus far.</li>
    <li> Tried it for months and DIDNT see any results. I don&#x27;t recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I tired different brand and I see the difference with a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and fast shipment that this company provided.  The vitamine C Serum is great.  It makes my face very smoth, soft and gives it a nice fresh glow. I will buy again from this company.</li>
    <li> I have used this for just a few days and so far I like it. I already notice a difference in the appearance of my skin!</li>
    <li> I used this for a month and didn&#x27;t see any results : (</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals has been a nice addition to my skincare routine. I love that it has no strong odors or scents. It feels nice on my face and seems to have reduced my pore size slightly in the past few weeks! I&#x27;m interested to see the difference it makes in my skin after a few months of use since the first few weeks have already given me smoother skin. It did make my neck a bit itchy, so I only use it on my face, but it&#x27;s worth it to keep seeing results I like!</li>
    <li> My skin absolutely loves it!!! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I considered Oz Naturals because of the rating. I had been a former user of Pharma-C and wanted to try a more natural product. It is early to tell if I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C has made a huge difference in the quality of my skin.  I am always looking for the best price and product.  I am impressed with this Vitamin C serum!  I will buy again from OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> At 31 I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but definitely have some fine lines around me eyes.  I started working night shift at my hospital and realized I need to start taking care of my skin as I&#x27;m not getting any younger and working nights can age you fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after reading all the great reviews, I decided to give this stuff a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it 1-2x /day and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks less dull and has more of an even tone to it.  I only need about 5 drops to evenly put a light coat on my face and 2 drops for my neck.  I use it under my moisturizer or under my self tanner (see my review for Jergen&#x27;s natural glow) and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this product is all natural - organic is best and the less chemicals you can put on your face the better in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Quality product delivered on time!  I will buy from this seller again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It was amazing it made a huge difference it&#x27;s the best product I have tried on so far&lt;br /&gt;it transformed my skin , made it fresh and look younger</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have been using it little over a week.  I love the way my skin feels and it really soaks in.  The product is very light weight and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using if for 5 days. I can already see resulta.  My skin is brighter, more even toned, and My dark spots are clearing up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve def had much better.  I think some product reviews might be &amp;#34;paid&amp;#34; to give higher ratings.  this should really get no stars in my book.</li>
    <li> Got for free with snagsnout 😃 Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! I bought it based on reviews and was very pleased with the results. It made my skin look and feel better. I even ran out before buying my second bottle and I could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I used the whole bottle religiously, twice a day, I see no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the product gets absorb quickly and skin not feeling sticky, I can&#x27;t think of other pros about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the rave for this serum. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty good and works well. Only thing is you must apply olive oil 10 seconds after you use this. It feels like it&#x27;s drying your skin. I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to come back to update my review on this wonderful vit C serum because I have been applying it almost for two months and the skin of  my face and neck are becoming better and better day after day.I can not tell that my wrinkles have disappeared but they are less visible I would tell that less deep taking on account my 55 years.I am very happy for having found this serum .It is slight and go into the skin deeply. For me is the Best and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. It seems to easily absorb into my skin and my skin feels immediately firmer.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> So as per many people have stated, my skin does feel very hydrated. However,  my skin felt just as hydrated with Garnier Anti Wrinkle Serum at half the price. I do not notice any difference in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I noticed one morning my skin looked better, after using for a week. Makeup looks better.</li>
    <li> I would like it if it worked---o results yet and it&#x27; been a month now what else can I say  Nothing yet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 wks now and I haven&#x27;t really notice any difference on my skin. Hopefully, by another 3 wks il notice something otherwise I will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Service was great and the product has brightened my skin in a short period of time. I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I can really see the difference after 1wk! The little lines around my eyes and mouth have noticeably diminished.I was hoping to see my skin get brighter as others had reviewed but that hasn&#x27;t happened. I am just happy to see my fine lines disappear and maybe as I use this product a bit longer my skin will become brighter :) The best part is the fine lines disappearing...and at 52 that feels great!</li>
    <li> Love this  and it will be an constant with my orders.  Face feels tighter.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I used this for sometime and I may have noticed a little more glow to my skin but nothing spectacular</li>
    <li> I have been using for a few weeks now.  My skin does seem brighter and smoother.  I use before my moisturizer.  I think this is a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out after Avalon Organics reformulated their Vitamin C Serum. I also wanted a serum that actually told me what percentage of C was actually in the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum was packaged well. Bottle was sealed. Does not smell bad but does not smell citrusy either. Has a faint smell I can&#x27;t really identify. My house can get a little warm, so I keep mine in the fridge just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals automatically emailed me directions on how to use it, along with specific instructions for Retin-A users. I found that helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid almost feels like a gel...not too watery...maybe because I keep it in the fridge? But it is very easy to apply and sinks right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too early to report if it&#x27;s doing anything for my skin, but so far nothing to complain about it.</li>
    <li> I have seen a different in my skin after a week of using this product</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s great.  I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin due to using this product or any of the other OZ Natural products that I purchased.</li>
    <li> I have just tried this vitamin C serum by OZ Naturals, I would definitely recommend it! It is smooth to apply and visibly brightens my facial skin after a few uses. It is super moisturizing and absorbs fast! It is gentle as well and does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have purchased this product with an introductory discount. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive and can rash out easily. But I do want to use a product that nourishes my skin. This product absorbs quickly, does not cause me any rash. I&#x27;m still waiting for result, but it has been good so far.</li>
    <li> Not sure, guess it works!  I still look my age. LOL!  Just hoping that all of my lotions &amp; potions are preventing future wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Love the product!! I will purchase this again!!</li>
    <li> Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Love the glow it gives my skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on well. With a smooth silky to feel. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in the skin around my eyes where the lines have become less creased. More smoother.</li>
    <li> I recently used another Vitamin C serum that caused me to break out. So I was cautious with this serum, however this serum has been fantastic for my face. No breakouts, plus it does all the good stuff I was expecting from the other serum. My skin looks clearer, my pores look smaller and it feels softer. I am so glad I found this brand and will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works like it says. I spend so much money on items just hoping they work. Well it has finally paid off.  I&#x27;ve been using for a week now but it didn&#x27;t even take this long to see a difference. Even those laugh lines around my mouth have softened! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It was sent quickly and is perfect for my aging skin.  I will be more from this line.</li>
    <li> I gave 4 star because I could see the difference in my skin within the 1st week.In addition, the price is reasonable in comparison with the expensive ones i have been using that doesnt work. Lastly, it arrived quickly. I recommend it to whoever want skin that glows.</li>
    <li> Not sure how long you are supposed to use this to see effects, but I am still giving it a try. It has been about 4 months.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference..</li>
    <li> This is really good I started seeing results in 3 days. Its no joke even I was sceptical until I tried it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Oz naturals is one of my favorite item</li>
    <li> Really plumps my skin.  This is my second purchase. I use it daily under my lotion.</li>
    <li> Been using for two weeks has helped with tone and smoothness.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible serum that serious hydrated my face and my hands. It works great with rosehip oil and coconut oil. I have eczema and very dry legs in the winter and it literally has moisturized my skin and tamed my itching.</li>
    <li> i have use it one month .my skin is become soft.</li>
    <li> this serum works really well and so far I really like it</li>
    <li> Between sunblock and this stuff, I think I&#x27;ve discovered the Fountain of Youth:-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Vitamin C serums w/HA out there and after a few weeks, they would turn crusty and discolor.  Not the Oz naturals.  The consistency is less sticky than others as well.  I really love this line and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this serum.  The vitamin C and HA serum is my no. 1 product I use to fight signs of aging that imho makes the most impact.  I am often told I look many years younger than I am which I attribute mostly to genetics, but I feel this stuff really does help.</li>
    <li> Like the way it soaks in ....tried another brand...this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Makea your skin feel so muxh bettw re.  Soft ans nourishing.  Only takes a few drops each night. Ordered more to have on hand and for my mom too.</li>
    <li> I clicked to reorder this product because I really liked it and when I received it this time IT WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT. Why did it change??? I loved the previous product!!! The new product is goopy and sticky. JUST HORRIBLE! Why would you change a product that received so many good reviews and was a top seller? I WILL NO LONGER BE PURCHASING!</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly. The serum feels good on my face and I feel a tightening effect with it. I have only been using it a week but I feel that it will benefit me with long term use.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Makes my skin glow after only a few weeks of using it. Works better than many expensive serums and creams. I will for sure buy more! Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like after a month of use. Happy customer:)</li>
    <li> This Oz vitamin C serum feels so soft when applying and my skin seems to &#x27;drink&#x27; it up!  Price is great and delivery quick.  I have used another 20% vitamin C serum before this one that helped with lightening dark spots but it left a sticky film on my skin and tended to irritate around my nose.  Also, the Oz serum lightened up some dark spots that the other formula did not.  I am a 53 year old grandma of three and if I am alone with the grands I am always assumed their mom!  It pays in self-confidence to use great products like this.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Customer service is satisfactory. They are concerned about customer thoughts and the shipment was right on time.&lt;br /&gt;Serum is very soft to apply and my skin absorbes it very quickly. I have amildly sensitive skin and this serum did not give me any irritation. I use it before going to sleep and fells like it started giving my skin some vitality.</li>
    <li> I should have bought more, I have really sensitive skin and this has to be one of my favorite purchases from amazon,  gentle on the skin with amazing results!</li>
    <li> Skip it--after 1 month of usage this product hasn&#x27;t delivered any of the benefits of other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve used. First 2 ingredients are &amp;#34;organic herbal infusion&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic aloe&amp;#34; which is probably more indicative of the results you&#x27;ll reveive. Throwing it away to find something more effective.</li>
    <li> I used whole bottle and did not see any significant improvement to my skin. Positive note, it did not have any adverse results - not breakouts or irritations.</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a product that actually improved the look of my skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  After one week of use, I&#x27;ve notice an improved skin texture.  My skin appears smoother and more supple.  My face looks more youthful.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue use in hopes of even more improved skin texture.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum has made a difference in  my face.  The pores are smaller, feels softer, clarity and overall smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have only been using the product for a short time, but so far would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product!! This serum vitamin C is fantastic! My skin is more radiant and youthful since using. I use other products in this skin care line as well and every one is great! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other skin care line. My skin is now in the best shape. I highly recommend this Serum  as well as the other products. Will continue to be a faithful customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great skin care line!</li>
    <li> Did not feel like it did anything different for my skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using as instructed for 5 days. I have deep wrinkles on my forehead , I already see an improvement. I am very pleased .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything...</li>
    <li> really makes a difference.  can even go out without foundation</li>
    <li> Great product, has improved my skin.  Will continue to purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> So I wanted to wait a while using this product before a review. I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps my face smooth and my dark spots are fading. Also I have noticed a difference in my wrinkles. Love it!</li>
    <li> I might expect too much since I am in my 70&#x27;s,  but  I would say a slight better on wrinkles, not  much, but I will keep trying and hope it may yet look much better.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT MY SKIN FEELS FIRM AS SOON AS I APPLY THIS PRODUCT AND THE SKIN IS VERY&lt;br /&gt;SOFT I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING FOR A SHORT TIME</li>
    <li> i like this product it is very helpful to improve your skin , also you can get similar product at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon.com/shops/AZNaturalsWorlds</li>
    <li> Love it, makes skin look better, easy to apply, no smell. Will buy again when this one runs out. thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two months now. The dark sports on my face is getting lighter and my skin feel a lot smoother. I love this product!!! I have recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used other vitamin c serums and they leave my face feeling a little sticky.  I like this because it feels like it tightens my face and makes my pores look smaller.  I have been using it about a week and really can&#x27;t see too much of a difference with my fine lines or small sun spots but I am sure they are not going to disappear over night.</li>
    <li> this is miracle in a bottle. within a week after i start using it, i see a huge difference in my skin.  less wrinkles, skin is smoother, brighter.  especially the skin around my eyes,huge improvement. very happy with the result. i will continue use it.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and was looking for something to brighten my skin and make it look more vibrant. I found this product and from the reviews decided to try it. I used the serum after washing my face and using toner as suggested on the directions. I used this product for about a little over two weeks and did not see much of a difference at all in my skin tone. I would suggest another product of you are a younger age and looking to brighten your skin tone.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve used! Results are fairly fast. Big difference in the discoloration and fine lines around my eyes. Really helps with sun damage!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day under my moisturizers and makeup.  It is very good and I think that it helps my skin.  I am a fan of all their products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now.  My skin just looks better, younger, tighter…the dark spots and lines are diminishing.  One big brown spot on my forearm is so much lighter it doesn&#x27;t even bother me anymore.  I won&#x27;t ever be without it, also I&#x27;m 67 years OLD!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, so haven&#x27;t seen a big difference yet. but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my refrigerator to keep it long-lasting and cool. I let it dry first then apply a moisturizer. I have been using this for a bit over a week and I notice a positive effect (more so than any other product). My face looks more glowy and clear- I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I received it on time. It&#x27;s too soon to say if it&#x27;s helping my skin but for now I&#x27;ll give it four stars</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because it&#x27;s too soon to tell how effect it is! The experience in purchasing this product was not only smooth but went above and beyond.  Receiving a personalized email with information on how to use the product gave me the feeling that the seller is invested in making sure I have a good outcome with their product.  I have only used the product for one week so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effect yet.  However, I do have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritation or outbreak.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2K7TEXW3222NR]]Quick Profile:&lt;br /&gt;Asian Male&lt;br /&gt;18-25yo&lt;br /&gt;Oily Combination Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use the shiseido bio-performance serum as my go serum to keep my face and eyes healthy and moist, but using it caused  bumps to appear sometimes so I decided a change of products was needed. Researched online, mainly through amazon&#x27;s average customer ratings on serums and found OZ naturals. It had one of the highest and most reviews so couldn&#x27;t hurt to try and I was completely satisfied with my purchase. No new bumps were appearing in fact it started to help get rid of some of the pimples I had. My panda eyes started to fade away after consecutive use and my face is staying moist, still need a moisturizer on top if going out. Overall, this moisturizer couldn&#x27;t better than what I hoped for, especially now I&#x27;m only spending $30 compared to $80 for a serum. My only recommendation for the manufacturer is to create a pump for this serum, using a dropper is sometimes inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: purchase from OZ Naturals only to ensure quality and authenticity of product, plus there should be a plastic seal around bottle if it hasn&#x27;t been opened or used.</li>
    <li> This product is great and has wonderful effects for mature or maturing skin types to increase elasticity and reduce small wrinkles from forming.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it twice a week but is gentle and can be used everyday.  Place a large drop in the palm of your hand and apply to face and let dry before using moisturizer and or sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I am 66 and often mistaken for under 60.  I have always tried to take good care of my skin and use high end products.  I use this every morning and every night after cleansing.  After 4 days I saw improvement!  I continue to see small improvements around my lips and eyes.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this great product.  I no longer have to juggle vitamin c and h acid products--this is all in one.  My sensitive skin is not bothered by this at all.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried several vitamin C serums and OZ Naturals is by far the best. It does not sting or feel greasy. My skin has never looked better!!</li>
    <li> I have used for 4 weeks. No change in my complexion. Product looks and feels like tap water.</li>
    <li> today i received my order on time and as described i will edit my review once my wife use it&lt;br /&gt;look to my photo uploaded for the order and packaging&lt;br /&gt;i will edit star rating after use&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
    <li> I was drawn to Oz Naturals for their organic and natural ingredients. I&#x27;m very happy to have placed this order for the Vitamin C Serum. It is so light, non greasy and absorbent. After reading all the great reviews, I couldn&#x27;t have made a wiser choice. Even though I just began this regimen, I already expect to be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> It is ok. Give shine to my skin .it does not help for wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best - in terms of both quality and value - skincare serums I&#x27;ve tried in over 15 years of skincare adventure. It feels completely fresh, natural and burden-free. I highly recommend this product to those who are serious about their own facial skincare.</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and decided to try the vitamin c serum as an addition to my skincare regime, I have found the product to be most effective in giving my skin the extra boost that it needs  to look radiant and healthy. I am very happy with the Lorressen Company in making these products available at an affordable price point for the many of us who live on fixed incomes. I also use the Vital Eyes Dark Circle Cream and  I will not be without it.  I am pleased that I have to search no more for these essential products and I will be trying other Loressen products as my skin matures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah from Connecticut</li>
    <li> Iove it, generous supply...super fast shipping...great follow up.from OZ  Naturals. Will happily order again, skin fills great, very soft and noticeable tightening.</li>
    <li> The consistency is easy to apply and it layers nicely among moisturizers, makeup and sunscreen. I left off a star based on price as it doesn&#x27;t even last me 2 months. I&#x27;m currently trying another brand with a bigger bottle and slightly cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I have oily sensitive skin. It&#x27;s prone to acne and breakouts, and has discoloration. I purchased this 4 days ago along with the Olay Pro-X Cleaning system and have used it approx. 7 times. I washed my face with my usual cleanser and applied the OZ Naturals. The results are remarkable. I can only imagine how my skin will look in a few more weeks. My tone is slowly becoming more even and my face feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum long enough to know how effective it is but I can say that the consistency and colour are right. It&#x27;s at a reasonable price as well, I&#x27;m not willing to pay $150 for a serum that can only be used for 2-3 months before it become useless. This one is moisturizing. In the future though, I think I might stick with CE Ferulic because it has worked very well for me in the past but I do think I&#x27;ll enjoy using this serum.</li>
    <li> i love this, i use it everyday 2 x a day right after my derma roller at night and before my sunscreen in the morning. its a good price, fast shipping and this will be a repurchase</li>
    <li> No adverse effects ,no miracles either</li>
    <li> Im loving this Serum! I started to see results after only a week of use. and the item arrived fast and properly wrapped with no damage, also the bottle was full to the top. Will buy more from same seller when i run out of it. 5*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews and took a chance, I have a very sensitive skin &amp; pro breakout &amp; have a lot of dark spots due to acne scars. One of my concerns, aging skin around my eyes. after 2-3 days of use followed by my moisturizer unbelievable! around my eyes, the line that&#x27;s been bothering me for quite a while is lessening &amp; the dark spots on my cheeks wow! start to lighten! I will never go without this ever!  I even want to purchase 2 more bottles just to make sure I have a stock. I love it! thank you this product is a miracle in a bottle! my friends saw me &amp; said you look blooming! that&#x27;s only 2-3 days of use. imagine a month or a year wow!&lt;br /&gt;this product is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum a month ago and have already noticed how much smoother and softer my skin feels. Usually by this time in the winter, (and this has been an exceptionally rough one) my skin would be extremely dry.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality serum which works well. The quality equals that of much more expensive products . And the personalized service is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love it..!!! Love it..!!! Love it..!!!&lt;br /&gt;I used to take care of my skin..!!&lt;br /&gt;This product really has good qualities it is really vitamin C and for my skin has been so nice..!! The best product that i have bought in all my entire live..!!! I am goig to order another one and if its tha sane as good as this one i think i am going to keep me using this for ever.!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT..!!! LOVE IT.  LOVE IT.  LOVE IT..!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking this Vitamin C serum.  Two drops spread beautifully for a light finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an oily T-zone problem and use the serum during the day without moisturizer.  My foundation stays put and I&#x27;m blotting the sheen much less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the results thus far, and will order again.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful experience and the product has been superb.  I feel like my skin is really responding to the product and while I have only been using the product two weeks, I feel the benefits are apparent and will only improve with time.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a thing. Didn&#x27;t feel like other Vit C serum at all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I originally gave this 4 stars but I Love the new formula!  I very much prefer it to the old one.  It&#x27;s very calming for my sensitive face.  The addition of the astaxanthin has been great for my skin!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I used this along with the hyaluronic acid serum. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and find the best results in using serums over lotions. Serum absorbs beautifully into my skin, makes it soft, and brighter. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have tried many vitamin C serums... this one is the only one I will buy from now on.  Great price, fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and so much cheaper than the department store brands.  It is now my go to product.  It is help to help some scars that I thought were permanent.</li>
    <li> I broke out using this product. I tried it alone and with the OX Hyaluronic Acid Serum, did not work for my face, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for yours, just not mine.</li>
    <li> Great serum and price. I&#x27;ve just started one month ago with drema roller, so will check back in for another review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as well as the hyaluronic acid, the toner, the upper and lower eye gel, cleanser, moisturizer and the body butter. I layer the products and I love them!  I even bought duplicate products for my man.  He&#x27;s 63, doesn&#x27;t need much facial enhancements but he now glows!  I&#x27;m now a committed fan for life.</li>
    <li> very good product .It is a face lift in a bottle !</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful serum! Apply on clean, dry skin and after a moisturizer/oils my skin is dewey and smooth.</li>
    <li> Returned it as soon as I found out that the ph was too high which is definitely not good for your skin. I think the people who reviewed this are either just following the hype or only seeing short term results because high ph can seriously damage your skin. I did a lot of research on vitamin c, which is a highly unstable compound and you can only reap it&#x27;s full benefits if the ph matches closer to your natural skin&#x27;s ph (5). Otherwise it will create an imbalance in your skin and will cause bad reactions.. such as infections, inflammation, redness, acne.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t &#x27;t believe that I got a personal email from Oz Naturals to make sure I got the product and instructions on exactly how to use the product. There are lots of good products out there but personal customer service is rare. This vitamin C is a great product and the customer service is superb.  Why would I buy from anyone else ????</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I have been using it for almost 2 months now and I definitely notice a difference. I had hyperpigmentation after my last pregnancy and this has significantly lightened my dark spots and made my skin appear healthy and glowing. The company is great also and emailed me with directions on how to use the product and how to contact them. This product does not dry out my skin or make it too oily. My skin tone is amazing! Thank you! I definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s way better than all the expensive products out there!</li>
    <li> Love love this product!</li>
    <li> i tried cus my sister loves it but didn&#x27;t work on my skin....skin became so dry that i looked like a zombie! will give it to my sister!</li>
    <li> This is the first Vitamin C serum that I have tried.  I&#x27;ve been using the whole line of OZ Naturals face products for the past 3 months and have noticed generally a more even skin tone and reduced blackheads.  I won&#x27;t say there has been a drastic transformation but my skin does look healthy.  This bottle has lasted me 3 months and counting so I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the value.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel filmy and tight, and not tight in a good way. Worst feeling serum I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used plenty. Serums should be a delivery system for a powerhouse of ingredients: age-fighters and antioxidants. They should also help hold moisture in. This serum feels so awful that even if its effects were awesome as far as anti-aging, I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the horrible way it made my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Good products, great service!</li>
    <li> Great for natural vital c serum with no carcinogens as most have dyes in them. Not as skin lightening as some. An doesn&#x27;t lock moisture in any better than just using moisturizer alone, but it&#x27;s good for gradual skin care and maintenance. Doesn&#x27;t break sensitive skin out or leave a sticky film.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! Do not be fooled! Used this serum and it gave me the worst outbreak I have ever had in my life. I am 30 years old and I have always had nice skin and have never been prone to acne, however after using this stuff my skin developed a terrible rash with dozens of tiny white pimples on my cheeks and forehead. It made my skin feel leathery and made my forehead wrinkles more pronounced. Worst purchase ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a year.  Definite improvement of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin c I put it on my face and use my face cream and no one would guess my age..</li>
    <li> This stuffs is the best!!! It WORKS!!! It has made my skin look 100% better in tone &amp; has gotten rid of some brown spots that I had, I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> Only been using for about a week but so far I really love it. Im using it in conjunction with a Derma Roller which I also just started. After I roll my face I add this to my face, let dry then add moisturizer.  I have an immediate tightening feeling and softness. I will revise my rate and comment after longer use.</li>
    <li> I brought for my mother, she loves it. My only concern is that the hyaluronic acid may damage her eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin so nice and soft. After 2 weeks I see a visible reduction in fine lines. It isn&#x27;t too harsh or irratable to my skin. I use it only in the morning after I bath.</li>
    <li> Not sure of results yet ....just started using...need 3 months to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle came as expected and was packed well ....no leaks.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has certainly changed the texture of my skin -- so nice and soft now.  Also, minimizes the fine lines around the eyes. Product arrived quickly and was well packaged.  I will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> So far it looks great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I can definitely tell a difference in the appearance of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This serum did nothing. I used it regularly and faithfully for a month and did not see any improvement whatsoever. If I could have given a Zero rating, I would have.</li>
    <li> This serum isn&#x27;t drying like other Vitamin C serums (gotta love hyaluronic acid); it has really made my skin look a lot healthier. I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many Vitamin C serums in the past. This one is awesome! It&#x27;s not too watery, not too oily, feels moisturizing, and it&#x27;s not drying. I just re-ordered my 3rd bottle. I am SO picky about what I put on my skin! This really makes your skin feel baby-soft, fades dark spots, and makes your skin glow! You&#x27;ll notice a difference the first time you use it, but in about week 2 (and beyond), you&#x27;ll really see a change in your skin. It will look and feel young and healthy, dewey and very clear. Lines faded, and youthful again. It definitely does not cause break-outs, in fact, it helps my skin heal faster. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this serum for a few weeks but have already noticed such a difference in my skin.  I will definitely reorder when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Vit C serum . I used to add Vit c to my serums , not anymore . This is great for antiaging . I love it and the Hylaronic acid serum too .</li>
    <li> I use this after cleansing my face and neck...it helps rejuvenate your skin and I use it along with the roller derm.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this particular product because of the sales price and excellent recommendations. I gave this product only 4 stars because I have only been using this product for about a week; however, it already seems to have made a difference in the firmness of my facial skin.  The &#x27;puppet&#x27; lines around my mouth do not seem as prominent.  If I continue to see positive results, I will purchase again....and hope the price remains the same.</li>
    <li> I hate to say it but Oz products does not work for me. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum hoping to enjoy brighter skin as a result.  It arrived super quickly (as with almost all of my Prime products), and I received a confirmation from OZ Naturals detailing the product and how to use it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed incredibly dramatic results, but my skin definitely seems brighter and, in pictures at least, the dark circles under my eyes have been reduced.  I have very acne prone skin but have not had any problems with this serum, and I have been using it twice a day since I received it.  I always follow with a moisturizer (once the serum has dried), including a pretty heavy-duty moisturizer at night.  All in all it is a good product and I am enjoying nicer skin as a result.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time and I love it! I used it on my face and neck area...my skin looks smooth and radiant...I am going to order another bottle right now since I am getting close to the end of the first one.....I am even using it on a new scar and it looks wonderful! I definitely recommend this to everyone that wants their face to look great!</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review in the past, but I have used the whole bottle and I did&lt;br /&gt;not see any difference.  I got this because I saw so many wonderful reviews,&lt;br /&gt;but, it has not done a thing for me - waste of money.</li>
    <li> It is the best serum I have used. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I noticed a reduction in the wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 45 days and I can see my skin is getting brighter and my dark spots have diminished quite a bit. I even think it is tightening the skin in my jaw line and neck.  Will keep using it to see even more results. :)</li>
    <li> This serum is pretty amazing. Go in into my pores really quick. Love it!</li>
    <li> Item just as described.  Will shop here again.  Works great... and great price.</li>
    <li> After using it for a week, I started to notice dark shades above my lips, on my forehead, and on my cheeks.  Saw a dermatologist  and I was told I now have &amp;#34;Melasma&amp;#34;  One year later and I am still trying to come of with a cure.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice product. Definitely does something.</li>
    <li> Bought this in hopes of it helping remove dark spots and control acne. This had so many good reviews that I thought it would be an amazing product...Well how wrong could I have been? I broke out the next day after using this, at first I thought maybe it was because I was stressed so I continued to use the product. My skin kept getting worse to the point that I had six CYSTIC pimples on the left side of my face and eight CYSTIC pimples of the right side of my face. This product clogged my pores so bad that it literally hurt to touch my face and it took two weeks just for it not to hurt to touch my own face. Whatever you do not buy this product, it will do nothing for you. Also half of these positive reviews are because the customers recieved the product free for a good review.</li>
    <li> Same with this no difference ,will try a little longer this is 2nd month...update... !! saw no difference and I believe I gave it a good chance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but not as drastic of an improvement I expected from all the advertising.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, but my face loves this product. I was skeptical at first, but soon after I started using it I could see the difference with my skin. It became noticeably smoother. A small amount goes a long way. I used a couple of drops every morning and night after my moisturizing toner and the bottle lasted me approximately 5 months. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I finished one bottle and was happy with the serum.  I ordered a second bottle a few weeks ago and the formula was changed.  It was previously thin and absorbed into my skin very well.  Now the new one is thick and dries sticky.  Not the same product at all and do not like the new one.  Will look for another brand.</li>
    <li> I received the product in the time promised.  So far I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  My skin is firmer, brighter, and smoother.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and and goes on very nicely.</li>
    <li> This new formula is awful! the old formula was amazing; evened out skin texture, got rid of blemishes, minimized wrinkles, brightened skin tone. This stuff is crap. Bring back the old formula!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the third time because I loved the results! However, Oz changed the formula of the product and it is now extremely sticky and has an awful smell. Initially, I thought I&#x27;d try to stick with it to see if maybe they changed the formula for a reason. But after a few days, I could not stand the smell. If they bring back the original product, I might purchase it again. But the fact that they changed the product in the first place makes me hesitant.</li>
    <li> I am pretty devoted to this serum now. It&#x27;s the first serum I&#x27;ve ever tried and it really makes my skin look more healthy and alive without irritating or making it greasy. I think it supports whatever you&#x27;re doing with a retinoid, too, and helps keep from over-drying.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this. I have dry skin and this really helps. Highly recommend it. Works better than the brand Serums I purchased for twice as much money!</li>
    <li> I loved this product.....have seen an improvement in this mature skin of mine.</li>
    <li> Received as promised Just waiting for results Now I will have to wait and see if it actually helps my skin</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. I notice a difference as do others. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product no negative reactions on my skin that is sensitive. I have not used it long enough to give it a full review but it arrived very quickly which I appreciate because I travel allot and needed the serum to take with me.  I also got a follow up email with the instruction of the product, very practical for a gal on the road. Absolute pleasure to doing business with this company and would recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum.  I have been using it now for about a couple of months and have reordered my second bottle.  It has helped soften my fine lines and give me a more even complexion.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The skin absorbs the serum like a sponge and the skins healthy glow and appearance is noticeable after only a few applications.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it to help keep my skin clear and it does that. It also makes my skin fresher looking.</li>
    <li> I saw immediate results with this, much more so than any other C serum I&#x27;ve tried.  Even got positive comments from my doctor.</li>
    <li> This is lovely stuff!  It absorbs nicely and it really makes my skin look fresh.  I do tend to suffer break-outs, but have had no problems with this product at all.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now and bought one for my daughter too last time, she also loves it.</li>
    <li> This might be my second review..not sure but this product is amazing.  I have tried many different products; from moisturizers that sell at drugstore chains to La Mer at Nordstrom.  To be honest I love La Mer but is isn&#x27;t affordable for most of us.  I certainly can&#x27;t afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Vitamin C Serum every day (sometimes twice but think I&#x27;m only supposed to use once).  I then put a moisturizer over it (whatever I happen to have on hand).  The results have been AMAZING. From day one, I noticed a huge difference.  My face looks so much more youthful.  I am 57 years old and have suffered with many health challenges and am on medications.  This all takes a toll on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting compliments all the time and even the occasional double take from men!!!  I thought those days were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lasted me longer than 30 days, not sure how long but it is very much worth the price which I think is very reasonable, especially for the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  After you put it on your face, I wipe the leftover product from my fingers or dropper on the top of my hands and they look SO much better.</li>
    <li> I like that the serum comes in a dark glass bottle. It feels good when applied, absorbs fast, it&#x27;s light. However, I didn&#x27;t like that it came wrapped only in  bubble plastic. I can&#x27;t tell if it was open prior to shipping or not, since it didn&#x27;t have any sealing. That is the only reason I will not reorder it.</li>
    <li> Just like another reviewer, I&#x27;ve also replaced Perricone&#x27;s very expensive vitamin C with Oz Naturals. I love that it includes E and hyaluronic acid. It really takes 6 months to see the most results from any skin care product, but so far..so good!</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to rate either product.  You would have to use it awhile to see results.  It would not be fair to review it until you had used it at least 6 weeks.  I don&#x27;t know about the rating yet to know if I like it or not.  I would be glad to review it after using the product for 6 weeks or more.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with both the product and the company! I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin. Ill be ordering this product again</li>
    <li> I just love your product ~ Best Vitamin C Serum for your face ~ I really can see a very noticeable change in my complexion and others have asked what I have done...and I tell them it is the new serum!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased your other Vit. C serum and use it on my hands and neck/chest were I can see a visible change for the good.  I am 56 years old and always went to the beach all summer long and I know that your Vit. C serum is helping the look of my skin look softer and younger!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL be re-ordering both serums when needed...&lt;br /&gt;Thankx...&lt;br /&gt;Zyla</li>
    <li> I love my Best Vitamin C. Serum For Your Face.  Every morning I warm my skin with very warm water as I wash it every morning, pat it dry, and immediately apply this serum.  The warm water opens up your pores and helps this wonderful product to absorb more deeply.  After a few minutes I use a moisturizer over it.  I already see results, but reports are that maximum results can be achieved after 6 months.  Similar products cost &amp;#34;a fortune&amp;#34; but the ingredients are the same, so why pay for fancy packaging.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a month,haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin. I heard you would start to notice results in as little as 2 weeks,with max results at 6-12months. For fine lines and wrinkles as well as hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I wish these companies would seal their products. This is the second company I have purchased from that isn&#x27;t sealed shut.&lt;br /&gt;I have just started using it so I can&#x27;t give you any rave reviews just yet....</li>
    <li> after using this Serum, I noticed difference with in a week time.  I am going to suggest to my friends</li>
    <li> I just started using this product in the evenings and like it so far. I really like the customer service with the emails to explain how to use the product and the ability to ask any questions.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any improvement in my skin...I think this is a waste if money. What I have been using that I have seen a real noticeable improvement is borga oil. I get the gel caplets and cut them open and put the oil on my face. No break out and my wrinkles seem less...</li>
    <li> My skin looked good right after putting it on. It was glowing and looked young. But I had a lot of breakouts from using this product. And I don&#x27;t get breakouts. Not even as a teenager.</li>
    <li> Awesome serum! Skin feels so good after using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two weeks and believe it has been very helpful...will know better in another couple of weeks.  Not giving up on the product.</li>
    <li> so far so good. It sinks right in and feels great. Will update as I use it more.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing. Makes my skin feels smooth and gives it a nice healthy glow. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love the serum! It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s &amp; my skin is doing much better, brighter &amp; clearer, with this product than a much more expensive product&lt;br /&gt; I bought for years at a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> After using this for 2 weeks, my husband asked me what I was doing for my skin because my face looked so much younger.  I knew then that the product was amazing.  I thought it was working well, but that really cemented it.</li>
    <li> It does help the skin.</li>
    <li> OK so I don&#x27;t believe all the hype Dr Oz puts out. In fact, I think 99% of his stuff is BS. This stuff however is effective and we can definitely see a difference.  Update: My wife really likes this product and we have been a loyal customer. After receiving our last order my wife noticed the oil was more like water than oil and did not have the same feeling on her skin. I contacted OZ Naturals to no effect. They have no quality control over their product and are not responsive to customer complaints. I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and can already tell a huge difference in my fine and deep wrinkles! I&#x27;m ordering more right now. I do use a moisturizer after it dries, usually takes a minute or so. Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I was utterly amazed by this product. I&#x27;ve used many extremely expensive skincare products over the years and bought this based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I thought for this price, if it isn&#x27;t great, I didn&#x27;t break the bank. But, it IS great -- my skin&#x27;s brightness improved significantly with the very first use. I am not a youngster so I was all that more pleased by the visible results. I need to order this in bulk.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum makes your skin feel smooth.  It adds  clarity and reduces  fine lines .  I  will  definitely  buy  it  again!</li>
    <li> Its important take care of your self no matter what age&lt;br /&gt; Take care of your body and face feel good look good&lt;br /&gt; Our body accumulates poisons and toxins and this product help</li>
    <li> Great anti-aging product! Vitamins included are great in regards towards targeting aging skin, fine lines, wrinkles, crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I provided a mini review of this product which you can view on the following link:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I have been using this vitamin C serum for about 2 weeks now and am seeing a significant difference in the texture and glow of my skin. I am very excited to see how the next few weeks go and considering the very affordable price of this serum compared to some that cost five times as much I feel I&#x27;m getting more than my money&#x27;s worth. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a week and I could see the difference on my face.  My skin is glowing if that makes sense, softer, and starting to help with the dark circles. I had really bad peeling near my eyebrows and would leave red marks and in a week that has gone away.  I apply also the St. Ives moisturizer afterwards and its a perfect combination.  My freckles or spots are not gone but i can see a small difference.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is ok but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  The price was good and it was shipped quickly but I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Daily, I use many kind of skin care cosme. Especially, I care to choose serum and essenes. It is very simply to be absorbed into face. After I use it, my skin is smooth and the pore is smaller than before.</li>
    <li> This product does not leave your face feeling dried out.Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives most serums these days have.would recommend</li>
    <li> Have been using for months. I am really seeing a difference in my skins texture and brightness.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to try this product cause I have never tried anything like this before. The packaging is very nice. It comes in a glass bottle with a glass syringe type of deal. I have used this product for a week now and within the first use I noticed that it is not oily nor does it leave any residue which is very nice and sinks into the skin very well. I notice within the first use that it does leave the skin glowing healthily and leaves it very soft. Now I have noticed my chin is breaking out more then usual right now but I am not sure if this product is the reason for this breakout or another new product that I am currently trying at the moment. When I first started using it I did not break out so I think I will stop the use of the other product and use this on its own and then update next week if I notice a difference or not but so far I really am enjoying this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week and I really like it. I was using another  brand of Vitamin C serum for about 2 years that was 2x the price of this one and was less concentrate so I figured it was time for a switch up. The only difference I see so far is that the consistency of this is kind of watery compared to my other one, but I like that because 1.) I think it will last a LOT longer and 2.) it absorbs info the skin SO fast and its not sticky or anything. I will continue to buy this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  first serum I use and don&#x27;t plan to change. it has help my breakouts and seem to keep my skin looking great. the liquid is nice. not too thick or runny.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few Vitamin C serums in the past few months and some have irritated my sensitive skin. This one has not irritated me and even though I have some redness or flushing right after application, it soon subsides and my skin is becoming more even toned. Of all I have tried I like this one best. If it keeps working I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times before. The last two bottles were quite thin and watery in consistency. I&#x27;m quite disappointed. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the product but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll reorder. I thought maybe the first bottle was a bad batch, but the second bottle was the same. It used to be of a thicker consistency.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing.  I used it faithfully for about 8 weeks. It seemed like I was putting water on my face.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and I saw improvement in a few dark spots. My skin tone looks more even and a bit smoother. I bought another bottle just to see if it keeps improving. So far I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, can definitely see an improvement in my skin!</li>
    <li> Another reviewer entitled their review &amp;#34;best serum tried so far&amp;#34; and I completely agree.  There are a lot of VIT C serums on the market today some quite pricey.  Oz naturals offers a great serum at a good price and with the added ferulic acid (keeps it fresh) and the plus of VIT E as well. Packaged correctly in amber glass (light deteriorates VIT C quickly) with dropper that gives you controll over the amount used. And it&#x27;s made in the US! Sorry China.</li>
    <li> I want my money back! After reading all the positive reviews, which I am sure are fake I used this religiously only to see no difference or if you say finding my skin to be breaking out yes, that would be a clear visible difference and I do not even have acne prone skin. No improvement in skin texture or lines or marks or anything at all. Don&#x27;t fall for the trap girls.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum and excellent value.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your face.  I like the blend of the vitamin c with the other ingredients.  This one even has some vitamin E included in it</li>
    <li> So far it does seem to help with moisturizing - no miracles but skin does feel better.  Know it should help deliver moisturizer but don&#x27;t know if adding layer vitamin e oil  is helpful in lieu of a regular mositurizer.  Plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This has vitamin E in it... I think I might be allergic to vitamin E.. wish it&#x27;s more clear in the title</li>
    <li> This is like putting paint thinner on your face. If you really want the best Vitamin C Serum out there use Mad Hippie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. It had made my skin improve dramatically, feels and smells wonderful as well. Pay the extra money for the Mad Hippie.</li>
    <li> Does not help hyperpigmentation on black skin!</li>
    <li> I really like it and will purchase it again! The serum is very light and doesn&#x27;t sit heavy on your skin!</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and you definitely see results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24, and I just recently started taking care of my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C serum for 5 days now, and I can already see a difference. My skin feels so soft to the touch after applying this serum. Now, after looking in the mirror, I can barely see the fine lines that used to be slightly visible on my forehead, right below my hairline. I also noticed some discoloration/dark spots cleared up. And my skin feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people in the reviews mentioned that this serum was drying, but I didn&#x27;t find it particularly drying at all (though this might be due to my combination skin). I use this serum with the OZ Naturals toner and an eye gel (another brand) for my dark circles, applying twice per day - once in the morning after my shower and again at night before bed. I&#x27;ve also started exfoliating once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with this serum. I even received compliments about my skin. This serum just leaves my face physically softer and visibly smoother with a more even tone. I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another bottle once this one runs out!</li>
    <li> works well, love the way it feels on my skin</li>
    <li> Like a lot of people, I have tried every product available without a Rx.  In my experience this serum has bee very positive.  Deeper wrinkles between my eyes have softened as well as crows feet.  I am in a very cold climate and have not experienced dryness of any sort.  I will continue to use this serum to see if the benefit gets better and better.  The shopping experience was wonderful.  Emails from the company giving detailed instructions was a great plus.  I would recommend this product without hesitation.  I am 49 with minor to moderate fines lines/ wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Made my skin extremely dry , I tried to use only 3-4 times a week but still made it dry :(</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it in place of toner</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and see a difference already . I will order this again</li>
    <li> I rated this product a number 2 because of what it says when you put the curser over the star.  Hate is a strong word and I don&#x27;t want to throw it around lightly.  I dislike this product and don&#x27;t believe in it.  I&#x27;ve wanted to try a Vitamin C serum for sometime now.  I&#x27;ve used up the bottle and no matter how hard I look I can&#x27;t see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do my research and bought this product because there are so many reviews.  I didn&#x27;t read a far enough to realize all the reviews were submitted over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading more of the reviews and then the questions (Q&amp;A) that were answered.  When I got to the questions asking if there was a company, why couldn&#x27;t I find your website, and how could they get &amp;#34;774&amp;#34; reviews in 2013.  BIG RED FLAG.  The answer to the question about the website - they were working on a website, but why would you create on a website after over 774 reviews????  Wouldn&#x27;t you create a website to promote your product?  I looked at the website, but I don&#x27;t think there was much information backing their 3 productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wondering about the section of their ad telling us to beware of low grade products out there.  I&#x27;ve have over 20 years experience in sales, so this caught my eye.  I&#x27;ve closed a lot of sales/deals over the years honestly and ethically, so I know how it works.  But as they said in their own ad, there are dishonest people flooding the market with poor quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going over this again:&lt;br /&gt;1. A company only one year old, or is there a company?  Read the Q&amp;A section.&lt;br /&gt;2. Between 774 reviews in 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copied and pasted number &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; from their ad warning that there are poor quality products flooding the market.  Could this be a scare or let&#x27;s manipulate the customer into buying our product?&lt;br /&gt;3. Beware of Generic Or Cheap Vitamin C Serum Here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;  There has been a large quantity of low quality Vitamin C serums flooding the market&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals Vitamin C+E Serum Is A Highly Potent Anti Aging Serum That Will Give You&lt;br /&gt;  Dramatic Results &amp; Help Your Skin Look &amp; Feel 10 Years Younger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I copied and pasted number 4&lt;br /&gt;4. Very Important...Read This:&lt;br /&gt;  We Apologize If We&#x27;re Sold Out. Because Of The Extremely High Demand For Our&lt;br /&gt;  Vitamin C Serum, We Tend To Run Out Of Inventory Fast.&lt;br /&gt;  Order Your Bottle Of OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum Now While It&#x27;s Still In Stock!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t number 4 remind you of some commercials we&#x27;ve seen on TV?  This a common sales tactic to get people to hurry and buy because so many people are buying and we don&#x27;t want to miss out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to say about this information.  Everyone has a right to make up their own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review in the hopes some will find it helpful in the purchases they make.  I&#x27;ve wondered about some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read online with several products, as there are so many sometimes that they sound like random computer generated reviews.  Reviews are meant to be a helpful tool for consumers and companies to promote their products, but I think there are a lot of reviews that have been made up as a sales tactic.  I encourage everyone to be proactive once they find suspicious product claim or review.  Write a review to alert customers of what you&#x27;ve found, so they can make an informed decision. Team work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading this, and I hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but unfortunately,  this product arrived and over a third of the bottle had leaked out, I went ahead and opened it to use and the dropper leaks, product pours out of it and seems pretty watery.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any real results, going back to Skinceuticals Phloretin CF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company offered to refund me $8.00 rather than sending out a new bottle - I thought that was a rather feeble attempt at customer service.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and Oz Naturals vitamin C serum didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it is 72% organic because I don&#x27;t need or want a bunch of chemicals on my skin. I use this product on my face, neck, and back. I use this serum to brighten up my skin and to help with acne. After using this serum my skin appears brighter and it does seem to be helping with my acne. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this serum when applying it to your skin. It absorbs easy and fast into your skin. Also it leaves my skin so soft like my skin is a fluffy cloud. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily or greasy. It has a very light scent in the bottle and when I apply it to my skin I can&#x27;t smell it. Overall I really love this vitamin C serum because it works and leaves my skin very soft. I was able to get this serum for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> Love this and will reorder later</li>
    <li> Arived on time. I have only been using the product for a few days now and I love it! It makes my skin very soft and smooth. Very pleased</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old guy, and this stuff works.  I just started getting a couple darker areas on my face from years in the sun without sunscreen, and after a couple weeks they began to fade.  My wife also noticed and said I really do look younger.  Pretty amazing for such an inexpensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get a free sample to write a review, and I am not a paid Amazon reviewer (they are ruining this site in my opinion).  I&#x27;m a real guy who bought this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum a week and I can already see results! I&#x27;m glowing and people have commenting on how smooth and silky my face looks. It&#x27;s helping diminish my acne scars also!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome after derma rolling</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this serum. Once it&#x27;s rubbed in you cant feel any residue. Didn&#x27;t cause irritation or burn. Dark spots definitely lightened.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product twice now and when I first started using it, I liked how fast it absorbed into my skin. I read more reviews and other buyers had mentioned better results using in conjunction with micro needling. I started researching and bought a needling kit. I have to admit, that I do see a change in my skin. My skin is sensitive and therefore only apply it after my micro needling session (about reive a week.) my skin seems to be tolerating it and will continue. I have prime and am glad to receive this product quickly. I will buy again as it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this! It brightens my skin up so much and I can really tell on the mornings I haven&#x27;t used it. I used the Body Shop capsules before but I prefer this and it&#x27;s less fiddly to use. Wanna try their retinol next.</li>
    <li> love this stuff...will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I started using this 3 days ago and my face now is uneven :( with patches, I don&#x27;t know what to do, if keep using it and it will fix the ha or jus stop and go to a dermatologist :( please advice!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good but it makes the skin so dry</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
    <li> i noticed my skin became so glow after i used half bottle</li>
    <li> My skin is very smooth and shiny :) giving me glowing skin :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks in combination with AzureNaturals Ultimate Retinol Lime Infused Organic Moisturizer after washing my face with Cetaphil and have finally found a skincare regimen that works! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and the dark spots from old acne have faded considerably and are almost gone. My skin tone is evening out too, and my skin is not left feeling greasy or oily at all. I have noticed though, that my skin feels dried out if I don&#x27;t use my moisturizer after the serum. I absolutely love this product and will definitely be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> After a month of use, I did not notice any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  The serum is really thin, I&#x27;ve used other vitamin C serums before &amp; they seem a bit more thicker than this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the vitamin C serum, it really did help my skin! I highly recommend all the OZ Naturals products, it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my skin.</li>
    <li> As a guy, I&#x27;m not particularly trusting of skincare products with steep claims like this since many don&#x27;t seem to work on my skin. I spent a lot of time in the sun during my teen years and completely overdid it in the tanning bed in my early twenties. Combine that with a decade of smoking and you&#x27;ve got a combination for early aging. I figured I would try OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum after a coworker raved about it to me. Not one to usually spend more than $20 on a skincare product, I was weary of the efficacy of the product, but noticed relatively quickly that it was working. Those claiming that it is drying must not know about how the various ingredients interact with your skin. For example, I did enough research on this product prior to purchasing (I told you I&#x27;m weary of skincare products) that I knew well and good that the hyaluronic acid in it would dry out your face if you didn&#x27;t apply moisturizer after it. As somebody with some early onset fine lines and wrinkles, as well as some hyper pigmentation from not treating my skin right earlier on, I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results. My fine lines and wrinkles have diminished a bit after my first month. They&#x27;re not completely gone and I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;ll be erased by this product, but they&#x27;re certainly better and I imagine will continue to get better with more and more use. My skin is certainly brighter and my complexion has begun to even out. Again, I&#x27;m sure that will continue to get better with continued use. I read an article about whether or not C serums actually work and it noted that they do work, quite well actually, but you need to continue using them regularly for 3+ months to truly see the results you&#x27;ve heard about. So, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing and keep using because the results I&#x27;ve seen so far are more than enough of a reason to keep this train rolling. I was so impressed with the serum that I went back and bought the Super Youth Moisturizer and the Retinol Serum. I&#x27;ll review those once I feel I canadequately provide feedback, but for now, I&#x27;m confident with rating the C serum 5 stars and giving it a very strong recommendation. So many other products claim to have results and never deliver anything, but this one has and I&#x27;ll be sticking with it. Also, you gotta feel good getting products from a company so committed to being animal cruelty free and making their products as organic as possible. This guy is a fan.</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews are fake. This did nothing for my skin and I have used it for more than three months.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really see any improvement yet, maybe too early.</li>
    <li> regular purchase...love this serum!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several vitamin c serums and I really like this one so far. I would order it again and recommend it to others. The price is excellent too.</li>
    <li> Very good product, impresive customer service. After one day the serum arrived I got this mail from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I just wanted to provide you with the directions for use and ingredients of our Vitamin C serum that you purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of your serum, please read the below carefully and keep this email as a reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;20% Strength Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> I have used this product for over a month and I had friends ask what was different as my skin was \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. I have extremely dry skin and I live in Minnesota where the weather is tough on dry skin. This product allows your skin to soak up your moisturizer and decrease fine lines and dark spots. I just ordered another bottle!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m really enjoying it so far.  I have never used a face serum before but decided to give this product a try after reading the excellent reviews &amp; because it&#x27;s so affordable.  I was looking for a product that would brighten my sometimes dull skin tone, and something that would soften fine lines &amp; help to even out my skin tone.  So far I am very pleased with the way this product feels on my skin.  It seems to have made my skin noticeably softer and I believe the skin tone is brighter &amp; more even.  I know it will take at least a month or longer of continued use to really see results but I am very pleased with this product after only 3 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about three weeks now and it has made my skin somewhat smoother however, nothing remarkable. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed as I thought I would see more noticeable results. I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time before I decide whether or not it&#x27;s of any benefit. For now, just OK.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. I have been using for about 4 days and my skin already feels a lot softer.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results over time.  thanks!</li>
    <li> I love the Cellex C product, but not the price. To me, this is just as good and way easier on my wallet. Be sure to use it first, before any other product, and if possible, wait 10-20 minutes before applying anything else. But sometimes I can only wait until it dries and then I have to apply tinted moisturizer. Still works great. I find I don&#x27;t have to use an additional moisturizer with it if I am using it at night or just hanging around the house.</li>
    <li> Just received Serum recently. Can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of product just yet. Will be happy to do so after I use it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a well made face serum with vitamins C and E for a long long time. It&#x27;s hard to find one that worked well with my skin. I&#x27;ve been using OZ serum for the past 2 weeks and I gotta say, it&#x27;s amazing. From day 1 I could feel a difference. My skin felt instantly softer! I&#x27;ve always used to use Clinique and Lancôme face skin are products, but recently decided that I should try something new!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read great things about this serum, and it has really high ratings on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable vitamin serum, definitely consider this!</li>
    <li> Mines was sealed. I love this serum. I am just starting but for my combination skin its wonderful. I will update later on results.</li>
    <li> Unlike vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s mild and easy on the skin...I am not sure i will purchase it again after the current one gets used</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does more than most expensive fact products do.  I will be using this every morning from now on.</li>
    <li> I am using it for just couple of weeks and I like it. Great for winter time. Use good facial moisturizer after using this Serum otherwise you will feel like constricted.</li>
    <li> I can see why this has soooo many amazing reviews. I think this product is absolutely fantastic. It is the perfect consistency and does what it says. will buy again</li>
    <li> We had our doubts but this product does wonders, almost overnight!</li>
    <li> goes on smoothly.....i think it is working great!  my skin definitely looks good and i think my forehead wrinkle is less noticeable.  will continue using.  a big plus....the &amp;#34;sun bumps&amp;#34; on my chest area, that i always have, are gone.  coincidence?  i don&#x27;t know but i&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for two weeks now and see no difference!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, I am 50 years old and I see the difference in my skin. I definitely will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have used the serum for couple of weeks now .I do not see any visible changes in my skin other than the fact that skin feels tight right after putting this serum and gives you a feeling of youthfulness. I am still using the product as I do not see any ill effects either .&lt;br /&gt;My skin is naturally good and does not have many fine lines so I should have seen the filling effect if it is working on people who are 50+&lt;br /&gt;Giving it two starts as I don&#x27;t see the miracles people are talking about but will continue using it to see how the long term use effects</li>
    <li> Have definitively seen an improvement in my (sun damaged) face.  Skin is not as dry as it normally gets.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in the texture and skin tone of my face. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I like the way you can target a specific area with the dropper</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of OZ Naturals, and I simply enjoy the feel of it. It&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this serum. Not too watery. It also has vitamin E which is great combined with vitamin C! I have only used it one week, so it&#x27;s too early to say What the final results will be. I use AHA serum at night and this serum in the morning under my SPF lotion. My skin feels very soft and looks nice and bright!</li>
    <li> This is my first order.  Unlike other C serum, this one doesn&#x27;t need to be hidden from light, and doesn&#x27;t smell or sting.  I use it under Life Cell(good stuff). The combination of these two products is working very well for me.  Very happy. Definitely will reorder.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2.5 weeks and can already see a difference in the lines around my mouth. Those were the most visible to me. The laugh lines around my eyes have also diminished. I use this in the morning and evening and use moisturizer on top.</li>
    <li> The service was quick, the reviews were phenomenal, and the serum is clear which is indicative of &#x27;fresh&#x27; v c. They also followed up with me to ensure I received it--great customer service. As for the benefits, time will tell!</li>
    <li> A surprise in this age when people are not so kind or considerate. The Oz naturals answered my questions in detail, gave immediate service, the product is all they touted and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use , does burn a little if your skin is dry but over all a great product</li>
    <li> Hmm not as good as previous serums as I can&#x27;t feel the tingles/plumpness and I don&#x27;t feel my skin is an amazing looking as before. Still will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Little did I know that I am allergic to something in this Serum&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Such a noticeable difference in only a few days!</li>
    <li> I love all the other products in the OZ Naturals line but honestly this just feels like I&#x27;m putting water on my face. I prefer the Ole Henriksen Vitamin C Serum. But will keep using the rest of the OZ Naturels line.</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals, Professional Anti Aging Serum, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this but I really do. It has given my skin a nice new glow. I have been using it for about a week and it now part of my permanent skin care routine. I have a few small blemish scars on my chin and over the last week I have seen them start to fade. I also have a fine lines that have started to fade. I was never afraid of laugh lines, I always felt that they just meant I was happy. Unfortunately I got stuck with a slight frown line on my forehead instead, thanks to my last marriage. This Anti Aging Serum has really helped to smooth that line and I am so glad. Someday I may still have those laugh lines but with this it may be a long time.&lt;br /&gt;  My skin feels much softer. It is just under $23.00 for a 1 oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Scent, it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong scent.&lt;br /&gt;  Texture, not oily, it absorbs smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;  Brightens skin for a youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;  Fades dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;  Evens out skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to Use&lt;br /&gt;  Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;  100% vegan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dropper, I wish it was in a cream or something easier to apply.</li>
    <li> This serum is very potent, with 20% vitamin C and 11% hyaluronic acid, along with other mostly botanical ingredients that are beneficial to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fluid is almost clear and has a sweet fragrance with notes of citrus and spice.  It is slightly viscous, which makes it easy to apply.  The amber glass bottle protects it from the light and has a dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops massaged into the skin after a bath or shower immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated.  Use a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum refreshes skin by removing dead cells and by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles when used regularly.  It also seems to minimize the appearance of facial pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not an instant cure, but there are many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by ultraviolet radiation when used for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided serum for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe), sodium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel), d-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin D), carbomer, (2S)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid, ferulic acid, kosher vegetable glycerin, organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba oil), phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglyceri</li>
    <li> I love how soft it makes my face feel.  I have just been using it for the last couple of weeks.  I look forward to what it will do by the end of the month.</li>
    <li> I hsve now finished the whole 100 mil retinol moisturizing cream and qnd sow very little difference on my skin. Any other moisturizing cream would do the same! . Does it really contain 2.5% retinol? !</li>
    <li> Ordered along with several additional products the first month including the Retinol, the cleanser, and the facial moisturizer.  The second time around I ordered just the vitamin C.  It dries sticky and hard, and leaves a shiny film that crinkles my wrinkles.  It does blend in (or go away?) after adding a moisturizer, but even then it still feels sticky.  Using with the seaweed moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum is working very well on my face. It goes on smooth and is not overpowering at all. My skin soaks it in and is ready for the next moisturizer I apply. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> It dosen&#x27;t work for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I always apply Oz Naturals on a clean skin and 1 minute later I can feel that it&#x27;s already start working, leaving my face with a smooth and younger looking skin. Skin looks radiant and definitely younger.  The wrinkles around my eyes diminished significantly after only one week and the the expression lines too.</li>
    <li> This is my first time that I used this, I must say this is a magic serum, I have been using this from past one month, the results are amazing. I applied it the way it said on the label, I apply it twice daily on all my face, I only use small amount, little does a lot for this serum, immediately after it dries, I apply any moisturizer on hand, you will notice the difference too, grab yourself one too, I can assure you no one will end up disappointed. It wil leave your skin glowing, fair, and plump. Guys give it a try!</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing!  I have really before more conscious of my skin now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. I have received many compliments on my youthful look. I have reordered this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love it and its amazing! I was skeptical, but it quickly proved me wrong!</li>
    <li> It feels as though I&#x27;m putting water on my face. I don&#x27;t see any improvements... It could just be that I received a bad bottle though.. It&#x27;s worth giving it a try..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying it a second time. Need something to save my skin during the dry summer.</li>
    <li> Not sure of any results yet</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and perfect condition, I liked the fact that the Oz team send me an email before I got the product explaining the use procedures; so far so good, been using the vitamin for two weeks every night and hope to see improves!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  I have been using it for about a year now.  I am now 53 years old.  The past two years have been nothing but horrible for me with lots of stress and we all know that shows up in your skin. So imagine my surprise when I stared receiving compliments on how great my skin looked!  I can honestly say that this is my favorite skin care product ever and that I saw visible results right away.  I notice and feel tightening and toning, my complexion is more even and skin seems brighter.  I now have about 10 other people using this product and they love it too. When I first heard about Vit C serum I went on a search.  This product has great reviews and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  The company even sends directions and a newsletter.  Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure you will love it too!</li>
    <li> Did not notice much difference after use this product. Was expected to have smoother complection. I cannot say it is a bad product but I cannot make any good comments about it.wont be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Smoothed my skin nicely, helped hydrate it well! Loved it!</li>
    <li> i love love this!!! this is the best vit c serum much better than any vit c serum i had used.  I will definitely purchase again :)&lt;br /&gt;thanks oz naturals! please don&#x27;t discontinue this products :)</li>
    <li> OZ VC is easy to administer and quite effective</li>
    <li> Feels like the right stuff to put on after being in the sun! :)</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this brand, and I&#x27;ve found it is an excellent replacement for the expensive brands sold at salons and dermatologists.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> the application is easy and fast, instructions were clear and follow up email helped with any question I had about using the product.  I have only used it for a couple weeks but I do like the feel is it on my face, slight tightening, not drying.  good product</li>
    <li> Great for aging skin. You see immediate results in the way yours skin looks. I use it every day</li>
    <li> Tightened my skin, but still use moisturizer. Bought this product according to reviews and glad I did. I look years younger than my peers and want to maintain my skin. I have faith this serum works, because I felt a difference right away.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product and used it religiously with great results. I recently ordered a new bottle and it arrived today (8/23/15). Unfortunately, the formula has been changed. The original formula absorbed beautifully into my skin and left it a little tighter once it dried. The new formula is thick and sits on top my skin leaving a layer of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so sad :(</li>
    <li> This serum works as well for me as the expensive one I was getting from my dermatologist!</li>
    <li> This is indeed a nice serum.&lt;br /&gt;discounted priced for this review</li>
    <li> The order was exactly what I expected.  It arrived well packaged so as to prevent damage, and it was delivered in a timely manner.  I would not hesitate to order from OZ Naturals again, and would gladly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light and non greasy. I think that&#x27;s what I like the most. Did it lighten my dark spots... I think I need to use it for few months on a REGULAR basis to comment on that. I do use it 3/4 times a week.</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin C Serum!!! my friends keep on asking me what i use on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get a photo of the bottle  and text them the info where to get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used it &amp; bought it for quite a bit more. This price is excellent! I like the way it brightens my complexion &amp; dark spots have lightened.</li>
    <li> used this after using a microneedle derma roller. it feels amazing, and doesnt burn at all. i would recommend to anyone. my skin looks brighter and more clear. definitely more firm too.</li>
    <li> The highest rating I give is 4 stars and this line deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve started using this serum, the eye product and the face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but lasts forever and is well worth the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!!  😃</li>
    <li> This is an amazing Serum...  My skin fells wonderful in the AM... It&#x27;s like a mask for your face, as it fells tight on your face when you put it on and it dries, but then the MAGIC,  In the am when you rinse your face off, it&#x27;s like SILK.. My cousin commented on my face and said &amp;#34;what are you doing?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;your skin looks so smooth!&amp;#34;  I love this product</li>
    <li> great product.  I feel my skin tighten when applied.  not sure if this product is really working since I wear multiple products together but I do know its helping since my face glows and I am complimented all the time about not looking my age.  I plan to re-order once used up.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this product. Unfortunately, my code didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> So far it is pretty good but I am not sure if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it makes my skin more brightly</li>
    <li> Hard to notice any change during the entire duration that I used the product. Would not recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> great love it thanks---pt</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been buying this for a long time. they just changed the formula and it&#x27;s not thin and quick drying like it used to be. it&#x27;s quite thick like the HA and takes a while to dry. i also use the HA, so it takes MUCH longer now for both of them to dry. i&#x27;ll keep using it because you CANNOT beat the results for the price, but just don&#x27;t expect the nice, quick drying, light feeling serum like before....  UPDATE: i&#x27;m still using this product, and love it. AND i just found out it&#x27;s cruelty free! couldn&#x27;t be happier with that news. thanks OZ naturals!  :)</li>
    <li> This product was delivered promptly by the vendor. I have used a couple of other Vitamin C serums, of which the last one I used stained the palm of my hand orange, but seemed to really firm up my skin. This product is a bit thicker, goes on nicely without any odor, but I do not notice any difference on my skin when using this product. Maybe it is a good product for people with sensitive skin, but that is not me. Sadly, I am going back to my previous serum.</li>
    <li> I use 4drops to apply all over my face . My skin feels smooth and I feel good using a product with vitamin c and E and Hyaluronic Acid for exfoliation. I apply my moisturizer over the serum after it is dry. I feeling it is helping to even out my skin tone without dryness and my skin feels more plump and resilient. I do not notice any decrease in wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t with any products I have tried</li>
    <li> The product feels nice, doesn&#x27;t have a strong or unpleasant odor, and my skin looks improved after only a week!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I actually use it twice a day even though the instructions say once a day is fine.  I have seen very positive results even within just 1 week.  My pores appear less noticeable, my skin tone is starting to even out.  The minor breakouts I would get occasionally are all but gone, and some of the tiny scars have started to fade.  I really like this stuff!  It works beautifully.  I use my PMD (Personal Micro Dermabrasion) tool, rinse the results of that off, dry my face and use the D&#x27;arsonval High Frequency tool all over and then let my face rest for a minute, then I apply this amazing serum.  My skin soaks it up and loves it.  Then I put on a good moisturizer and my face is very soft and healthy.  So, I highly recommend this serum, it works!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything happening after 2 weeks but maybe it takes longer.</li>
    <li> Results are no better after 3 weeks of use than Stryvectin or Cindy Crawford&#x27;s regimen.  I am not looking for the silver bullet or the fountain of youth, but when Dr. Oz endorses these chemicals, Id expected more.  The product is no better than those previously used, but I will finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for well over a month now. honestly, i see no visible difference. it feels nice but the smell is off, i dont know what it is, its just got a bit of an odd smell. I&#x27;ve seen no change in my fairly normal combination skin. I wanted to love it but i&#x27;ve got nothing good or bad (sorta-the smell is weird) to say about it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not from the &#x27;dr&#x27; oz, but do really like this serum all the same. pricey for the little bottle, but 6 drops goes a long way. Item received promptly &amp; as described.</li>
    <li> I love it! My skin looks better now, is brighter and the hyperpygmentation is clearing. Absorbs quickly and feels great! I&#x27;ll never stop using it.</li>
    <li> could not see any improvement. another scam product??</li>
    <li> I spent all my teenage years covered in horrible acne. After I got pregnant with my first child, the acne just stopped coming, however the damage was done. My face was scarred with horrible acne marks and my pores were huge! I came across the product by accident and ordered it based on the reviews. I AM SO HAPPY!!! After just 1 week, my face is more radiant and my pores almost disappeared. I am starting to see an even more Beautiful complexion and make up is not even a morning option. I am 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> This product had awesome claims and even better reviews. But I am now skeptical of it all. I noticed after using 3/4 of the product that it wasn&#x27;t really giving me noticeable results (if it&#x27;s a good vitamin c serum you can feel softer/smoother skin the next day). Usually once you open a vitamin c product it will oxidize (from exposure to air) and turn yellow. I noticed months later that the serum was still crystal clear. So, I tested it out &amp; left the bottle completely open. 2 days later..still clear as air. Even if the product has stabalizers (ie vitamin e, etc) it should turn yellow given that it has Vitamin C. If this is a vitamin C serum then shouldn&#x27;t it!? Makes me wonder what&#x27;s in the product. If this review leaves you somewhat skeptical, open your bottle when you&#x27;re near the end of it and see if yours oxidizes (it should).</li>
    <li> I added this to my daily anti-aging skin routine.  I have noticed that my forhead lines are not as deep in just 2 weeks!  I also use it on my hands - what a huge difference in how they look!</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and my mother, I use it only at night and my mother uses it in the morning and at night. Can&#x27;t tell if I see any results yet on the fine lines, but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks since we started using it. I will continue to use to see if it does make a difference, for now I can say its a little drying so I still apply my moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> It has been almost 3 weeks since I have been using this daily. I have been using it along with a 1.0 mm dermaroller made by Petunia Skincare. I have had adult cystic acne that has resulted in many breakouts over the past 7 years since I been 18. I have tried everything with no luck. It was beginning to seem unless I had surgery, the  scars and open pores were going to never go away. In just under 3 weeks, I have already watched my pores shrink, my freckles begin to fade, and my scars lightly fade! As an added bonus I have noticed already the few wrinkles I have at age 24, already are beginning to fade as well which is just an added bonus. I would recommend this serum to anyone out there with the same issues as me.&lt;br /&gt;What I am doing as a routine, if it helps anyone like me is the following:&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C bar soap for showers,&lt;br /&gt;then applying this serum as soon as I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Every other day, I will dermaroll at night, then apply this serum before bed. (Solves the redness and helps healing while you sleep)&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate Twice a week.</li>
    <li> its ok , but not what I spected</li>
    <li> I am taking the phytoceramides and using this Vit C serum and I think I can see a difference in my skin looking a little bit fuller.  I will have to see in another month or so.  My skin seems to be more moist as well.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this serum and noticed a brightening effect almost immediately. I try to use it every day and liked it so much I purchased more so I would not run out.</li>
    <li> A nice product, but nothing to write home about....You can purchase Lumene&#x27;s Vit.C capsules,and a bottle of Hyaluronic Acid facial mist(at local health food store,NOT a GNC)near your home and they work together very well, no shipping, a lot less $$$$$$$$$$. If you like to order products online due to a frenzied schedule, then go for it,it&#x27;s good, not excellent</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I love it! Make sure you use it in addition to a moisturizer as the manufacturer suggests.</li>
    <li> As you age you become more skeptical about things since over the years you&#x27;ve tried so many things, but I decided after reading the reviews I&#x27;d give Dr. Oz&#x27;s C Serum a try. I also bought a 20.00 dollar derma roller which I love, to see if the Derma roller would help the serum do it&#x27;s magic. I have only had both products for a week, and I have used every day and I can say I truly see and feel a difference in the texture of my skin. I am 57 and have never had any procedures done to my face, and although my skin is still pretty good for my age I have noticed more age spots and fine lines ect...all the norm for a woman my age, but Dr. Oz C serum really seems to be making my skin feel and look fresher, smoother and I do notice a slight fading of age spots. Now in saying that I am using the derma roller, which also took some wonderful reviews to persuade me. It made sense to me that the roller would help the serum penetrate better so it could do its magic. It seems to help plump the skin and absorbed the product better instead of just staying on the surface of the skin. So I am giving only a 4 star because I&#x27;ve only used for a week. I am going to give a good month before I am sure my eyes are not deceiving me! And again at 57, it may be just that! Lol</li>
    <li> I think my wrinkles are better but it&#x27;s hard to tell since it&#x27;s such a gradual thing.  I&#x27;ll probably get another bottle just in case it&#x27;s not my imagination!  Talk about wishful thinking...</li>
    <li> It may be too soon to tell...I bought the Vitamin C serum after reading that to help lighten brown age spots, Vitamin C Serum was the best thing to use.  I think the serum is marketed more for the reduction of fine wrinkles but my goal is to sock it to some age spots---which is due to, yes to age--I&#x27;m 54---, but also sun exposure and the taking, over the years, of hormonal replacement.&lt;br /&gt;  I have followed the directions and appreciate follow up email directions of less is more, allow to dry and moisturize away.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used it now for about two weeks---I can&#x27;t really tell if the two main little spots are fading or not, or if my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; wrinkles are fading away as well...but I am persevering and do feel as if I am doing my skin a needed service</li>
    <li> Have seen a definite change in appearance and texture of skin.  Skin looks clearer, feels smoother.  Using with a retinol product. Wish I had known about this a lot earlier.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum.  It has done wonders for my face and in a short period of time.  The ordering was easy and I had it delivered within a few days.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does what it says it will do and the price is very reasonable.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very seldom do I take the time to actually review an item but this product is a miracle! First of all it was promptly shipped.  I have a few dark spots due to sun damage and after a week&#x27;s use they have started to fade.  I only use it at night before putting on my face cream.  I don&#x27;t want the secret of this product to get out becuase I don&#x27;t want it to sell out- it really is that great.  The customer service is outstanding!  OZ Naturals THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Saw immediate results. I would recommend to anyone. I have somewhat sensitive skin but have been able to use this serum without any adverse effects.</li>
    <li> my other vit. c serum has 10%, this one claims to have 20%, this may sound strange, but I can taste the vit. c in my10% serum, there is not even a glimmer of vit. c taste in this one. There is no difference in the way my facial skin looks, it is inferior to my 10% serum. I will use the remainder of this product on my feet, and reorder my 10% serum.</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t have much expectation of this product... I do a lot of research on skincare and am very selective -- I knew I needed a Vitamin C product and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money. Purchased on the strength of positive reviews .. I have to say after a few weeks of use my skin looks visibly brighter, smoother and the wrinkles around my eyes are shallower. I rarely can say a single product has made a difference but I see it with this one!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have notice a big difference. I use it on my face and the back of my hands.</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin looks noticeably plumper and fine lines have diminished. I wish I would have known about this ten years ago! Appreciate the quick shipping, too.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a great product and well worth every penny. Totally recommend it. It&#x27;s great and gives u perfect moisture.</li>
    <li> My serum arrived as promised. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a follow up email explaining how to use the serum correctly. This was very helpful. It is still a little early to see the full results from using the serum, but my skin does not feel so papery, it seems more plump.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for 2 weeks, but already I see the difference. My skin tone feels more even and clearer. When it runs out I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not terribly sure if this stuff is even working.  I think I&#x27;ve gotten better results from OTC products.  It seems to be drying my skin out, and considering that it contains hyaluronic acid, that&#x27;s a little weird.  I&#x27;ve used other serums before - successfully - mainly Perricone&#x27;s stuff.  I was looking for a lower cost alternative, but perhaps this just doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin. ( I&#x27;m 50 and have very fair, sensitive, combination skin.)  It&#x27;s kind of hard to judge skin care products because even though this hasn&#x27;t been fabulous for me, it might be the very thing for someone else with a different skin type.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference on my face. I only used it nightly.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my skin tone and that &#x27;s great!..&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve not noticed an increase in the moisture level of my skin&lt;br /&gt;Have not decided on, if I will  repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the great reviews. After using this for a week, I see a major difference in my skin. The best things about the serum is that it is not greasy. Your skin absorbs it quickly. I use this right before bed after cleansing, and wake up to beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> So far I like it (about 3 weeks), I feel like it is helping my skin look a little more refreshed, smoother</li>
    <li> The serum seems to absorb into my skin, then I put a moisturizer on top of that a few minutes after that. I think I am seeing improvement in my complexion using this product. It goes on smoothly. The company also e-mailed me insructions how to use thier serum, that was very thoughtful. This is an organic product, which gives me peace of mind. I have been using it for about one month now and really do feel it helps especially with the dry indoor air and very cold outside air, I need all the help I can get! I am 59.</li>
    <li> Helps fade age/ sun spots. I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice and am happy with the results. The spots are not gone, but very faded.</li>
    <li> IAM USING THIS WITH VIT C 20% &amp; HYALURNIC ACID. SKIN SOAKS THEM IN FEELS SATINY. DONT LET THE WORD &amp;#34; ACID &amp;#34; THROW YOU !</li>
    <li> Love, love, love what this has done for me. I have added the toner by Oz Naturals recently, and love it also. As a former Obagi customer and Estée Lauder, I can&#x27;t believe how much money I spent with such few results! I am 61 and blessed to have decent skin, but these products have actually improved my complexion and I am a very satisfied customer. I want to add the moisturizer next. At my age, I advise staying out of the sun without proper protection, no smoking, and i, personally, have never been much of an alcohol user either. I believe these products have helped to firm my skin and also reduce some of the darker spots I have. I have spent a fortune on products from the spa that were supposed to do that, but had poor results. These products last longer because you don&#x27;t have to use but a very small quantity.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel nice on my skin (I have a normal skin type)! Makes it too stiff and when I put the moisturizer over it (after let it dry), it doesn&#x27;t sit well on my skin!</li>
    <li> Seems to make my skin feel supple.</li>
    <li> The best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve ever used. Will Continue buying it..</li>
    <li> Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> My face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle of this serum and I just keep coming back. My skin looks more radiant, smoother and younger. It also helped with brightening my skin complexion. I use this serum after I cleanse my skin. 3 drops for my entire face. Last, I use a face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love it. It works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now and see no difference in my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  It absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  My complexion looks so clear and it evens out my  skin tone. Gives it a glow. I can go without any foundation or concealer. I use it everyday.  Its GREAT!!!  I</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I was using another brand of vitamin C serum previously and this one is much better. It is non greasy, non irritating and seems to be smoothing out some fine wrinkles. A friend even asked me what I was using because she thought my skin looked great!</li>
    <li> Really helps to diminish dark spots; even old ones.</li>
    <li> I have just started using the OZ Naturals vitamin C serum and so far I really like it.  It feels silky on my skin and hasn&#x27;t caused any adverse reactions.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it will really have anti-aging effects yet, but so far it is very good.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve given it 3 months using the product line (cleanser, toner, vitamin c serum, moisturizers (day and night) )... unfortunately, I honestly can&#x27;t say I see much change, or feel a difference.  I&#x27;d love to give it better than 2 stars, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed....</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the service given when I ordered the product. By the time I ordered it, I couldn&#x27;t find the notes I made on how to best apply the product. I was surprised and pleased to receive an email with detailed instructions. I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Just got this product about 5 days ago and started using it right away.  Too soon to tell as for the result.  I bought this product based on the number of reviews from other people and it&#x27;s a best seller at Amazon.com.  As for the feel of the product, I like that it&#x27;s not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I can only give 4 stars for now until I see the result.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but wasn&#x27;t happy that they mislead you in to thinking Dr. Oz either recommends or manufactures the product.</li>
    <li> Skin appears much more radiant giving that youthful glow. I&#x27;m interested to see how long this serum lasts before it  oxidizes and turns yellow. If it can last up to 3 months then my rating will be a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Very thrilled! Superbly helpful!</li>
    <li> Love it great results my skin looks so great..I would greatly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;Product ..a must have for every woman</li>
    <li> Affordable &amp; excellent product! Natural ingredients! I will continually using it &amp; recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> tried this instead of my regular one because it had some added stuff... does feel as soft on my skin. ill finish it but back to my old vit c</li>
    <li> Has an obvious healthy effect on my skin. -------------------------------------- My first bottle of this brand meet all of the hype the reviews lead me to believe - 5 STARS for sure. Two applications and I would notice a clear difference. BUT !!! I ordered a second bottle and it was not the same formula! They&#x27;ve changed the #%x formula!!! Which was the wrong thing to do. The company should have made a subset. This new bottle actually dried hard onto my skin. (Unlike the first bottle). I&#x27;m been using it over a month and still no fountain of youth like effects which the first bottle was able to do consistently.  It&#x27;s just really a dumb move to change a formula that thousands have praised. Why not just add a number to the name to differentiate the formulas???  You lost a loyal customer with that move. What a waste of product and money.</li>
    <li> I am used to the Obagi vitamin c serum which smells lovely and immediately brightens your face upon use. I haven&#x27;t seen any brightening effects with this product and no real improvement in my skin. I bought it because it was cheaper. Will use up till bottle is empty</li>
    <li> I loved my transaction and product from OZ.&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered the Vitamin C serum and it arrived promptly.  Within the first two days of using the product,&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in my skin.  It looked smoother and felt firmer.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU OZ.... I will be back for my refill.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Skin feels tight and smooth!</li>
    <li> It gave me smooth and lighter skin</li>
    <li> Has a bit of an odd smell and made my skin feel sticky even with just a small amount.  Was also surprised as to how quickly I went through one bottle.  Decided to go to the dermatologist and get a mild Retin A cream that ended up costing about the same.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a week - so too soon to tell if there is a difference.  But is is light weight, oderless and feels &#x27;clean&#x27;.  Hopeful...</li>
    <li> First off let me state that I purchase items on Amazon based on reviews of others. I purchased this hoping it would work because it had so many positive reviews. I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the positive reviews, but this was no different than using water. I went into the bathroom at work today and was actually shocked at how my wrinkles looked deeper and more pronounced. It&#x27;s not working!!! I have used it faithfully everyday for over a month and can&#x27;t see any difference. I seriously debated if I got a bad batch or what. What am I doing wrong. I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum ever!</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out like never before...</li>
    <li> I only been using a couple of weeks I do notice some of my fine lines have faded but I want to use a bit longer before I give my fair opinion &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I do not have oily skin but I need to use moisturizer right after I get out of the shower which normally leaves me feeling greasy. This serum feels amazing and does not clog my pores!</li>
    <li> Love it, does the exact same thing to my face as said in its descriptions!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buying again :-)</li>
    <li> Update: I really haven&#x27;t experienced any results with this product. Something in me doubts that its ingredients are legit. If I were you I&#x27;d just go for a more expensive product that you can trust instead of wasting money on these cheaper products that ultimately just waste your money.  |*~*|*~*|*~*|*~*|*~*|  So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any results, except for the fact that it drys my skin out.  I apply it to freshly cleansed skin and afterwards apply a moisturizer.  I am fully aware that one should wait at least eight weeks before noticing results, so I&#x27;ll give it more time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. I have been using just for 2 weeks and see a huge difference already.</li>
    <li> I can really tell a difference!</li>
    <li> The product works a bit slower to fade dark marks than say, hydroquinone but for those of us who want to steer away from controversial products or want to go in a non-toxic direction, Vitamin C serum is an excellent alternative.  In the past, I have used a hydroquinone product prescribed by a dermatologist as well as an OTC product and yes, the prescription product works faster in the short term but in the long run, it doesn&#x27;t truly make my skin better.  Also with hydroquinone, one has to be very careful how you use it and over what length of time as the effects can be damaging with long term use.  Not so with Vitamin C.  The product works slower for sure, but I actually feel as if it has made my skin better, in tone and texture as well.  The fading of the dark marks is quite visible now after about a month of nightly use.  The serum can be a tad drying but I follow up with an oil blend (of Rosehip Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil and a few drops of Lavender EO) and in the morning my skin feels soft.  With the winter weather I suspect though that I could use an additional &#x27;something&#x27; perhaps a cream(?) to truly seal in the moisture but my skin feels soft so I won&#x27;t quibble about degrees of softness at this point.  The company, OZ Naturals sent me an e-mail after I purchased this serum with detailed instructions on how to use to achieve the best results, which was great for me because I crave detail (as you can probably guess from my reviews).  I also need to add that I apply Sunscreen at least 20 Minutes before going out.  If you are trying to fade dark marks, in particular, you must use adequate sun protection or the dark marks could actually get darker, which would be the opposite of what you are trying to achieve.  So a good sunscreen during the day is definitely a must!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in September of 2014.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the changes in my skin thanks to this product and others in the OZ line.  It is simply the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I think I&#x27;ve used them all.  To have such a simple daily regime is a huge plus and that it fits into my budget, well, just amazing. If you&#x27;re still young, start using it now; if you&#x27;re older, start using it now! Your skin will become refined; pores shrink, acne breakouts disappear, and it absorbs quickly allowing makeup to be applied without waiting forever. An absolutely brilliant product line. Don&#x27;t miss out on your new, beautiful skin from OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 1.5 months regularly.  I apply 6 drops each night after cleansing my face, followed with one of my moisturizers.  It has refined my pores and has created a smoother appearance.  I am waiting to see if it helps with the one age/dark spot on my high cheek.  So far nothing.  I do like the way it feels and smells, although the first month it was very drying.  I am a 62 year old woman with good complexion.</li>
    <li> Nice vitamin C serum.  It has no to little fragrance which is a plus for me, i hate smelly facial products, and it is helping to even out my skin tone. It is 72% organic and is made in the USA.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use it after estee lauder creme at night , it seems make skin lifting more than before ,and make the creme absorbed fine.it is so different between use or not  .</li>
    <li> This whole line is just wonderful!!!!!</li>
    <li> It really makes my face feel and look so smooth.  It diminishes the wrinkles I have.  I intend to repurchase when I run out of this.  I would recommend it to anyone as long as, it doesn&#x27;t run out of stock.  lolol</li>
    <li> I have had my serum for about two weeks and so far I love it. I have a tendency to break out on my chin out of the blue and I&#x27;ve not had a single blemish since I started. My skin is smooth and really it has a nice glow, too! I can see that I might be able to skip my tinted moisturizer soon if the improvements continue. I would reorder, for sure. The delivery was way ahead of it&#x27;s projected date which is always a pleasant surprise...</li>
    <li> I used the product as instructed and within a few days had rough scaly patches along my cheeks, jawline and between my eyebrows. I tried exfoliting the dry skin, using alot of mosituriser and now have only a few dry areas left. It was very similar to retin a. I have started re using on my forehead where it did not cause flakiness so that I do not have to bother with return. Do you have any reccomendations</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product, leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing, noticed more of an even skin complexion.  Also want to mention I really love the follow up email after I received my order with directions of use, expected benefits and breakdown of ingredients.</li>
    <li> This a keeper! absorbed fast into your skin.  Although looks like water, you can tell it is not just water by the feel and speed of absorption. Goes well under moisturizer. I am not impressed by the light smell though. But overall it is a 5 star!</li>
    <li> You probably won&#x27;t see results and they don&#x27;t stand by there guarantee, look else where for a real brand and not smething that popped up within the past year.</li>
    <li> I always believe in vitamin !!C!! And have Been using it for years.  I decided to try this one as I have tried quite a few brands and I do like this one.</li>
    <li> This product is really good and my skin looks a lot healthier and does work on fine lines .  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It only been one week and I can see a different in my skin. My skin is very soft but to see more results I have to give it more time..</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the high reviews.  It has been 2 weeks and I have not noticed a single change.  I am 53 with mostly slight wrinkles.  I would not recommend this product and plan to return it before the 30 days are up.  If anyone has found another product that works well I would love to hear about it!!!</li>
    <li> Very light under moisturiser</li>
    <li> not sure yet - but feels nice not oily like others</li>
    <li> I will keep using this, wish they had this on automatic reorder.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My face appears to be getting clearer and brighter!</li>
    <li> Love this- great on my skin!</li>
    <li> bought for my mom; she loves it.</li>
    <li> This does not oxidize.  It does nothing at all.  I used 1/2 a bottle and had zero results.  Wish i had tested it for oxidation while i could still return it.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Vitamin C serum!  I ordered this after watching a program, not OZ, but a program about the benefits of Vitamin C Serum.  I then got on Amazon and did a search for the best rated Vitamin C Serum.  Based on the reviews, I ordered this serum and two other OZ products.  Loving them all!  I have personally seen a change in my skin.  I&#x27;m 52 and have always taken very good care of my skin, but after turning 50...  well I started seeing more fine lines.  While this has not taken them away, I feel my skin looks brighter! And fine lines softened.  I will be ordering this and the other products again.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.  It made my skin break out and I had to stop using it.  I know a few people that have used it and they have had great results.</li>
    <li> Still applying as directed, but no change. Too soon at this point. I&#x27;ll give it two weeks and then judge.</li>
    <li> When I got the chance to try Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum I took it. I had never tried a Vitamin C Serum before so I was curious to see what results I might get from it. I primarily used it on one area of my face to reduce the look of some darker age spots that are starting to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of use, my skin looks better, however the age spots are still there. Maybe possibly a little lighter, but definitely not noticeably. You have to be sure to use massive moisturizer with this product. I did not see a significant reduction in wrinkles or lines, but as I said my skin actually LOOKS healthier, so there is an improvement there. I believe that using this product with a full skin care routine can help, but used by itself isn’t safe, nor recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money, this is nothing but water. Took to my MD to only find out that it was  water with oil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum for a couple years now.  I&#x27;ve tried others but this is the best so far and the cheapest.  My skin definitely improved, more supple, supple and brighter.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It has a very nice, mild fragrance.  Vitamin C is a great antioxidant for the skin.  OZ Naturals are great products made in the USA.</li>
    <li> This brand makes a difference. It is better than other similar products. I have been using it for two weeks now, and i saw results right away.</li>
    <li> Even skin tone.  Soft, smooth skin texture.  Smaller pores.  Diminished lines.  All over radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t look like a teenager again, but I look youthful and healthy.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I have been using it daily for a month now and I started seeing results. My face looks brighter.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much so far, It feels good on my sensitive skin. I am just curious that I bought two kinds of oz naturals products, why do they have different boxes. I&#x27;m not talking about wordings, im talking about the layout of box design. I am a designer, so it&#x27;s weird to me. Makes wonder if one of them is a fake product.</li>
    <li> This is the  first serum I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or cause my eye makeup to run. I&#x27;ve been using it with my Dermawand and the combo is fabulous! My skin is much nicer, my wrinkles less noticeable. Great product!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I will say my face looks radiant and brighter.  I didn&#x27;t expect this.  I bought it because an aesthetician I went to told me a vitamin C serum would help reduce some of the light wrinkles I&#x27;m starting to develop.  Well, I gave it 4 starts not 5 because i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reducing wrinkles the way I&#x27;d like, but my skin looks better and more youthful than before in terms of tone and brightness.  I also like how natural the ingredients are.  I&#x27;ve sampled another vitamin C serum and while it worked better at reducing wrinkles, it was filled with some ingredients and dyes that were possibly carcinogenic.  Not into that.  I&#x27;ll give this serum another few weeks before I make my full decision.  I keep hoping not to have to resort to restylane.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Can see a major difference with just a weeks use, and no burning, irritation or peeling. Is very reasonably priced considering the exuberant cost of similar products.</li>
    <li> I saw many good reviews on this so I bought it. It turned out not as good as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;I used Instantural just before this and it was very good. I see this one has more people buying so decide to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It is thicker than Instantural, do not feel as good on your face. it also has a smell, not strong, but does not pleasant either.</li>
    <li> I usually buy my Vitamin C Serum from Dermesse and pay $66.00 for the same size bottle I purchased from OZ Naturals for $28.95. The strength in the Serum from Dermesse is only 10%, and the strength in the Serum from Oz Naturals is 20%. I have been using this product for several years, and I like it very much. It does help with fine lines and dryness. Now that I have discovered this product that has a higher strength than the previous product I was using at a much lower price, I will continue to keep ordering it online from Oz Naturals. I would highly recommend this facial serum to anyone and everyone I know. I&#x27;m sure you would be as pleased with it as I am.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this product leaves a white cakey film on your face making it impossible to wear under makeup. It also feels like it is drying my skin out. Horrible product</li>
    <li> Oh my God, I can not say enough good things about this serum. When I first started looking for a vitamin C serum there were so many out there luckily this one caught my attention. I have tried so many anti aging products and honestly nothing really works any better than anything else but then I heard about trying this along with vitamin E oil in my moisturizer and within a week there was a dramatic difference. I am on week 4 and I can&#x27;t believe it, the fine lines are actually disappearing. This is not just anti aging it turns back the clock on the damage already done.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom, and she has positive experience with it. The customer service is awesome. They even send me a lengthy email explaining how to best use this product, and I forward it to my mom. If all the business owner do this, the world will be a better place, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have used in years.  Im in my 40s and people think Im younger.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 days and it seems to make my skin look and feel better. I wish it was cheaper or maybe the seller can sell them in discounted bundles.</li>
    <li> Love it. I can&#x27;t wait for this part of my morning ritual. It glides on, absorbs quickly and my skin feels very nice after applying. I have combination oily dry skin and have rosacea.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermotologist to use a Vit. C Serum in the mornings. They gave a sample of one (that was much more expensive). I liked it ok-but it had a strange sent and very thick consistency. I bought this one after reading some good reviews since it was more reasonably priced and thought I would give it a try. I have been using it for two weeks and have seen great results and much prefer the lighter consistency and lack of weird smell. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I am 44 and have lines around my eyes and my skin is fairly dry. I kept seeing that Hyaluronic Acid was vital, and additional research said to make sure the Vitamin C serum was in an opaque bottle, etc., This had all of the qualifications and was very reasonably priced. I feel like my skin looks better and my aesthetician said she thinks it looks better too. Granted, I also started a retinoid and microdermabrasion, but I think it takes several steps and products to achieve optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coincidence that I have seen numerous magazine articles lately about Hyaluronic Vit. C serum. Obviously it works. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a few more weeks. I plan to stick with it. At this price why wouldn&#x27;t I?</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I&#x27;ve tried! I&#x27;m excited to see what my skin will look like once I&#x27;ve completed the bottle. Thanks OZ Naturals!!</li>
    <li> Very nice. My skin is smooth and the lines above my lip are less pronounced. I will buy this serum again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for the last several months. Then with my last order the product is more of a gel than a liquid and it dries and leaves white flakes all over my face. It also feels terrible when it dries. It&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s a totally different formulation and I&#x27;m very unhappy about the switch without notification. I will be requesting a refund.</li>
    <li> Used for 1 month, did not see any changes. Bit dissapointed.</li>
    <li> So good I bought two bottles</li>
    <li> I have used 2 other brands of Vitamin C &amp; Hylauronic acid but nothing worked like OZ Naturals. I have really noticed a difference on my forehead where there are now less lines especially the creases between my eyebrows. I&#x27;m no longer asked if I&#x27;m upset when I&#x27;m not. Really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum twice now.  I use it after washing my face, before applying my daily spf moisturizer.  Makes my skin skin feel and look great.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent serum. I have very sensitive skin and break out from everything. However I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and not a breakout in sight! I have noticed a improvement in my skin tone almost immediately. The lines in my face are pretty deep, but I have noticed a slight improvement there as well. Over all I reccomend this product. You will be very satisfied! The quantity goes far, I can tell it will last me for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed as was expecting more after reading the glowing reviews. Didn&#x27;t improve the appearance of my skin nor cause any adverse reactions. Used the product as suggested with no discernible results.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> love love love this stuff! really brightened my skin within the first few uses, definitely will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Amazing product have reordered it many times can see a difference in my skin and love the way it feels on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help ease the aging on my face.  This product really works!  It has softened the lines around my eyes - they&#x27;ve actually disappeared.  The deeper lines have significantly softened.  Also I&#x27;ve inheirited my Mom&#x27;s jowl lines.  This product didn&#x27;t eliminate those, but did indeed soften them.  Also lines over my lips (from long ago smoking habit) are also softening.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.  It did it for me!  Oh by the by I am 68 years old.</li>
    <li> This one of the best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve had. It help with my scarring. I use to have bad scarring on my checks because of cystic acne but this serum really work. Also I&#x27;ve notice that my pimples are disappearing but i still get zits though. This serum moisturizes skin and it feels so soft. I would recommend this product to anyone. But the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the serum feels like it&#x27;s just water. But overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m Asian, but this product made me break out.. I was using another product &amp; I was doing so good, until I saw the ad from Dr. Oz, I thought I&#x27;d try it. Unfortunately, did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this serum because it was more affordable than the vitamin C serum I typically use.  After 2 uses, this thing hit the trash can.  It goes on like a weird gel that dries on the face and flakes off after any additional product is used on top of it.  It also gave me a rash. Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down the worst product I&#x27;ve ever ordered from Amazon.  Boo hiss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a year and have gone through many bottles. I loved it. I&#x27;m a skin care snob and have tried every department store luxury skincare line and most infomercial brands. Nothing moisturized my skin as this vitamin c serum helped to do. I felt using as a first step helped the rest of my skincare absorb and work magic. My usual skincare regimen without this serum was unsatisfactory, but in combination with this serum gave amazing results! I have sensitive skin due to preventative acne ointments used since high school (now mid 30&#x27;s.) My acne prone skin stayed at bay and I never had a breakout.. Until now. The formula of this serum has changed. Original formula was a thin liquid, transparent and odor free. New formula is thick, sticky, dark yellow and has a foul fishy odor. I thought maybe I had received a bad batch so I reordered, and unfortunately received the same new consistency. Truly disappointed. I&#x27;m sad the original formula is gone and now my dry flaky skin has come back along with horrible acne and redness the new formula left behind. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for you if not acne prone. Surely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin looking and feeling soft, radiant, and all around amazing. I highly suggest this so so much</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. I have been using this for over 2 months but I haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have received many compliments on the appearance of my skin since I started using this product. My face is more plump and the brightness has improved a lot. The best all natural product I have tried yet. Works great in combination with retionol cream at night and this in the morning followed with a light SPF.</li>
    <li> I had a breakout after using this serum. Can&#x27;t use it! After using it for the first time I broke out with pimples. As soon as I stopped using it my skin cleared up.</li>
    <li> this stuff leaves my skin tight and itchy, it says you can put makeup over it but you cant unless you like uneven and crumply makeup-looks terrible. wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. I used this once with the hyaluronic acid serum the next day my face was covered in whiteheads.</li>
    <li> I noticed a softness and smoothness in just a few days!!!! Great product to  use when you&#x27;re  just starting to notice aging!</li>
    <li> I read and read and read all the reviews this serum has. HOWEVER, I cannot say that my experience is as positive and alluring as the others. I don&#x27;t know if the face moisturizer I was using in conjunction with this serum was what made me break out, but I was getting huge zits!!! I&#x27;m in my mid twenties...I don&#x27;t need any pimples on my face!</li>
    <li> I am a very long time Obagi  user and like the entire product line.  Light weight, good coverage, really works and  feels good on my skin.  And my dermatologist recommends this line as best for your skin.  But this product works just as well in the daily regimen and is a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product but so far I have been really happy with it. First, I love that it is both vegan and cruelty free!!! There is no unusual scent which is something I have experienced with other products and I definitely feel like my skin has a fresh glow since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;I will update once I have spent some more time using it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 weeks now and I can definitely tell that it is working . My skin feels much smoother and tighter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my face is still the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I use it daily. I only need 5-6 drops to cover my whole face. (With a toner)&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped my breakouts, and all the lines on my face are gone after a week!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> I started using this serum 2 weeks ago.  By the end of the third day I noticed a change in the complexion of my face, but I wanted to use it a while longer before writing in.  It does work.  The skin on my face has gotten lighter.  The dark areas have gone.  My face is one skin tone again.  Even the dark under my eyes is getting lighter..  I use it in the morning after I wash my face.  Then I put my favorite moisturizer over it.  When my bottle runs out, I will buy another.  It really is working for me,</li>
    <li> My face looks so bright &amp; healthy since I started using this product! I have had compliments from others so I know it must be doing the trick. This product will be a staple in my future.</li>
    <li> I believe that my skin is less pigmented from using this serum daily.  The container with eyedropper is perfect as the serum is watery.  I use this product with my regular regimen and have had no negative reaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with the Phytoceramides capsules and I love the way my face looks and feels.  I have noticed that my pores are much smaller in just a short amount of time.  I had a male co-worker today tell me how bright my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using so he could tell his wife :)</li>
    <li> The item, although not exquisitely boxed, is a fantastic product.  I have been using for over a week and notice that my face is smoother, cleared and more hydrated.  The price is far less than other similar products, some of which do not contain hyaluronic acid.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Only just purchased will update my review after use.  Feels nice on face and dries very quickly.  Leaves face nice and taught.</li>
    <li> Its fairly early in the process, however, this product seems to be working.  It goes on clear and is not sticky, is well absorbed and feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve tried other serums but none have come close to this one.  I&#x27;ve only been using a few weeks and swear I can already see a difference, it&#x27;s definitely reduced the crows&#x27; feet around my eyes and the worry lines on my forehead.  It&#x27;s also tightened and brightened my overall complexion.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced and a little goes a long way.  I will definitely be reordering this one and recommending to friends!!!!</li>
    <li> This serum doesn&#x27;t sting when applied. I tried it after dermarolling, and there is no sting. I do think that it makes a difference in my skin. I havent had any adverse reactions. I will continue to use and update this review later.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum has potential. My skin tends to be finicky and this product has not caused any issues. It has only improved it in the time that I have used it. My skin looks healthier and feels healthier. I have not noticed any reduction in fine lines, but I am sure that takes time. I cannot wait to see how much better my skin looks in a couple of months. I was able to try this product at a  reduced price for my review. I would recommend this serum, it is worth a try and the ingredients are all natural and simple.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to control his eczema. It moisturizes well and it is not shiny. It absorbs quickly also. I do not know if it helped with the eczema, because my son moved to go to college, so I&#x27;ll have to wait until I see him, since he is not telling me how it is working out for him.</li>
    <li> The serum arrived  quickly as did an email from the company with directions for usage.  I have been using the product for about 1 week.  It absorbs into my skin and is not oily.  I believe more time is needed to see the anti aging benefits.  So far I am pleased with the product and the customer service OZ Naturals has provided.</li>
    <li> So I tried the Sano and the Tru-Skin. Hard to tell but they seemed Ok. I bought OZ before but it&#x27;s more expensive. I ordered the OZ again and it seems worth it. You can feel the tingle of the C and it seems like you use less with the same coverage. I think I will spend a few more dollars for this serum. Try them all yourself. I like this one.</li>
    <li> I think I can tell some of my age spots are fading, but it has just been a week since I started using. Shipping and arrival speed was excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish it came in a bigger bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C Serum for 6 months and can really tell the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency! Goes on easily, absorbs quickly, and is not noticeable under makeup. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I think I can already see a change in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks and already notice that my skin is firmer and brighter.  I am hoping after using for a month I will see a dramatic difference in my skin.  It very easily absorbs into your skin. I do recommend it</li>
    <li> Great product, super-quick shipping!  I love that this product is unscented, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with any other products I use!  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice radical anti-aging benefits yet, but my skin feels great!  The vitamin C, vitamin E, and hyaluronic acid are all great anti-aging ingredients, and I like having them all in one serum.  Best of all, no petroleum based additives in the serum!</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum just absorbs in to the skin. It leaves the skin so soft and feeling soft. I also appreciated the follow-up email from the company with instructions for use. They have another serum i plan to buy and use for daytime as i use this one at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I was hopeful for results but not really expecting to see any noticeable effects.  Within a week of using this serum my skin is more even toned and I&#x27;ve had fewer break outs, which is high for me!  Seems like everything makes my skin break out.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and the customer service.  When I received he serum I was going to get back online to research how to apply it but to my delight I had already received an email from Oz naturals with specific usage guidelines.  It was awesome.!</li>
    <li> I have started using it and could see some results although it&#x27;s a little premature. Will send additional comments after a couple of weeks&#x27; use.  The item arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Was better than expected! Definitely making my skin shine and feel tight. I see that it is gradually erasing the fine lines and wrinkles. Love it! Will purchase more from this company!</li>
    <li> The dermatologists always recommed using vitamin C serum after cleansing the face in the evening. After a few days, you can feel your complexion brightening and clearing. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! I saw a remarkable difference in the appearance of my face within a week.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum! The serum is not greasy and goes on easily. Within minutes it&#x27;s like small wrinkles begin to fade and your face looks brighter. I will definitely be ordering another.</li>
    <li> Great product ,already see a difference and friends have said that I look younger. I recommend this product. Specially if you go out in the sun a lot. It is a good anti oxidant for the skin. MJ</li>
    <li> Works great on scars and skin marks, my skin looks visibly rejuvenated. I plan to keep using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of days and I must say my skin looks much brighter and the texture of my skin much smoother. Within days I have seen a difference...I can only imagine what my skin will look like in 2 to 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! My skin looks so radiant and alive once again. The ordering and delivery process was superior. I will be buying again from OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Fast shipping as well, I didn&#x27;t see a different the first few days after I used it, but I noticed a different about after 20days, my skin is brighter. My skin color got lots of darker after I moved to arizona,  because of lots of sunshine...and my skin color is lighter now!!!! Amazing!!! I&#x27;m very happy and I&#x27;m going to buy this product for my mom too.</li>
    <li> Have been using it twice daily since I got it a week ago. Nothing spectacular, but I use it as a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. Which is a miracle in itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and feel it has improved my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.</li>
    <li> I have used other Vitamin C serums and could tell a difference after around 4 weeks.  I really could not tell a difference with this brand.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on and really feels like it soaks in!</li>
    <li> In just about a month that I&#x27;ve been using this and the other products in this line my skin is smoother and brighter, softer and makeup goes on easier .  I&#x27;m almost out and I&#x27;ll be getting more because I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I use this product along with OZ Naturals Retinol Serum.  I am starting to notice a small difference in my deep wrinkles around my mouth.  I know nothing works fast so I will order these two products again and again.  I want to see what it does over the next year.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.....hopeful.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase Obagi 20 serum and thought with the reviews I would give it a shot. I would not recommend this if your wanting good results in a serum.  It is not of the best quality and after use I see a minimal result.</li>
    <li> Since I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my results from Oz Naturals Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum , I decided to buy this product by them as well.&lt;br /&gt;I just started using it &amp; have been pleased.</li>
    <li> Love  the product! i just wish its a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old, have always taken great care of my skin and am no stranger to a good skin care regime but, despite all my efforts, fine (and not so fine) lines kept appearing and deepening and nothing I tried worked.  A friend recommended that I try some kind of topical Vitamin C product, which was something I hadn&#x27;t yet done.  So I did a search on Amazon and up popped this product.  I was very - and I mean VERY - skeptical but it had great reviews and a good price so I thought, &amp;#34;What the hey?  I&#x27;ll give it a shot&amp;#34;.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it (if at all) but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week.  I was stunned.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums (sera?) in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims.  I&#x27;m now a total convert and will not start my day without applying the OZ Naturals serum.  Their customer service is also excellent so I&#x27;d give it a six-star review if I could.</li>
    <li> If this was the old vitamin C anti aging formula I would give it 5 stars. That stuff was amazing. My confused skin was finally clear and glowing after using the old formula and I received many compliments. I frequently told people to try it. Alas, it exists no more (sniff) The new formula is sticky, smells funky, and doesn&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is drier, less glowing and I&#x27;ve had a couple blemishes. On the hunt for another serum that worked as well as the old formula.</li>
    <li> Really like this serum, my skin feels tighter and smoother.  Will definitely purchase again, in fact I just did!</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this serum and find it easy to apply. I&#x27;m unable to rate the results as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days which is the reason for 4 stars. I appreciate the follow up from OZ Naturals in regard to product usage in order to ensure you have a good experience and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I use this product with 3 others and it keeps my skin looking fresh and young!</li>
    <li> After reading so many glowing reviews about this serum, I decided to give it a try in lieu of ordering my usual serum.  Unfortunately, my skin did not respond to this product as advertised at all.  Instead, my skin  became dry and taut upon applying.  It felt like I was applying rubbing alcohol to my face - did not give sensation or scent of being &#x27;natural&#x27;.  Had a chemical odor.  It did not live up to it&#x27;s description for me.  Stopped using it and won&#x27;t use again.  Very disappointed with results from using this product.  Would like to return for a refund if possible.</li>
    <li> I had read in beauty magazines and heard rave reviews from friends about the benefits of Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 34 years old with combination skin with dry/dehydrated cheeks.  My complexion is very clear and even but tends to look very dull so I was looking for something to brighten my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the serum as part of my nighttime ritual, 2-3 days a week for two months and did not see the brightening results I had read about.  Instead, my face felt tight on the days I used it, and reddish and sensitive.  I am not certain that if I used the product longer, I might have seen results. The discomfort and lack of results weren&#x27;t worth it to me so I stopped after 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have used it more often if my skin didn&#x27;t have the tightness.  After cleansing, I would apply a few drops in my hands and pat it on my face and allow it to fully dry before applying lotion.  I would experience a tingling and tight sensation after applying it.  I thought at some point that would go away but it never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not work on everyone but it&#x27;s worth a try to see if you&#x27;re one of those who gains the benefits of using this serum.</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this vitamin C serum for a few months now and have seen a  change in my skins texture and also noticed a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;I will be definitely ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> Great great great.  Helps with hyperpigmentation, brown spots, lines.....PERFECT</li>
    <li> Nice conglomeration of essentials for your money.  Added to the nightly rituals.</li>
    <li> This is a light, super absorbent formula that brightens skin giving it a youthful glow and markedly reducing dark spots with continued use.  I use it immediately after my clarifying lotion and before my face cream.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I finish using the product and i don&#x27;t have any results .. or get the benefit that the reviewer write they get !!</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. i had a brown spot on forehead and above eye brow and they are gone now. I used one bottle and it worked. My skin looks great. thank you</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product.  It felt like putting water on.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because I feel like it&#x27;s getting used up a little too quickly.  I feel like maybe the dropper could be designed a little better because I have to take care not to have any run off my face.  I haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see results, just my second week, but I&#x27;m more using for maintenance right now to help prevent wrinkles and damage down the road.  We&#x27;ll see how fast I go through it, it seems like it&#x27;s almost half-way down at week 2, so that will be my gauge as to whether or not I reorder.  I was expecting to get something to last a couple of months.  I do use it on my neck and chest, so that could be part of the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The seller of this product responded to my comments and let me know it is in fact a 1 month supply.  Therefore, it&#x27;s not running out quickly, and I&#x27;ve adjusted the star rating.  I had always thought that \\&quot;little goes a long way\\&quot; with serums and was hoping to get more use out of it, but at least this serum is affordable unlike many of the others!</li>
    <li> I returned it.  They changed their formula adding rose and it&#x27;s thicker, sticky, has a funny smell and caused me to break out.  I had been using this product daily for over a year and was very happy with it until they made this change.</li>
    <li> I am 60 yrs old.  After using this for 30 days there a very noticeable improvement in the lines on my forehead, around my eyes and on my upper lip, neck and chest.  After 60 days the sun damage and deep lines on my chest are almost gone.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I will be using this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It made my face glowing and I will recommend it to everyone who wishes to preserve their youthful face.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product one day ago and have never used a product that makes my skin feel like silken powder (hard to describe) you must let product dry before you use a moisturizer or foundation. I have only used twice so far but am very impressed ,I can already see a glow from within effect.I love it when that happens as I am 55 and will take all the glow I can get!I love all the Oz Natural products so far and look forward to my skin tranformation with their awesome natural products.Thanks OZ Naturals you guys are naturally good. Sincerly Rachel Bata</li>
    <li> Best vitamin c any money can buy.  The company is great and tells you exactly how to use it.  There is a generous amount of product, and is lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> Just wonderful great anti age serum ---- feeling the wonderful effects that it has on your skin&lt;br /&gt;Use daily and sometimes nightly----- happy I bought it</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 9-10 months and have loved it. But today i tried the new order and I was so disappointed. The serum is now sooooooo sticky and doesn&#x27;t spread easily like before . Earlier it was very watery and now after putting it the face feels sticky like you would feel if you put honey on your face . They have definitely changed something with the formula !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product works as described.  As it dries, I feel the skin tightening however, I only been using the product for two days.  Have to see the results after a week or so.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this Serum. My face had many dry spots and with two uses they completely disappeared...</li>
    <li> Still too early to make a definitive call here, but it hasn&#x27;t made my skin react poorly, so thus far I will give it 4 stars.  After application (and I use 4-5 drops over my face and neck), the lines around my eyes disappear, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  However, it&#x27;s only been a little over a week, so I&#x27;m not prepared to judge whether the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; properties are truly anti aging.</li>
    <li> I found this serum too watery. A few drops near my fingertips would drip right through. I had to put the dropper on my cheek to not loose most of it between my fingers. I have switched to Alina Skin Care vitamin C serum. Much better and seems more effective.</li>
    <li> Honestly? It barely did anything. I&#x27;m almost out of my first bottle and it didn&#x27;t even fade/lighten my acne scars. I used it twice a day on a washed face as instructed but no use. Nothing happened. Switching over to the Instanaturals skin brightening line, we&#x27;ll see how that goes. Looks promising.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to high end Skinceuticals. I don&#x27;t know if the C concentration is actually 20, but my skin likes the product. I have used high end C for many years and think OZ is comparable in quality.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Easy to apply and leaves skin feeling tight which is good before applying moisturizer.  Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Glides on your skin and it&#x27;s quickly absorbed. Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> After using Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid Serum a few times, I can see the difference in my facial skin.  It helps my dry and sensitive skin look healthier, radiant and tighter.  My hyperpigmentation started to fade away.  This is an excellent product at a low price compared to other vitamin C serums.  I would highly recommend this product to others.  I am also very pleased with their customer service.  I will continue buying this serum.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any thing on my face.  Was anything suppose to happen? Even after I used it all, I wondered-- what was it suppose to do ?</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is actually making my pores smaller and who doesn&#x27;t love that!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love Vitamin C serum. I see such a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> product seems ok, it is too watery , and I am wondering the true result, as I have been use other C product before, they had result with 2 weeks, so far I can not tell this one yet.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! My skin has become smoother and my dark spots have lightened significantly.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I try this particular Vit C serum and so far, I am very happy with this product. It feels easy and light when applied, absorbs quickly, does not feel oily or thick or sticky, gel-like in texture, more like a blend of gel with water but not runny or too thin.  So far, I am happy with the feel and smell (there is no smell). As for the effects, my skin feels more hydrated and Vit C results take time to notice... I like that Vit C &amp; E are combined with hyaluronic acid in this product.  Also, I have used at least four other Vit C products from very expensive to inexpensive but potent, and I like the feel of this one so far the best. However, I will know more about the efficacy in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to really give a strong opinion. I used it three times and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a feel, it did nothing on my skin.  I am used to using Obagi and that feels much different when applying.  I will continue using it every morning because I bought it and want to give it a fair try.</li>
    <li> Definitely has a good effect.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, with just 7 days of using 2x/day, the result is noticeable already. The only negative is that it is pricey for a small bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I feel the tightness after use  look forward to seeing a difference after using it for a time</li>
    <li> this product is light, i have been using it for a full week now and i can see some of my old scars seems lighter.&lt;br /&gt;i use it in the morning before my makeup</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! How can you not purchase a wrinkle serum at prices like this?! Amazon rules b/c now I don&#x27;t spend hundreds on all these skin products that are not cheap and work brilliantly.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum as part of my nightly routine for several weeks.  Because I use them together (first Vitamin C and then HAC) I am reviewing them together.  I am really happy with the results so far.  I like the consistency of both - not oily and really absorbs quickly into my skin.  I find my skin is brighter and I notice a slight fading of a brown spot on my face.  I will definitely keep using these as part of my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> very good for my skin</li>
    <li> I think it is just as good as the more expensive brands! Shipping on time. And email for instructions if you need them.</li>
    <li> I love it, I was out like 2 weeks and I could see the difference without using it. Plus, affordable.</li>
    <li> My skin feels very smooth and I am quite pleased with the results so far. I will purchase again for sure</li>
    <li> Never had an issue with my skin, thought I would try as a preventive measure and now I am breaking out like crazy, dry and have uneven skin tone.  I&#x27;ve used SkinCeuticals and had wonderful results, this does not compare.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. It does nothing</li>
    <li> did not see a difference.</li>
    <li> It does nothing besides waste your money.</li>
    <li> O choose this product because it was recommended , I use everyday and I can see some improvements on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this product to anyone to see some changes on the face</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better  than  other brands  I tried so far need to get a new one</li>
    <li> Ok so i&#x27;m a 35 year old female with moderate adult acne. Up until 4 weeks ago I was using the whole La Roche Posay Effaclar line (also purchased on amazon) which was just ok....still had acne! :( But I love amazon though. So when I noticed this highly rated product with such a low price...i figured what the heck...for that price if it didnt work oh well....at least I didn&#x27;t break the bank!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at the lightweight consistency.....almost like putting water on your face. I had switched to washing my face with pure african black soap a few weeks earlier (which is also the bomb.com by the way) and 2 weeks ago started using a few drops Dr. Oz Vitamin C morning and night under my moisturizer. You don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your whole face,&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!! Within a few days of this, my face and neck was 90% smoother, the acne diminished significantly and I my skin had a beautiful glow to it!! I used get bothersome neck acne from my hair touching it all the time and after using this...that is completely gone! I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!! Hope they never stop making it! This may just be a HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT! BUY it!! You shouldn&#x27;t regret it and if it doesn&#x27;t work for you...at least you didn&#x27;t spend a fortune! I&#x27;m buying two bottles as soon as the price goes back down to 29.99!</li>
    <li> Finishing second bottle and I can see a improvement on my face. Skin looks much healthier and wrinkles look less visible&lt;br /&gt;For people that are spending time outdoors on sun and on dry climate this is a must as an overnight treatment with some moisturizer in conjunction.&lt;br /&gt;Product speaks for itself</li>
    <li> Delight your customers and plenty of folks will give you positive reviews. Take the e-mail address I gave you in trust to help resolve our transaction and use it to spam me, earn a negative review.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because I did not have any bad reactions to it so far.  But I also have not seen anything different to my skin either.  Still looks the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 15 days.  I guess I will have to give it more time.</li>
    <li> i order it before &amp; i liked it ,so accordingly i ordered it for my sisters also. it is very light and i can use it under my makeup &amp; after using it my skin looks more better.</li>
    <li> I just revive this  ítem but I hope to improve my skin.  Good presentation but I think that it is a little expensive</li>
    <li> Othere serums containing the same quantity and ingredients are several times the price.  Oz Naturals also sent me clear instructions on how to use the product, which I have for the last two weeks.  It&#x27;s probably to soon tell if the serum is making any changes to my skin, but I will add to this review in about a month.</li>
    <li> My 2 cents on this is that it is probably best for those who have not tried, or don&#x27;t tolerate stronger treatments.  I have been using Retin A and Glycolic Acid for several years, and at 45, I would say my skin has less wrinkles that my peers who use nothing.  Was hoping the Vitamin C would do something more,  but I think I am already doing the max I can do.  If you haven&#x27;t tried serious things on your face,  you will probably see improvement.  If you are a treatment veteran,  this probably doesn&#x27;t offer you anything.&lt;br /&gt;I will also add that the customer service is VERY attentive,  the flip side of that is I think the reviews are biased because they email you and ask you not to post bad reviews without letting them try and fix it.</li>
    <li> I regularly use retin A and just added this to my regimen.  I am really surprised at the wonderful difference it makes.  My skin looks smooth and feels soft.</li>
    <li> First thing I use after cleansing, then serum.  Noticed improvement. Skin softer, healthier looking. Started using because of C &amp; E vitamin recommendations.</li>
    <li> Never been so impressed with any product like this , my face feels so smooth , I love it so much , I actually use it everyday .</li>
    <li> I received me order quickly! Product goes on smoothly, am waiting to use for 4 weeks before being critical about my personal results, but I do see less crow&#x27;s feet or larger wrinkles. Also, I can feel the texture of my skin becoming slightly different, and more elasticity. So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This wonderful vitamin C serum leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. It is non-greasy. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle. It really does make my skin smoother. As a 70 year old person, I expect wrinkles but this product really helps especially around my mouth.</li>
    <li> I am only on my 2nd week of using this product but, have high hopes that by using this along with phytoceramides that I will notice a change in my skin.  I am 53 years old and have noticed dryness and how my skin is starting to loose the firmness that it once had.  I will update as the weeks go by once I have time to fairly give a review.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum twice a day and I like the way my skin feels.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in lines but it&#x27;s taken me many years to get my character lines so I doubt they will go away very quickly or easily.</li>
    <li> I saw this as one of the top best seller here in Amazon and decided to try it. I tried it on my knuckels first, I have really dry hands. Just used a drop and rubbed it in, and wow, what a difference. It soaks right in and made it really soft. I wish I can use this as an everyday all over body lotion but I have to win the lottery first ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this on my face for 2 weeks now, I try to use it twice a day, clean with Witch Hazel, then use a drop on my forehead, drop on both cheeks and another around my nose area. It&#x27;s amazing how your skin just soaks it in and makes your skin nice and smooth. I have noticed the fine lines going away. I dont know if its the combination of what Im doing, needle roller, peel and using moisturizer regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it. One of my co-worker actually said my skin looks glowing and clearer!</li>
    <li> Skin is much softer and I will pre-order.  Fine lines are disappearing.</li>
    <li> This worked great to prevent and get rid of eye wrinkles. I used it in combination with the InstaNatural Eye Cream. I was really hoping to get rid of the dark circles but that didn&#x27;t happen. I don&#x27;t believe there is a product out there that actually does that.  It by itself is rather drying to the eye so the InstaNatural Eye Cream helps to moisturize. I would purchase again only to prevent and treat wrinkles, not dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have used at lease four bottles of this and have seen absolutely NO Differences nor Improvements.  I am bewildered why this this products gets thousands of rave reviews?!!?  I used on clean skin daily. My skin did not glow. I still have continous adult acne (that only recedes when I completely cut out dairy). And I definitely did not see reduction in dark marks or acne marks. I did not see reduction in winkles. Goes on and absorbs like water.  And if used alone, would be too dry.  So I keep buying due to the rave reviews.  But after four bottles, first bought in 2013 and recently again...I should have self control and call it quits.  Gets one star for being unscented and very gentle, literally like water.</li>
    <li> So far absolutely love this product. Great results!!.</li>
    <li> This stuff surprisingly works really well on my skin I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and haven&#x27;t seen anything dramatic. I think it has very slightly lightened the dark marks on my face, but hasn&#x27;t had any affect on my fine lines, reducing the look of my pores, or any of the other claims.  The serum absorbs quickly and does make my skin soft, though. I will probably not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Highly recommended. Only used it for 5 days now and are starting to see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This product made my face worse. It was truly a waste of money. I follow the directions.  I stop using it because my face kept getting worse and worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using this for a while now, and I loved it.  I actually looked forward to putting it on after washing my face. It made my face visibly smoother and brighter.  However, this time when I reordered it, what I received was nothing like what I had been using. The serum used to be clear and smooth, but now it&#x27;s yellowish and very sticky like putting glue on my face.  I exchanged it with another bottle, but I got the same sticky thing. I&#x27;m very disappointed to have lost my favorite serum...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and can see a noticeable difference in my face. I am 56 and my skin looks really good and yes younger. I will continue to purchase this product - thanks OZ  Naturals.</li>
    <li> I loved this serum until they recently changed the formula and raised the price from $22.49 To $39.99! The old formula did wonders for my skin. The new formula is very thick a feels like paste when it dries! I will be searching for a new brand with the old formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used vitamin c on my face for several years.  I hadn&#x27;t used OZ Naturals before, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  My skin feels great and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This serum has made my skin glow. Gets rid of breakouts very quickly too. Love it!  I recommend it when people ask me!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin is firmer, more moisture, more luster, this is a great invention, I cannot do without it.</li>
    <li> Worked really well, made my skin clearer. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this serum as it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break out. It is lightweight, and keeps my skin feeling taught and smooth. I don&#x27;t have to use much, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants glowing/rejuvinated skin.</li>
    <li> I want to say that this really did help my puffiness under my eyes.. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I loved this product until they changed their formula (August 2015) and doubled the price! Didn&#x27;t they even do any focus groups before they released this, to let people try it out? The old formula was clear and silky, and soaked right into your skin, whereas the new formula is thick and viscous, almost like glue, and when it dries it feels a bit like having a dried egg white mask on your face - ugh.  Also seems like false advertising that they have more than 4500 reviews that are all based on the OLD formula, which was great. This new formula is awful - I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund. Update: I got a refund, but their customer service was not very friendly about it. They didn&#x27;t seem to care that a previously loyal customer was upset by them drastically changing the formula and raising the price.</li>
    <li> Suggested by my sister. Shipped on time and the results are amazing. I luv howmit goes on. I&#x27;m still in the newlywed stage but now decide to apply it twice a day to condition and repair my facial condition. I plan to buy another bottle for reserve.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne problems ever since 2007 and this makes my skin clear and nourish, my dark spots have been dissapearing as I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks. Im happy with it.</li>
    <li> I found that it absorbs quickly and makes my skin very smooth.  It diminished under eye dark circles quite well.</li>
    <li> First, I would like to stipulate that I used to be an avid Skin Ceutical consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have reached my sixties, and although I have been told that \\&quot;I really look pretty good for my age\\&quot; I am like most women at this stage in that I have not escaped the inevitable fine lines and the onset of wrinkles.  I chose this year to do something about this concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I went through a CO2 treatment to get rid of any sunspots that had accumulated over the years.  Then I proceeded to use Retin A, along with a regiment of derma rolling (micro-needle therapy).  I had previously used the Skin Ceutical Vitamin C E Ferulic Acid in the mornings, but I have now switched to Oz Naturals, and in the evenings, after my derma rolling session I am also using OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given OZ Vitamin C serum a 5 star rating for a few different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1)  The OZ Vitamin C serum does NOT sting my face.  I apply this serum directly after an aggressive 10 minute session of derma rolling when my face is red and the skin is slightly raw.  Even the Skin Ceutical serum stung, but with the Oz serum there is only a slight tingle as my skin is tightening.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I have not developed any allergic rash, welts or bumps&lt;br /&gt;3)  The benefits of the OZ serum seem to be exactly the same as my much more expensive Skin Ceutical serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is why I chose to try the OZ naturals serum.  Before I choose what to purchase I do read through the reviews, almost all of them including any 1, 2, and 3 star reviews.  What I found impressive was that in many of the lower ratings a representative from Oz Naturals would reply under comments, often encouraging any dissatisfied customers to please call and speak directly to the OZ esthetician for personal support and help with the product.  Customer service like this is to be commended.  This shows a willingness to listen, help, and a true belief in their product.  This impressed me enough to choose OZ Naturals over the other high rated serum products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the last part of my lengthy review I would like to share some tips that I have learned both from both my research and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First of all, according to what I&#x27;ve read in many dissatisfied reviews, there is a misconception of what a face serum is used for.&lt;br /&gt;  A serum is NOT a moisturizer.  It has more of a face tightening property.  A good moisturizer should be applied  AFTER the serum has had a few moments to be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) A serum will only help in conjunction with other skin care products and your healthy life-style.  You need to stay hydrated, and get enough sleep, and we all know that sun, stress and environment plays a large part in the health of our skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Think of it as getting ready for a special event.  Buying a new dress is not all that is required for the event.  There are shoes, accessories, a handbag, doing your hair, maybe painting your nails, and perhaps some make-up.  The same is true for skin care products, working all together should get you some positive results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Please don&#x27;t expect miracles within a few days, weeks or even months.  If you think about it, a long fingernail that breaks is not going to grow the full length back in a day, nor is you hair going to grow 2 inches in a few weeks, and I think it&#x27;s unrealistic to believe that someone is going to lose 50 lbs in a month.  Well your skin is no different.  Even with a professional face lift it takes quite a while for your face to heal and lose the numbness.  The collagen in your face takes about a month for the cells to turnover.  There are going to be some better days and worse days in between, but after a month you may see some small improvement,  but usually so small that it&#x27;s only apparent to you.  However, in 4 to 6 months these monthly improvements add up to be significant for others to notice.  So, be diligent in your skin care routine,and be patient.  It will happen, everyone has different issues and needs and therefore experience different time periods before they see all the positive results that they are looking to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have taken the time to read through my rather lengthy review, I hope that it has been helpful, and encouraging.and be patient.

    <li> It&#x27; works. I&#x27;ve had compliments saying your skin looks nice. My face feels  smooth not dry. I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been any improvement to my skin apart from temporary pore reduction.</li>
    <li> My face and neck are moisturized and my skin is brighter. I cannot express how happy I am with OZ Naturals vitamin c serum. It&#x27;s AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is easy to apply and dries very quickly with no sticky residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to try more products from OZ.</li>
    <li> Facial Skin has been softer with daily use.</li>
    <li> Very great for sensitive skin. Helps even my skintone. Really like it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the stuff.  Living in a high desert area that is very, very dry, this serum has rehydrated my skin and turned back the clock by at least ten years.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was NOT paid to write this review, but I DID receive the item from the Oz Naturals free strictly for me to review with my HONEST opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: This serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper for an applicator. When I first received the product I opened it to smell it. The smell isn’t anything special. It doesn’t smell great, but it doesn’t smell terrible. I wish this serum had a citrus scent since it is a Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: As I have mentioned many times before, my face is typically oily, but after I wash it is very dry. The instructions say to wash your face and pat your skin dry before use. It can be used once a day or multiple times a day. It can be used under make up or alone. I used about a half full dropper to cover my face. I drop the product on my hand and spread it all over my face. It dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: After using this product for about a week, I can say that I am very pleased with it. The bottle says to apply moisturizer after using it, but moisturizer isn’t needed. It keeps my face very soft and smooth all day. I use it in the morning when I wake up and at night after a shower. Since I have been using this product I have not had one break out! My skin has remained clear and glowing all week long! My face feels so clean and nourished! This is definitely one of my go-to beauty products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see my full review, click here: [...]</li>
    <li> I have used previously other vitamin C, usually in little blisters that has around 5ml, and they work out perfectly in around 2 weeks or less.&lt;br /&gt;This product, did absolutely nothing on my skin nor after 3 months!!! As soon as I open the blister I started to think weird about it: the color was transparent, when normally is like orange... and second, the consistency it looks like water, when normally it&#x27;s a little bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this product has so many stars and goods reviews (that is why I bought it). And seriously, I prefer to spend a little bit more money but that work out, that not to throw away my money. First and last time I got this product!</li>
    <li> Te first week i started to see bit chancges on my face specially on the uneven areas, like my chicks and forehead. Skin felt very smooht and mosturized. I really liked it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN, IT HELPS WITH DARK SPOTS</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it for a month and found absolutely no difference in my face.  I figured I&#x27;d buy another and try again for another month, this time using it twice a day.  Still no difference.  So I emailed them to ask if perhaps I was using the product wrong.  They said that this product was more effective when using retin-a along with it.  I&#x27;ll be shopping around for another serum.</li>
    <li> It continues to do a great job on my scars.</li>
    <li> Used this product and feel it does supply good things for my skin.  I have experienced some burning sensation around eye area but overall I think it is a good product. Appreciate your prompt service.</li>
    <li> Price is right. I usually use Paul&#x27;s Choice-Resist C15 Super Booster, but it is expensive. I like Paul&#x27;s better my skin feels tighter and brighter. However, what I have decided to do is alternate each month. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; product delivers.  Soft skin, non-greasy &amp; reduced pore size noted after first nite usage &amp; continues to soften &amp; reduce pores w/ usage.  Great product for my sensitive, oily summer face.</li>
    <li> Feels good and &amp;#34;assume&amp;#34; it&#x27;s doing its job.  Probably will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product is very hydrating. Feels like using fresh aloe gel. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> After having used this serum for about a month, I have not noted any improvement whatsoever and am somewhat disappointed.  I could probably use water and get the same results.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference on my skin after finished a whole bottle.  I really want the serum to help fading my freckles but it did nothing.  Don&#x27;t know why there are so many good reviews.  I did not feel any tingling feeling when I applied this serum on my face but I have used 4 bottles of Nufountain Vitamin C 20%, lightening, vitamin C serum before, I definitely felt some tingling feeling.  Even though I did not enjoy the tingling feeling and I did not see any results from the other serum neither.  I don&#x27;t know if no tingling feeling means there is not enough vitamin C in it??  I can&#x27;t be sure about it....but for sure I will keep looking for other brand of vitamin C serum.....hopefully one will work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 and have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I already take good care of my skin but this serum adds smoothness to my complexion.  My skin feels softer and looks a little smoother.  I will reorder and though it&#x27;s a little pricey I believe some things are just worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product does as it says and I only use at night for about  3 weeks now I have seen an improvement  in my face In terms of fine lines on forehead and am in my late 20&#x27;s best to start early. Overall Great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I used the product first before I wrote a review. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I do see my under eyes have gotten a bit brighter and my crows feet have disappeared a bit. A little goes a long way and it is not heavy at all. It&#x27;s very lightweight and soothing as well. I do feel like this dries my skin though. Other than that I use this serum under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this it works just use as directed and success it has all the ingredients needed for your skin</li>
    <li> Tooooooo pricy but works well</li>
    <li> If you read my reviews you know I’m always searching for quality skin care products that don’t irritate my extremely sensitive skin. I’ve found one with this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im thirty (something) and taking care of my skin and looking younger is becoming a priority. I wear very little makeup so my skin matters a lot. Fortunately, this serum helps by making my skin smoother and helps even out tone. It’s easy to use and a very small amount goes a long way. The product is just what I’m looking for: good results with no skin irritation and good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this serum with all of its powerful ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my face...I put in on clean dry skin....then moisturizer and eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it on my hands and I feel like it&#x27;s helping!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. :)))</li>
    <li> Great price, great value.</li>
    <li> Works great. I can tell a huge difference in my dark spots, they have lightened with a week of consistent use</li>
    <li> This is a good product, and my skin likes it. My only hesitation about this is a personal preference: I don&#x27;t like the eye-dropper approach, though I understand why it is packaged this way, being of an oil substance. I, however, much prefer a pump product, or a squeeze-type container. That said, this serum does effectively help moisturize the skin.</li>
    <li> I would recommend the Insta natural Vit. C Serum to anyone who is looking for a brighter complection. I had heard about a vit. C -Hyaluronic combination for ages and finally found one thats affordable. My skin feels tighter &amp; brighter and I feel more attractive and I&#x27;m over 70 so go for it. It can help you too. When you feel attractive you actually are attractive and have more confidence</li>
    <li> This product DARKENED my freckles and DRIED OUT my skin.  After 35 days I asked for a refund.  OZ replied, you must ask in 30 days or less, or we won&#x27;t refund you.  However, OZ&#x27;s website states: &amp;#34;Skin care products can take at least a month to start showing any results, and if the skin is more mature then it will take longer.&amp;#34;  By OZ&#x27;s own admission and encouragement to use its product longer than a month, 30 days is not long enough.  Its 30-day disclaimer is buried deep in its website and took a while to locate.  OZ repeatedly states &amp;#34;satisfaction guaranteed&amp;#34; on Amazon&#x27;s website but, apparently, only if you contact OZ in 30 days or less, which it does not disclose on the Amazon website.  This is deceptive advertising which insults the customer&#x27;s intelligence.  There are better products from others who provide excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product.....as soon as I put it on I just feel the Vitamin C and know it is doing nothing but good things for my face!!</li>
    <li> Love all their products</li>
    <li> noticed no difference in appearance of my skin</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and condition was as described. Thank you. I keep it in the fridge and it feels amazing, but I don&#x27;t see a marked difference.</li>
    <li> This is this kept secret I discovered in a long time. I am a woman of color and my face has improved by 80%. I have been using it for about 45 days now and I am well satisfied. Everyone keeps telling me I&#x27;m looking so much younger, did I have a face lift, and other similar like questions. When I tell them the truth they laugh as if &amp;#34;she&#x27;s so funny&amp;#34;. I love this product and will continue to use it for a long time to come. By the way I&#x27;m 60 y/o,</li>
    <li> I tried this product and I like it very much. I would like to ask another customer what else they use in addition to this because when it is absorbed in my  skin  feels without elasticity.</li>
    <li> While searching for an organic serum, I stumbled upon this on Amazon.  I have been using it for the past couple of months and I just love how it feels on the skin.  I have also noticed how great my skin looks after using it.</li>
    <li> Used it for slightly over a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed no improvement.  The texture is not very pleasant.  At first, I didnt think much of it because as with any kind of cosmetic, your skin takes time to adapt to it but after a few weeks I&#x27;ve actually noticed my skin drying out more than it used it.  A similar dry feeling that you get after you splash water on your face and let it dry.  I had such high hopes for this product given the glowing reviews its had but I should have paid more attention to the critical ones instead.</li>
    <li> I like this product but c&#x27;mon, it was $29 and some change less than a month ago and now it&#x27;s twenty dollars more @ $49 PLUS shipping. When I ordered it a month ago Prime shipping was offered. I&#x27;ll be waiting for the price to come down or will be looking for another brand of Vitamin C Serum. Sheeeesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it two stars because of the tremendous price hike!!</li>
    <li> This is very good, I like it</li>
    <li> Love it !! My skin looked brighter and younger within the 1st week of use. Non - greasy feeling. Will definitely keep buying!</li>
    <li> THE BEST. Use sunscreen after.</li>
    <li> satisfied with this item, it was actually the third bottle</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t write reviews, and I have not yet begun to use the product, but from what I have heard and read, I believe it will be a wonderful addition to a beauty regimin.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Not too sure about this stuff. I used it faitfully, even took pics for the before and after. No change as far as I could tell..</li>
    <li> My sister told me about this serum.  I have not been using this product for very long, but I do like the feel of my skin after applying.  It feels taught, smooth and a bit dry.  Followed up by moisturizing sunscreen, it leaves a nice texture to my skin.  I will keep using this product and bought some for my daughters.</li>
    <li> I think they are selling water and glycerine and fooling people. It was like applying water on face.Worthless buy after reading all reviews !</li>
    <li> Any product with \\&quot;OZ\\&quot;  in the name is clearly banking on anything that Dr Oz claims in his show. Dr Oz  himself claims that anyone who is trying to sell a product based on his name is a scam! Plus he only recommends 3-10% C in any serum! It doesn&#x27;t seem like this product is true quality. It made my face dry and break out. If a product is going to claim OZ, my guess would also be \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; is a possibility as well. Buyer beware!!! Do not use this brand!</li>
    <li> I broke out a little the first week but then that stopped.  haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable  benefits yet though.  Used it every morning for 2 mths</li>
    <li> love this product I bought it with a derma roller and found I was getting much better results than without very soft and easy to apply, smells amazing not too heavy</li>
    <li> Item has a foul odor to it.  I used it twice and had to throw it away.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well to moisturizer but not greasy. Light weight goes on smooth so you can wear under makeup. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I use this under sunscreen to maximize sun protection. I am only 26 so I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles, only like two fine lines under the eyes. They are still there so it won&#x27;t get rid of everything. I can feel it tightening my face every time I put it on so I feel like it is a great preventative measure.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It definitely brightens your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My 45 yr old face looks better and brighter after using this serum. After washing my face, I use toner, then apply this serum, and last I apply my expensive Algenist moisturizer. Since I started using this serum,  I find that I am able to use less of my expensive Algenist moisturizer. I&#x27;m very impressed and will keep ordering this!</li>
    <li> Love this serum......got rid of some of my sun spots.  I also love the fact that they are cruelty-free which is important to me.  I try to buy more natural products as much aa I  can.</li>
    <li> In my honest opinion, I believe this product is no better then any of the C+hyaluronic mix serums I have tried ( I think 4 so far).  Frankly it works well in the beginning and your able to feel the tightening on the skin then lock it in with moisturizer.  But after a few weeks it looses its tightening effects and I didn&#x27;t notice any other benefits.  I think I just like the idea of putting vitamins into my skin in serum form.  No adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> Hello all...I am happy to report, my face feels healthy. The oz vitamin c serum really works great. I wash my face, then apply the serum, use your favorite m</li>
    <li> In the world of Vitamin C Serums it has vastly grown this past year and I have tried many, some I have loved and some I am not so impressed with but when i tried the Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum I was sold!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear based serum, mostly gel like and in the form of a pump bottle for easy convenience, it has no smell&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I first wash my face and apply a coinciding serum with other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Feels cooling on the skin and a small amount of tightness in areas like my cheeks and neck but not anything uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains a relatively unknown ingredient called astaxanthin, which is now believed to be the most potent antioxidant nature has to offer which has the ability to defend against the suns damage and boost your collagen level and improve skins tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been seeing a vast improvement in my skins texture with firmness and suppleness.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this as an addition to my normal sunscreen to protect my skin from damaging sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is one serum I would definitely recommend you try it&#x27;s highly rated!!</li>
    <li> This product really works! I would highly recommend this product to buyers especially with aging concerns.</li>
    <li> I love the way my face and neck feel when I use this (every morning before any other product.)  It makes your skin feel hydrated and refreshed, not oily or heavy.  I think it helps with fine lines and uneven tone, but mostly, I just love the refreshing way it feels.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me about this bc I was complaining that my skin was looking old and wrinkly (I am 36 and love the outdoors and I surf). She swore by this product. I ordered and I am not kidding, I noticed a difference immediately, after one application the next day my skin looked a little brighter, now 3 weeks late by skin looks vibrant, fresh and has a glow. I have received many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything under the sun with little not no change - I am a believer that product works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 3 weeks but I do feel it is helping my skin.  I have noticed smoother feeling skin and better color.  I think,however, the full effects of the serum takes much longer than the few weeks that I have been using it.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a really impressive product. Does not irritate my skin and I have noticed a difference after 30 days. Smoother complexion and I am now ready for a no make-up summer tan!</li>
    <li> Not good for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this daily since late-dec (more than half way done with my first bottle). still contemplating on whether or not i should repurchase. haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet so maybe i should repurchase and give it some more time to see if i&#x27;ll get the results other reviewers have noticed?</li>
    <li> I am going to be 54 this month and my aging skin needed a little help. I not only have some deep lines but I had dark areas that really bothered me. I don&#x27;t think I have been using this serum for a month and the dark areas are gone and the lines look better. Overall my slin looks younger, more even toned and much brighter. I wish I had taken before and after pictures to show the improvement. I do watch what I eat and use very good organic products on my skin which plays a big part in how my skin looks. Thisproduct was the answer to my problem areas and then some!&lt;br /&gt;  Another great thing about this product is the customer service. I was unsure about how much to use. The bottle says a small amount, or something like that. I wanted to know how many drops to use so I contacted their customer service. Not only did I get an immediate response but I got three responses all very detailed and helpful. To be fair I think I sent two different emails, one through their web site and one through Amazon but the response was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;  I use 5 drops every night after washing my face and using toner. After that I put moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I took a picture of my face before starting this treatment.  I will take another picture at one month and then 3 months.  That will be how I decide if I&#x27;m going to continue, but it seems good so far.  I&#x27;m also trying a derma roller a couple times a week and using this as my nutritional treatment to follow.</li>
    <li> I had a facial from a professional medical aestetician (gift certificate!) and I asked her what is the most important thing for face care if I don&#x27;t want to have 5 different steps to do every day and she said the MOST important thing is to have Vitamin C on your face every day to help heal the free radical damage and that it had to be 20% potency to have any effect. AND she said that Hyaluronic Acid was the best and most natural form of moisturizer.  Then she tried to sell me one Vitamin C cream and one Hyaluronic Acid serum for $60 each - $120 total.  So - instead I went on Amazon and found this serum for $30 that has BOTH.  And I love that it is all natural and as organic as possible.  When I ordered it I received an email with detailed instructions on how to use it and an email after I got it following up to see if I had any questions - so great customer service!  And I LOVE the serum - I have tried so many moisturizers and face creams and they all feel yucky or oily or cloggy or itchy on my skin and make me want to wash my face - and this serum feels so GOOD on my skin!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It is so lightweight and feels great on.  It dissolves well into the skin, and can be worn under moisturizer and foundation or alone.  My skin looks brighter and more refreshed since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Love this!</li>
    <li> Fabulous! LOVE this serum! If you want truly healthier and younger looking skin NATURALLY then I recommend trying this product. Honestly anything from OZ Naturals is great and when you use all of them as a daily routine the your skin will look better in no time. I honestly saw a difference after using the entire Oz Natural line the first time! I don&#x27;t even where makeup anymore to feel extra confident. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;ll have an occasional pimple or blemish but nothing like it was prior to using Oz Naturals products to my face. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum based on other reviews, and love it...I noticed smoother, brighter skin within a few days. It goes on light and you just need a small amount. It comes in a yellow glass bottle with the dropper, which makes it very easy to get just the right amount that you need.  I will reorder this again!</li>
    <li> still working on my bottle</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to use this product a lot, but seems to be doing a good job.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in the daytime before my moisturizer and feel like it has helped brighten my skin and give me more a glow.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it is incredibly difficult to find products that don&#x27;t give me reactions and or breakouts. Having an extremely fair completion makes this problem even more frustrating because every spot and blotch stands out and takes forever to fully fade away. This serum is not only gentle and non irritating, but it has definitely improved the clarity and texture of my skin, and repaired quite a bit of damage. My skin is finally getting back to its beautiful porcelain glow. I am so pleased with this product an it is now a permanent part of my very carefully put together daily beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I used this product, as soon as i applied it to my face and neck. it makes my face glow and I feel like my face is stretching a little bit so after applying this you need to follow up with moisturizer. I am fond of products that have little or no scent (unscented) so, it is a plus that this vitamin serum has no foul odor.  I will recommend using this product because it has a good effect. I will make a follow up review once I see my dark spots fades.</li>
    <li> I thought I was reordering the same product. The formula was changed and it broke out my skin. Sad and dishonest!</li>
    <li> As I am an older woman with sun damaged skin and this product has given me softer skin already. I look forward to continue using it.</li>
    <li> SERUM IS THINNER THAN THE GREEN LABEL HYALURONIC ACID PLUS C. HAVEN&#x27;T USED IT BUT TWO DAYS ONLY. WILL COMMENT AFTER 30 DAYS.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the great reviews. I used his product for about 3 weeks twice daily under my moisturizer as the directions stated.  I could not tell any difference as from before I started using it.</li>
    <li> I used 4 bottles of the product with no result so I stopped. I moved on to try ROC and Olay. Then I  notice my skin started to show sign of aging, sagging cheeks and fine lines under eyes started to stretch out even further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventhough this Oz Naturals Vitamin C+ HA didn&#x27;t improve my skin, I believe that at very least it did help slowing down the inevitable aging process.</li>
    <li> Used in concert with OZ Naturals Facial Moisturizer, this product appears to be smoothing fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really do anything for me and certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have not tried other brands of vitamin C serum so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this too but it worked well for me. It&#x27;s not an oil or a lotion and it does not moisturize on it&#x27;s own. It&#x27;s like thick water. It takes some practice to apply without wasting any. Once it dries I apply my usual moisturizer over it. My skin appeared smoother, brighter, and with improved texture.</li>
    <li> Am pleased with Oz Natural Serum. Oz Natural Serum does not irritate by skin. I have roscea so I have to be careful what products I use. I would reccomend this product for people with senstive skin.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of this serum for free to try and review. I have really loved what it is doing for my skin. It feels softer and more supple, even now that the weather is getting warmer. I definitely see more of a glowing, brighter skin tone. I do not have any dark spots, so I cannot comment on that part. I have enjoyed using this and would likely by it when this bottle is done.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to be my cure all for &amp;#34;fine lines.&amp;#34;  I guess at 57 that&#x27;s asking for a miracle within a jar without going under the knife.  This may work well for those in their 30&#x27;s, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients that I need.  Yes, my face felt soft, but that&#x27;s as far as it went; that&#x27;s why I gave one star.  Would I buy again, no.  Would I recommend to others my age: no.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She says it seems to be doing OK, however it seems a little thin and seems to dissipate quickly into her skin leaving it a bit dry, She also prefers a nice scent when applying any skin products and this has no smell at all. Overall, seems average.</li>
    <li> Dr oz always talk like he is sure of his products so I will wait and see d result before I can rate</li>
    <li> I initially bought this to lighten dark spots but so far have not seen any results. I do think it has improved my skin in some way but I was hoping that the c serum would lighten like the product info said it would.</li>
    <li> I like it.  I have no idea if it does anything, it feels good;  I think it locks in moisture and works well under foundations etc.  I does not get flakey which is a good thing.  If you think vitamin C is good for your skin, this is highly regarded by most reviewers.  I am 62 and have normal - not terribly dry or sensitive skin.  I have not felt any stinging with this. I find that face lotions in the &#x27;aging skin&#x27; category are too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin with freckles and I&#x27;m getting some red and crusty spots...I&#x27;m scared about this for skin cancer. I have only been using this product for 2 weeks and already the spots have diminished..not gone completely but it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not mean you shouldn&#x27;t go have yourself checked by a Dermatologist periodically. But this seems to have a very good effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offering it on your site.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about two months now.  It seems to be working OK!  Don&#x27;t see any major results.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum arrived in a bubble wrap envelope. The product wasn&#x27;t boxed or sealed which seemed odd. I tried a few drops on my hand and it wasn&#x27;t like a serum at all. It was like water, no oil present. I cleansed my face and applied the serum which immediately dried on my skin like water. Since I&#x27;ve been using another vitamin c serum I wanted to give this product a chance and have been using it twice a day for about a month. No results at all. I truly think this isn&#x27;t a serum at all. I will never order this product again. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and I am impressed with it.  Upon application, you can feel the serum firming and tightening your face.  I have very good skin already, however I feel that this product is helping to make it better.&lt;br /&gt;It is also economically price, similar products cost more.  I&#x27;ve tried many skin products, this will be a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other Vitamin C serums, and this one feels the best on my face.  Serum came crystal clear and is not too thin, not too thick, and soaks into skin well.</li>
    <li> I just received the serum and have been using it for about a week.  I use it every night before bed, my skin seems to be taking on a brighter look, I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum is a very nice product - leaves my skin feeling really soft and bright.  I would buy again for sure</li>
    <li> Like many others who have reviewed here, and after  considering the multiple options available,I approached this product with some skepticism. That was  an unnecessary waste of energy! The product performs as promised, and I say this as a mature male who is very attentive to his skin. Considering the performance and price point of this item, don&#x27;t hesitate. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> youth in a bottle. Tightens, tones, evens out to produce smooth skin.  This is the ONE PRODUCT I can say actually works....and immediately at that! Just be sure to follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t taken care of my skin as I should for several months.  Decided to go a step further because of the absence of care and add this to my wash, toner, and moisturizer step.  Before under my eyes were like crepe paper texture(no kidding) and my eye lids were about the same. The winter has taken its toll and my face looked dehydrated.  I have only used this for a week and I see 100% change.  My face has tighten and firmed.  It feels so good and looks great.  Under my eyes have changed as well.  When I apply eye shadow my eye lids are plump and healthy, no longer lifeless and flappy skin.  I will definitely continue to use this - ITS A KEEPER!!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what they say it does and more!!  I am 56 and have tried every product on the market over the years.  THIS STUFF IS AMAZING in every way!!</li>
    <li> Not really to sure yet it has only been a week however my skin is soft after use make sure to use a moisturizer after wards.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best, it is amazing, I USE IT DAILY. I have use Clinique dark spot, Skin Brightners on my face  to remove a bad ugly scar (burn) from Child Birth. I believe I have found the product that works best for me. I am stuck on this one, after using The Best Vitamin C Serum for 2 Months my scar is less noticeable, I love it, Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this. I typically read rave reviews from other women, specifically about serums and oils, and think &amp;#34;hmm, they must have already had the skin of a beautiful, fairytale princess prior to trying the product if it didn&#x27;t make their face oily or sticky&amp;#34;...as they ALWAYS make my own skin oily, sticky, and unpleasant. This, however, is a major WIN! It literally absorbs COMPLETELY within minutes. Does it make my face LOOK better? Not a daggum clue, probably not. It doesn&#x27;t immediately rid you of blemishes, blackheads, large pores, or anything (from my own experience) but it DOES do an EXCELLENT job at making my face married</li>
    <li> Not sure. Feels like water. The safety seal on the bottle I received did not completely seal the bottle, and could easily have the top unscrewed. Was a little scared to use when I saw it. Not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Started using this about a month ago.  I have see a tremendous difference in the brightness of my skin.  I use it every night after cleansing.</li>
    <li> The product seems good.  I have only used it for two weeks so it is a little early to tell.  I will continue to use it hopefully see some results.  I know that I can&#x27;t expect miracles but even a little better will be helpful.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I was looking to fade sun damage/ age spots and one week in I can already see a difference. Easy to apply and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived promptly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> After just two weeks I had started to notice dramatic results with the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Serum has been helped create a facial luminescence.. it arrived quickly. The dropper botle works ok but a flat sponge applicator might be more useful.</li>
    <li> I like the serum a lot as it has helped me get back the healthy looking texture on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I think it is helping.  My wrinkles do not appear to be so deep.</li>
    <li> excellent product i love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for several months and I only have positive feedback regarding it. I have combination skin it is dry in some areas and oily in others. It&#x27;s frustrating to say the least. My skin is very sensitive also. I found with using this product #1 it did NOT cause my skin to sting at all. #2 No redness. Now, for me those are big pluses that very few products have provided. #3 This product has improved the overall tone of my skin. Now this takes some time. That did not happen overnight. And months after I began using this I&#x27;m still noting changes. I like how my skin feels after I apply this serum. My skin feels noticeably tighter minutes after usage. I use it at night and some mornings too. I wash my face, use oz naturals ocean mineral tonic, this serum, then a moisturizer. This little regimen works well for me. I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I am using this to clear up acne scars and prevent future break outs. Just after a week I see a drastic difference in my skin. The tone is more even and my skin feels smooth. I pair this product Glytone Glycolic Acid moisturizer by applying the serum first and moisturizer second.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product at first, but after time, it seemed to tighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> Nothing extraordinary with this serum. I have been using it for 2 weeks and is not different from any other serum bought in stores.</li>
    <li> 2nd time around ordering this and yes it does seem to be helping - I&#x27;m 67 and seems to help soften wrinkles</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so awful. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I have been dreading using it. Buyer beware! Smells like fish oil and have seen no results only complaints from my boyfriend that it smells disgusting and I couldn&#x27;t agree more. Find another vitamin c serum !! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not using this product anymore</li>
    <li> This stuff really is of high quality. I will definitly keep buying this one its a great price and works super good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 and I bought this product mainly because of the raving review other people posted and at the suggestion of a friend. I have to say, this is the most amazing product I have ever tried. I noticed dramatic change to my skin after 1 use. I woke up the next morning my skin was glowing and flawless. It totally rejuvenated my skin and made it more dewy and even. I will use this from now on and it will become an integral part of my skin care routine. One thing for people who use asian skincare regimens, where you use Toner-&amp;#62; Softener -&amp;#62; Serum-&amp;#62; Moisturizer &amp;etc, the vitamine c serum is best when applied after the softener (If you use it in your routine, some do not), because the softener actually prepares your skin by enhancing the treatment that follows. (The softener enhances later products&#x27; absorption rate) and don&#x27;t forget, as suggested by seller, use a high quaiity moisturizer afterwards to protect the vitamine c serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about using it twice a day, but I have not decided if that is too much yet.. We&#x27;ll See!</li>
    <li> I was about to renew a purchase with an existing pyramid/network marketing cosmetic company, but saw this had such good reviews I decided to try this instead.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality. Not only does my skin feel great and smooth, it also appears to clear up small breakouts too. I saw a comment about dryness...I top this with a moisturizer at night; I believe the bottle even says to do that. This is *significantly* cheaper than the products I was using and seems to work even better.  I&#x27;ve handed my current bottle over to my teenage son for his minor acne and within one day he seems to be clearing up as well.  If you buy the 1 oz bottle first, that is not a bad amount of money to test with. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and am about halfway through the bottle, so you can guess a 1 oz bottle every 4-6 months?  Not too bad if you ask me!</li>
    <li> I loved this vitamin c serum.  I didn&#x27;t have any improvements in my skin but maybe you just have to use it for a longer period of time.  Would tell others to try it and see what their skin showed</li>
    <li> I have been using this a month and see a big difference in my skin. I love it and will buy it agan</li>
    <li> Last year I had an expensive facial and was told to use a vitamin c serum that cost $100. I checked on Amazon and found OZ Naturals for a much less costly sum. I have been very happy with the product and have reordered. It really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now.  The consistency has always been liquidy but the last order that came in was thicker. When I put it on, it left my face feeling sticky and not the usual feeling where the serum is quickly absorbed by my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if you reformulated this product but the previous formula was better. This new formula feels like I&#x27;m wearing a mask and my skin feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken a photo of the two bottles. The new one I recently purchased is on the right.</li>
    <li> I chose this because i saw the rate about many kinds of serum.&lt;br /&gt;So many people have recommended Oz.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my skin really fast and you will not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After several time i feel  my skin watery.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> As always, when I buy a new product that has lots of promises, I usually make my final decision based on peer reviews.  After reading many positive comments, I ordered this Vitamin C Serum.  I followed the directions emailed to me, washed my face in the evening and applied a thin layer to dry, cleaned skin.  There was no strange odors, and the product seemed to absorb very quickly leaving no residual feel.  Before I even got out of bed the following morning, I remembered trying the new product and ran my fingers over my face and noticed how soft my skin felt.  Even though it was 5:30am, when I looked in the mirror, my skin appeared fresh and had a nice glow.  Of course I was excited to repeat the protocol in the evening, and when applying the product that night, I was tempted to use more for two reasons:  One because my skin looked and felt great all day, and secondly, because it just feels and absorbs so nicely.  But as the directions say, less is more.  I&#x27;ll be happy to report back after a solid month of using this product to see if in fact I continue to benefit and rave over this product, but I already have a feeling I&#x27;ll be placing another order soon if not for myself, then for a friend or family member to try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times over the past year, I loved it, it worked well. They&#x27;ve revised the formula and it&#x27;s completely different than the previous formula. It&#x27;s horrible, it sits on the skin like a mask does, it dried it didn&#x27;t absorb.  I used my moisturizer after the serum,  I started to basically get little product pills rubbing off the skin,  like a mask or glue.  So so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. Have noticed a nice suppleness in my skin. I would recommend this product. Hope you like it also</li>
    <li> Im 61 and not seeing much yet..might be to old!! Will keep using and see what happens!! No side affects...</li>
    <li> I have no idea who is paid to write these great reviews but it is a scam!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have bought many different types of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid product and they clearly have a smell, color and even acidic taste to them - this is like water.  Do not buy- someone is making lots of money on water in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months!  At least 3 months at this point.  I only use this once a day at night and I&#x27;ve noticed no major changes.  I wanted to use this for 2 purposes: 1. wrinkle prevention 2. brightening hyperpigmentation.  I&#x27;ve noticed no changes in either after religiously using this every night.  I honestly do not know what the fuss is about.  I know a lot of people write positive reviews in order to receive a free bottle but that is only worth it if this stuff works.</li>
    <li> It seems okey. Used one bottle and did not see results. May be one bottle is not enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s been two weeks and my skin look brighter and clearer. Follow the directions and wear sun screen to see full results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Use a small amount under eyes combined with Shea butter to get rid of dark circles</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery. I received it only a couple of days after placing the order. My skin became smoother, less wrinkles! Remember to put on sunblock after applying this serum since it contains vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product. I wish there was a way I could sell it because I now have my mother, mother&#x27;s co-worker, sister and friend using it. I have cystic acne and scars from the acne and this (in just a few weeks) not only reduced the scars but helped the cysts go away without cortisone shots! I am somewhat of a self-proclaimed hoarder when it comes to skin care products, however, this product has changed my skin and confidence in just a matter of weeks. Obviously, it will work differently for each person, however, I highly recommend trying it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Did nothing at all. Used as directed along with recommended pills. No results. Wasted my hard earned money... I work too hard to waste it on useless products</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for his product.. but unfortunately I am disappointed.  There wasn&#x27;t any changes whether bad nor good</li>
    <li> I find this product very drying and tight on my face. I have used vit c serums for yearsand this one did not compare well to the other at all. I bought it for the price but next time I will buy my usual even though it cost more. I guess it&#x27;s true. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum made my skin smoother and younger looking.I put it on before bed and it is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Feels like water. Goes on ok, but I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.  I only been using this for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Love all the natural ingredients in this product and instantly after you apply my skin tightens and glows. I am 65 and get compliments on my skin. Will be using this product for long time. Vitamin C serum was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> quick delivery/made my face look more clear,my skin look more healthy, and has a nice shine(not in a bad way). will purchase again to see what continued use will do.</li>
    <li> it works great, but oh man does it make my skin peel. It&#x27;s very strong and it does its job. I have seen my skin get really light after using it. I used it while i also got microdermabrasion so double peelign.</li>
    <li> I have tried other vitamin C serums in the past.  This is the best!  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I like it or not. How can one tell if it&#x27;s working? All I know is that it absorbs even before i have a chance to rub it in. I use high quality, medical grade products on my face (Obagi, tretinoin) and thought I would try this because of the raves on it. I honestly see/feel no difference or improvement.</li>
    <li> It is healthy for you.  Our daughter said it really works to reduce wrinkles.  She looks 20 years younger. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great serum which gives my face a nice glow after using it for just a few days, I can also see a very nice glow on my earlobes after using this serum. It absorbs into my skin right away leaving my face feeling very moisturized. After applying a few drops I waited a few minutes before following-up with my moisturizer, after which my face is very moisturized and supple. I have another great serum that I have been using for years so I compared the effects after using both serums and realized that this serum gives me a nicer glow so I will definitely repurchase. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after finishing this bottle. Customer service is also great. Thank You.</li>
    <li> Loving the results while using this in addition to the Jan Marini skin care line &amp; my derma roller 1.0 mm</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was listed as one of the best sellers and had tons of great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, when I use this product,  I do not see any difference at all. It absorbs quickly without hydrating or moisturizing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many vitamin C serums from Sephora so I am very well aware of skin care stuff... but this product is not &amp;#34;SERUM&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s more closer to water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t include return receipt or any printed document, so I am not sure how to return this.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and  grateful to get instructions in my email as to the best use of this product, especially since it is new to me.  Well, I like the product a lot.  This is my first use and I can see big differences already.  It was well-packaged and arrived on time as well.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It is just what I was looking for at an AMAZING price.  I already told my friends and they ordered it as well!</li>
    <li> My skin was looking dry and cracked and needed help.  I thought I would give this serum a try and see if it worked.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!  I have been using it a little over a week now and my skin is looking better and better each day.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face every morning. I can not say that I have noticed any changes but I do get a lot of compliments on my skin and that is new! So... I guess it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any side effect issues, only starting using it around a week ago and I do see a big difference in the way my face texture has changed.  Looking forward to more results.</li>
    <li> I just received the product, so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of it yet (will update at a later date), but the customer service is exceptional.  As soon as the product is mailed out, you get an email telling you the best way to use the product, and they are always there for any questions.  Thanks OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> Within a couple of days of using it on a day when I was stressed and sleep deprived I got the comment from a friend: &amp;#34;You look so fresh and well today!&amp;#34; I am not kidding. This stuff is amazing! My skin is smooth and soft and looks refreshed. I gave this to my mom to use and she got the same result within days when I coworker made a similar comment about her looks. I use it twice a day and also use a Vitamin B Serum for additional moisture. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I chose this vitamin C serum because I was looking old and tired after a long Wisconsin winter.  I put it on at night, and follow with a good moisturizer.  After only two weeks I can see a difference!  My wrinkles are not as noticeable, and my face is smoother, noticeably less stressed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> im 21 yrs old and had a bad reaction to the acne product differin.  It made the skin around my eyes and mouth waayyyy darker than the rest. It was irritated amd just horrible!! I tried this and immediately noticed my skin got tighter. after a few days I noticed tge irritation was completely gone and the daek spots were fading. every few days inotice fading and it has been a month!!! iwill continue to use this even after the spots are gone because it makes ur skin look and feel better overall!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve tried several products in my lifetime, under eye creams that cost $80 and serums that cost $200. However, none have yet to give me the results I&#x27;ve received with Oz Naturals! I had begun to develop dark circles around my eyes as well as lose collagen. Within a week I have noticed a drastic improvement. I look so much more alive and fresh! I will be purchasing another bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to help rejuvenate my skin a little and maybe help some fine lines also I have a son with a recent facial scar that I have been putting it on there to maybe lighten it a bit. I feel like its water in a bottle, I use it on a daily basis and the bottle is just about gone and I have seen not a single result for the money it cost and the results that I have not seen I would not recommend this to anyone for any purpose. I hope to find another product out there that really does what it says its going to do. This was a rip off!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product approximately 7 weeks ago, it arrived quickly and as advertised.  After using it for this entire time, I have discovered the following, and this is how it worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly dry skin, with the occasional blemish, some freckles and some fine lines (I&#x27;ve been really lucky in that sense).  Since my skin is 40(-ish), it is also temperamental and can turn on me in a matter of seconds, so I have to be cautious when trying new skin products.  This does not stop me in the slightest from trying new skin products, but I do have to be cautious... otherwise I might have a *slight* reaction which gives me an angry red rash all over my cheeks just in time for the Marine Corps ball, but that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted in some previous reviews, this serum does seem to absorb quickly into my skin, so I started to use a bit more than I initially tried and had better results.  My skin feels pretty good after I use this product, but it still needs additional moisture, so after it&#x27;s fully absorbed I follow it up immediately with a moisturizer.  I do this because I personally find it beneficial for my own skin type, but it may be something that others can consider doing for sufficient moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like how this serum is affecting my skin as it&#x27;s softer and seems to have a better complexion.  If this changes as time goes on, I will update this review to reflect those changes.</li>
    <li> Nothing major. Overhyped.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, not a strong fragrence. Have noticed some clearing of spots</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful I love every night I put on my skin and my skin radiant  will not let you use it</li>
    <li> I have fair, sensitive skin and the beginnings of crows feet when I smile big and 2 horizontal lines on my forehead (31 years old). I decided to try this because of the great reviews. I used it for the past month and noticed that my skin looks great and on a few occasions noticed no lines. I also noticed in photos taken at a work party this week that my skin looks more like it did when I was in my early to mid 20s! I am ordering another bottle right now and decided to post a review since I actually used the product. I don&#x27;t like when people post reviews after just receiving a product a few days prior because it&#x27;s hard to tell results for a face serum after only a few days.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the large number of positive reviews for it.  Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me but I used the product for 4 weeks exactly as described and then started using it morning and night and putting on a lot more for 2 more weeks and still have not noticed any difference at all.  It is as thin as water but feels a little sticky when I apply it.  I only have fine lines so I would expect that they would be less noticeable but I think they are actually more noticeable recently.  Also, note that it says your money will be refunded with no questions asked if it doesn&#x27;t work, but apparently that simply means you can return it with in the standard Amazon 30 day window for returns.  After that, they will not refund it even though it says you need to use it for at least 30 days to see results.  So, if you aren&#x27;t seeing any difference after 3.5 weeks, make sure to return it then.  Edited to add an update:  Because I take posting negative reviews for a product seriously, I continued using this product for 11 months to see if there would be any improvement over time. I still did not notice any difference. So, it may work for some but didn&#x27;t work for me and I have switched back to using Olay Regenerist Serum which worked better for me.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference after a month of use.  I&#x27;ve been using Skin Eternal and I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
    <li> I have used half the bottle but don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in the texture of my complexion.  Light, non-greasy, has no fragrance, which are all good things but I don&#x27;t see any difference one way or the other.</li>
    <li> it seems to be alright haven&#x27;t used it much. to much to do all time and in hurry to get some stuff done. sorry thank you</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t change my skin at all.i am not going to buy it again.there are better products on market. I used philosophy vit c powder,liked it better</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is working or not (even after using it for the past two months) and it feels to watery, not gel like.</li>
    <li> The very first application made my face feel so soft and supple.  I use it every morning before I  apply anything else on my clean face.  It will last forever!!!!  Wonderful delivery, and so on time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.It hydrates so well. Not greasy and does don&#x27;t make me break out. My skin feels and looks great since using. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is a thinner solution than expected but a much bigger bottle. It goes on nice and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to get in a better habit of taking care of my skin while Im young (25). I use this at night after I cleanse and use witch hazel. Its been about 2 months of doing this routine. I generally have bad breakouts before my period and this has drastically changed that. Yes I have a tiny pimple here and there but Ill just chalk that up to stress... Over all I will continue to purchase this because I have seen a change in my skins clarity and glow.</li>
    <li> I like the Vitamin C serum because it works well and is a good price for the results you get.  I use it after cleansing my face and have noticed decreased pore size and a brighter complexion.  It not only helps tone my face, but also condition it.  As long as the price stays reasonable, I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used it, I could notice the effect on my face. Applies smoothly and a small amount goes a long way. Great product</li>
    <li> Not for sensitive skin..!! Totally broke me out! Way too strong for my sensitive skin..</li>
    <li> After two months of usage the product was so stinky, I could not and did not want to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Daily application of OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum is like repaving your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture and smoothness of the face and throat visibly improved within two weeks of consistent a.m. and p.m. Consistency is key. Skin clarity improved and the appearance of fine lines drastically decreased. Unlike other serums, this product is not sticky on the fingertips nor the face. Consequently, application closest to the skin after cleansing, and before another daytime or nighttime moisturizer is ideal. Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C are ingredients that A-listers claim in their beauty arsenal, and understandably so. If you are looking for an positive return on investment, consider investing your dollars into products like this with active ingredients, aka actives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, tightly replace the top after each use to avoid spillage. By mistake, I left the cap loose and lost an entire glass bottle in my makeup bag. In the meantime of my replacement shipment, I could actually see and feel the previous dull texture resurfacing. This is a must-have anti-aging jewel.</li>
    <li> I bought several of the Oz products&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was Dr Oz&lt;br /&gt;I googled it, ect and then read here this was not Dr Oz&lt;br /&gt;But why name it Oz? I think it&#x27;s a clever way to get attention for sure. I just read ten reviews and one person thinks it&#x27;s Dr Oz lol&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will update as I use these more and more, but I just think using Oz in the name is clever, maybe tricky. As my first impression was it was Dr Oz line.  Clever girl that created these!!</li>
    <li> I have used this every day since I bought it weeks ago.  I just don&#x27;t see enough improvement to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used it seceral times and saw a difference. Helps heal skin</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum&lt;br /&gt;My experience buying the serum was good.  I have been using it for a week now.&lt;br /&gt;I do not expect miracles, but I feel confortable using it.&lt;br /&gt;What I appreciated most was your e mail with instructions</li>
    <li> Love it! So inexpensive compare to other brands but it works amazingly! My skin is smooth and glowing after using this serum. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Still trying this to see if it makes a difference</li>
    <li> I use this every day and I am very pleased with the results.  It keeps the moisture in my face and not sitting on the surface</li>
    <li> Someone told me how good Vitamin C is to face complexion. I decided to buy this and I do see why this person told me that. I feel my face much smoother. AS far as lines I have yet to see them diminish. Probably that will happen with the second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have bought and tried many vitamin C products over the years.  Few did what was promised.  My skin feels and looks beautiful!! I will never be without this product.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Seems pretty good. Wish it was in a pump container instead of a dropper</li>
    <li> Excellent product; I&#x27;ve been using daily, and I can feel it working.  My wife particularly likes these natural results, and she is happy to protect her skin as well.</li>
    <li> I saw results after the first use. Evened skin tone and reduced fine lines around my eyes. A little goes a long way. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  I noticed a difference after the first few days of using this product.  I was skeptical but now I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used a couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin.  Love the combination of Vitamin C and Hylauronic acid.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was werry fast...I just gat this product it is hard to say how work on skin.this is my 3 day to use,so far skin looks werry soft</li>
    <li> To my surprise, this really works. I have never used anything other than regular cream and this made a huge difference for me.  It only took two applications and I could easily see the difference on my neck and cheek area.  This bottle will last me at least six months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, noticed a difference after only a few days application. I will continue to use this product. The price was good and a must have serum.</li>
    <li> Meh.....I like the Skin Obsession Vitamin C Serum better!</li>
    <li> the reason why i give it a five star rating is because my comment can be on the top and be seen. yes i have purchased the OZ naturals vitamin c and my feedback about this product is not so good its only strong in the first two uses but then you barely see the results after that. I found another product which stays stronger and the results are instant EVERY TIME YOU USE IT and its called mad hippie vitamin C serum and i&#x27;m going to stay on it for life because its that good. the reason why OZ naturals has sooo many rating and purchases is because of the Dr OZ show, I am sure he gets a profit in mentioning to look for a vitmin C serum with only 20 % in it or some bogus nonsense like that. i&#x27;m just upset that i spent money on this and have to wait until I finish it so I can go back in using mad hippie&#x27;s products again, but other then that i hope this review helps someone.</li>
    <li> After 30 day&#x27;s you see some results,</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have oily skin and since I&#x27;ve started using this serum I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not breaking out as much and when I do it helps dry out the pimples. You only need two or three drops for your face and neck</li>
    <li> I received the shipment with no problem. I think OZ will be great to work with if I order this product again. I have been using it for a week and a half and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my face. Maybe softer but that is about it. My fine lines did not soften at all. I will keep using it to see if I see any difference. Thank you for contacting me. Marleen</li>
    <li> The product is unbelievable. My skin is glowing. My pores and overall skin tone has improved from the first use. It does not cause breakouts, but instead clears your skin from the inside out. I&#x27;ve had the product less than two weeks. I&#x27;ve already rid of my costly products that lacks in comparison. I&#x27;ve tried it on my skin and cuticles. It even improves my other skin products. I mix half a drop of this product or less, with a dab of st Ives collagen moisturizer, a dab of herbal aloe force- skin gel. I apply it to my face after cleansing. I follow with ponds clarant b3 ( travel size). These items worked awesome before but the OZ Naturals gave me the boost I&#x27;ve been looking for. I have barely worn makeup since this serum arrived. My skin improves daily so I feel comfortable wearing my natural skin.  I use it under my make up or alone in the am and night. It feels awesome on my skin and everyday my skin looks better.  This item gives your skin a glow that you don&#x27;t want to cover with makeup. My smile wrinkles are looking better, despite all the smiling I&#x27;m doing these days thanks to OZ. I have challenging skin than can easily go from mild to severe. After decades of chasing products, I realized the ones that work have harsh consequences later. And every all natural product is not right for every person. But for me I am glad I can stop looking. Not to mention the bottle comes sealed, with a two year expiration date. A little is all you need, and you can use the excess on other parts of your body. It&#x27;s mostly organic and made in the USA. The bottle top does not leak after opening. Which is important when traveling. Balances oily skin without over drying also. My skin no longer has acne under the skin, and the acne scarring is smoother.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product for a while before giving a review and here it is now: I have been applying this product 2x/day before my moisturizers for 1 month now. I am a 44-yr old female with obvious wrinkles and dry/dull complexion. My skin is very important and I therefore invest in what are considered top-of-the-line and pricey products. The Skinceuticals Phloretin serum worked some but I did not think the mediocre results justified the price. Now to this product: the liquid is clear (not yellow) which is an excellent indicator the product is fresh (vitamin C oxidizes quickly and becomes yellow and ineffective); my skin is more radiant and it looks more refreshed. the dull complexion is visibly reduced and the lines around my eyes have diminished nicely. In all the years of expensive products, I have not seen such an improvement... ever. The best thing is this stuff is affordable at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Received this quickly and used the very next morning, felt wonderful going on.  So far noticed my skin isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; after a few days.  Will have to update in a month for further results, use in the morning with Retin A in the evening.</li>
    <li> Did not noticed anything remarkable.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for over a week now, but I am already seeing improvements in my skin. My skin looks so much smoother and my dark spots are starting to lighten up. I was also very pleased with the company for sending me an email with directions on how to use the product. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Would not be without it</li>
    <li> I thought it was a mistake and they sent me warmer I used it for 8 weeks thinking it has to do something..nope...did nothing for me. Waste of money</li>
    <li> It is not good quality of serum.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything, just felt like a waste the whole time I was using it. The whole bottle is over and no effect.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this Vit C because of the testimonials, it&#x27;s a little drying for my face but hopefully the benefits will outweigh the drying aspect.</li>
    <li> So far I like it ,leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over a year and I love it.  I am 65 years old and my skin is soft and smooth and I have no wrinkles.  I use it day and night and follow with my favorite serum.  It is a product I cannot go without.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever submitted so that others don&#x27;t waste their time or money on this product. It is as effective as water, no results seen.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for older women like me. It has made my skins softer. To me my skin was felling like a lizard, but not any more. GOOD STUFF!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is a great product.  It made my skin feel and look supple and radiant.</li>
    <li> This is a different product from what I have ordered before??  I really don&#x27;t care for it at all.  It leaves your face sticky!  I&#x27;ve added a little extra water to my face after putting it on and that seems to help somewhat.  When the sticky feeling finally dries, it feels like there is a weird film left.  I thought I was ordering the Amino Blend Vit C serum (and actually that is what the ingredients list above states) which is such wonderful stuff.  BUT the bottle I got is totally different with different ingredients.  If you order from this page you will receive Pro-Astax20, which is what the picture above depicts.  But it is not the original Vit C serum everyone &#x27;s been happy with?  I checked the Oz Naturals website and as far as I could tell, they have replaced the Amino Blend formula with this new product.  I won&#x27;t order it again and will now have to find a different brand of Vit C serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oz naturals for about 7 months now and I do like them very much. I wasn&#x27;t sure they were working and I quit for a few weeks and my skin looked dull and tired. I use the vitamin c serum, the hyaluronic acid serum, under eye serum, toner and the retinol face cream. I especially like the organic and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I tried this because the reviews were good. The product forms some sort of smooth film on your face. My makeup did not look good over this product&lt;br /&gt;It looked blotchy and shiny. My skin started to break out after using this product. The customer service is great. They will send you an email on how to use their product. Not sure about the reviews for this products. I will not order again.</li>
    <li> Really good product, you can see the different3 or 4 days after</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum. It&#x27;s light, smells wonderful, and feels wonderful on my face.  I highly recommend this product and is less than other Vitamin Cs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I should probably buy more at one time but am uncertain of the shelve life, so PLEASE keep making it. My skin is alway blemish free and has far less sensitivity!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It feels great and works great.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to Skinceuticals! I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> The product smells nice. It comes in a small bottle and nice packaging. I love Oz Natural products. They never make me unhappy. This product keeps my skin moisturized and nice. I was able to try the product out from a gift from my friend.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Helps make my skin not so dry. Best when used with the entire product line.</li>
    <li> The verdict is still out, but I will buy again to see if after a few more months my skin starts showing some signs of re-birth. I think it is repairing.</li>
    <li> Really nice serum, doesn&#x27;t run down your face as too liquid and soaks in quickly.  I also bought the Vitamin C cleanser and I think the two together have really brightened and calmed my complexion overall with no sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;Age 53, skin medium-oily</li>
    <li> Got this on the advice of a professional make up artist. She was 100% right. This is an excellent product. The appearance and feel of my skin has greatly improved. Acne and scars are diminished. It makes additional products in my routine act more powerfully by delivering them deeper into my skin. I use it with the Oz Naturals Halyuronic Acid.  I haven&#x27;t experienced this much success with any other product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the rage about this product, after reading reviews of this I decided to give it a try. and after using it for about a month now.. I honestly feel and see no difference. Maybe it takes longer for the result to happen? The serum honestly feels like water more than a serum. Maybe i got a defective bottle?! But everyone rages about it so i&#x27;ll just be patient, maybe the results will come in later! The size of the bottle was bigger than I thought it would be! So it&#x27;ll last a while!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 28 but I still have some wrinkle, and this stuff made it youthful and it still looks somewhat more youthful since using it. I reccomend using raw shea butter after this dries..</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  A little goes  a long way. If your moisturizer or sun screen &amp;#34;rolls off&amp;#34; too much serum has been applied or it was not allowed to dry completely on the skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It&#x27;s potent with great results. Doesn&#x27;t have your typical vitamin c smell or tingle that most have. I noticed a even tone and brightness in my skin within a week. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my face after.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product. It is quickly absorbed by the skin, plumps it up, and leaves no residue on the surface of the skin that interferes with the application of foundation.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time in Feb, 2015.  (OZ Naturals Serum)  I am very pleased and will buy this product again.  Several friends have asked, &amp;#34;what are you doing for your skin&amp;#34;?  &amp;#34;It is radiant&amp;#34;!  I have to agree with them.  I am 64 years young and this serum has helped take a few years off my complexion!  It is brighter, tighter and more youthful-looking.  And the bottle goes a long way...6 months and counting!  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  This is the second time ordering it from Amazon. After about two weeks using it I noticed a big difference in my completion. My skin looks so great I have stopped using foundation all together. This is a great product for the price; all the things that are in much more expensive products are in this serum. Highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I have started using it off and on.So can not give honest opinion.However I plan to order more of it</li>
    <li> I give it a 10 only because it don’t give the promise of correction or treatment so there is nothing to wait for, it is meant to enhance and add to your current regime. Therefore, anything other than preventing wrinkly and plumping the skin is a added bonus. I recommend this for anyone with spotty or dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I have had a nice dewy look to my skin all day.</li>
    <li> This vit C works pretty well for my skin. The other vitC that I have tried did make much difference so I&#x27;m happy with my OZ</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve ordered...been using this and a few other OZ products and love the way they work!</li>
    <li> I like this product better than the last serum I purchased.  It&#x27;s not sticky and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great..very light..absorbs well. I love fact it&#x27;s not tested on animals..that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the oz naturals serum for more than a year. I have noticed that my skin looks better and feels firmer. It&#x27;s also , reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this. I have very dry skin and it makes my skin feel tight.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this three times now and love it.  My face has freckles and dark spots and I want them to fade.  I noticed a difference in my skin tone immediately when I used this serum. It was smoother - significantly less blotchy. It took about two weeks before I saw a difference in my dark spots but I was only using it at night and I tend to put on right before bed so I think it comes off on my pillow.  I have started using under make-up during the day and expect that to speed up the results. It dries quickly and I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there. My make-up looks exactly the same. It doesn&#x27;t water it down or make it oily.</li>
    <li> They are calling this \\&quot;Oz Naturals\\&quot; but the truth ia Dr. Oz has nothing to do with this--that is a lie &amp; the company is just trying to capitalize on Dr. Oz&#x27;&#x27; fame.  I think this is despicable!!!  The product is OK but the hype/advertising was not!!</li>
    <li> Like water and no results at all .. I don&#x27;t recommend this product even for free</li>
    <li> I made the purchase because of the very high rating on Amazon, it lists as #1 best selling, and I can now see why.  It does not sting my skin, and it is not expensive so I try to get more whenever there is promotion because it work well with my sensitive face.  It feels very natural and not some chemical based serum.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best vitamin C product I have ever used.  I have used many vitamin C cosmetics in the past and have seen no difference.  But with this serum I certainly see a difference in the texture of my skin and my overall complexion.  You only need to use a minimal amount of the serum.  What impressed me also is that the sender e-mailed me detailed instructions for use before I even received the serum.  I found that very thoughtful.  I will definitively reorder and check out the other OZ Naturals products.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Have used for a couple years!</li>
    <li> With 20% concentration, I thought this might be potentially irritating. I have slightly sensitive (depends on time of month) and acne-prone skin, and I have been using 2 drops on each side of face twice a day for the last month or so, combined with prescription retinol. No irritation! It seems to speed up the fading of acne discoloration and in fact reduces the frequency of my irritated skin. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different and will have different reaction even from one day to another. So you just have to try it to find out.  If facial skin does not tolerate this product, I usually will use it on my hands and feet, rather than throwing it away.</li>
    <li> The original formula was a 5-star product. This new formula with astazanthin (spelling?) is utter GARBAGE and doesn&#x27;t deserve one star. Oz has added this ingredient plus several nasty chemicals/preservatives that weren&#x27;t in the original formula, in addition, this once easy to apply serum is now a gelatinous mess that really smells bad. Maybe they reformulated it to lower the production costs? Will not purchase this again and have moved on to another brand.  The original formula worked beautifully for fine lines, hyper-pigmentation and as a mild exfoliant. This new formula is just awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.  Shame on you Oz Naturals!!</li>
    <li> I have use various more expensive vit c products in the past as well as others that are more &amp;#34;wallet friendly&amp;#34;.  I LOVE this product!  It penetrates quick and you can feel immediate softness to your skin.  The price point is amazing for such a high quality skin product.</li>
    <li> Maybe I had too high of expectations for this serum after reading so many glowing reviews before I purchased it.  I really can&#x27;t see much difference in my skin after using it.  It may be a little softer, but there isn&#x27;t much change in the places where my skin tone is uneven.</li>
    <li> I have religiously used it for 2 weeks twice a day and it really worked. My scars have faded away and it actually brightened my skin. I am completely satisfied, Ordering my next one.</li>
    <li> Next to my retin A (which I use before this vitamin c serum) the OZ naturals serum is my favorite anti aging product.  I always use a vitamin c serum after my retin A, but nothing has compared to this vitamin c serum.  I&#x27;ve never heard of OZ naturals before but I&#x27;m glad I found it here because it&#x27;s helped make my skin appear much younger and healthier.  My husband even asked if I were using a new product because he noticed the change.  I would recommend this to anyone in need of a high quality vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> Had no idea what to expect but even after the first application, my skin was softer! Have now been using this product for a little more than a week and already the lines around my eyes are softer and less noticeable. Hoping as I continue using it, my psoariasis patch gets better, although that is not why I purchased it. Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a little over a week and am already seeing results. Even more amazing: other people are noticing and complimenting on my skin! I have very sensitive skin and fine lines and acne scars and this stuff is just smoothing everything out. You must try this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product I have very dry skin and extremely sensitive skin this is amazing works so much better than much more expensive products I have used for years!  I just wish they made it in much larger bottles.  By the time I put it on my face neck and décolletage I go through it faster than I would prefer.</li>
    <li> I have read all the reviews and have used this product for 30 days now.  I apply it every morning before I apply moisturizer and sun screen.  It goes on nicely but I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin.  I will keep using it in hopes that more time will see improvement.  The customer service is great for this company as they followed up after purchase to ensure that I was using the product correctly, use a couple of drops (little is more).  That impressed me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I do notice that my skin looks brighter and a has cleared my dark spots slightly.</li>
    <li> Ingredient list says organic &amp; natural, yet it lists a chemical Methylsulfonylmethane as an ingredient... ? Frustrating to say the least.  [...]</li>
    <li> This product I have started using on my face every morning.  My face feels firm and hydrated.  I talked two of my friends into buying some!</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. I put it on and let it dry before I put on my moisturizer morning and night.  A little goes a long way.  My face is smoother. My breakouts have cleared up and my pores have shrank.  Best buy I have made all year</li>
    <li> I have been using Oz natural products  for more than 6 months but their vitamin C serum so when I was offer at a reduced price to try their Vitamin C and E product and review it and I was trilled. I really like the combination of C and E because not only does it help my brown sun spots but it help smooth out acne scars from hormonal changes that occur. The serum is just right not to thin or thick in consistency and I love to put this on after I remove my make up at night and after I clean my face with a toner. It feel good and I will continue to use this product to keep my face youthful and sunspot free.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money.  i wanted this to work, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is really easy to apply and mix with my current face lotions. My skin feels less dry and more moist.</li>
    <li> I have an extensive skin care regimen consisting of various facial masks (sheet masks, clarifying/detox mixes, toning masks, you name it!), face washes (foaming, non-foaming, non-surfactant, black soap, and more), toners (rose water, witch hazel, orange blossom, SkinNutritions), and moisturizers (too many to name!), but I was relatively late to the game regarding serums.  This serum dispenses precisely (because of the included glass dropper), won&#x27;t degrade because of light exposure (because of the amber glass), and greatly benefits the skin (xcellent ingredients, AND the ingredient list provided by the seller also explains the benefit of each).  I would highly recommend this product - I have added it between my toner and moisturizer (even on days when I wear makeup) and it hasn&#x27;t interacted negatively with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:Vitamin C. This antioxidant works by ridding skin of free radicals and protecting it from environmental aggressors like pollution. Vitamin C has been proven to stimulate the synthesis of collagen, which decreases as our sun exposure increases and as we age. Vitamin C also helps minimize scars, fine lines, and wrinkles. OZ Naturals uses a concentration of 20% Vitamin C because for most people, this percentage provides the best results without irritation. Hyaluronic Acid. This naturally occurring acid can hold 1,000 times its own weight in water, and that is the reason it&#x27;s ideal for hydrating and moisturizing the skin. Our hyaluronic acid is botanically derived from Cassia Angustifolia seed. When used in conjunction with vitamin C, it helps assist in penetrating deeper into the skin&#x27;s layers. Amino Blend. This blend promotes blood circulation to the skin, helping strengthen capillary walls and nourish cells, thereby allowing the skin to heal naturally. Since the epidermis layer of the skin absorbs this blend, it is often used to treat scars, acne, and wrinkles because it can help speed up cell regeneration making your skin appear more supple and youthful. Organic Jojoba Oil. Jojoba oil isn&#x27;t really an oil, but rather it&#x27;s a liquid wax that resembles human sebum (the oil that keeps your skin and hair smooth and supple) and is proven to smooth your skin&#x27;s texture. OrganicHerbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate), MSM, botanical hyaluronic acid, Witch Hazel), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.appear more supple and youthful.

    <li> **UPDATE 6/30/15~~&amp;#62; My skin continued to break out so I have stopped using this product. I think the majority of the positive reviews are scams from people that were solicited and paid to do the review. I feel taken advantage of as a consumer. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading reviews about how amazing it was. Honestly, I&#x27;m wondering if most of those were paid reviews and not from people who actually bought the product on their own. I&#x27;ve noticed many beauty products are given as solicitations for reviews. While I don&#x27;t mind that, I just really hope people are being honest with those reviews. Both the customers and the companies deserve that honesty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so far this serum is just ok. I think it&#x27;s making me break out if I&#x27;m being honest. The texture of the serum is great, it&#x27;s liquid but it has that slightly thicker feel to it, and it glides on nicely. It doesn&#x27;t feel dewey afterwards though, which is something I like about other serums I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m just not impressed and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing much for me. I will give it some more time and update this post if there is some miraculous change. Otherwise, I am still on the hunt for a great,non-toxic, Vitamin C based serum. If you have any recommendations, please send them my way!</li>
    <li> I like using it.  I don&#x27;t have bad skin but want to keep it nice as I aging, 46...but this doesn&#x27;t look like it does anything for my skin.  have been using it for over 2 months now.  I tried few products from sephora and they are nice (a little too expensive)...</li>
    <li> maybe its just me,  but I got more good out of the Correctionist time correcting crème with line blox... but they are discontinuing it!  This vit C didn&#x27;t seem to do a thing but take up space on the cabinet!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin feels so nourished and firm, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy feel. It has no odor and I love to put it on before I put any make up on. Best vitamin oil ever.</li>
    <li> I AM A 60 YEAR OLD CAUCASIAN WITH FAIR SKIN.MY PLASTIC SURGEONS NURSE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AFTER I COMMENTED ON HOW BEAUTIFUL HER SKIN WAS LOOKING.I WAS TOLD TO USE IT ALONG WITH THE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM. HAVE JUST STARTED,LOVE IT SO FAR!! IT IS WORTH YOUR TIME TO READ ABOUT THESE 2 PRODUCTS. I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN AND THE BEGINNINGS OF DARK SUN SPOTS. THESE 2 TOGETHER HAVE MADE MY SKIN FEEL SO VERY GOOD. CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO SEE RESULTS IN 6 MOS.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 new products according to the reviews..I was pleased with the reviews. So, I purchased three products. So far I am pleased with this new product. I like the idea that I did not spend a large amount of money for a good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 1 month and i see no result on my skin. It does not break me out, but that&#x27;s it, seeing no miracle.  Dont really know why there&#x27;re so many compliment reviews. I did notice lots of bad comments on this one but ignored them since i really wanted to love this serum and tried to believe that those were from competitors. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I choose this product beause it is marketed as the  best Vitamin C  serum available and would bring the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I can definitely see steady  improvement by proper and regular use of this serum.</li>
    <li> This has worked on my 56 year old skin.  Started using it 8 weeks ago, just finishing up first bottle.  Friends tell me my skin tone is much more even, I don&#x27;t wear any cover up.  I saw pictures of myself at the 3 week mark, did not notice difference in tightness.  But just saw pictures of myself at the 8 week mark, noticeable difference.  My neck and jowl area much tighter, I would say a good 50%.  Excellent product for me, I recommend it to anyone who asks. UPDATE 9/2015- I have added the hyaluronic acid serum to my routine, and after 3 weeks use I am very pleased.  My moisturizer seems to work better, and I use less.  I don&#x27;t understand the science behind this, but I will continue using these products. Thank you OZ Naturals for making me feel like a valued customer.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like an oil, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now once a day, and my complexion has noticeably brightened.  It lasts a long time, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I put it on my face after I use my dermatologist roller. The results are amazing! I plan to buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> Seems ok my skin looks clearer!</li>
    <li> Great! Goes easy on your skin and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> I buy a LOT of things on Amazon; this is the only company I buy from online; but I have NEVER reviewed anything on the site before.  I bought this serum months ago and forgot about it, and I finally dug it out and started using it about 2 weeks ago. I have to say, my skin looks brighter and healthier after just a few days of using this product.  I have used Kinerase, Clinique, Murad, Cerave (recommended by an esthetician), Pro-Active, etc. but NO OTHER PRODUCT has given me results this quickly.  My lines are softening and my skin is clearer, brighter, my pores are shrinking!  I am very skeptical with claims since I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on false promises in the last 25 years.  However, I love this serum!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin is going to look with continued use.  If you read reviews to decide whether to spend your money Amazon products, trust me, I love this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, some say that many of these reviews are from people that have only reviewed this product and no others.  I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon consistently since 1999 and I like this product so much that I wanted to review it.  I am NOT a scammer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  I feel like it has made a difference in my skin after only a few weeks of usage.  It only takes a little bit to cover the entire face.  My skin feels like it has more moisture and and more of a glow.  I also appreciate the customer service I have received with this product.  The OZ Naturals Company has sent me two emails to be sure I have the information I need to properly use this product and to be sure that I received the product in a timely manner.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  I have also used the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin by OZ Naturals and loved it, as well.  If you&#x27;re considering either one of these products, I say go for it!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have heard of OZ Naturals or ordered product from them, but my experience was a very positive one.  The Vitamin C Serum arrived quickly and was packaged safely.  I have only been using the product for about a week, so it is too soon to tell yet if it will work, but based on other customers&#x27; reviews, I am confident that it will work very well.  I would just like to especially point out the seller&#x27;s (OZ Naturals) level of customer service and follow up is exceptional.  I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> I have always had heathy but dry skin. Now that I&#x27;m 50 my skin is even dryer, which make the wrinkles stand out.  After reading about this product and how natural it is I decided to give it a try. The very first time I tried it I could feel it just sink right into my skin, it was like my skin was thirsty and the vitamin c quenched. It felt wonderful and my skin had a nice glow.  But you don&#x27;t need to use much, you pat it gently in the areas you need it most instead of apply it by rubbing it in like a lotion.  So less is better.  To compliment this vitamin c serum I use natural face cream with skin essential vitamins by Ohio Valley Herbal Products over top.  I received my vitamin c serum in a timely fashion with tips on how best to use it. I feel and see the benefits every day that I use it and will definetly be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on expensive products but this serum is amazing!  And for a fraction of the cost!  It really does get rid of those wrinkles!  Just make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Best serum I&#x27;d ever owned. It helps with my post acne marks and prevent me from breaking out. A tiny drop is enough. Highly recommended! I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum seems to be fit for all skin types.  My skin can be sensitive and turn red very easily when I switch products.  I have not had any trouble with this OZ Naturals serum.  I will continue to use the bottle!</li>
    <li> This is a  case when the product name  completely corresponds to its content.. Great customer service is a great addition to the great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I noted a noticeable difference in the first week. My skin was so soft and smooth and my wrinkles also became softer and less noticeable.  I will continue to use this serum in hopes that I can maintain a youthful look at the age of 54.</li>
    <li> I used this product only 3 nights in a row and discovered that I am highly allergic to something in it! My face got spotted and peeled. My eyes are now wrinkled and baggy. Haven&#x27;t seemed to get back to the way I looked before using this product and I&#x27;m a little concerned! 😔</li>
    <li> First, I gave the serum 4 stars only because I haven&#x27;t finished the full regime.  I selected it because from the enormous array of anti-aging products, yours was recommended as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; in the market for Vitamin C treatment, so I went in with a certain amount of confidence.  So far, for the past few weeks, I have used it twice daily and then applied argan oil when my skin felt ready, and I must say the results are very satisfying.  Plus, the treatment is so time-efficient that you just can&#x27;t beat it for a daily anti-aging treatment in a busy life.  I intend to replenish my supply when I&#x27;m finished with my initial investment.  Thank you very much.  Flo Perlman</li>
    <li> I have used several vitamin c serums over the years, and this is my favorite.  It does not sting at all.  No odor.  Goes on the skin very easily.  And I can tell a difference in my skin.  I am also using it on my hands at night to help reduce some discolorations.</li>
    <li> Much as I wanted to love this product, and liked the other hyaluronic acid by Oz Naturals, I feel that I gave it a good shot, but did not care for it.  It feels too watery to me, and it may be my issue, but I feel that a serum should have some substance to it, which this didn&#x27;t.  I faithfully used it daily under a moisturizer, but did not notice a difference.  If others like it, I&#x27;m happy for the company.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product.  It does exactly what it claims at a great price. I absolutely love its simplicity and results.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a short time, but I do really like it.  I already had good skin for my age of 70.  However, some lines started creeping in around my eyes and lips.  This product seems to have given my skin a more glowing look and has made the lines less noticeable.  I will definitely continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie, an advertising companies dream customer.  don&#x27;t even want to think about how much money I have wasted over the years.  This product works as well if not better then the more expensive brand.  Within a week my skin was looking better, had a glow to it that I haven&#x27;t had in many years.  And it wasn&#x27;t just me noticing it others around me did.  I have now purchased this product for friends.  Definitely a keeper</li>
    <li> The product &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; great, not &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34;, but smooth and &amp;#34;creamy-like&amp;#34;.  UnfortunatelyI haven&#x27;t had it long enough to use it enough to know the benefits of using it. The price was great and the percent of vitamin C was adequate. I was looking for a serum that contained at least 20% vitamin C.and many serums only contain 15% C. I like the combo of C + E +Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will follow up with another review after I have used it for six months. I have rated it on &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;results&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims and more. After one week I saw a significant difference in my facial skin. I am a makeup artist and clients always ask what I use on my face. I have added this to the products I tell them and have also mentioned it on my blog under skin care</li>
    <li> It works!  My face is tighter, smoother, and less wrinkled in just a few days!  I HIGHLY recommend you try it!!</li>
    <li> Thought it was supposed to have thicker texture. Runs off finger when squeeze dropper</li>
    <li> the vitamin c was like a gel not a liquid. when you put it on your face it did not absorb it just dried and made your skin very tight . when you put moisturizer on your face it did not go on smoothly at all. this was a waste of my money would never buy any of their products . how can they advertise as the best vitamin c serum its a joke.</li>
    <li> I am confused by all the great reviews. This is a gooey mess that does not soak into your skin but lays on top and feels like Elmers glue. I woke the next morning only to feel it still on my face and it all peeled off. It is by far the worse product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used vitamin C serum before as well as hyaluronic acid. They are both liquid and have a pleasant smell. This product was chunky and had a foul odor. It is either expired or there is something seriously wrong with it. It also burns upon contact with the skin. I am returning it ASAP.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a year and prefer it to other Vit. C products so far!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on 05/15/2015, I was happy and loved this product. OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum (professional anti-aging serum at the bottom but when I re-ordered it on 07/28/2015, somehow they change the product to ProAstax20 and I&#x27;m not happy about this product. I don&#x27;t like the consistency of serum. It is different than the professional anti-aging serum. I don&#x27;t like it when you I put on my face, it&#x27;s really different. Also, it is not make up base. I hope they change it back to professional anti-aging serum.</li>
    <li> I put it on at bedtime and it seeps down into my skin during the night helping me to keep skin soft and a little less wrinkled. Note:  Probably not good for people if they toss and turn as far as pillowcases go, but I sleep on my back all night.</li>
    <li> This feels nice on your skin and soaks in but then I feel dry. I do have dry skin at baseline. I have used Obagi vitamin C serum prior to trying this one and I do like the way obagi feels better. Seems to offer more moisture than Oz.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Would have bought more but they are sold out!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a couple weeks now. Although, I am only 23 and I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, I was expecting this to maybe help even out my skintone. I had noticed from other reviews they mentioned it made their skin glow and look healthy but I&#x27;m still waiting....</li>
    <li> This Serum has done more for my face than anything before by tightening my complexion.  In addition, it leaves my complexion soft.  I&#x27;ve had so may compliments that I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 70 years old.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change, but it feels nice and light on my face. No concerns</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I noticed my skin more clear and didn&#x27;t got breakouts. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It cyually made my skin flakey and got dry patches for almost a week! I don&#x27;t like it at all!!!</li>
    <li> I look 10 years younger after one bottle using it twice daily.  I wish I knew about this serum earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They changed the formula as of Summer 2015.  It&#x27;s way too thick now and moisturizer doesn&#x27;t help!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skin care snob and I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of this already. It delivers similar results as other higher-end, more expensive serums but with a smaller dent in the wallet. Goes on clean, definitely smooths texture, pigmentation and brightens. It doesn&#x27;t have the lovely, citrus aroma as similar products (Ole Henriksen) but for 1/3 the cost, I don&#x27;t mind too much!</li>
    <li> I have an acne prone skin, and i&#x27;ve tried a lot of other Vitamin C serums but they made me break out, But with Oz vitamin C I have never had encounter with such a problem, it actually made my skin softer and little bit brighter, also it has a very light consistency that allowed the skin to absorbs very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend !!</li>
    <li> I really feel that this serum has evened out my skin. Great serum!</li>
    <li> I have noticed that some of  my  wrinkles  have  gone away,  with  the daily use of this  product.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product !!!! I seen a different only skin in just a week . Smooth out my fine lines . Tighten up my face . Love it I would recommend this to anyone !!!</li>
    <li> I see a difference as soon as I put it on.  It absorbs right away and my BB cream effortlessly glides right over it.  I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t finished the entire bottle yet, however I am liking this serum as much as I liked my Skinceuticals, it&#x27;s not quite as effective or strong but the cost definitely makes up for it. I still see results and I feel it&#x27;s working. will buy again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Used sometime and comparing with other products, this one is sticky and smells like soy sauce. When it dried it starts to peel off itself and dropping like dandruff. I bought two and try to get rid of it. probably I will use for sush dip..</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it, but it gave me cystic acne. It gave my wife acne as well. Extremely disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a few times and every time I would get cystic acne and a whitehead or two, so no more of this.</li>
    <li> This product lasts a long time, and it makes your skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great feel on skin, lives up to its promises! I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months, and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with all of OZ naturals product. My skin has been looking much better and glows. I absolutely love their products!</li>
    <li> Not sure about the anti-wrinkle, anti-aging effects as I have only used one bottle. However, I like the ease of application and the moisturizing quality of this product. My foundation glides on after applying this to my face. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I have been using it for a few months after a recommendation from a friend who also uses it. I am so happy at the results. I get compliments all the time about how my skin looks. . I had someone who owns a Spa tell me how great my skin looked even before I told him I had been using this serum. I live in the Caribbean and have been exposed to a lot of sunshine all my life from just going to the beach and being outdoors all the time. All my sun spots have now faded. And my skin is medium to fair.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Oz Naturals.....I will always have you in my Amazon cart :)!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I feel the difference since th first day of use, I noticed day after, just can&#x27;t stop using it !!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t found any changes in my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before and it was fine. I&#x27;m not sure if it was due to the heat of summer but by the time I got it, it had a strange consistency and left an uncomfortable film on my face, making it itch. I had to file a claim for refund.</li>
    <li> Grwat product.  Worked better than I hoped, it smoothed out my skin.  It even rid me of the little bumps that I get from using sunblock on my face.</li>
    <li> like this serum very much!</li>
    <li> Friends recommended that I try this serum. So glad I did, such a great product, I will order again!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t bad overall. Just don&#x27;t know if it worked or the other things I use in conjunction with it. It does make my skin feel clean after application so 4 stars!</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful, and I love what it has done for my skin - and I&#x27;m almost 69!!!  On top of that, the company is very thoughtful and informative. Shortly after I received my order, I received an email from them thanking me for my order and giving me helpful ideas on how best to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certain you will be delighted  :)</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me and i absolutely love it! This is not like any other Vitamin C serum i have encountered. Most Vitamin C serums you have to refrigerate because after opening, if left out in the open it can oxidize , which mean it will turn brown, and it will no longer be good to use. This doesn&#x27;t say to refrigerate, but if you want to you can, then it can be great to use on hot summer days to cool down your face while evening out your skin tone, minimizing the look of pores, and plumping up the skin. I also liked that their wasn&#x27;t much of a smell to it, it had this very smoothing feeling affect to it, and it did not have that tingly/stinging to it. I also love that this brand is made by an esthetician, and as a fellow esthetician, that makes me feel happy that i can relay on them for great skincare at an affordable price. This can also be great to put on before you put on makeup as it will keep your face smooth, while making your makeup look flawless. I love this product, and i am so happy that my husband knows me enough to get this for me knowing i was looking for one, but didn&#x27;t ask him. I will defiantly repurchase this item along with others, so i can test them out on myself and future clients of mines.</li>
    <li> Not really the same as the CE Ferulic bought from the dr.  This dried the skin, so high in HA, but maybe a bit too much. I follow with jojoba oil from Leven Rose. I use along with a dermaroller as well lightly that I also got on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I started using the serum about a month ago and the skin on my face looks improved.  Happy I got this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the serum and started using it right away.  My face feels great!  A small amount goes a long way.  If you use to much it will leave a crusty film.  When you put it on you can feel your face tighten almost like putting on a mask. Once you put on your moisturizer  the tight feeling goes away.  I will definately continue to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is too oily for my skin. Like other people, I&#x27;ve used it for awhile but I haven&#x27;t seen ANY improvment in my skin texture or condition. I finally decided it time to try something new. Ladies, do yourself a favor and use Azure&#x27;s vit C serum, that stuff works SOO much better and it works super fast. I&#x27;ve seen improvement in just the 2 days I&#x27;ve been using it. Thank God I switched! You can get it on Amazon here&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HZ7IRTW/ref&#x3D;as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;9325&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00HZ7IRTW&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;tecki-20&amp;linkId&#x3D;I6NTRO6IXXPYDBOM</li>
    <li> Excellent product exactly as described. I have 52 year old skin and it has really improved fine lines everywhere on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Not down rating this product, what works for some may not always work for all. My skin broke out. I would only use at night time. I only used 1 bottle, maybe I should have continued using at least another bottle to rate it, but I really didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin other than the breakouts I would get after using this product.</li>
    <li> Well I have to say I liked it. I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying this concoction didn&#x27;t make their skin tingle so it didn&#x27;t feel like it worked. I went around this by exfoliating my face by washing with super lathered soap a few times. No towels it will scratch skin (You know your done when you stand under shower and rub finger on cheek like your getting rid of sticker residue, your face will squeak) I can say that it does indeed tingle a bit. I personally think this little liquid shouldn&#x27;t be used alone tho, cause after your skin absorbs it, it becomes tight and dry. After the point where it becomes tight, I slap on a 2nd liquid, this time being Clinique liquid moisturizer for me. This vitamin liquid made my skin so soft and delicate and springy. All I have to do now is get off my lazy arse and order more but I tend to procrastinate....</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this serum works and it works extremely well.  My skin is brighter and smoother than it&#x27;s been in years.  I was getting to the point where I could feel little, uneven bumps when I washed my face with my fingers. I couldn&#x27;t see these little bumps but I could feel them. After just a few days of using this vitamin c serum I could feel my skin getting smoother.  Almost like my skin was taking on a more even texture.  My skin is also brighter and more vibrant.  I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly!  This product absorbs quickly, &amp; has no odor.  Feels very nice.  Pores &amp; fine lines instantly disappear as product dries, leaving face firm &amp; smooth.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic effects as of yet, but have only been using it for a couple weeks.  Really like the product, &amp; hope to see better long term results.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to figure out if this has done anything.  I began using this immediately when I received it and weeks later I see no difference.  I was hoping to be writing back and saying great things but I can&#x27;t.  Is my skin in such bad shape that these OTC products can&#x27;t help me?  I have faithfully used this product as recommended and read all the reviews and suggestions and went in with a realistic outlook.  I will continue to se this till it runs out but do not foresee re-ordering it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from hyper pigmentation caused from birth control pills.  Within three months of changing to a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; birth control pill, I developed what is commonly known as the pregnancy mask.  I have spent thousands of dollars trying to repair my skin, between Chemical peels, Fraxel laser, 4% hydroquinone cream, Tri-luma cream and blue and green light therapy.  Although my skin improved, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting my money&#x27;s worth.  After five Fraxel treatments, I still had hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, and I finally accepted that this was something I would have to live with forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running out of Estee Lauder Even Skintone Illuminator, I decided to research comparative serum&#x27;s.  During my research I kept reading about the benefits of Vitamin C serum.  Well this product was one of the highest rated and with the most reviews so I decided why not try it since I have tried everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used OZ Naturals for 30 days and noticed a slight improvement to my skin.  Nothing significant, but considering this was far less than what I was paying for Estee Lauder products, I decided to order another bottle.  By this time, I discovered the benefits of derma rolling.  The combination of a .5mm derma roller and vitamin C serum has made my skin look amazing. I still have discoloration, but it is definitely improving.  So much so that one day out of the blue my husband told me that my skin looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I am going to list my entire skin care regimen.  I wash my face twice a day with facial cleanser and a Clarasonic cleansing brush.  Afterwards, I remove the excess soap with 100% witch hazel.  I let the witch hazel dry completely before I apply vitamin C.  Once the vitamin C has dried, I apply moisturizer and follow up with sun block.  Two to three times a week, I use a .5mm derma roller on my face and neck.  For me, combining all of these products has rendered the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, there is no need to purchase expensive skin toner that only contains 50 - 70% witch hazel. Save the money and go to Walgreens and purchase a 16oz bottle of witch hazel for $6.re is no need to purchase expensive skin toner that only contains 50 - 70% witch hazel. Save the money and go to Walgreens and purchase a 16oz bottle of witch hazel for $6.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use the other brand on my face but when I put it on my neck it feels sticky, so I tried this and it feels so smooth and not tacky. When I have used it on my face it does at times make it feel dry and tight to combat this I use a moisturizing toner first then the serum and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of vitamin C serums over the years.  I got tired of paying almost $100 for Perricone vitamin C serum, so I decided to take a risk and try something new.  Not only is this serum very inexpensive, it&#x27;s far better than Perricone.  My skin is much brighter and more radiant than it ever was with Perricone.  Maybe it&#x27;s the quality of ingredients or maybe it&#x27;s the mixture of vitamin E and hyaluronic acid.  I have no idea, but either way, this is my new favorite and it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for anyone in need of a high quality vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year.  I think it works. A bottle lasts me about 3 months.  So not too expensive.</li>
    <li> good product; good price.</li>
    <li> No noticeable benefits after more than two weeks of use -- in fact, quite the opposite. I have combination skin that&#x27;s not dry -- just normal with a slightly oilier T-zone. I&#x27;d used SkinCeuticals C serum in the past with good results, but wanted to try something a bit less expensive, and that contained other beneficial ingredients as well, instead of just vitamin C alone. I was really surprised to discover that when I use this serum -- whether morning or night -- it seems to mask my skin&#x27;s usual radiance, and makes it appear rough and dull. I decided to do a test to see if it was the serum or if my skin was just going through a bad phase, so I stopped using the C serum for a couple of days, and my skin went back to looking soft, smooth and radiant. So, I guess this C serum just isn&#x27;t the right one for me, though it may work well for others. I since found out that my neighbor uses this serum, specifically because it helps dry out her oily skin (and I have to admit, her skin looks luminous and flawless!), so perhaps it is a bit drying for those with normal/combination skin. Though this serum doesn&#x27;t work for me, it may be a winner for you if your skin is more on the oily side.  3/9/13 Update: I didn&#x27;t want to toss this serum just because it was drying out my face, so I started using it on the back of my hands at night, followed with my usual hand lotion. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my hands, but this serum has definitely improved the texture and tone of the skin on the back of my hands and faded a few freckles. It also didn&#x27;t cause any dryness like it did on my face, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it entirely!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 21 but everyone says you should start anti-aging in your 20s. This was my first serum and it&#x27;s my favorite part of my beauty routine. It goes on your face almost as a watery substance, then dries like instantly. I don&#x27;t know what this witchcraft is, but it&#x27;s not oil. It&#x27;s like a vitamin c transformer (liquid to dry). You can and should layer it with an SPF face cream, and it&#x27;s great because you don&#x27;t notice the serum at all. Only in appearance. After about a week I noticed my skin was clearer and brighter.</li>
    <li> At first, I was disappointed.  I was hoping for and expecting miraculous results.  My spots have indeed faded over several weeks now, but it also does something wonderful to my skin....I&#x27;m not sure what though.  Tightens it, brightens it maybe?  My spots took a while to fade down and they&#x27;re not gone by a long shot (yet) but almost immediately i did see an overall improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again    Have used OZ Naturals cerum Like it and will continue to use</li>
    <li> I felt like when I applied this before I went to sleep, I woke up with brighter skin. I really loved this a lot. It didn&#x27;t break me out or anything either.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good,but i can&#x27;t tell too much for the effection. it seems ok not good and not bad.</li>
    <li> This serum, along with the Oz Eye Gel and Retinol Moisturizer have made a HUGE difference in my 50 year old face. I&#x27;ve use them exclusively for over a month now - and the bags, darkened under eyes and wrinkles have noticeably decreased.</li>
    <li> I am 29 years old, Asian. This is my third bottle of the Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;ve been really amazed with results. My routine is this: I usually wash my face first then use about 3 drops of the serum then a moisturizer. I have observed my skin is way softer and smoother for almost a year of using it. I can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s been a daily habit. Worked for me. The picture face my face after applying it without make up on. Bare face.</li>
    <li> I love the texture of the Vitamin C and the ingredients are second to none. I use it in the morning and at night if I don&#x27;t use Retinol. Love the way it makes my skin feel and look, will re-order.</li>
    <li> Love the serum but wish I could use it more often.  My sensitive skin tends to burn if used more than 1 night in a row.  Use every other night/morning instead.</li>
    <li> Seriously i dont know what all the buzz is about! I shop at Sephora, Nordstrom and Target for my skin care product. They have different versions of vitamin C that i think works better. I have sensitive skin, it didnt bother me as far as smell or texture however it didnt do much either. It feels like putting water on your skin. I give every product a fair 4wks and this was just not for me. I was curious based on all the reviews and bc it was cheap. Didnt see any changes very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought this was, one more advertised product but it is not, this is  really a great product, after a week of using it, my fine lines dissapeared. .</li>
    <li> product arrived on but it was 3/4 full. so far result is great..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two to three weeks now and need to give it a bit longer.  What I have noticed is that my skin feels very soft and smooth.  It says it builds collagen which will not happen overnite.  I think the price is good.  I wear it alone in humid weather or under moisturizer or a tinted moisturizer in cooler weather.  At this point,  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> great product... love it</li>
    <li> Very good product for my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used other vitamin C serums before. This one never had that distinctive &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;. However, I started using it anyways and, within a few days, developed a rash on my cheeks. Gotto go to a dermatologist to get it treated.</li>
    <li> it did not work for me. I got all rushes and it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference. my acne scars have gotten lighter. I love this product will buy again.</li>
    <li> This has helped fade some large brown spots on my forehead.  I have been using it for a month and there is a noticeable difference.  I intend to keep using it for at least another month.  I am quite impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> amazingly good serum, I absolutely love it! highly recommend it</li>
    <li> The order shipped really quickly and I got the product right away. I&#x27;ve used quite a few vitamin C products and this one is much thicker than other brands. I think it is due to the hyaluronic acid. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks now and -- so far so good. I am good some good immediate results and hope to see additional results with more usage.</li>
    <li> After trying it, I bought more right away! I love the stuff:) a friend told me about it, and they love it too!!!</li>
    <li> Worked but slowly show</li>
    <li> Over the years I have dumped so much money into skincare products.  Enough so that I probably could have purchased a new car with cash that I have dumped into buying skincare products that didn&#x27;t work.  I have used some very expensive products.  I&#x27;m realistic with myself and have accepted the fact that I will never have the skin that I had when I was 20 years old.  I am now 51 years old.  I just want to look the best that I can and grow older gracefully.  I can honestly say that this stuff works!  First day of use I actually saw firmness, clarity.  My skin looked brighter, younger.  My skin received it very well.  I got tired of dumping cash in the trash so I made a decision that I was going to find a good retinol or c serum, invest the cash in a serum so to speak and then go for a less expensive good sun block/ moisturizer or a sun block and a moisturizer and do it organically, no parabens....  I can honestly, truthfully say that after many years I have finally found my routine.  No more frustration, let downs!  I also use a good fruit acid peel once/twice a week.  THIS STUFF ROCKS!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate it or like it - i am just &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34; with the product. I saw no difference in my skin when i used this - there was no brightening on the face, my fine forehead wrinkles are still visible, and it did not reduce any sun damage. I use this twice a day - in the morning, I would apply my moisturizer and sunblock on top. At night, i apply after toning my face before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although i did not like the product and think it is only ok, it is not oily nor did it break me out.</li>
    <li> I am truly in love with this serum. It helps to reduce my dark spots and even&#x27;s out my tone. I have sensitive skin and I have yet to have any adverse side effects!</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in the texture of my skin in 2-3 weeks time. if anyone is not using some kind of vitamin C product, please begin!</li>
    <li> This is another great product from Oz Naturals. I love this serum, it makes my face feel tight , younger, and gets rid of the fine lines around my eyes. I use it with Oz Naturals eye gel and absolutely love them both!</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s worth every dime!!</li>
    <li> This was ok but I really didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference. Might work for someone with less sun exposure.</li>
    <li> Amazing serum!  I use this everyday in the morning now and my skin looks radiant, brighter and smoother!</li>
    <li> Especially like this product in conjunction with magnesium oil.  Fast ship.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and i&#x27;ve seen just very minor improvements despite being slightly sick. I&#x27;ll try to update this in a few weeks if I remember.</li>
    <li> awesome product, better than the $200.00 products.  Noticed a more even skin tone after one week.</li>
    <li> I started using and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. It has made a difference in my skin and I would highly recommend to anyone. I have bought so many different skin care products that say there will be an improvement in your skin and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything that it was a great surprise to find this and know I have found my correct skin care product!</li>
    <li> I have used for about 3 weeks and have not really noticed much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since a year but have not noticed any changes on my face. It has not reduced the wrinkles nor has got any glow..! I feel its just waste of money.</li>
    <li> Buy this product. Period.</li>
    <li> Honestly I just started to use vitamin C serums, my first one I purchase was by poopy Austin  which Works WAY BETTER. Poopy Austin serum leaves the skin tight , smooth and soft. So I&#x27;m going back to my poopy Austin serum :)</li>
    <li> It works! I&#x27;m 24, I lead a fairly healthy lifestyle. Even with rigorous beauty regimes (sleeping early, minimal alcohol, balanced nutrients, sunscreen applications) I still developed some sun spots (or age spots) on my cheekbone areas. After applying this serum to the problem areas once a day for about 10 days. I saw a significant improvement in my complexion. My mom who is in her mid 40s is also using this product. She has more age spots (more like patches) than me to begin with. After 2 weeks, her age spots have diminished greatly as well. We will keep on using this potent product.</li>
    <li> Incredible product. After 24 hours I noticed that my skin was more radiant. After two weeks, my skin is luminous and so soft &amp; smooth. I use morning and night, following the directions by putting on cleansed skin, letting it dry and then applying moisturizer. One of the best parts, it is not sticky. Once it dries, my moisturizer applies smoothly. It said to use a small amount - I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how much to use but after my own trial and error I ended up filling one dropper full and used the entire contents, and then filled it halfway and applied that additional amount on any problem areas (I have a little bit of redness and scarring on my cheekbone areas). This serum is easy to apply, feels refreshing and smells neutral. For reference, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap &amp; Sanitas Oil-Free Moisturizer on my face. Overall I am very happy with this Vitamin C serum and recommend it for anyone looking for an improvement to their complexion without more invasive treatments.</li>
    <li> I luvd this.. After a week of using it i gt compliments for my skin.. That it has brightened ..</li>
    <li> Great product! I feel like it has slowed the the aging process and smoothed my skin. I use it every morning and feel like my skin is soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product. Prices is good too.</li>
    <li> It was ok. I think there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product--used it for almost a month with minimal results. Product feels too &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; as opposed to a serum. Save your $</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great product for the price especially.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! But it took some time to see results. I&#x27;ve seen deference in 2 month (using it  daily).&lt;br /&gt;I was going to give up after a month of use, but decided to finish the bottle. And I was really surprised!&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks healthier and  more clear now. I&#x27;m going to reorder soon.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the mornings and retina A for night time.&lt;br /&gt;It was my second experience with vitamin c. Before this one I&#x27;ve tried Swiss very expensive brand ( over 100$) and it haven&#x27;t done much to my skin.</li>
    <li> Used this with dermastamp and gave me good results.</li>
    <li> second time purchasing but this bottle has a weird smell kinda fishy and odd texture  . It&#x27;s a bit disappointing because the first bottle didn&#x27;t smell bad and had a good constancy. :( not sure if I&#x27;ll return</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before.. I think it works great.. Use it every night esp around my jawline &amp; cheeks were I need a bit more firmness.. then I apply my oils/ moisturizers.. Great Price..</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel very soft!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It DEFINITELY has made a difference in the texture of my skin.  I only use in in the morning.  It gives a really nice matte finish and glow before I put on my BB cream and other makeup, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the overall quality of my skin since using it.  I&#x27;m 100% behind $28.99 for 1 ounce….TOTALLY worth it based on the vitamin C serums out on the market right now.  But why when I switch to the 2 oz option does it switch to $116!!!  Hmmm…let&#x27;s see… do I order 2 1-oz bottles for $58, or do I order the 2-oz bottle for $116? That&#x27;s just stupid.  I&#x27;m thinking I may need to divest in Amazon.com stock.  They&#x27;ve served me well as a customer and a stock holder for years now, but I&#x27;m starting to see things that don&#x27;t make sense.</li>
    <li> This serum works as well as one I was paying three times more for, and I can find no difference in the products.  I use it every day.  After it is completely dry, I use a good moisturizer and then my sunscreen.  At night, I alternate it every other day with a retinal product, followed by a good moisturizer.  I have ordered this product  three times....so very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum! I was hesitant at first because there are so many antioxidant serums and skin creams claiming to have vitamin C in them that always fall short.&lt;br /&gt;Best Vitamin C Serum is not one of them, in fact it is probably one of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve used in years. Within one week of daily use I noticed a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. The fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable after only two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to keep this in my skin care regimen and count myself lucky that I stumbled upon it!</li>
    <li> I have been using it now for about two weeks and I can see pretty visible results.  I currently use a great skincare line by NuSkin and have loved it for the past 20+ years.  I have swapped out the cell renewal fluid step in the morning and have replaced with OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  It seems to be working great, pores appear smaller and I have been able to see visible &amp;#34;sloughing&amp;#34; that has now gone away.  It has definitely improved the lines around my eyes and mouth.  Hopefully will continue to see great results.</li>
    <li> I read the review from other users and decided to give a try. So far has been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin looks better. I like how the seller will send me an email on how to use the product even before I received it. Very good customer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a week in using this and I&#x27;ve noticed a positive change in tiny lines. I&#x27;m looking forward to more positive results as the time passes!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum a lot! It comes with a dropper which is all you need. A little goes a long way. It is not greasy at all, unlike some other products that I have previously used before. It soaks into your skin and makes my skin feel soft and smooth, even more firmer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and am very happy with this product. I love that it is made with certified organic ingredients so I know that it&#x27;s something good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after using it for a while.</li>
    <li> This serum really delivers right from the start!  I will continue to use it after this bottle is empty.  Love the glow I am starting to get.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Saw a difference in my skin with  in a week&lt;br /&gt;Softness, clearance, helped a lot with my discoloration&lt;br /&gt;Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I tend to find a product I like and stick with it forever. I am over 50 and starting to notice larger pores as well as dealing with brown spots. I had a facial done and the technician recommended I try a vitamin C serum. The last time I made a change from my usual products I had a bad breakout so was very hesitant to try anything new. I have used this serum for a few weeks now and while I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic overnight effect, I do like it and think my pores may actually be decreasing in size. I like that OZ is made in the USA and uses Kosher/Vegan ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love that this is cruelty free, 72% organic, non GMO and contains no alcohol, parabens, or sulfates.  It is safe for all skin types and is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and am always wary of trying new products.  I always start with a small amount of a section of my face and see how my skin reacts to the product.  Thankfully, this gave me no allergic reaction or caused any sensitivity.  I didn’t notice any overwhelming scent which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a thin consistency and was very easy to apply.  You apply a thin layer on your face and then apply moisturizer after.  This comes with a dropper which makes it so much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my skin looks more radiant and healthy after using this product.  I love using it in the evening because my skin has all night to absorb all the goodness of this product!</li>
    <li> So far, I am loving this stuff! Right away I notice a much brighter complexion. I also noticed that, gradually, my dark spots and darker areas are fading. This is awesome! I also really like that it is 98% natural and 72% organic. The OZ Naturals group also sends you a detailed email with instructions which is great. The instructions say to use it once a day so I use it at night. I think I might check out their other Hyaluronic Acid to use during the day. I can&#x27;t speak to the long term benefits but I am thrilled with what it has done so far making it well worth the money. Really hope they don&#x27;t stop making this stuff!</li>
    <li> I loved Cellux-C, only problems were that it is a tad pricey, but more importantly, it clogged my pores.  I spent a lot on facials to deal with blackheads. Other than that, it worked great.  This has all the advantages, but none of the blackheads.  Win!  I love it and will keep ordering.  I am using it with the Acid Serum.  My 50+ skin is firmer and looks radiant.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> No difference on my skin, whatsoever. I did not see any changes. Almost like water in consistency and effect as well.</li>
    <li> This is a product I am trying out To see if Hyaluronic acid added to my face serum will make a difference. This product is reasonably priced and so far has no negative effects as some vitamin C products do. The company seems to provide you with plenty of information about proper use which is always appreciated&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> After using it for 2 weeks i can tell it&#x27;s a scam. It has produced me a lot of pimples in my lower cheeks which I HAVE NEVER HAD IN MY LIFE!&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews seems bought. Please don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> best face product to date for me.  I have aging skin, this keeps it soft and supple, minimized the &#x27;brown&#x27; spots on my face and my wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have been using it for a month and already see good results.</li>
    <li> I used it for about a month and the product worked alright! Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my Skin.</li>
    <li> So far I have ordered this product twice.  I absolutely love it because it does not leave any residue, smells great and leaves my skin looking beautiful.  I also love how it is natural and lacks a lot of the chemicals of common face products.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try this, but due to crazy below zero temps in Michigan alllllll this winter, it came frozen solid. I didn&#x27;t dare thaw it out and try it because I thought the freezing may have compromised the product</li>
    <li> If something works &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; I am suspect. That&#x27;s just not natural. I have noticed an improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s not radical, but it is an improvement. I have a raised spot on my chest, amongst the sunspots,  that has significantly shrunk. I think that continued usage will help my face in general. I&#x27;m not certain if I see discolorations lessening. I guess time will tell on that. Also, I don&#x27;t believe this will help with any major wrinkles or sagging, but as I said, the texture of my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> Dries into the skin rather quickly.  You can feel that this is a high quality serum.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and haven&#x27;t noticed much change, but things like this take time.  I feel certain I will have good results.  This serum is larger than most other serums here on Amazon with comparable ingredients.  I will continue to purchase.  I also use the QZ moisturizer.  This company is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of product . Amazon is quick with delivery and serum is great for face. I also use on my neck and hands. Excellent product and worth the money. It is such a great price for the benefits of healthy glow .</li>
    <li> It really works, Leaves my skin soft and bright. Also my skin is oily but this serum doesnt make my problem worst.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in a bubble wrap and without a box which is  very odd IMO.It made me breakout with a weird spot on one of my cheeks after using it for 12 days .Do not recommed it .</li>
    <li> I use this with the needle roller. It is ok. Waiting for some fine sun damage to go away. Not seeing it yet. Good thing it is minor. Been using about a month now. A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Time to do some gas chromatography or the like in the lab to see if this is really what it claims to be. Any biochemists out there?  Most vitamin Hyaluronic acid or Vitamin C liquid products will have a citrus-y taste to them as well as they oxidize over time and develop a slight color. This does neither. I think there is a thickening agent with water.  I think some type of &#x27;chemical profiling&#x27; should be required. Otherwise any of us can generate a smooth looking label and put it on some amber drop bottles. Not convinced it is what it claims to be based on those two &#x27;tells&#x27;. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> my wife has been using this and she loves it! she has noticed a huge difference in her (lack of) acne, increased skin smoothness, and overall facial health.</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne prone sensitive skin with post acne scars and I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week now and I love it !!! It&#x27;s crazy ! I can already see my scars lightening, makes my face so smooth. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in about a months time.</li>
    <li> Just got it. My wife said its still too early to tell</li>
    <li> I received the serum in two days, which is quicker than expected. So far I really enjoy this serum it dries quickly and is easy it apply. I feel my skin is improving but is to soon to tell to what degree of improvement.</li>
    <li> Only a couple of days - lets give it time. Do not really know how it works yet.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After using this serum for over a month it started to give me such a bad rash. Tiny bumps on my chin and neck. I was so happy when I first got it and I must say it was working but people with sensitive skin cant use this long term. The sad thing is this company only accepts returns up to 30 days from the day of purchase. Its too late to return or get a refund.  Absolutely love this serum!! I love how they have combined Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid together, it saves you a lot of money rather than buying them separately. Instantly my skin became softer and more youthful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with a few other products and the lines around my mouth are nearly gone. After a peel, this product and  a home made , fresh moisturizer, very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product, after the reviews I thought for sure this was a keeper. It&#x27;s been way over a week (14 days to be exact)since I purchased this product, I have put it on twice a day following the instructions, it does dry my skin only temporarily, I apply moisturizer and the dryness is gone, but all around I have not noticed a single difference. :( I guess I just have to keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;*I am revising my review on a few details that were not well accepted by the retailer, I should have clarified wasn&#x27;t just a week, 14 days so far and still waiting for the results. Also,I was advised on a strict skin regimen for the product to work, I feel this is important to know in advance for the fairness of all future customers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1 month and feel that it does improve the quality of my skin appearance.  I use it morning and night.  At night I use the Super Youth Retinol moisturizer, which I really like as well.  In the morning I usually use the Seaweed Extract moisturizer which is so-so.</li>
    <li> the vitamin C along with hyaluronic acid is great my skin has never looked so good</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! My face was smoother and tighter in a week. Excellent transaction. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month. There is a noticeable change in the appearance of both fine and deeper lines, and my skin looks younger. I have sensitive skin, and was a little cautious about using this, but it works great.</li>
    <li> Do not hesitate to order this product!  It has only been 2 weeks and my skin is already looking better and the price is unbeatable. The seller is awesome and has followed up with me 2 x to ensure I am satisfied.Will definitely be a regular customer!</li>
    <li> I just recently started using the OZ Natural C + E serum but I like what I&#x27;ve seen so far. My skin looks brighter and hydrated than ever. I totally recommend this product especially for the quality of the ingredients as well as the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product not only is it excellent in fighting free radicals on your skin, but I loved receiving an email from the seller with clear instructions for use, it was really helpful. This serum is not oily, will not clog your pores and has no alcohol or parabens and can be used in conjunction with your other skin care routine. Just wash your face as usual apply, let dry and then use your other favorite products on your face.Love it and will keep using it as well as ordering from this 5 star seller.</li>
    <li> One star! 20% vitamin c.  There&#x27;s much better vitamin c products that has 100% but it&#x27;ll cost more n it&#x27;s a lot more effective.  I showed this to my skincare lady, and she was disappointed that I didn&#x27;t buy the right product.  So. This product for me, tightens my skin a lil bit, and gives it slight youthful feel, since the price is lower, I use it generously only at night.  During the day, I feel like it darkens my freckles so I only use it before bedtime.  Over my toner, dna, and under my night cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve purchased for my face.  My skin has improved and facial lines are disappearing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel and look so much smoother! I love and will be getting more for years to come.</li>
    <li> After several months of use, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, nor suggest it to my friends. It isn&#x27;t any better or any more efficient than a drug store product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like it and make it work.. but it made me break out so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of weeks now and can see the improvement in my complexion. Smoother, brighter skin so far. Will keep using and will recommend to others. I take vitamins for my inner health, now I have some for my outer beauty!</li>
    <li> Really works! Customer service excellent, had to get more info on use &amp; was contacted immediately. I will re-order for sure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and see a dramatic difference in my skin.  Works much better than the expensive wrinkle cream I have.  I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed in the effectiveness of this serum, bottle almost empty, no brightness, no apparent difference in my skin.  Gave 3 stars because it soaked into skin, and hoped it was doing some good!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with overall feel and effect of it on my face after applying. My facial skin is firmer and skin color is even toned.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a timely manner.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks.  So far, I really do not notice any difference, but I like the feel of the product on my skin.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell there is no difference between this product and the ones I&#x27;ve purchased for 3 times as much. The packaging and service was great as well. Fast shipping with Amazon Prime. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. Makes the skin clearer and softer. Don&#x27;t forget to use it with a moisturizer as it makes the skin a bit dry</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give this product a better rating, since it did absolutely nothing for my skin. I used it religiously for 3 months. It seemed no different than rubbing water on my skin. I continued to use it after those 3 months, but I stopped using it twice a day. I&#x27;m just in my early 40&#x27;s, so I was only hoping to see a couple of fine lines and a few spots disappear. They haven&#x27;t, but maybe products simply don&#x27;t work for everyone. The only product that gave my skin a glow and made it even softer than it is had retinol in it. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to resort to chemical peels when my skin ages more in the future. I had high hopes for this, based on other reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t as lucky as those others. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily in the morning as part of my morning routine, I am not a person who wears any makeup so I don&#x27;t have a lot of skin issues, but I will say that this product makes me feel great. It brings a natural glow to your face and it makes your face feel so smooth. I was skeptical at first but can honestly say that when it says it&#x27;s the best it truly is. They take time with their products and the care they put into it is remarkable. The customer service this company provides is great also you can pretty much get any question answered. Looking forward to using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum feels very light and absorbs easily. The skin around my eyes is very sensitive and this product does not irritate, which is very unusual. All the more expensive serums cause immediately itching and redness. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I received my C Serum about a week ago and am very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on very easily and I feel very good about using such a high quality product on my aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have started to use this product long ago.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. The product is as it is described. Working fine so far. It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Really thought this would be thicker but it seems to be watered down.  Still using it just to see if it works.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery - good instructions of use.  It is noteworthy that the instructions said that using less is more and that one need not overdo it.  They are right, and as a consequence the serum will last quite some time.  It is light and absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and am considering purchasing it again. I have been using it instead of toner, and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will keep ordering it!!  After the first week of using it a co-worker looked and me and said &amp;#34;What are you doing? you look so good; what ever it is keep it up!&amp;#34;  Customers tell me how good I look everyday.....What a boost this is!!</li>
    <li> I like the results, However, it is somewhat drying to my skin. Just need to make sure you us moisturizer every time. Good product, though.</li>
    <li> Only two weeks in. Not a mind boggling change but what made it a super experience is the exceptional customer experience.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up email to explain how to best use the product and prompt courteous responses to my questions means I will use this vendor again!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product and noticed a difference after the first day.  I followed the directions as instructed and have had no problems.  I plan to reorder another bottle.  My skin feels so soft and healthy and I can see a difference in the fine lines and texture of my face.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal addition to my skin care! It brightened and smoothed my skin instantly... I would absolutely recommend it. The customer service was also great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. As many said it delivers however it contains phenoxyethanol. Look it up and see if you will be ok with it. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything bad happening to my skin on the contrary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin since I started using this serum along with a vitamin A lotion. Will keep on using it!</li>
    <li> I am dark skinned black woman with hyperpigmentation. Although it didn&#x27;t clear the hyperpigmentation it make my skin look very nice and bright without looking splotchy like hydroquinone. I&#x27;d definitely but this again, it&#x27;s relatively cheap, lasts a long time and worth every dime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chemical peels, dermabrasion treatments, facials, and used much more expensive skin products in an attempt to slow the aging process and have found this stuff is better than all of those combined. I&#x27;m 39 with some fine lines and dark spots beginning to show up, I read all the previous reviews on this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a try too. Well I&#x27;m certainly glad I did. Such a immediate result, and only gets better after a few weeks. I cleanse with a gentle wash, use a light toner, then a thin layer of this product, after a few mins I do a layer of vitamin A moisturizer. I&#x27;ve never had better results. You must try this stuff! Use sparingly and always follow with a good moisturizer. Customer service with Oz Naturals can&#x27;t be beat, they sent me detailed instructions when I ordered and followed up to see if I liked it. Top notch!</li>
    <li> Results within a week were very noticeable. This price is very good and it lasts a long time, as very concentrated. Have re-ordered.</li>
    <li> I used it for only a week and my skin glows! And whiten,make sure you use Moisturizer afterwards. So far I have no problems with the product.</li>
    <li> Do some research, this + sunscreen will SAVE your skin from aging, sagging, sunspots, wrinkles, cancer. I Put an entire eyedropper full into one hand, spread it to the other, and just coat my face with it like I would a lotion or cream. Do your neck, too, and crow&#x27;s feet. Do this in the morning, let it dry, put sunscreen on top. At night use Retinol or Retin-A. Your face will age half or less as much as everyone you know. Make &#x27;em jealous, or share the secret. Plus within a month or two it will make your skin more even and glowy. Perfect, right?</li>
    <li> This is a great anti-aging product!  I have been using it in conjunction with my derma roller and am seeing great results.  I am 48 years old and have really been seeing signs of aging the last couple of years like spots, fine lines and wrinkles and thinning skin.  Since starting the vitamin C serum, my skin feels plumped and rejuvenated, my skin tone seems more even and pores are diminished.  I have a very deep vertical line between my eyebrows and that even appears minimized.  You need very little of the product each use and so this bottle will last me quite a while.  The price is also very good and the customer service is fantastic.  I got an email from Angela Irish of Oz Naturals with directions on how much to use and how to apply as well as a follow up email to see if I had any questions.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t rate product efficacy yet as I have only been using it a week or so... Quick delivery and thus far I have liked the product consistency, and feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to give a complete review only been using it for two weeks have not notice any difference in my skin but I know it takes at least 6-8 weeks.  I can say it&#x27;s not sticky and it seems to absorb pretty quickly. It arrive as scheduled.  .  I will continue to use until I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive/acne prone skin and I use this at night. After wash, cotton ball my face w/ witch hazel, then I put on thin layer of tretinoid all over my face (for acne prevention), then put a small drop of this all over my face and finish off with dermalogica moisturizer.  My face feels soooo good the next morning.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to start using this treatment as she had read that topical vitamin C was very good for the skin. She says she really likes this product and will continue to use it. I had a small skin tag in my eyebrow and my wife applied some of this on it with a q tip. The next day the skin tag had reduced by three quarters. I am still continuing to apply this to the tag once a day. Now after six days it is almost gone.</li>
    <li> This product has made my skin feel smooth and I feel like the fine lines and wrinkles seem to be lessening if not disappearing !!  I really like it and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Slight evening of the face, no breakouts. OZ Naturals customer service has been excellent. They followed up with an instruction email to make sure I was using it correctly. Would definitely buy more products from them.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but after I tried it I really could see a difference in a week hope to continue seeing a difference</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, but this product definitely lives up to the hype. I have seen a drastic improvement on my face and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month. Yesterday I received a compliment on my age, the waitress actually thought I was 15 yrs younger than I am. I have spent a lot of money on other product, and haven&#x27;t seen nearly the results that this serum has given me. My little secret!</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals has great customer service, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a couple weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin. To be fair, I have used a lot of skincare products in the past, so my bar is sort of high. A lot of people seem to enjoy this product and see results from using it, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from trying it out. This product just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Smooths and plumps skin after a few days. Evens the skin color. I don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to do what I am about to say, but this serum has given my skin a glow; like a healthier color. I was sitting at a round table during a meeting and several co-workers literally commented on my complexion.  It is refreshing to have discovered a product that truly works as advertised...in other words, it&#x27;s great that there are products that truly can improve the skin of our face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this product delivering all that it claims (and more),and being an incredible value; the customer service in general is amazing. I have discovered this level of service with high volume/low ticket items is hard to find these days. This company is a class act. Will be purchasing again when my supply is exhausted. Super satisfied customer here. 5 stars. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this serum about 3 weeks ago. I use it nightly. I can see a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes. It helps my face stay hydrated (it&#x27;s dry in Colorado). The customer service was great - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had an Amazon vendor send me a separate email with a thank you and instructions for use. I will finish this bottle and order another!</li>
    <li> I purchased this and was a bit hesitant because I&#x27;d never heard of this company before.  I have very sensitive skin, so am careful what products I use.  I found the serum to be very light and not the syrupy texture I&#x27;ve experienced in other serums.  They sent me an email letting me know this was because they don&#x27;t use any fillers, just the active ingredients.  I have really loved the serum, my skin is soft, brighter, and my hyper-pigmentations are fading after a few weeks of once daily use.  I have not experienced any redness or any irritation. Its a really great product!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know for sure how it works. But the service from OZ Naturals was great, they sent a follow up email to be sure I had received this product. I&#x27;m used to Vitamin C products being yellow, but this is clear, and goes on nicely. I haven&#x27;t had any strange breakouts or noticed any real difference yet but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The product ordered was delivered quickly and of the same quality of comparable product 2 to 3 times more expensive.  I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels when I put it on.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin yet but am hopeful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few vitamin C products. This one is much thicker than other brands. I am assuming it is due to the hyaluronic acid. It terms of what it does--so far so good. I am a realist--if not a pessimist--and do no expect to see benefits immediately.</li>
    <li> Really like the texture of this product, thought it was a great value for the size of the bottle and the price, great service as usual!!!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;ll say that the service has been excellent.  Delivered on time with a personalized thank-you note and instructions from the company.  I just started to use the product so I can&#x27;t give full results yet, but I will say that it has a nice consistency, goes on well and feels nice on my skin.  I should see results in another month or so.</li>
    <li> This serum arrived on time, securely packaged, and met all of my expectations.  The price was very reasonable, and I am using it in conjunction with fraxel therapy to improve the texture and appearance of my not so very bad, but 56 year old, skin.  The serum goes on smoothly, a small amount goes a long way, and the hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin and reduces the appearance of all but the most well-earned wrinkles.  I think I will postpone that facelift for a few more years, and invest the savings in french bulldogs.  After all, they love you no matter what you look like...</li>
    <li> I received the Vitamin C Serum about 2 weeks ago and have used it daily.  I have not used it long enough to see a difference but I do know that Vitamin C is very effective in good skin care and have been using other Vitamin C products for years.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really did much but I feel like my skin is doing better (it might be all in my mind). I am prone to acne and this did not make me break out. It actually felt refreshing. I used it after I washed my face and it felt calming. One thing- I am not a fan if the smell. But I held my breath for 10 seconds while it soaked in and then I didn&#x27;t smell a thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. Applied on top of the exfoliating/brightening lotion, moisturizer. Topped with sunscreen at daytime or night emulsion at night. Marked improvement of wrinkles and texture of skin.</li>
    <li> I expected a lot out of OZ Naturals due to all the reviews, and while it was suitable, I wasn&#x27;t happy about the quality of the Serum. It was a bit watery and didn&#x27;t provide the moisture-locking feeling that I&#x27;m used to. Furthermore there was a scent that I didn&#x27;t like, it didn&#x27;t smell natural like the label says. Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a bit inexpressive that they can&#x27;t provide truly high quality Vitamin C. I was turned on to [[ASIN:B003H1MYF8 this Vitamin C]] by a dermatologist, and I must say it has been far more effective for my skin type. If you&#x27;re skeptical I recommend trying a few options and testing all of them to see the real results you&#x27;ll get from each. It is a time intensive process but it&#x27;s the only way to know which Vitamin C is truly good and which ones are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to look out for:&lt;br /&gt;- Any company claiming to remove wrinkles - these are likely fake. The best Vitamin C products can reduce fine lines, but will not get rid of them completely.&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin C is not a moisturizer, any product claiming to be a moisturizer is likely not good. Vitamin C helps lock in the moisture and when paired with the right moisturizer increases that moisturizers effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly make sure to choose wisely, there is no cost too great when it comes to protecting your skin.</li>
    <li> good value for the price. Best for combination to oily skin type, I&#x27;m a skin care therapist and good vit C serum have been my morning routine for years, you don&#x27;t have to brake the bank.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Made me break out immediately and is full of suspect ingredients. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the 72% organic, which means almost 30% can be synthetic chemicals, which is is a high percentage, so it&#x27;s borderline false advertising to say it&#x27;s an organic, natural product.</li>
    <li> Just okay. I&#x27;m over 60 and saw not changes or improvements to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first serum I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it.  You get results almost instantly.  I use it morning and night, and my skin has never looked better.  I apply it everywhere: face, neck, around eyes.  The fine lines are gone, and the skin complexion is a lot smoother.  It is a good moisturizer on its own, so I don&#x27;t even have to use anything on top of that. I do follow with sunblock, though, if I go outside.  This is my second bottle.  The first one lasted me several months.  From all of the research I&#x27;ve done, OZ Naturals looks like a good line for natural/organic beauty products.  Looking forward to try other products.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t amazing. I saw no real or lasting improvement in my skin, but it did give me a temporary glow as long as I used the product. The eye-dropper bottle is extremely frustrating because your hands are often wet and you have to unscrew it to use it, and then screw it back on after applying it. However, I ended up tipping over the bottle and all the product spilled out. This happened with both bottles I purchased, even though I was extremely careful not to do it again.     I am not going to purchase another Vit C serum, as I think the results are just temporary and not worth the price. If they had done something for my pores, the texture of my skin, the elasticity- anything, I would repurchase. But I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on two spilled bottles that had no permanent improvement.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working but no breakout is a good deal. All C serums gave me breakouts</li>
    <li> Best dark spot remover I have ever tried.  Worked better than the expensive serum I bought from a famous Los Angeles dermatologist. Spots were almost invisible after a week of using once a day.  However the spots will begin to come back if you expose your face to sunlight too much, even with sunscreen. It also helps with keeping moisture in my skin.  I use the same moisturizer as before, but have noticed since using this serum my face still feels moisturized at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it with OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum and it is not greasy, feels good on my face, and it&#x27;s actually softening some of my wrinkles.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it on morning and night before I put my face cream on. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> this was recommended to me by a nutritionist who focusses on skin care and i tried one bottle. thought it was way too expensive and did not find any of the results to be worthwhile. vitamin c is said to be great for skin, so i will source other products with this but will not be purchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> love it --totally part of my morning and night routine now! doesnt feel heavy to wear under makeup and sunscreen either.</li>
    <li> It provides such a youthful glow. I used to use VIT C all over my face, and I forgot how beneficial it was till I tried this. Use it, you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I find that this oil does help to fill in the facial lines to a certain extent. It can&#x27;t perform miracles but it helps the skin to look younger.</li>
    <li> So far this stuff is amazing!! Can&#x27;t afford amazing expensive products. But amazing inexpensive is right up my alley!!  Seems to give you a clear smooth come in rather quickly!  No stinging ... you need to follow up with moisturizer</li>
    <li> I have tried several vitamin C facial products and always had the&lt;br /&gt;irritation and redness.  Not with this one!  Has smoothed my skin and helps&lt;br /&gt;with fine lines.  Takes very little to cover the entire face.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Seduced by the myriad reviews, I bit. My experience? Not that great...too strident and caustic on my sensitive skin - lesson? Not every product is meant for one and all...</li>
    <li> This is a great product, help me a lot with my acne. Buy it you love it.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. It is more liquid than serum. But helps to heal my cuts fast as I am having an eczema outbreak now. Surprisingly non irritating, and comfortable. using my 2nd bottle now.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Good price and I love the light citrus smell of this product. A little goes a long ways, so I only need about two drops to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have some hyperpigmentation on my cheek, this seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> Just received this item this week, but  already noticing improvement in my skins texture! Came nicely sealed which is important for high grade derm products, as they lose potency.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Skinscueticals Vit C oil several times and decided to try this one because of the price, because it&#x27;s organic and because it has hyalauric acid.  It&#x27;s a fantastic value and I found it to be less drying or irritating than the much more $$$$ brand name I was using previously.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, removes light patches and skin for an even tone.</li>
    <li> Nice Serum, not greasy.  I can only review the short term effects of this serum because I have only been using it a week.  It&#x27;s a generous size for the price and I like the dropper applicator.  This serum itself is fairly thin and goes on evenly.  A little goes a long way.  I noticed a plumping smoothing effect almost immediately.  I don&#x27;t have great skin and this helped my makeup go on smoother and look nicer and more even once it was on.  There isn&#x27;t a reduction in actual wrinkles (after all it&#x27;s only been a week) but I think the little bit of plumping gives that effect.  I really like the serum so far. I will comment on any long-term effects once I have been using it longer.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for six months and it is amazing. I&#x27;m a 69 year old male and it has soften the lines and has made my skin healthier.</li>
    <li> After using this for only two weeks my dark spots are lightening up! I have oily skin and it works well with it. My skin definitely looks younger and has a glow.</li>
    <li> Has all the active ingredients I was looking for. A better deal would be https://www.scottsmarketplace.com/buy/939/vitamin-c-serum-2oz-advanced-vitamin-c-serum-for-f/.</li>
    <li> I think those positive reviews are fake...&lt;br /&gt;It causes hives on my face.... ( and this is the first time that a cosmetic causes problem on my skin )</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for feel of it on my face.</li>
    <li> So far i really like this product! quick shipment</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic seller!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel and look wonderful</li>
    <li> Fantastic product I use it every day I am 72 but my skin looks 50.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this diligently for the past few nights. We are both in our early thirties so overall our skin does not many have wrinkles and fine lines. I can see that it gives my skin a glow and minimizes the pores and fine lines around our eyes. I think this is more suited for a mature person in their 40s and up. The product is not sticky and applies easily and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves this Serum. Just few drops is enough for the whole face and neck area. It feels really nice on the skin and after just 1 week of use she already can see the results-healthier looking more hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> Just put my face dry... I tried acid hialuronic before and it work great for me but not this ...</li>
    <li> Good stuff but to get it to penetrate into your skin instead of on top, I found that using a face buffer &amp; face cleanser to get dead skin off really makes a difference. This product has made my skin feel smooth without dryness &amp; look fresh. It really has helped fine lines around my eyes &amp; for frown lines. It did take some time to notice a difference &amp; it did not completely take it away but what does? Nothing! No need to use moisturizers that clog pores either. I really like it &amp; can tell when I have forgotten to put it on.</li>
    <li> watery, very unserum-like.</li>
    <li> NOT ENDORSED BY DR. OZ AND NOT A VERY POTENT VIT. C</li>
    <li> Second purchase of this product but not before being tempted away by another organic serum.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s no comparison this one really does fade my annoying dark patches and is quickly absorbed into the skin leaving no sticky residue unlike others I&#x27;ve sampled, great value too!!!!</li>
    <li> I must say this is a wonderful serum!  My skin looks younger and feels smoother!  Its not heavy, feels very light weight, and absorb easily into the skin!  I love this product and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see any changes for at least a couple of weeks. I saw a difference the very next day! I love the beach and as a result I had a couple of broken blood vessels on my face. They decreased dramatically...no kidding. I also use to smoke and I had one deep line near my lip that suddenly became almost invisible!! I was so excited that when my husband got home I asked him did he notice anything about my face. He looked quietly and then said yes, your broken vessels are barely noticeable and under your eyes look puffy...like you got really good sleep. I then told him about my serum and he was amazed at the results from just a day. I have been using for a week and believe me when I say...IT IS SO WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before bed, and I love the way it makes my skin feel. This is such a great product!</li>
    <li> Delivered frozen.Thawed promptly at room temp.Used the whole bottle.Freezing may have interfered with potency.I am going to try&lt;br /&gt;one more bottle and rate again.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum over a month ago,  I waited to write my review until I had time to use it. I have a good daily skin care regiment, but I wanted to add a  vitamin C serum.  I review several different products before purchasing this one,  I have to say I am glad I did.  I have noticed brighter skin, more even tone and less redness since using the product.  I am quite please and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the positive reviews, and now after a while of constant correct use the results are in.... Not a change at all.  I actually do exactly what the directions tell you to do.  I have used it twice a day (they came via email to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go on to say, it makes your face really dry so you have to use a good moisturizer after would any way.  Not worth the money, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works for you, that&#x27;s wonderful, but not one bit of change happened for me.  I gave it 2 stars as I am still hoping a miracle will happen, as I do intend to use it all up, but I am not holding my breath...</li>
    <li> great product. this is my second bottle. my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product for both young and mature women.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t yet been a week and, already, I can see a brightness and a smoother texture in my skin.  Dark spots from previous acne scarring appear to be lightening.  You definitely want to follow usage of this serum with a good moisturizer.  I&#x27;ll provide an update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to try out and replace a more expensive brand product I was using for years.  I am happy to say that this product far exceeded my expectations and dare I say that it works better than my old brand.  Upon using this product I witnessed a noticeable improvement in my face in really just under 1 week.  It was smoother and had a very nice glow to it.  A must for the winter time as my face tends to look sallow and dry at this time.  Another thing I like about this product is that you only need a little each day.  I just put 2 to 3 drops in my hand and rubbed on my face generously.  Most days I did twice a day, but probably really only needed one application.  With that process it lasted about 2.5 months for me.  It&#x27;s now become an item I am ordering regularly.</li>
    <li> I think it might be a little to early to give you a fair assessment of the Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you... the Customer Service + Support has been really great !&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll let you know how how it goes in a couple of weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Until then...thanks.  DJL</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and after using a more expensive product recommended by my dermatologist&#x27;s medical aesthetician.  I saw zero results. The aesthetician said that it is the wrong type of vitamin c to be effective. It should be ascorbic acid.  Also, that hyaluronic acid and vitamin c are not mixed but used independently.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This has made such a difference in my skin i see the improvement daily. My skin looks great I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the positive reviews I read from those who had tried it. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results, my skin appears clearer and firmer, and the product leaves my skin smooth and soft, rather than dried out.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of Vitamin C products and didn&#x27;t think this was anything great.  I would like to point out that the only &amp;#34;Allure Best in Beauty&amp;#34; award this product has is from an advertisement.  A quick image search using the words &amp;#34;Oz Naturals Allure Best&amp;#34; produces the page from the publisher and the word advertisement is at the top.  Nice try.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin to look brighter amd more even toned.  I have had malasma for years.  This seesm to keep it under control.  I&#x27;ve actually felt ok going out w/o make-up since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> My son search  the best serum for wrinkles on the face, and came up with  this bottle, so I tried it. The very first night that I applied on my forhead where wrinkles are visible, it was gone the next morning. And yes I  will definitely recomend to my friends and I will buy it again when I am done with it. But I think it will take a year to finish this because I only put 2 drops on my forhead, up to the corner of my eyes, then on my throat another two drops.The result is amzing. The shipment is good it was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it makes a difference yet. Been about 2 weeks. Will have to see if any difference in a month.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite vitamin C serum. I have tried several different ones in the past and stumbled across OZ naturals on Amazon. I have brighter, even skin now, thanks to OZ!</li>
    <li> Calms and heals my skin + seems to make it glow from within. Beautiful! Thank you!! Only drawback is small size for the price (I use morning + night), but it&#x27;s still much cheaper than designer serums + more effective.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using this product for a while now and I can see a clear difference when I use only my daily moisturizer or I use this before I apply the moisturizer. I see my skin has improved. My skin feels soft and looks radiant. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a month... but I really like this product so far.  I use this serum in the morning and the OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Acid serum before bedtime.  I&#x27;m 24 years old, so I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of deep wrinkles, but I do think my skin feels smoother and generally brighter and healthier looking.  I only gave this product 4 stars as I can&#x27;t say whether or not it&#x27;s this product making the difference (or really, how much of a difference is being made).  Although, I believe in it!  Definitely worth a try for the price.</li>
    <li> total rip -off&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin water&lt;br /&gt;Buy the real Skin Ceuticals product if you can afford it&lt;br /&gt;I compared the two side by side</li>
    <li> I use this product along with my cleanser and lotion in my evening facial cleansing routine. I have been using this product for 3 months now and I have seen a few noticeable changes in my skins consistency. I didn&#x27;t realize how many red patches I had on my face until after I used this stuff for about a month and my skin tone evened out to a healthy, even toned glow. Another difference I have noticed is how soft and hydrated the skin on my face is from the time of application before bed until I cleanse in the morning, I also had some mild acne scarring from my teenage years that has become so shallow that it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in bettering their appearance and is looking for a higher end product to add to their daily routine.</li>
    <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum.  My skin has never looked better.  I have my 20 year old daughter using it and she loves it too.  Just makes your skin feel tight and firm and looks just amazing.  My sister is using it too and she says the same things.  This is one product I will never stop using!!</li>
    <li> I was using pure hyaluronic only and had no problems.  Decided to try this one with the additives.  My skin dried out and was blotchy.  I guess it had too much acid.  Don&#x27;t know but I am returning to the 100% pure hyaluronic one.</li>
    <li> This one dried my face and left my skin peeling a little around my nose and made certain areas red (ouch). Maybe I&#x27;m just allergic to it for some reason because I&#x27;ve used other brands of vitamin C serum &amp; they didn&#x27;t give me this issue.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! I can really see a difference!</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received this within 2 days and so far I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for only about 2 weeks and I think my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> It works after first application, less fine lines and my skin looks radiant.It works better than department store serum. I would definitely purchase the serum again</li>
    <li> Hopefully I continue to get good results, time will tell.  Wish I had known about the benefits of vit c years ago!</li>
    <li> The results from my Vitamin C Serum are more than I expected.  The texture of my skin improved immediately.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work!&lt;br /&gt;There are so many reviews and they are all true. My face looks bright and glowing. When I do get my little breakouts (every month) this stuff helps the healing process. I highly recommend this product. Only downfall is that it IS expensive. I will, say you only need a little bit so it can go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve heard people say &amp;#34;feels like water dont waste your money&amp;#34;. Sorry it is nothing like water. It is a little slippery when you rub it and it does dry fast but it is NOT water, not even close!</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy! I have had a sun spot on my cheek that has bothered me for years.  I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work specifically on it, so I haven&#x27;t been paying attention, but I&#x27;ve used about a half of the bottle, and my sun spot is almost gone. Usually it gets darker in the summer, so I&#x27;m excited to see what happens during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some spots on my hands that I don&#x27;t like, so I just started using it there to see what happens....</li>
    <li> I like this product because it has several of the ingredients that are good for your skin.Absorbs easily and non irritating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about six or seven weeks, and I see a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with a vitamin C facial cream and can see a noticeable difference. I would recommend it to anyone, but it does take some time before you start seeing improvement so be patient.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid eighties, but needless to say I am at war with Mother Nature. It will be a fight to the finish as I feel Much younger inside.  I have been using your Vitamin C with Hyaloronic Acid for only a month, but feel pretty good about my encounters with the mirror  - May be somewhat better, but at least holding my own and have hopes of going back in time.  Thanks for the push. - Fergie</li>
    <li> It did NOT give me the results that the reviews said that it would.  I used it 2 times a day and the only thing that I can say is that it felt nice.</li>
    <li> I usually put off trying anti-aging serums because my skin reacts so badly to a majority of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. This serum, however, did not irritate my skin at all and I&#x27;ve been loving how well it evens out my skin tone. I use it every night under my night cream and it&#x27;s been a pleasant addition to my night time skin routine</li>
    <li> I have been using a retinol (tretinonin .025% ) cream by itself, and noticed visible decrease in lines/wrinkles when I added this vita c serum--I am 63 years old.  I found the combination to be exceptionally effective.</li>
    <li> a very good product for the price</li>
    <li> I noticed improvements in my skin in just a couple of days. Effective, but not too strong or irritating. Great price and customer service. I will buy this for many years.</li>
    <li> The first day I used it, I already saw a difference. My foundation just went on so much smoother. Over time, it also evens out your complexion and gives you this glow. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends and we all love it. Try it.... you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> hasn&#x27;t done much for me. Maybe it isn&#x27;t the right product for my skin, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of this vitamin C serum! I was really surprised that I received my product within 2 days of ordering it, which is the quickest I have ever received anything I have ordered online! And the serum works great! I have gotten so many compliments on how wonderful my skin looks! A friend said it looked like I had foundation on because my face looked so flawless and youthful! I definitely recommend this product to anyone interested because I will be purchasing this again as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away.  I did some research and found that Vitamin C may be just as effective as Retina A, so thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  With my 50th birthday right around the corner, I felt like it was time to do something a little more serious than the daily moisturizer.  I combine applying the Vitamin C after I use a product with retinol (over the counter) and end with a moisturizer that is loaded with aloe vera.  So far, I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful going on. I don&#x27;t get a sticky film from this serum. Definitely will order again.  Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> My skin looks better and my dark spots have lightened up .</li>
    <li> My wife like it very much, the quality is very good and the price is very favourable</li>
    <li> Oh oh so nice . My face drinks this in and absorbs fast. No fuss no muss and follow up with face cream. It is really nice on the face. I am a senior and just love it. Got two bottles up front.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful vitamin C serum! Reasonable priced,and people ; it really does do want it says!! Love it!</li>
    <li> this prodactis is not good . aftere i aply it on  my face start burning for last tow days. it is not for every  one</li>
    <li> Best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Would have been nice to find out how it works, but bottle&#x27;s dropper top did not stay securely closed.  Took a trip and found the $30.00 serum had leaked out all over my other toiletries.  I tested the top afterward, twisting it closed and again, it untwisted, allowing leakage.  Moving on.</li>
    <li> Quite nice, does its job and I attribute its potency more to science than the particular formulation of this serum. However, minus a star for using phenoxyethanol as a preservative and two stars for still being slightly pricy in comparison to the price of the raw ingredients.</li>
    <li> My order arrived in a timely manner.  I have only used it for about 10 days and I can already see the difference in my skin!  I highly recommend this product to anybody who wants to have younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I would like to start off by writing that product arrived promptly as advised. Product has tone my neck and face. Wrinkles are diminishing. But give product time. It will work as advised. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is extremely good. All I need is a good cleanser and and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I received my Vitamin C Serum as promised and also received a follow-up email instructing me how to use it.  I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but am already feeling and seeing the benefits.  My skin appears smoother and fresher in appearance.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 2 weeks and my skin is much smoother and the color seems to be evening out.</li>
    <li> This serum has all the ingredients I like and need ...vitamins A, C, E plus moisturizing hyaluronic acid.  I&#x27;m glad to have found a product that has all of these ingredients in one solution.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice serum that leaves your face feeling fresh and looking renewed.  It goes on easily with no residue and I can apply other products after it as well.  I like the fact that not only does it contain the vitamin C &amp; E that the skin needs but also contains hyaluronic acid which is a plus.  Also being a freshly made product made to order at a reasonable price is a bonus.  A real win-win!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent, but wasn&#x27;t magic for my oily blemish prone skin. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere next time.</li>
    <li> I just really like this product.  I guess the vitamin c helps to brighten my face.  It&#x27;s not a miracle serum, but it feels good when I apply it.  I use it at night only.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and seems to be working on my face pretty good. My only issue is the bottle was only 3/4 full. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the norm but my wife bought vitamin C serum from a different supplier not the same, and her bottle was full.</li>
    <li> I have always used a Vitamin C serum along with my skin care routine. This one is a good value compared to others I have used and is also gentle for my sensitive skin. I have combination skin and occasional pimple breakouts. This one does not cause my skin to get too oily and aggravate it. I noticed that it also made my pores look smaller and gave a nice texture to the skin. I use it on the days I do not use my prescription retinol product. I am 57 and have no wrinkles. This is a good combo for me, the C serum has helped with the sun damage from living in a sunny state for 5 years. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I notice a bit of difference, but I use it with Estee lauder facial night repair, which I use in the night then OZ for daytime.I might try a second bottle to see if is worth continuing.</li>
    <li> its way too diluted to the point where it is essentially useless</li>
    <li> it has soften the lines around my mouth</li>
    <li> Broke out my skin. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the way my face feels when I use this!</li>
    <li> Loving this product! My skin feels and looks smoother, softer and firmer. Been using it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!! My skin is so much better. It worth what you pay.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works</li>
    <li> this product does make your face look better when you apply it but have not seen any lasting results as a topical product its ok not as great as peter thomas roth i have tried which is amazing but also cost alot more</li>
    <li> I read some the positive reviews and I was deceived into buying this worthless product. It did absolutley nothing for me. No fading of discoloration ....No FADING of dark spots and NO evening of SKIN TONE that the package promised. More phoney promises and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I fisrt used this for a week, I did not recognize any drastic difference. I, then, decided to apply more (at least half of the spuit) and layer on to my skin several times. Next day? I loved my skin. It was brigther and pimple redness faded away.&lt;br /&gt;Now my skim tone looks even and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;I love this and recommend this to anyone who is looking for a high quality yet cheap vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money...didn&#x27;t do anything for me. have been using as directed for several weeks without results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 months and I have noticed the difference on my face.  My wrinkles are less noticeable and my face has brighten.  I definitely recommend this product and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> i like it, not sure if it is doing anything...</li>
    <li> It is interesting that most of the reviews are from people who have received this product free&lt;br /&gt;for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. I have never received the product for free, BUT I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;two or three bottles, because I do like it very much. The very first thing I do in the morning&lt;br /&gt;when I get out of bed is wash my face and put this on. I am seventy-six, and I&lt;br /&gt;look much younger than my age. I take very good care of skin and have tried MANY&lt;br /&gt;serums, creams, etc. over the years. SO FAR, I really feel that this serum has helped keep&lt;br /&gt;my face in good condition, before I apply my sunscreen and makeup for the day. AGAIN, I&lt;br /&gt;have NOT been paid or given free any products to write this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different vitamin c serums and this one is by far the best. I can actually see a difference in my face and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I think this is helping.  I&#x27;m half way through the bottle now.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it.  You must use a good cream after about 10 minute of putting this on.</li>
    <li> We all know that vit c is good for the body. Well this bottle is a vit c serum. You take out the dropper and put one to two drops on your fingers and you put it on your skin after you have done the oz naturals facial toner. Then after that you take the naturals facial moisturizer on. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  Make sure when you apply anything you are doing upward and outward motions on your face. If you do downwards well you will start sagging sooner than you would like too. It is vegan free. When you have been using this for a weeks or so you will notice your skin texture feeling smoother. I noticed it after my third application big time. I do highly suggest getting all three product to get the best benefit out of the products.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m really loving this!!! It makes my face even softer and seems to soak right in...looks even smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it &amp; it hasn&#x27;t even been a month yet!</li>
    <li> Noticed that it made my skin a little dry other than that I like it</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC serum. Skin feels tightened, smooth for makeup application.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> really makes my face feel soft</li>
    <li> I like it very good product will be ordering again thank you will recommend to family and friends good experience.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. It really smooths out the skin without leaving a hint of any oily residue. Absorbs quickly. I use it every night and highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Great product to revitalize your skin again.  Use it with the Acid serum.  They work great together. I have had many compliments on how great my skin looks.  I just turned fifty so this was great to hear.</li>
    <li> very good item, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and it makes my skin glow, it gives it a brightness I haven&#x27;t had in quite some time. I put a couple drops in my palm and rub my hands together and quickly pat it on my face then apply my moisturizer the same way and I&#x27;m done. I would recommend this product  if you want to maintain healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference. I have pitting, acne scars, discoloration and some wrinkles. Did not see any improvement for any of these... Not worth the money</li>
    <li> I was dubious when the manufacturer said I would likely see results in one use but one use later I did see it! I noticed first the smoothness that you get from hyaluronic acid and the brightness started 3 days later. I am going into my 3rd week thrilled with my skin! I&#x27;ve turned on a handful of friends to it and they are having the exact experience. What a find !!!!!! I bought a second bottle already so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. My face started to look brighter after 2 weeks. Yes, I love it and will definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is great around my eyes. They look refreshed and bright. Light moisture, but just a little, it&#x27;s almost the consistency of water. Good for sensitive skin. You won&#x27;t break out. I like it a lot so far :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days so far and after the first night I noticed a huge difference.  My redness is much lower, skin color is more white and bright and the texture is softer. Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but to me I can tell a huge difference in one day. I&#x27;ll repost in a week or two.</li>
    <li> After trying this for a few weeks, the OZ Naturals appears to do exactly what they claim. It isn&#x27;t a miracle liquid that is the fountain of youth. However, it does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to even out the color of my skin. Darker spots have lightened up a little bit. The results aren&#x27;t dramatic, but there all the same. This has been really good at reducing a dark bruise I&#x27;ve had for many years. This is one of those blue and purple marks that never went away - I bumped into something and well it&#x27;s been there a long time. I&#x27;ve applied this serum for the past few weeks and I can see the spot getting lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin feel smoother and healthier. There is science behind hyaluronic acid reducing wrinkles, it has been around for a long time and really works. Vitamin C is always a good thing. And amino acids can&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love OZ Naturals packaging. I have three of their products and each is in a unique container with a different colored label. It makes it easy to choose the right product. Even though the product itself is the critical thing, I love the company logo with a beautiful tree - it is calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> In the beginning it was just because it had good reviews and it was natural, but after using it only once, OH MY, my skin was tighter! I am glad that I have found such a great product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 23 year-old who has always had pretty good skin- clear but with visible pores and those tiny annoying bumps here and there. I&#x27;ve always been afraid to have a complicated skin regimen because I believe that simplicity is best when it comes to your skin. I however do know that like the rest of your body, your skin needs nourishment. And the best is simple nourishment. This stuff is literally goodies for your skin and I could not be happier with it. I expected to see slight betterment in the look and feel of my skin, but the results were DRASTIC within two weeks. My skin is smooth, flawless, and glows on it&#x27;s own! My pores are gone and if I do put makeup on (which is literally half a pump of product whenever I do), it glides on flawlessly. Here&#x27;s my skin regimen for anyone who&#x27;s interested:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clarasonic with Neutrogena Deep Clean Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2) Pat dry and press (DO NOT RUB) OZ Naturals Serum to face and neck&lt;br /&gt;3) Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;4) Olay 7 in 1 total effects moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;5) If I use makeup that day- pea sized amount of either NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer or Smashbox Liquid Halo Foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clarasonic with Neutrogena Deep Clean Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2) Pat Dry and press in Ole Henrickson&#x27;s Youth Activating Oil to face and neck&lt;br /&gt;3) Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff turned sceptic into believer and I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65.... and my skin hates anything that even resembles a moisturizer!  That&#x27;s not good at this age.  Moisturizers make my normally clear skin break out after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks now.  Not only has my sensitive skin NOT broken out... I do believe I am seeing a difference in wrinkles already!  I actually noticed a difference in the way my skin felt after the first use.  I&#x27;m loving it.  Will be ordering more soon - for myself and for gifts.</li>
    <li> I have a moderate acne and sensitive skin, I used this product for two months I didn&#x27;t get any result, instead I broke out more than usual. I now use Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure by Cosmedica Skincare and my face has improved alot.</li>
    <li> I have been using OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum for several months now. My friends and family have all asked me what I have been doing because my skin is looking better than it has in years. The only consistent change I have made to my daily routine is to use this serum twice a day. I use it on my face, neck, chest and arms. My skin tones have evened out, my face is radiant and clear. I now go to the gym without makeup. Sounds vain, yes, but I couldn&#x27;t do it before because of my complexion. I am thrilled with this product and best of all it is inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product - it works and my skin is looking much better after just a few weeks! Unfortunately, the packaging sucks. Most of the container spilled out in travel, as the top will not stay closed. I would recommend this product as a great solution, but not for traveling - purchase a different product for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great serum. My skin feels and looks so much smoother and has a more even tone and it&#x27;s much softer too</li>
    <li> This is the only product my husband was willing to try because it wasn&#x27;t a greasy feel. So he actually used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month he came to me and said,&amp;#34;Look the lines from my crow&#x27;s feet on my right eye don&#x27;t all the way back to my temple like the other one.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was it. When your man actually tells you he can see a difference, then you may as well give it a 30 day try.</li>
    <li> I am so very happy with this product. There was visible difference in seven days. I will be telling other friends about this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vit C 12% and liked what it has done to my face. I tried this Oz Natural product and see immediate results. I love this product and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to really see any difference. Kind of hard to tell on your own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I am impressed with my results. My face feels soft and looks healthy. I will continue to use this product and hope to see more anti-aging results. Fast delivery and great customer service~ I love that the company sends personal e-mails to check on the delivery status and my happiness with the product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to know if it is making a visible difference or not.  I am very hopeful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a good product according to other reviews.  I have not had any adverse reactions to the serum.</li>
    <li> Working great, love it! Skin seems to be revitalized day by day. Gonna buy more if it&#x27;s still working on my skin like this</li>
    <li> Completely unimpressed with this.  I have to wonder where all of these reviews are coming from?  I&#x27;ve been using this along with their Hyaluronic serum for a few months.  See no improvement to my skin.  The moment they are both out of the bottle, they basically turn into the consistency of water.  Might as well be water - has done nothing for my skin.  Very difficult to apply.  I recently purchased Paula&#x27;s Choice Vitamin C serum and within days saw a positive difference.  I will not be repurchasing this product.  I find it useless!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week or so now.  I find it to be just as great as some much more expensive brands.  I will defiantly be returning here to purchase again.  I am also going to look at the other produces they carry.</li>
    <li> I saw it smoothed my face skin on the first day but not after the 1st day unfortunately.  I don&#x27;t like the smell and sticky texture.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a year now.  It&#x27;s not greasy, goes on nicely, very light weight and dries fast on your skin.  I use it under my sunscreen moisturizer every morning.  I also, have oily skin so it was important to find something that was not greasy.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m too young to know if this works well or not but i think it does. i&#x27;ve started using very early to keep my youthful complexion (carded for an R movie and i&#x27;m 30 years old). i think it may be a good product though, if you can swing it i&#x27;d try this one over the other products offered.</li>
    <li> Not only was the shipping prompt but I love the product! My skin is typically really sensitive so I was expecting to have some kind of a bad reaction but the reaction has only been positive. My skin looks healthier with a nice glow!</li>
    <li> love it...heals pimples and also i think gets rid of dead skin...</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift. She received. That is all I can tell you about this product. She was glad to receive it.</li>
    <li> The product feels good on the skin, but don&#x27;t notice a difference yet.  Question:  how much Hyaluronic Acid and E  in the ingredients?  And, no Tocopheryl shown in the ingredients for Vitamin E.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sermon on my face for about two weeks now and i haven&#x27;t broken out ye. My skin looks healthier and isn&#x27;t dry like it normally would be in the winter. I&#x27;ll update my review in a few months to let you know whether the sermon does take care of dark spots, blemishes, etc.</li>
    <li> I have never used a serum on my skin since I was pretty skeptical of the work some oils could do . Not any more !&lt;br /&gt;A small dab of this product daily,  prior to your moisturizing regimen helps brighten , tighten and prep the skin to actually absorb the moisturizer .&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much - a tiny droplet will be more than sufficient . Felt like the number of pimples I accrue, during the hormonal cycles every month , have considerably been reduced .&lt;br /&gt;I am however hoping it will also heal my facial scars from acne in the past . I have only been using this for a month .&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this serum due to price and results !&lt;br /&gt;ps : I also have Asian skin and most of the Asians like myself do have acne prone skin  especially as we age from teens to our 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> this serum did nothing to my skin. it did not lighten or reduce fine line my skin at all. I used two bottles and I now come to a conclusion and quit. was deceived by the reviews.</li>
    <li> I was using another vitamin C product, much more expensive, and I felt it was doing a good job, but when I read the reviews for this I figured I give it a try, afterall, it has a much better price and if it was as good as reviewed why not try. Well I noticed the difference with this from the first day.  I tried it first at night and when I woke up I thought I might be imagining it but my skin looked great.  I have been using it now for a week and I cannot believe the difference.  It looks like lines around mouth and eyes are fading away.  Appears to be evening out the skin tone too.  I do not like to wear foundation or anything like that, so to see the difference on bare skin is impressive.  Generally I do take good care of my skin, that&#x27;s why I started with Vitamin C products, but this one is superior. Will definitely continue buying this.</li>
    <li> Well, I said good product because I have been using this for about a month. I start my routine washing my face, then I apply this serum and then an anti-wrinkle cream with spf and at night a night repair cream. I am 34 and have some wrinkles around my mouth (smile) and between my eyebrows. I bought it meanly after reading that Dr. Oz recommended topical vitamin C ton help with collagen. I have to admit that I have seen a huge improvement in the texture of the skin on my face, but, I started using a derma roller, and taking Biotin also. Ladies, start taking some Biotin first and you will see and  feel the  huge improvement on skin texture on your whole body. I definitely believe that all of that new regimen I am into, is giving me results. this product is not oily at all and love how quickly it is absorbed. Note: you must apply this serum first and then any other face cream you are using.</li>
    <li> I have used other vitamin C serums and this one appears to have no active ingredient in it. It is lacking in color, odor, and taste of vitamin C. It seems to be just plain glycerine. I used it on my face for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any benefit as I do with other products.</li>
    <li> An acquaintance told me she was having problems with the skin on her arms and she tried Vitamin C serum and Vitamin K serum and it had made a huge difference in the health and appearance of her skin so I checked on Amazon to find these two Vitamin serums and bought on the basis of reviews. I&#x27;ve tried this OZ natural Vitamin C Serum for about a week and am very happy with the results. I&#x27;m using it on my face, neck and arm and saw positive results from the beginning. My skin is definitely more clear and brighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m newly 40 and I have to say, this is my first experience with vitamin C serum and I really loved it!  I used it very often and it lasted about a month.</li>
    <li> I like this serum, it&#x27;s hydrating and moisturizing. Honestly I don&#x27;t see my skin changes dramatically but I will still keep using it just because it makes my skin feel good!</li>
    <li> The product is clear with a very very slight viscosity which allows you to spread the two drops recommended dosage to your entire face.  I have noticed that the melasma (brown spots) I&#x27;ve been trying to control is fading.  I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin C products, and this one is the best so far.  I will continue to use this product until someone can show me something better, which at this point, I think will be very difficult.</li>
    <li> i really love this stuff. As soon as I get to 1/3 bottle, I order another. My face looks brighter, softer. Very good product</li>
    <li> This product was not good for me. I did not see any changes with my skin.  My face develop a rash.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change on my skin, I think this is a normal oil, like any other on the market...</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work but I have very sensitive skin and every time I used it, my skin broke out.  I kept trying but finally gave up.  People with normal skin may have better results.</li>
    <li> Just a little background of my skin for those who would like to know before purchasing this product: I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. I have combination to oily skin and acne prone skin with scarring. Although the serum contained a few oils, it is not oily at all. Once you apply it, your skin absorbs the serum. It is very light weight. No strong perfume or scent from the serum that I find bothersome. I absolutely love it! As for the difference it made on my skin, it&#x27;s still too early to tell.</li>
    <li> The product seems great, but like these types of products one needs to use them for 6-8 weeks to see results and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Well, I use it because it is proven that using vitamin C directly on your skin helps it much better than taking Vitamin C pills. I have been using it for more than a month, and I like it. It gives a firm feeling to your skin that you definitely feel it. Though, I have not seen any miracle, any dramatic change in my skin, I believe it is doing the job: I can say it made my skin quarter a degree brighter, and to be honest that s what you can expect from a vitamin serum!</li>
    <li> I have tried this serum for approximately 30 days.  I have seen improvement in overall appearance in my skin, especially in&lt;br /&gt;The neck area.  The deep lines have improved also.  I am very pleased with this product.  I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;To anyone who would like to try to improved skin quality.</li>
    <li> I am surprised to say this works amazingly well. About two weeks in to using this product I noticed my skin looked and felt much firmer, brighter and clearer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 25 and am starting to get fine lines around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for a few months and what a noticeable difference it has made! The lines have almost disappeared! The serum doesn&#x27;t produce a strong smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. What a great product!</li>
    <li> The best vitamin c I have used, and the best part is I got mine free, if you never tried Oz Naturals you really need to try them and you will not use any other Products out there...</li>
    <li> My face seems to be broken out constantly since using this product.</li>
    <li> I had to try this serum because of all of the good reviews, and I wanted something that would work FAST for my acne scars. My skin for some reason takes a ridiculously long time to heal, I&#x27;m talking MONTHS for a scar of one breakout I didn&#x27;t even touch, when most people don&#x27;t even get scars from a simple breakout. I began using this because I love that it not only has Vitamin C, but also MSM and Hylauronic Acid among other ingredients. I noticed a difference in acne scar color (lightened), and the current breakouts I had faded without leaving a mark. It also makes my face more radiant and shrinks my pores, which is especially nice in the morning and after using a dermaroller or PMD. I would definetely recommend a Vitamin C serum for everyone, acne scars or not. It is a must for uneven skin tone and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum to help the redness and dryness on my face from sun damage.  So far I think it has been working and I see a difference.  I feel that the redness, dryness and dull appearance has definitely improved. I will be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> I was a bit sceptical when I first got this but, after consistently using this pretty much every night for a month , I see my skin evening out and my complexion looking brighter and my face looking more youthful. I am very diligent with my skin care routine &amp; since adding the vitamin c I see a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. I have very sensitive acne prone skin &amp; even thou it says safe for day and night I only use it at night since I live in Florida ,I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts or irritation on my skin while using this product and I&#x27;ve already bought a replacement to use when I run out .</li>
    <li> Just love OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum!  A few drops morning and evening leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft.  I also like that the ingredients are all natural.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews (the way I buy everything) and I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for one month today without ANY discernible difference in my skin. Though I am a woman of a certain age my skin is in pretty good condition primarily because I have been blessed, or cursed depending on your point of view, with oily skin and wanted to improve in anyway possible and maintain my &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34;---hasn&#x27;t happened----though the product hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin--I haven&#x27;t seen the wonderful results the reviews describe.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the reviews are written by the manufacturers of these products or at the very least by people hired to write them. Obviously, I won&#x27;t be reordering!!!&lt;br /&gt;I just want to give an honest assessment of the product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time 3 weeks ago and I love it, I can&#x27;t believe the difference in the fine lines and wrinkles I had on my face. They have become almost invisible, I am 68 years old and have tried more expensive products with less results.  This is the first time I have voluntarily written a review on any skin care product I have purchased.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle  of this.  This product will erase all your brown spots.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed an improvement in the tightness and radiance of my skin from using this product.  I use this product after washing my face and then follow it by applying my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Works really well and I can notice some difference in just a few weeks!  Its quite a bit cheaper than other brands you can buy in stores but does cost more than a few other well rated brands at Amazon so I might check out the other brands as well.  There is no sticky feeling when applied and no smell so it just on very well and works well with sunscreen for me as I&#x27;m out quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I love this serum , actually came here to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference and didn&#x27;t like the feel on my face.</li>
    <li> Love love this product makes my face glow and gets raid of my hyperpigmentations</li>
    <li> I tried this serum instead of the ferulic acid I used just to try something different.  I must say I am not impressed.  It does nothing for my skin, except the hyaluronic acid does moisturize.  I will go back to the product I purchased previously.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great.  I am more pleased with this serum than the others I have tried.  I will purchase again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> It is good but I don&#x27;t see great results so far.</li>
    <li> Eight-star product over the excellent product</li>
    <li> I just received my product yesterday and used it last night. Felt good on my face. Will see how it is after a couple of weeks. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am using this serum scenes 1 yr..it&#x27;s always been very thin and liquidy, but the last product I got the one with rose hips and green tea in it is very thick and feels sticky on face. Did I get the wrong one or the company has changed the product?</li>
    <li> This serum is pretty nice. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. As for the benefits of the vitamin C, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin overall, but when putting on the product itself, it goes on very lightly and dries quickly which is really nice. Then I can put other things like a SPF lotion over it without worrying about clogging pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive and acne-prone skin, and I can say that this serum did not make me breakout or make me have new acne. So that is a plus for me. The main reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t do much to the face even if you use it religiously for over a month. It&#x27;s good if you just want to put something on your face that has vitamin c, and don&#x27;t have anything else you can put on your face for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the perfect reviews. This product did nothing for me but I thought maybe I should give another try since so many people gave glowing review, it must be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;So silly me, I bought another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;After a while, it started to sink in perhaps I should have read the reviews more throughly.&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe what I read. A lot of them got this product for free in exchange of the great review. I felt being ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;I then switched to Obagi (same 20% Vitamin C serum). The difference in both products are day and night.&lt;br /&gt;So beware and do your research before investing in this products!</li>
    <li> I already love this product.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quick results.  I will reorder this product when I run out.  EXCELLENT customer service.  I received a email from the seller with detailed instructions on how to use this product and some other important information!  I was extremely impressed with this level of customer service!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> .One of the first things I noticed about this Vitamin C serum is the container.  This comes in a nice looking amber bottle, complete with dropper.  Granted, I am not used to using a dropper for my face, but this one works great.  When you examine it, it appears to be a very important, medicinal treatment.  It is an anti-aging serum, complete with plenty of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This treatment is used with a dropper,  and I think that makes this serum look very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an odor-free treatment, it drops on smooth onto the skin, takes a few minutes to work itself in, and then it is ready, meaning dry and without any stickiness.  Once it is dry, you can apply make-up or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, according to this instructions, it reads:  Apply to face, neck, and decollete...  I don&#x27;t know where my decollete is, so I skip that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nice, no odor, smooth, creamy, and hopefully, I de-age.....  Rizzo;  Received Product for Review.</li>
    <li> I love this lightweight serum.  Absorbs into my skin very nicely, not greasy, and seems to last. After a few weeks I am starting to see smoother skin, I will buy it again.  Nice addition to the products I already use.</li>
    <li> Not sure why but everytime I used it it made me break out. I had small pimples the next morning. I tried it various times and it did the same think. I did not like it.</li>
    <li> Very drying. I&#x27;ve used a lot of Vitamin Cs&lt;br /&gt;This is not one I will be reordering again.&lt;br /&gt;Has done nothing to my skin, the consistency is like water, maybe it is?!</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  It has helped reduce the sun spots on my face and hands!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t see any difference so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It is drying,but the directions say to use a moisturizer after it.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for every day use.  If I use it every day with a moisturizer I will break out..  I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference with the look of my skin other than that, but in anti aging I could not tell a difference.  Maybe I will notice a difference with the use of more than one of their products,  I am glad I got a full size sample though! :)  I do really want to sample other products with this line of skincare.</li>
    <li> I love this! I am ordering my third bottle today. It works excellent. My dark spots on my face have faded a lot. Now I do not see them at all with foundation. Before I could see them clearly with foundation. I am married to this product and will not stray. :) Highly recommend!! --- I was just coming back to purchase another bottle. WOW!!! It sure went up in price!!!!! I am not going to be repurchasing because of this fact. Very sad.</li>
    <li> My skin basically oil but this serum absorb very good after apply and I feel non oiliness&lt;br /&gt;I love it !!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Ordering it again!</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying I am an avid Amazon buyer and I have never wrote a review until now. And I wish I could have gave 0 stars. Most recently was my 4th or 5th time ordering this serum. While the serum was en route I received an email from the company explaining an added ingredient that may change the color. But assured that it was a good change, in terms of additional benefits of the serum. Well, I went to put on the serum as I do in the morning, before moisturizer, as directed, and it is a terrible, confusing, disappointing change. The serum used to go on smooth and light. I noticed it was thicker but didn&#x27;t think that was a big deal until 2 minute after I applied the serum and my face felt like there was a clay mask on it, extremely dry &amp; uncomfortable. Then, I looked in the mirror and there was a VERY noticeable thick film on my face that looked like I had a chemical peel on my face. My face legitimately looked like I had put scotch tape over it. I can&#x27;t believe that such a well-reviewed company, a company I gave my money to for a product that was by no means outstanding but wasn&#x27;t bad until now. Truthfully, I&#x27;ve looked at othe serums on Amazon and this whole &amp;#34;review for free product&amp;#34; trend has really changed the integrity and ease of ordering products like this on Amazon. I just want a simple vitamin c serum that does what it says. Oz naturals - you just lost a customer.</li>
    <li> I apply this product after using a derma roller (1.0mm microneedle) and it seems to be working.  My skin has better texture and more even skin tone.  I&#x27;m trying to diminish dark spots on my face so it&#x27;ll be a long process.  But I&#x27;m optimistic that this serum in addition to the occasional peel (lactic acid 50%) will fade any sun damage.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several months, faithfully, and have seen NO change whatsoever.  Maybe my face just doesn&#x27;t need any more Vitamin C!!! I gave it 2 stars because it didn&#x27;t do any harm! I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> There is a good reason this product is number one best seller. It really works. I use on back of my hands and results are amazing. Vitamin C Serum and retinol work together like magic. I use pure virgin  coconut oil to complete my beauty routine. Simple and I get questions about what products I use. No expensive creams just natural, pure products. I absolutely love OZ vitamin C Serum. Once you try it you will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this recently on both my hands and around the corners of my eyes. I normally don&#x27;t spend much time doing skin care, but I&#x27;m getting older and things are starting to show some wear. I didn&#x27;t expect much in terms of difference, but I was surprised. The wrinkling around the eyes has decreased, and the backs of my hands are showing less aging now. There is a definite &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; effect that causes the skin to look more full and moist. I also didn&#x27;t have any adverse skin reaction to using the serum, so there&#x27;s no drawback to me continuing its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a happy customer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. I have a sensitive skin but this product does only what it should do. I highly recommend it for those who have troubled, wrinkled skin.</li>
    <li> not what i was hoping for, a little thin and sticky after putting it on. haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if my skin is improving</li>
    <li> Really liked this product until they changed the formula. Product is difficult to apply because it is so watery it runs through your fingers before you can apply it to your face. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Omg !!! So happy my wrinkles are disappearing !</li>
    <li> not sure if its doing anything fantastic but it feels nice on the skin</li>
    <li> I bought this product twice previously and loved it, this time, not so much. Not sure if they have changed their formula or what but as it dries it sits on my skin like thin layer of glue or something! I even sent my bottle back for exchange thinking it was a bad batch but no, it looks like I&#x27;ve been swimming in the ocean and have a dried layer of salt on my skin! I am so sad as I LOVED the first two bottles I used. Double checked to make sure I ordered the same product and I did. oh well.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as a prescription, but a good product.</li>
    <li> I dont see any good result but it is not bad, i meant I dont get sensitivity...thats y iI am only rating it 4stars...but will not reorder..i found a replacement, the seriuosly firm by Acure...so firming and smooths out skin..love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  Not only is it natural, it combines two of the best ingredients to help the health of your skin.  In the month I have been using this I definitely see a big difference in the tone and feel of my skin.  I also use good quality all natural moisturizers and face washes which, believe it or not, do not have to be super expensive.  These products in combination with this Serum has left my skin softer, firmer, and healthier!  Highly recommend this product!  Especially for aging women like myself!</li>
    <li> my friend got this so I decided to try it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my skin amazing. I get tons of compliments. I will say I have great skin already and this makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I like the way this serum feels on my skin. Very easy to apply, light weight. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with my skin. But I do love the fact that it&#x27;s a easy to do in my skin care routine. Hopefully after finishing the bottle I will notice a diffence. So far I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely lovely Vit C serum - I wear it daily!</li>
    <li> My mom and I are both addicted to the Vitamin C serum. Within a few days, we were already seeing results. I love how this makes my skin feel and how it is decreasing some of the discoloration on my face and my mothers (sharing is caring). The discoloration didn’t appear overnight, and I know it won’t disappear overnight. But I do have to say that using this concentrated product is better than using drugstore products. Also I must admit, this product has started giving me the confidence to start going out without wearing cover up. It is evening out my skin beautifully. Love it—recommend it for sure! And a little bonus thing, my mom mentioned it helping her wrinkles look less defined.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a week and can already tell a difference in the tone of my skin, as well as dark spots fading. this is the first thing I&#x27;ve bought that has actually worked. so i would def recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Loved it. A little bit went a long way and it went on smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  I have been using this for a couple of months by now.  I do have to put a moisturizer after I applying the serum, otherwise it drys out my skin.</li>
    <li> Oz vitamin c serum absorbs very quickly with no greasy residue.....you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> Good  product skin looks better!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I saw a difference quickly on myself and my 78 year old mother.  I did not break out.  Have not had any for two months but I am ordering more.  Give this stuff a try.  You may see results instantly or within a short period of time.  I used Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair for six weeks and saw nothing.  The results here were great.  I realize that some of my marks may not entirely go away but they did look better than usual.  Try it for yourself.  You&#x27;ll see.  It works.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling it gives me but I&#x27;m still trying it so I cannot tell if it works.</li>
    <li> Love it - smooths the skin nicely.  Will order this again.</li>
    <li> This serum works fine as soon as I put it on it started working on my wrinkles I use it everyday now and I love it. I hope my skin gets even better.. Will definitely buy again thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mother, she loves it.She uses twice a day along with her regular moisturiser .Her skin is very dry and this serum is working wondres on her skin. A great Product.Anti Aging benefits too!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it .Thanks OZ Naturals for the product.</li>
    <li> i believe it is working... i can tell a difference in the brightness of my skin and its texture.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Very soothing.  It makes my skin feel HEALTHIER.</li>
    <li> Excellent product easy to apply. I love it . Helps plump the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  On my second bottle. Will order again</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change yet.  Using for 2 months.  Product kind of thin.</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s really works</li>
    <li> I had a scaly brown spot on my cheek that I was going to have to get removed by a doctor, after I started using this vitamin C serum  I noticed it looked smaller,  after a couple months of use the brown spot was completely gone,</li>
    <li> Its a great product, not oily, would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! This is the best and most affordable Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve purchased it over and over again. I mix it with my lotion directly in the lotion bottle and shake it all up and use it every single morning. I&#x27;m probably diluting the Vitamin C a little but it works great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Used consistently, the results are great!</li>
    <li> I am 62 and none knows it because I believe in this product has taken ten to fifteen years off my face, why pay a fortune when you can get this for less than 20 dollars a bottle, great product.</li>
    <li> I had a patient actually ask me what I have done different for myself.  she thought I looked amazing.  I gave her the web site and now she looks amazing as well!  I like how I don&#x27;t feel too heavy w/ cream.  I use it EVERY day.  Last time I ordered I actually bought 3 because I cannot tell when i am about out and i don&#x27;t want to be without.  That would be my only suggestion is leave a space in the label so I can see how much is remaining.  Thank you for asking.</li>
    <li> Was not  satisfied  with this product. I know it cannot perform miracles, but I at least thought it would help a little more with the crows feet.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel. I really feel like my make up stays on better with this under it. I also feel like my blemishes and post blemish spots heal faster with this. I cannot comment on the anti wrinkle claims as I am 27 and do not have any wrinkles, but I do notice a healthier glow. I am 3/4 of the way done with my first bottle, and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this serum......I think it would be awesome if there were refills (just the bottle minus the dropper)!!</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as all the lauded reviews. Previously I had been using the Obagi 15% Vitamin C serum. While more costly, it definitely made a more noticeable difference in the texture and overall appearance of my skin. Also, using this product, I&#x27;ve had significantly MORE breakouts (I do have acne prone skin) far more than with any other vitamin C serum. This is my first Amazon review and I felt strongly enough to write it as I feel somewhat duped by all the positive reviews that touted this product over the Obagi and other skin care product lines.&lt;br /&gt;I so wanted to give this a chance and see results. It just never happened.</li>
    <li> Great product for your face to lighten up complexion.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on smoothly. It is a bit more viscose/thin than others I have tried, but the effects seem similar. There is no odor and it dries quickly enough for moisturizers and makeup to be applied shortly after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this serum for a few days, and so far it feels great on my skin. However, I had an issue with the jar that it came in. I only had it 2 days and packed it in my make-up bag on a weekend trip. I made sure the top was closed tight, but it still came loose during travel and spilled in my bag. It was very upsetting since I just bought it. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t tighten it enough, but when I checked the top and re-tightened it, it would just loosen and begin to unscrew on its own from the pressure or something. All I could think was, \\&quot;I just spilled $6 worth of serum!!!\\&quot; They definitely need better caps that stay closed. If you&#x27;re going to take this traveling, make sure it&#x27;s in a small plastic bag, wrapped tight, secure it with some rubber bands, and try to keep it vertical if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Just wanted to upgrade my review because of the company&#x27;s great customer service. I let them know what happened, and on the same day, they refunded me for the purchase and sent me a discount code for a replacement order (and I get to keep what&#x27;s left). Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. So far no problems. Noticing some improvement in skin tone and is very moisturizing.  I think I&#x27;m using a little more than suggested and still have more than half a bottle. Worth the price and will continue using.</li>
    <li> I am giving this three stars for now and will update it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only started using the product 1 week ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I thought the product was a little too watery since there are many ingredients that should make it thicker - ie hylauronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did sink immediately into my skin.  After 3 days my skin looked a little brighter.  Do not expect this to erase wrinkles.  It is an antioxidant so make sure you add moisturizer and then sunscreen before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO SMELL which is good. A LITTLE WATERY which is questionable.  BRIGHTER SKIN after a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day since December.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and so my skin will take longer to show results.  It seems to be a good product, especially for the price.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Although the customer service is top notch, I am not impressed with the product. I&#x27;ve used the serum for 2 weeks, as directed, and see no difference at all. I was excited after reading so many promising reviews, apparently I don&#x27;t share the same enthusiasm. This is the last time I will &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34; for Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendations....he has proven to be a good marketing tool for many companies.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about this serum, I decided to give it a shot. I had recently had a reaction to a new mascara, and this left me with some wrinkles (more so than the laugh lines I already have). I&#x27;m 35 years old and decided I need to do something before my skin just gives up on me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for about a week now, and already my face is brighter, and I see a slight reduction in wrinkles. I was shocked to see results this quickly! I feel better about my skin than I have in years. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a month of using this will do for me. I have always been a low maintenance type girl who doesn&#x27;t like the feel of a cakey face (both with lotions and make-up), and this product is extremely light-weight and dries quickly. Completely worth the $28! I will continue to purchase this product from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for everything OZ Naturals!&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
    <li> This is a great product and My skin looks better for it. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to take out a small loan to pay for it!</li>
    <li> Great  serum because it works. Has the right ingrediants in it especially vitamin C At 20%.... It absorbs very quickly just remember to wait at least 5 minutes before you apply your moisterizer !!!  There is NO animal testing with OZ products therefore no animal cruelty..</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the very first time I used this product which is unheard of! I&#x27;ve tried so many much more expensive vitamin c serums and had given up because they either didn&#x27;t work, or didn&#x27;t work AND clogged my pores. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this. Beautiful results without the hefty price tag .</li>
    <li> Love the way this product has helped rejuvenate my skin! I am 47 and starting to have problems from years of sun exposure but this product is helping peel away the dry sun damaged skin and dark spots and fresh glowing skin is still there! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> This serum is really great and I will for sure buy again. I have been using high priced serums and this one is better.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped quickly and arrived well packaged.  Angela emailed me, advised me on how/when  to use it and asked if I had any questions.  She informed I should exfoliate 2-3 times per week to assist the product with absorption.  She did not push a product she sells, but rather suggested a simple &amp; cheap at home method, which was much appreciated and rare in this day and age!  She was responsive via email, knowledgeable, personable &amp; professional.  I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for about a week now and although I haven&#x27;t yet seen results, I trust they are coming.  The serum is a great value compared to most other serum prices and/or sizes.  When my bottle is low, I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for a serum to use after I dermaroll. I am in my mid twenties and suffered from severe acne. My acne has died down but I am left with horrible deep scars and redness on my face. I heard about dermarolling on youtube and wanted to give it a try. All the tutorials said to use a serum with vitamin C right after I dermaroll so I went on amazon to search for one. This had the best reviews so I gave it a go. This product arrived quickly and I love the product. I even use it when I am not dermarolling because it leaves my skin feel so soft in the morning. So far I do believe it is helping and healing my skin.</li>
    <li> It really like it, i feel my skin soft and better, of course not a 100% improvement, but for te price is ok.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in a few days and I was excited about using it.  I have not used it long, but I can tell my skin is brighter almost looks cleaner.  Also my skin is softer on my face and hands.  After I put it on my face I massage the rest on my hands like lotion.  I can tell this is a product I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> I just received the product within the last week, started using and can tell a difference after 4 days!  Will be purchasing more for my family members as gifts. Thanks for a great product Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> Smooths out my skin and makes it feel like new. I have been using the product for 2 weeks or more.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this Vit C Serum. I&#x27;ve only used it for ten days but thus far I see myself making it a permanent part of my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I used a hemp seed oil for years until someone recommended this product to me, and I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it. The hemp seed oil cured my flaky dry skin, and makes my skin healthy looking, but it is so oily that I can&#x27;t wear it out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum tightens, and gives my face a healthy look without leaving it looking oily. I was told to apply a moisturizer after the serum drys, but have yet to discover a good one. If anyone has any suggestions for a quality moisturizer I would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I have used this Vitamin C serum for about one week now- It really makes my skin feel great,&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes as yet, but I am hopeful I will in time. the customer car and correspondence with Angela from this company has been great- she is a delight to deal with and most likely as a result of her I will buy this product again! Thanks so much Kimberely</li>
    <li> I apply this product in the morning before I apply my moisturizer and sunscreen.  Within 2 weeks of use, my skin is looking great!  I have received several compliments on how radiant my skin looks.  I use just a few drops on my face, neck, and decolletage.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have known that Vitamin C is the secret weapon for repairing skin since I saw the Dr. Oz program on this topic, but I was unable to find topical Vitamin C that was affordable.  But here it is!  I received the bottle 2 days ago and I can already see and feel the difference on my face.  I am excited to see how my face looks and feels after a month.  The bottled arrived on-time and safety sealed.  I like the eye dropper, as I can drop the liquid onto my fingers and so not contaminate the serum since I do not make contact with the dropper.  I believe Vitamin C is volatile if exposed to light, so I keep it in a bathroom drawer away from light and heat.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I see any real results yet. It feels great, it&#x27;s non irritating and my skin does FEEL great afterwards. I will continue to use it and come back for an update.. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a week 1/2. I am also 23 and have little lines I am worried about, mostly using this product for the benefit of the nutrients and because of my acne. Hopefully the anti-inflammatory effect of the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid will help. Shipping was decent and the seller has been e-mailing me with info on how to use, what my thoughts were, etc etc. Overall a good experience...</li>
    <li> Only been using this for about 2 weeks but I&#x27;m seeing small lines disappear.  My overall complexion looks brighter and I noticed this morning that my pores were definitely smaller and skin is tighter and looking smooth.  I will order this again I&#x27;m sure and I was happy about the price as I don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on this sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I started to see the difference after a week.My skin feels more hydrated and the skin has become soft.The best part is I spend very less time in the morning for skin care,and that makes a huge difference to me :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this serum after reading all of the reviews on the product (which were overwhelming positive).  It did not disappoint. It&#x27;s only been two weeks, but I do see a difference in my skin tone.  It&#x27;s more even.  Less red.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that cost 3x&#x27;s as much with no results.  In short, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Amazing, read all reviews, ordered, and will use forever!!&lt;br /&gt;Lines reduced, skin feels great, better than my expensive serums!</li>
    <li> Not to hood dried my skin out way to much</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN RESULTS JUST YET</li>
    <li> Update: I&#x27;m very disappointed! I had loved this product and had given it 5 stars previously. Since then I ordered a second bottle. They changed their formula and the new version is terrible. Why would a company that has received so many positive reviews change an award winning product? The new serum does not soak right in. Instead it forms a tight, dry, plastic like layer on my face. If I try to put foundation on top of it, it rolls off. Terrible!  I wrote the company to ask if they had any old stock or would consider selling both versions. I received a quick response letting me know that they were considering updating their formula again due to feedback they have received...&amp;quot;considering&amp;quot; and not giving me a date as to when and if they would change...I&#x27;m so disappointed that I have to start my search over for a new product. Old review for the non-Pro-Astax version:It exceeded my realistic expectations. I love this stuff and will continue to use it. My skin just drinks it in, it absorbs almost instantly, a drop or two is all you need. I have very easily irritated skin. I had no stinging, no redness. The skin on my face is smoother, softer and the pores less noticeable. I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what happens over the next three. Even if this is as good as it gets, I&#x27;m very pleased and hooked! I don&#x27;t look twenty years younger...but I don&#x27;t believe any product can do that. Bottom line is that I saw a noticeable improvement and love it!</li>
    <li> love this. it&#x27;s really great for my skin and really made it look more fresher. my husband noticed a difference after 2 weeks of using it. (I didnt tell him I was using it either). such a great price for an organic, natural product.</li>
    <li> This watery formula gives me just the right boost of hydration for my overly oily skin. My skin has become noticeably brighter, and my acne scars have faded, since adding this product to my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have only been using it a few days. I&#x27;m not one who is into expensive skin care liquids. I have found that my facial skin feels good by scrubbing it with a baking soda paste, applying an inexpensive alpha hydroxy  8% moisturizer and using Retin-A a couple of time per week and regular use of sunscreen.  Anything else is rather superfluous. I do like the idea of vitamin C for the skin. I wonder if it is the equal of a good alpha hydroxy cream. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and recommends to anyone.</li>
    <li> Makes you face feel super sticky, even if applied sparingly and followed up with moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have the smoothing properties of other serums or any type of silky feel. I will use up this bottle and not buy again.</li>
    <li> i recently repurchased OZ and realized they have changed the formula AGAIN. The last time I purchased OZ Vitamin C was back in May and before that was hmm, maybe the beginning of this year or December of 2014. OZ keeps changing their formula and the bottle I received couple days ago was completely different! When I first opened the bottle and took 1 drop, the formula was super gooey and looked yellowish. I thought maybe my bottle expired and then read the formulas and realized OZ has added green tea &amp; rose oil in their formula. Kind of skeptical using this but let see how it play out in the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago when it contained ferulic acid.  Initially, the ferulic acid made my skin very red and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tolerate it.  A representative from the company recommended waiting a few months then trying the product again as they were changing their formula.  My skin quickly adjusted to the ferulic acid in the first bottle and I loved it so much I reordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed this second bottle however does not have ferulic acid listed as an ingredient so the company did indeed change the formula.  This new product is thicker, unpleasantly sticky and has a greenish-yellow cast that makes me think it has oxidized already although I just opened it.  I don&#x27;t see the same benefit to my skin as with the first product and am thinking about returning it due to the suspicious discoloration.</li>
    <li> its not oily after a month i could see a difference in my skin,my daughter says i look more radiant!</li>
    <li> This is my second review it wasn&#x27;t like before I have been use this product for a while like 2years and order over 20bottles already. I even order them then shipped  it to Thailand for my grandma and my mom because they live this product  but recently I just order 2more. I know price went up too but I don&#x27;t mind if the product is good but this time  it doesn&#x27;t feel right it doesn&#x27;t do any good to my skin anymore i feel so like my face so tight after I use it,like glue on my face . I so disappointed I thought &amp;#34; Oz Natural &amp;#34; can keep the same quality so customers keep coming back</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product!  For more wonderful products try here:  [...]</li>
    <li> I will probably continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this always drys my skin. I used it for a week and it dried my face skin, I stopped using it and now my face skin is not peeling or drying anymore. I think this was a bad side effect or something.</li>
    <li> This dried out my skin instantly on application.  There is no way this can be used on my skin.  I have to return</li>
    <li> I just tried another Vitamin C serum and honestly, this one smells great and is the best one on the market!</li>
    <li> I use it for couple of months, I did not see any changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> This serum is so amazing. The changes in my facial skin color from the sun have cleared and my skin looks a smooth tone now. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 weeks now and observe a noticeable improvement to my complexion. My skin looks fresher, almost glows!  The customer service is excellent-received an email on instructions for use and contact info for any questions.</li>
    <li> It seems that this product really works to reduce fine lines. It is also quite gentle on my skin, which I like. However, it is rather expensive. Each bottle only lasts about two months.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Looking at oneself everyday in the mirrow it is hard to see change,  but I was convinced when a friend said to me that my skin was looking much clearer with fewer wrinkles, and what was I doing?  That is the best recommendation I think, and so I have reordered it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I turned 50 last year and decided to take better care of my complexion.  I can see a difference in the last three or four weeks of using this product.  I just started Derma rolling and this has been great product to complement the treatment.  Would order again!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  It has only been a few weeks and I think I can see results.  The company also emailed me with suggestions on how to use the product and what to/what not to do.  Came fast and was not as expensive as some of the other Vit C serums out there.</li>
    <li> Its a matter of opinion and everyone&#x27;s skin is different! I have used other products that are better for my skin</li>
    <li> Hello! I love the OZ Naturals Vit C Serum.  Have been using it for almost a week, every morning  (in the evening, I use a  serum that is more intense).  After the serum,  I follow with 100% hyaluronic acid and a moisturizer with an SPF factor since we live where the sun shines every day!  I think my skin is definitely brighter, which is difficult to describe, but it just looks healthier.  Thank you so much for a great product and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.  Patti S., Albuquerque, NM.</li>
    <li> The service from your company has been great! I have only been using the product for a week so I can&#x27;t really see a huge difference yet. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky so I like that and I am hopeful based on all of the excellent reviews that I read that I will be simply GORGEOUS in no time! :-) Laura in Hollywood, FL</li>
    <li> Being born a natural skeptic, I read a lot of reviews before buying this serum. I usually don&#x27;t purchase health and beauty products online, however my wrinkles were winning the battle over my skepticism. The result of my purchase? After one week of daily use I noticed a brighter complexion and smaller pores. After two weeks, sun spots were fading, and fine lines were disappearing. I can&#x27;t wait for weeks three and four!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I normally have a slightly freckled and uneven skin tone, undereye circles and some acne scars. This product has evened out my skin tone, my very fine wrinkles are barely noticeable now and my acne scars aren&#x27;t as noticeable either. This product really works like it is supposed to. I will continue using it and I just purchased 2 more bottles of it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Didn&#x27;t see much results yet.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and safely. I&#x27;m now using it every a few days. I find it&#x27;s useful for my skin and I will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> My skin is definitely really hydrated after I use this and I have began to see more even tone all across.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just past 50 years old, a redhead with very pale skin that is allergic to everything and prone to break outs, and the skin issue I have is that it feels like there is an extra layer of skin, growing on top of the skin, on my face. My skin felt thick and dull, and exfoliating scrubs and washes were not doing the trick. I&#x27;m not a believer in miracle face creams that remove wrinkles and make you look half your age, but I wanted something to make my skin look and feel better, the best I could be. The vitamin C Serum works great. I use it in the morning after showering and follow up with a Neutrogena moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I having been using this product for at least 2 weeks. The serum is very light not oily or sticky makes my skin feel very smooth. i will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C and Hyralonic Acid?  Combo beats nothing.  Again Glow glow glow and moisturize  No oily feel at all.</li>
    <li> This has started to clear my hyperpigmentation in a month. This is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the  20% vitamin C with amino acid- Anti-aging serum. What I got was the vitamin c ( doesn&#x27;t tell you the %) - Moisturizing serum.  Wrong product- and it doesn&#x27;t show any beneficial results.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use this twice a day (before bed and in the morning) after I wash my face. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and I feel like my skin looks healthier and younger. I also don&#x27;t feel the need to wear make-up every day because I feel comfortable with my face as is!</li>
    <li> I see no real significant change. Just beginning to work. wrinkles are diminishing a bit.  I&#x27;ll write more in a month.</li>
    <li> The product came excellently wrapped and it was delivered fast.  I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet but i&#x27;m hoping for good results!! I will update&lt;br /&gt;once i use it.</li>
    <li> I have noticed some improvement in skin texture and tone.  I have recommended this product to friends and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I like this serum a lot. I&#x27;ve only been using a few weeks and I can&lt;br /&gt;already tell a difference. My skin appears to be brighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use after this bottle. Great stuff..I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend.</li>
    <li> So far, so good with this serum.  I&#x27;ve used many Vitamin C skin regimes, and I like this one a lot.  The serum is light and absorbs well and while nothing is a miracle (don&#x27;t believe people who tell you anything is...) this is a nice, natural skin regime.  I also felt the company was incredibly attentive in sending me a personal email detailing usage recommendations, which were quite helpful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C serum for about 2 weeks now and love how it makes my face feel in the mornings.</li>
    <li> best anti again serum, high quality organic ingredients. Show great result in a week!.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for two weeks now and my skin is smooth, wrinkle reduced and radiant.</li>
    <li> Definitely seeing a brightening and evenness to my complexion after just a few weeks of nightly use. I follow with my usual nighttime moisturizer and wake up with smooth and healthy looking skin</li>
    <li> When reading face product reviews, I always like to know the age range of the reviewer. It helps me get a understanding if it pertains to me or not. So with that being said I am 55. I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group. Sorry to say ladies, no noticeable difference what so ever...</li>
    <li> I have just started using this vitamin serum and I think its working very good. My skin feels firmer and healthier. I would recommend this product to everyone!!!!</li>
    <li> I was contacted by OZ Naturals and asked to try this product. I have had the product for a little over 2 months now. I have been using it that long to be sure that I am both giving it a fair chance and a fair review. The texture of this product is nice out of the bottle. It is thin and runny. There isn&#x27;t a strong smell. Once applied, I find the texture to be sticky on my skin. It is a little more tacky then I like for my face to feel. I have used it both in the morning and at night. I honestly have not noticed much of a change in my skin. I did not break out from this product which is a plus. My overall opinion about this is that it is ok, but I would not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> I use it exactly as the email said and in one week I could see major improvement.  Thanks for the email and thanks even more for a great product.  I had crepey eyelids and this has really helped smooth them.  I am a believer.</li>
    <li> This serum is great. I bought one for my mom also. She loves it too!</li>
    <li> I have been using for less than a week. People are already asking me what I&#x27;m doing differently. Very Exciting!!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in record time. I love this serum, it has vitamin C+E and it contains Hyaluronic Acid. It&#x27;s a product worth trying.</li>
    <li> Very Fast service, great product! Seems to be making my skin look more radiant and more youthful!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend</li>
    <li> After reading a number of different articles with regard to the use of vitamin c serum I decided to give it a try.  Oz naturals appeared to have the better product for a reasonable price.  The product arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the results over the past week.</li>
    <li> Third week into using this, I can surely feel that the surface of skin has smoothed a lot. I also feel like it makes my skin glow. Also, I believe it&#x27;s most effective when used after a dermarolling session. This is a product that I will recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> The Vitaminc C Serum is light, absorbs well and fast.  It seems to have a slighten tightening effect on the skin upon drying which goes away after a moisturizer application.  I have been using it for only a week so don&#x27;t have any other input at this time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the dermaroller, and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  It&#x27;s well priced, excellent quality and seems to be having a very good effect on my skin.</li>
    <li> I do like it very much. Using before sleep even without a night cream. In a morning skin soft and my face look rested. Can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen to my fine lines in a month or so.</li>
    <li> actually it caused dryness for that it is highly recommended to use strong moisturizer .. its really effective and gives good results by daily using..</li>
    <li> I liked it and ordered 2 more bottles. But surprisingly one came unsealed and half of the oil was gone. It was packed in bubble plastic but all bubbles were flat. Seems like someone uses it and filled it with fake serum. It was clearly unsealed. Very disappointed with the package. Makes me wana think twice before ordering anymore.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a try and I was very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s amazing that I felt the product tighten my face and if I had some cosmetic surgery done. I like the fact that the ingredients are natural and packs with vitamins. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have only just begun using the serum this week. So far I have noticed a subtle rosy glow which I love. I appreciate the company&#x27;s customer service. They checked in to make sure I was satisfied and answered some questions I had promptly. Their follow up is excellent. I plan to post an updated review after I&#x27;ve used it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected.  Not much information included when order arrived.  Hoped to notice some difference but so far (and I used it twice daily before moisturizer) not much .  I keep hoping ;o)</li>
    <li> Have used other (more expensive) Vitamin C products in the past.  So far, I have been pleased with the product and plan to reorder.  Customer service provided for this product was great.  I actually received a follow up email to ensure I had proper directions for usage.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!</li>
    <li> Like that it is clear without smell. But after using it for a month, have seen maybe slight results under my eyes which have started to show I&#x27;m 50 yrs old. Much prefer Devita RX, C-Pro Plus, Morning, 1 oz (30 ml). I only bought this since I broke my Devita serum and couldn&#x27;t remember what brand it was until I found it in my records recently. I purchased it at iherb.com.</li>
    <li> Angela,  Would love to help you, however I have not used the serum long enough to make a fair assessment.  The product arrived safely and in a timely manner.  As soon as I see twenty-five years disappear from my face, I will be back in touch.  M. Nunziata</li>
    <li> Noticed about mid way in first bottle of Oz C Serum that lines in my forehead and mouth were less visible&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer and glows more.  Very pleased with the results.  I put it on in morning and let it dry then apply a moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> Gave the product only 3 stars.  Have been using it for 4 weeks and can see no difference in appearance or feel.  The product itself feels nice and applies smoothly.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but with the amount of Vit C this serum is purported to have, I thought I might notice even a little difference in fine lines.</li>
    <li> Excellent results!  This product minimized my pore size evened out my skin pigment and my overall skin appearance appears more hydrated and vibrant.  It also reduced my fine lines!  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best forms of vitamin C serum that I have used over the last several years.  In my opinion it performs as well&lt;br /&gt;as the Skinceuticals  brand and is much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well, skin looks brighter, a bit less wrinkling - only drawback is that it&#x27;s a bit watery, but easy to put on</li>
    <li> My review is based on the daily use of the serum for one month.The product is scent-free and the texture is not oily. I have very sensitive skin and am careful which products I use on it. It is quite hard to find products that do not smell like perfume, flowers or medicinal. It is a factor I personally consider to be important, because certain smells are migraine triggers.&lt;br /&gt;I also detest oily products, so I was relieved that this serum seeps into the skin without leaving an oily residue on the skin or my fingers.The company uses natural, organic ingredients, the products are not tested on animals and they offer a money back guarantee. The bottle has a pipette attached to the cap, which then can be used to drop the serum onto the hands/fingers to rub into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed an improvement on old facial scars and age marks. It also seems to smooth out the neck region, which can be the first place to get all wrinkly and dry, well for us gals that is.&lt;br /&gt;My 23yr daughter has been using it simultaneously and has noticed a remarkable improvement of her skin. It is smoother, looks fresher and has been applying under her moisturiser and layer of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a moisturiser and should be applied before using a moisturiser and then applying make-up. You should allow the serum to absorb into the skin before putting anything else on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised by the results after just one month and will be interested to see the long term outcome of using this product, which my daughter is also enthusiastic about.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product courtesy of OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> The very day that it arrived, I used it.  My friends came over and I had them feel my face.  The first day of using this my face was as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I followed it with my moisturizer.  A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> It has done wonders to my skin :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week, along with some new skin care products, and I can tell that this has made a difference. Not only does my face look much brighter, but a lot of the redness and acne has cleared as well. I know that using retinol along with this also helped. I will definitely buy this again, and have been recommending it to friends!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fabulous ! I had a white spot on my forehead from the sun and in a week if using this product twice a day, the spot is way less noticeable ! Love it !</li>
    <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this serum long enough to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference, I can say that it arrived quickly and there is nothing about it that I don&#x27;t like.  It seems to absorb into the skin well and does not have a noticeable smell which I prefer.  We&#x27;ll see if there is a visible improvement by the time I use the entire bottle.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, I have noticed that the texture of my face has gotten smoother. Also My face has lightened a bit! I have only been using this serum for about 3&#x27;weeks now and I love it. It feels light on the face, it also is not sticky feeling at all which is awesome. Just over all an awesome skincare must have.</li>
    <li> I noticed results within a few days, my fine lines are gone, and my face feels tighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> I love it, I use it with OZ Natural Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
    <li> Skin is looking clearer after using it for about 1 week.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It seriously is. You see results instantly. I had people asking what I did because my face looked really soft and youthful after only a week of using it. I&#x27;m 28 and use this on a regular basis. Just a little goes a long way. I use just a little bit around my eyes where crows feet are wanting to develop and on my forehead. I LOVE this stuff it is a must. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasant smell (glycerin and slightly floral) and absorbs easily, but it&#x27;s nowhere as effective as the 20% Obagi serum I used previously. I bought this serum because it&#x27;s significantly cheaper than Obagi but I&#x27;m going back to the original. Two stars for not making my skin worse.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I feel like my complexion is better.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 9/18/15: the reformulation of this product is garbage. It is thick and oily like pure glycerin and causes acne. It goes on thick and semi-dries leaving your face feeling dirty and oily. It also smells bad. Old bottle on left in photo, new on right. Such a shame they changed the formula&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I went home for Christmas and several relatives remarked I looked so healthy with bright vibrant skin. I have been having problems with bad caustic acne caused by bowel disease that left dark marks and irritated skin all over my face. This quickly repairs acne damage and leaves the skin an even tone, healthy and bright. Be sure to moisturize after applying though since it can dry out the skin or irritate it without the added moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin C serum. Absorbs quickly and is moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a month and haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference. The price was right so I thought I would give it a try. I use it morning and night - no real results... just meh.</li>
    <li> After using for about 7 days (skipped a couple) with the retinol moisturizer ....I really can see a difference in my skin tone.  I am 42 and a smoker with sun damage.  I hope to see more results with further use.  Oh, I am also using Clarisonic Mia 2 prior to application and it seems to help with absorption.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for a year now and I like how smooth it makes my skin.  It hasn&#x27;t really help with stopping any acne breakouts or scars, but I feel as though my skin is much smoother and my pores are smaller.  I plan on continuing to use it as it is reasonably priced!  Each 1 oz bottle lasts me about 6 months.  I use it twice a day and use 3-4 drops each time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent customer delivery service!</li>
    <li> works very good for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been decreasing the dark spots on my face due to meds, sun, and my age.</li>
    <li> I can truly see the difference in my face!  I would and do highly recommend this product. My face feels so soft and feels &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t put it on.  This is one product that even if it&#x27;s a no makeup day this goes on!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed any changes in my complexion or health of my skin.  However, I will continue to use it and hopefully will see some visible results.</li>
    <li> Received the package containing my Dr. Oz Vitamin C serum today. The box was neatly closed and undamaged,  however, after opening the box I noticed the plastic security wrapping seemed cut where the dropper screws onto the bottle. It seems to me that the bottle itself was tampered with and neatly placed back into the box. I don&#x27;t feel safe applying this serum onto my skin. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum - lightweight and odorless. I use it in conjunction with Retin A and Yonka Vital Defense. Honestly, where I&#x27;ve noticed the biggest difference has been on my hands. I&#x27;m happy with my face (at 51), but I was starting to get &amp;#34;granny hands&amp;#34; and started using the serum twice a day. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of weeks now and I can see a big difference! Give this product a try - I thought the price was reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I admit, I tried many regiments before and was skeptical that anything could produce such results as they claimed.  I purchased this product about 3 wks ago and have been using it daily.  I bought the vitamin C serum, eye cream, retinol moisturizer, and spray toner.  I have been using all 4 of these products as part of my morning and nighttime cleansing ritual. In just this short time, I have gotten noticeable results.  I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  I had horrible blackheads on my nose and forehead which have drastically shrunk in size and my face looks great!  The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out and I am happier than I thought I would be.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 3 wks.  I have tried others and noticed they caused stinging or burning - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  What impressed me the most was the follow up email I received from the selling company OZ!  they emailed me with directions for use, what to expect, and gave me their contact information.  I mean, what company does that these days?  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C serum. I used to order directly  from a dermatologist before. I have to say this is almost exactly the same. Probably, just a little slower in effect but would be a great substitute. The one from the dermatologist was pure and has a thicker consistency, this one is a little diluted. Nevertheless, I would definitely buy again coz effects are fairly the same :-)</li>
    <li> I have mostly managed to avoid wrinkles at 52 years old and while I try not to get overly nervous about it, I would like to keep it that way.  I have some small wrinkles near my eyes but they are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product, for me, has been more about maintaining the health of my skin rather than taking aging effects away.  My complexion is slightly dark and I have always had very clear skin.  One thing that I have noticed though, is that my skin feels dryer at almost no provocation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this serum does for me, used in conjunction with other OZ products, is to make my skin feel healthy.  I like having a smooth, clear face.  I also like that the price of these are a portion of what similar products made by Clinique cost.  I am done with Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I keep using this because I hear from everyone that I should be using a vitamin C serum, but honestly from looking at my skin I have no way of knowing whether it is doing anything at all.</li>
    <li> It rivals any of the Vitamin C Serums on the market at a highly cost effective&lt;br /&gt;price point.  Oz Naturals gives the market a top of the line product.</li>
    <li> Great for me !!!!! it&#x27;s really working!!!!! good price good serum!!! much better than cost over $90 things !!! recommend</li>
    <li> The best Serum ever and the price is even better! Thank you.</li>
    <li> only used it two days and already some improvement</li>
    <li> I know its working on my face, it works I feel the difference.</li>
    <li> This made me break out at first but I stuck with it and now it&#x27;s great and my skin feels better.  I generally have dry skin though and am ordering the OZ Naturals Retinol Cream to try since I had such good luck with this. I really feel like my pores are less congested and I attributed that to the exfoliating factor since I haven&#x27;t changed anything else :-)</li>
    <li> Effective in cearing pimples</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results at all.  Makes my skin dry and forehead red and irradiated. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I just use it around my eyes and it seems to work great with the life extension skin restoring phytoceramides.</li>
    <li> finally something really works!! Super!</li>
    <li> This serum has helped to even out my skin tone...lots of sun damage. Has faded one particularly large sun spot. Overall texture of my skins is smoother; less redness, just nicer overall. Speeds healing. Easy to use under makeup...sinks in, leaves no perceptible feel on the surface of your skin. I will continue to use this, and can recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Absorbs right into skin immediately. Don&#x27;t feel heavy.  I Haven&#x27;t notice a big change in skin but will keep using to see results.&lt;br /&gt;Others have complimented my skin so it&#x27;s helping.</li>
    <li> Well, used 3 bottles during the course of months. But this did not do anything at all, and it&#x27;s actually drying rather than moisturizing. I suspect it doesn&#x27;t take good on everyone&#x27;s individual skin based on the reviews. Caution buying this as some magic potion, it may not do any more than sugar water for you! Cannot recommend this based on price and the reviews did not hold up. Bad batch? Is this probably easily damaged in heat during shipping? No idea, but didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this post about this product to be interesting but I haven&#x27;t investigated the authenticity of the claims yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R9EULQRDU72AE/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B00DPE9EQO&amp;cdForum&#x3D;Fx34KL5WC7DA3TX&amp;cdMsgID&#x3D;MxXK2S2V6QG17Z&amp;cdMsgNo&#x3D;1&amp;cdPage&#x3D;1&amp;cdSort&#x3D;oldest&amp;cdThread&#x3D;TxM42KU375YMRO&amp;store&#x3D;beauty#MxXK2S2V6QG17Z</li>
    <li> It made my skin dry. If you have sensitive skin better to use once a week</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that makes it easy to apply Vitamin C directly to your face.  It is very smooth and actually gives&lt;br /&gt;you a nice glow.  At my last facial, I was asked what I used on my face since my skin&#x27;s clarity was much improved and my brown&lt;br /&gt;spots had lightened.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I wore it over night and my face felt tighter and firmer in the morning. I have really oily skin and when I woke up in the morning it was super dry so I couldn&#x27;t wait to put on my moisturizer. That&#x27;s the only down side</li>
    <li> unfortinatily its waste of money &amp; time&lt;br /&gt;i tried it for more than 3 weeks no changes at allll at alllll at allllll</li>
    <li> Completely stopped the cystic acne I was constantly getting on the sides of my chin. Didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits, but was wonderful for acne.</li>
    <li> I put the serum on before bed and woke to a fresh face. I&#x27;ve only had the product for a couple day but love it already!</li>
    <li> This is part of my morning routine. It feeds my skin and the vitamin C is a natural sun protector.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that Amazon would support the sale of useless things. I bought this product and received an email from the seller explaining how to use and and what to expect. That gave me confidence in the product and was exited to try it. It has done nothing but waste my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;After a period of use without results I tasted it and found it does not even taste acrid as an acid, (vitamin c) would taste.</li>
    <li> After looking at the reviews, I decided to try this product.  First let me mention, several other reviews, complained about the dropper versus a pump top, I prefer the dropper, it allows you much more control over the amount you are using.  As a senior female, I have problems everywhere, lol.  My hands and arms look twice as old as the rest of me, so I started using this product on my hands, and arms. WOW most of the brown spots have just gone away! My hands look like they belong to a living person now.  I started using it on my face, and can honestly say I can see improvement there also.  My forehead saw results first, then the crowfeet around my eyes are better, the deep lines, I guess they are going to take the longest to show improvement, but after seeing the way my hands improved, well I know this product works, no miracle but it was nice to see a real improvement.  Will post later after I have been using this longer.  Have only tried one other product, but it left a film on skin, did not like that, so I have little experience with other products, but I do like this one, not sure if I would be willing to try something else.  Hope everyone also has good experiences with this product.</li>
    <li> I am loving everything about this Vitamin C Serum.From scent of the oil in the pretty bottle, to the ease of use of the dropper, to how my skin feels after using, I have zero complaints. I am such a BIG fan of Vitamin C in general and Oz Naturals makes a lovely, natural product with feel good ingredients, that make my almost 40 skin bright and clear. I love it. Great shipping, easy to use and add to your routine.A light scent and feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my skin. I do like how it feels on my skin though. Very light.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference in diminishing of my dark spots on my face. I have been using this for one month, maybe it needs to be used for 3 months...so far, no difference at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for like a week and I&#x27;ve seen good changes in my skin, it&#x27;s more even and has a certain glow when I&#x27;m using this product. Change was not really dramatic but like i said i just used this product for a week (morning and night). I have acne prone skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I will surely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Need to use following a derma roller treatment - leaves skin smooth and dewy. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I use 2 of the serums and are very pleased. Great price and I feel my skin looks and feels more youthful.</li>
    <li> I also use the Oz naturals, i alternate with the One life vest, love them  both.</li>
    <li> It is what it says, the best Vitamin C &amp; A &amp; other ingredients, quick results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past two weeks.  I have not seen a &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; difference, but age spots seem somewhat faded and my skin looks softer and brighter.</li>
    <li> This works as promised.  My face is smoother and clearer.  Dark spots are gone. Definite improvement in appearance.</li>
    <li> Love this product but one of the serums leaked out.  Tried to return it but I could not get the system to return just one.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser Contains Powerful Vitamin C, OZ Naturals Facial Mask, OZ Naturals -  Retinol Moisturizer Contains 2.5% Retinol Cream, Vegan Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + VITAMIN B5 and OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C + Amino + Hyaluronic Acid Serum, four items total.  I&#x27;m 48, light brown skin black American.  I want anti aging and skin brightening products.  Now, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve already have gotten some hot days here in DC which my skin tends to oil up compared to winter months, but I got a pimple above my right eye brow, then two small pimples on the left side  of my of the jaw, which I do use a rotary razor.  Then another one where I shave left side side face.  I&#x27;m light brown skin and don&#x27;t&#x27; have severe acne, but they may pop up here and there. Today, I have another small pimple right side shaving area. But before OZ, I used another brand which uses all natural 100%, men anti aging; don&#x27;t know if I should name it, RSVP. But I thought I would try OZ.  RSVP products were used during winter when my skin is dry, not oily and no problems.  I have some pigmentation spots due to chicken pocks when I was 19, so they didn&#x27;t totally go away. But my face looked pretty good.  So, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll return OZ or stick it out. On my second week at least with the products.  I don&#x27;t think my face can take a lot of lotions and creams, maybe with the warm days, oily skin and such, my pores getting clogged. I do a mud facial mask and use apricot face scrub too; store brands.  *** UPDATE 6/12/15 *** I&#x27;m still getting pimples and now too late to return.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this [product so I have not used it enough yet for me to comment</li>
    <li> Does nothing don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> All these things that are supposed to help our skin.  It&#x27;s hard to tell if there are changes or not.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now though and it was recommended by Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> Havent noticed a real difference in my skin. I will continue to use it though.</li>
    <li> Great product - my skin looks so good.</li>
    <li> I received my Vitamin C Serum in perfect condition and on time! I apologize for rating \\&quot;3 stars\\&quot;. I can not leave much detail on the product because I literally just started using the product 2 days ago. When I see results I will be sure to leave feedback. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thank You</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for two weeks and absolutely love it.  I&#x27;ve used several premium skincare lines and wish I had found this sooner!  The customer service was great and I will order again.</li>
    <li> Make my skin smoother</li>
    <li> I have very little faith in beauty products, but this one worked for me. We are all different, for some reviewers, it did nothing at all, for me, I could see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Did I look younger and more radiant? No. But I was surprised to look in the mirror and see an old woman who takes good care of herself.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.  It works well.  Sleeping 8hrs.  it helps more.</li>
    <li> This was a very nice serum. I do not have a lot of issues with my skin, such as dark spots or wrinkles, but I can say that this serum has definetly made my skin softer and more smooth.</li>
    <li> This is  super hero to help aging skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Feels great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Package in good shape and arrived within due dates.  Just started using the product.  It is slightly oily so a little goes a long ways.  Too soon to see results, but not expecting product to have instant or dramatic changes.  using it after a needle roller on face to help with acne scaring, and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My skin looks much better . I have been using this for 2 weeks now and i have notice improvement on my skin. More smooth and glow. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks but I love it so far.  The serum is lightweight and not sticky at all.  It has a very smooth texture that my skin absorbs quickly.  My skin is left feeling moisturized and smooth even before I put on a moisturizer.  Just FYI, I am almost 40 and have skin that is a bit of a nightmare.  Adult onset acne due to food allergies, so I have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation.  My skin is prone to oily but is also crazy dry and flakey - bad combination.  This serum moisturizes without causing breakouts and I have VERY sensitive skin.  My skin looks smoother and feels younger so far.  I&#x27;ll be checking out more of OZ Naturals products soon.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have now been using this product for a month and my skin is visibly brighter and smoother.  My skin is no longer dry and flakey and it feels more moist and \\&quot;springy\\&quot; (youthful) to the touch.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my fine lines are looking less obvious as well.  I just ordered another bottle!  I have slightly less than half a bottle left, but I&#x27;ve been going with the \\&quot;more is more\\&quot; theory ;) and slathering it onto my face and neck.</li>
    <li> The Serum feels great on your skin.  I was worried that it would be oily, it&#x27;s not.  It goes on smooth and right into the skin.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week and I see already a difference in my skin coloring and texture.  I also liked that they send an email to you before your product arrives and give more details on how to use it.  Nice touch.</li>
    <li> I used a different brand of serum prior to this and I think it may have been keeping my skin a little &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; or orange, but this product does not do that. I also really like the consistency as it has a tendency not to drip all over the place as easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a month now and watched my dark spots fade away gradually.  Overall, it enhanced my skin look and texture.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and in good condition. I&#x27;ve just started using it and already my skin feels softer and nicer, so I hope it will continue in the same way in the future.</li>
    <li> i havent used it for very long but my face feels good so far, check back with me in a month</li>
    <li> This product is good for my skin but it didn&#x27;t arrive in the original box.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away my skin feels smooth and soft after just the first day.  I got it for some cleavage fine lines and for laugh lines around my mouth.  I am going to use in conjunction with my retin- A I am very hopeful about the results.  I will come back and post in a month or so.  By the way does anyone recommend a good moisturizer that I can put on after the serum</li>
    <li> I love this serum! Only been using for 2 weeks and my skin has changed dramatically. And the price is wonderful...I have paid so much more for serums in the past. Coupled with a good moisturizer it makes all the difference. I am 61 and have already seen diminishing lines on my face.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used.  I am allergic to quite a bit of lotions, etc., but not this one. Feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum for a few weeks now &amp; have noticed that my face feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; and my skin tone is much more even looking.  I am sure it will do even more after using it for a month or so. I would definitely recommend this serum!!</li>
    <li> Ok, not sure if it works, no scent, I wonder about this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the second bottle for me. I love to read reviews on products &amp; I reviewed a LOT when looking for a vitamin C serum.  This serum has a nice consistency &amp; dries very quickly on my skin-never feels sticky. I use mine every day.  When I ordered this time, I had a rep from the company email me giving me complete &amp; detailed instructions on how to use it!!  Wow-never have had that with another product. This serum is a good price to...I&#x27;m hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I have seen great improvements in the look and texture of my skin.  The key is to let it dry well before applying moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have numerous freckles so I decided it would not hurt to try the Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum. I have only been using this for around a week now, and I am already seeing results. My freckles have began to fade and even some of the broken capillaries I have around my nose have decreased in color. The great thing is I know if I am already seeing results this soon that I will continue to see more over the next few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price, you honestly cannot beat the quality of product, and I love that it is perfect for all skin types!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;product received for review purposes&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I saw a difference in my skin after about a week.  Generally brightened my face &amp; neck. Less discoloration.  I haven&#x27;t niticed any further changes since then, so I guess I&#x27;m perfect now :).  I am stil using it, maybe just to keep the bright, not sure what would happen if I stopped...but no plans on stopping.  I use a dime size amount in the morning and another at night before retin-a. I use an expholiating brush on my face and neck also which I think helps everything to absorb.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product line. Made a visible difference in tone, evening out my redness in some areas and dryness in others. Monthly breakouts are no longer a problem. It&#x27;s gentle but wonderful. I loved it so much I bought the Seam Minerals wash and Super Youth moisturizer which together made the most visible difference.</li>
    <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great. They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way. To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning. My forehead is completely smooth! Great products! I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients. They now only need to make a face scrub and sunscreen and then I am set :) Purchased the Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C 20% serum, Facial Toner, Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this serum multiple times. The serum is more on the liquid side than other vitamin c serums. It is almost clear (tinge of color) and lasts months. After toning my face in the morning, I drop 4 droplets on my palms and pat it onto my face and neck. The serum is a little sticky, so put it on before the moisturizer. I think the serum helps keep my complexion looking nice and bright. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. It is like 3x cheaper than other vitamin c serums on the market.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on my skin, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any change.</li>
    <li> Since using this serum my skin has a clarity that it has never had.  My skin was not problematic but I felt it could use some improvement.  I am so glad that I tried this vitamin c serum.  My skin is soft and smooth; make up goes on more easily and I am using less.  Even the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes are less visible!&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried many products and been disappointed in their poor results.  This vitamin C serum is the BEST I have ever used!  I will continue to use it as part of my daily skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a year and I absolutely love the way it make my skin look and feel.  Love the product, love the fast and thorough service the company provides.  They even send you a follow up email with detailed instructions for use.</li>
    <li> Good.I&#x27;d used two bottles already.And will order it soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I use it twice a day and my skin looks awesome.  I had eyelid surgery in August which left me with some discoloration at the outside corners of my eyes.  The spots have almost disappeared and my skin tone is nice and even.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum has given me excellent results so far. I use it after cleansing and before moisturizing, and have tested it for a month. I feel it has given me brighter skin with fewer fine lines. However, I feel that if I don&#x27;t use the serum, the results do not last, so it&#x27;s a product that you need to schedule into your daily regimen to continue to enjoy the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a one-year-old, it feels good that I can do this small thing for myself to look and feel a little brighter and less tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for testing and review.</li>
    <li> I saw an improvement in the quality of my skin with one use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this serum.  I use it only at night. It seems to be helping with overall clarity and tone of my skin.</li>
    <li> this serum is really good. I use it every night and sometimes in the morning. I also rub some into my finger nails. I have bought face cream with vitamin C  from the dermatologist. I like this just as much if not more, I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, not greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i love it. after just two weeks of use you will feel and see the difference, skin is smooth and firm. two thumbs up for this.</li>
    <li> Love it, LOVE IT!!!  My face is firmer and more radiant</li>
    <li> amazing! skin looks clear and smooth immediately, after just one use...</li>
    <li> This serum makes my skin feel wonderful.  It takes just a drop or two to cover the entire face.  The serum helps the OZ moisturizer really penetrate my skin and it looks more fresh and bright. The packaging is wonderful and the customer service is outstanding. The OZ company sends me helpful information on how to best utilitze their products.  Very refreshing change from most companies.&lt;br /&gt;  I went looking for a new line of products when I purchased my last product of Olay, when inside the Olay package was a coupon that expired 3 years before I even purchased the product.  Upon contacting Olay, I was told their products have a long shelf life and this particular one had no expiration date.  So I can&#x27;t help but wonder how un-natural their product is.  Also, they never offered a replacement coupon.  Thanks, but no thanks.&lt;br /&gt;I love how orgainic the OZ products are....I will be sticking with this line for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum and use it with Oz Naturals&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C. After a month, my skin is brighter, firmer, plumper and overall healthier. It&#x27;s a bottle full of magic!</li>
    <li> Great product with limited ingredients. I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.. i have tired other brands  ut Oz aways amazes me.I just love the dewy look</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from dry skin and hyper pigmentation for over 10 years, and have been told by various dermatologists to accept my condition.  I desperately tried many brand name products and spent lots of money.  Due to my extremely sensitive skin, I often times developed acne and wasted these products.  It was a stressful journey until I found OZ Vitamin C serum.  I am not an advertiser, and I barely comment on products.  But I have to give OZ vitamin c an all star since my struggles were put to an end.  My skin is much brighter, even toned, pigmentation is less noticeable.  I have received many compliments about my skin recently.  Most importantly, I have less ance attacks than before.  Even if acne ever happens, it goes away in a day or two.  I can&#x27;t believe it, this is like a dream coming true only after 2.5 months using the product. I am very lucky to find OZ.</li>
    <li> Heard about this from a friend so I purchased a bottle. Great choice</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. Highly recommend using a derma roller for optimum absorption. My skin looks and feels amazing. Excellent for those with hyperpigmentation issues.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Update:  Still love this product! Fine lines-less, skin clear-lightened-softer. Will continue use... very happy!        Purchased this item and then was quite impressed when within 24 hours of my order- I received an email from the Vendor with directions on how to apply. I then sent an email as I had a question as to whether the product had to be refrigerated upon opening to which they answered quickly with a detailed explanation as to -NO it does not need to be refrigerated and why.   Followed the directions to use the serum, let dry and then apply Retinol cream at night-(two nights now). Noticed this morning the fine lines around my eyes are very hard to notice...excited-watching and waiting for more results.  I do drink plenty of filtered water and believe proper nutrition and hydration play a major role.  Will update again....</li>
    <li> I like how it applied and dried, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I am relatively young (26), so maybe the benefits would have been more marked if I were dealing with a lot of wrinkles or hyperpigmentation. Anyway, it didn&#x27;t interfere with my moisturizer or makeup and dried quickly, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing simply because I didn&#x27;t see a benefit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working yet too early</li>
    <li> Ladies stop wasting your money this smooth out wrinkles you had and keep ones from developing.  Your skin is so soft it is unbelievable.  Buy this and find out yourselves it is ammazing.</li>
    <li> I finished my first bottle of this and I really like it, just ordered another one. I apply this in the morning, let it dry and then apply my moisturizer over it. At night I use ROC and I do a chemical peel once a month. My skin is looking great. I think I have found a good combo for my skin.</li>
    <li> This item is not like the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serum that I was used to using, I would like to return it for a refund, but not sure Amazon will do that&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This serum leaves your face feeling super soft a few seconds after you apply it on your face. It also dries up quickly and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  It makes your skin feel so soft.  I have definitely noticed a texture difference in my skin!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for two weeks now, under the Oz eye gel which I&#x27;ve used as a complete facial moisturiser, and its been very good. I have very dry, sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It comes in an eye dropper dispenser so no germ laden fingers contaminating a pot, and no waste spilling a thickish liquid from a bottle...its very light, almost like single cream consistnecy, and it quickly absorbed into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have any fragrance, which I like, so there&#x27;s no worries about clashing perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels very soft, and there&#x27;s no signs of redness which often happens to me. I like the way it quickly sunk in to my skin, I hate feeling like I have a layer of something in my face - it feels like I can&#x27;t breathe so this was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my diet and skin treatments fairly natural if possible, and this company specialises in that. This particular product is 98% natural and 72% organic.&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with product for review, and have been using it daily and would be happy to continue with it.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the (very dry) skin...this is a great base for my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Hard to know if this is actually working.  My cheeks are rosy when I use it, so maybe that&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s actually doing something?</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and they sent a follow-up email with directions for use.  I am excited to see how it improves the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I know this isn&#x27;t the review box for the Derma roller so I won&#x27;t get into it however I bought both products and began rolling and simultaneously using this serum.  I did started to notice a slight difference but it just wasn&#x27;t worth the pain, swelling and redness I got every time I &amp;#34;rolled&amp;#34; so I tossed the Derma roller and just started using this. The results where amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this works! I Can&#x27;t live without this stuff, my nasal labial folds are slowly disappearing. In the mornings I wash , exfoliate and then add a  drop to each side of my cheeks , let it dry and then moisturize (I do exactly the same for my nightly routine) after about 5-6 weeks my skin has never felt or looked better! I am now purchasing a bottle for my mother and grandmother who are both a little self- conscious about lines and little wrinkles &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5 stars. But it makes my skin feel good</li>
    <li> This product is quite expensive and after one bottle it was too early to tell if it was doing any good.  Topical Vitamin C is all the rage, though, so I will use it, only this time I&#x27;ll make my own with ascorbic powder, distilled water and glycerin.  Distilled water and glycerin are easy to find in local drugstores.  The ascorbic acid powder is available on Amazon and recipes for the varying concentrations are easy to find online.  If you make it yourself, you&#x27;ll know the concentration, you can be sure it&#x27;s fresh and you&#x27;ll save tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Absolutely AMAZING little bottle!!! Takes care of your oiliness, or dryness, addresses small skin issues/lesions, and leaves your skin feeling great!! As a beauty therapist, and an &amp;#34;owner of an oily kin,&amp;#34; I am so very happy I finally found this product - no more shiny film few hours after I apply my make up!!&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME STUFF!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more...... &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> easy to use.  Goes a long way. skin feels great</li>
    <li> I find the product to be okay.  My skin is good.  I will see how it works over time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for almost two weeks and very much like the results. Nice texture, plus I think the combination of Hyaluronic Acid, C and E is proving very beneficial for my skin. I&#x27;m noticing a smoother texture and less of a tired look, especially around the eye area. Will absolutely order and continue use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After several weeks my skin was looking duller and the wrinkles on my forehead and the bridge of my nose more prominent. Although my skin was soft, this product did not give me the beneficial results of another product with just topical Vitamin C. I&#x27;ve gone back to the other and my skin has improved to its prior condition before I used this product. It&#x27;s not terrible, it just did not ultimately do anything for me. In my opinion, added ingredients are probably of little benefit. Stick with the C.</li>
    <li> I have only been using my Vitamin C serum for one week and I am already seeing a difference in my skin. I have to say that I am very pleased because I have used other products on the market and have only been disappointed. Most anti-aging serums are expensive so to purchase one and not see results it is very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;With Vitamin C serum my skin seems tighter and younger looking, I am excited to see what the next few weeks holds</li>
    <li> Definitely would recommend your product! Easy to use and feels great on my skin. I would definitely order product again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference in my skin, but I do find it to be a decent serum.</li>
    <li> Meh, not for me.  My skin loves the moisturizing but it isn&#x27;t non-comedogenic, so I had to deal with clogged pores. Will probably see if someone else can use it.</li>
    <li> Works well after using a Derma roller!</li>
    <li> this product is really nice. been using it for almost a month. As soon as i applied it to my face and it dried, i could feel the tightening. the permanent effects are kind of slow but definite. i&#x27;m prone to mild breakouts, but i have not experienced any with this product. i had really bad sunburn as well prior to receiving this product and the serum actually helped speed up the healing process, my skin was back to normal in just under 2 weeks. would defintely purchace again</li>
    <li> Good product...I appreciate the service and follow-ups from the manufacturer. So far it makes my skin feel tight, but have not seen a hug difference yet.  maybe too soon to tell but nothing negative so far.</li>
    <li> I never review products, but this one is a winner. The price is fantastic but the results are even better. My skin tone evened out considerably and brightened beautifully. Just one bottle. It goes a long way too. I ordered Perricone&#x27;s vitamin c tubes thinking they would be even better but they certainly were NOT. Pricey to be sure on top of that. I love a few other Perricone products but this Oz serum is the bomb!!!! I&#x27;m 51 with dryish/crepey style skin. Fair complected.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this is working as claimed since I have only been using for a week.  But i feel like my facial skin a bit softer than before.  Am hoping for the greater result.  Then I would place more orders.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and packaged well.  No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Trying this serum morning and night under eye cream and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s hope it is as amazing as others say it is.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent serum used in daily skincare. Easy to use, dry quickly, put on lotion after it. I prefer to use it in a.m., and it works well with my makeup on. It has been part of my regularity. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Skinceuticals serums and wanted to try something new.  And so happy I did!!  This serum is awesome!!  The serum does not sting and is absorbs right into the skin without any sticky feeling.  My skin so good after using the serum ~ it&#x27;s a definitely a keeper as part of my beauty regime.  Thank you so much for the amazing product!! :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, it&#x27;s great and it makes my skin much brighter and smoother. I was not expect that results but i was shoked. I&#x27;ll keep buying this product and I&#x27;ll try the other OZ products as well</li>
    <li> Awesome for dark spots!!  Love OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> I have been asked several times if I was doing something different, because me skin looked great.  Unsolicited I have received compliments on my facial skins appearance. I will continue to use this product,</li>
    <li> This product is truly revolutionizing the way people determine their skin care routine, and by people, I mean almost all of the women in my family. Before purchashing this product I wasn&#x27;t sure what a Vitamin C serum was, and with the growing number of companies that sell it I was hesitant to try this one. However, I am really glad I did. The serum did more for me then I thought it would. Originally, I purhased this for my mother to help her combat her aging skin but at the same time I wanted to try it out for myself before I gave it to her. I have very dry skin that is prone to breakouts and I needed something which would help me get smooth, oil free shiny skin in the winter months. After using this for almost a month now, I am very happy with the results. I apply this as directed and once it dries I apply my favorite st. Ives moisturizer on top. I can honestly say its better than buying any of those high end creams and lotions. My skin looks radiant, it has a glow. No more dry skin, and I can step out the house with my bare face!</li>
    <li> I love the Oz natural products!  I have seen great results with the products and others have noticed too!  Glad to say other friends and family have used these products and love them too!</li>
    <li> I was using another VitC Serum when I found Oz Naturals and decided to give it a try.  It may not smell like an orange, but it definitely made a bigger difference than my original brand.  Oz Naturals helps keep my hormonal freckling and acne to a 0-minimum.  My skin is softer and smoother with Oz Naturals.  I like the VitC Serum so much I ordered the face wash!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile now. It is a great product. Can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t live without it. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The Oz Serum are excellent. Feels lovely and silky after application.It&#x27;s like an oil but I was surprised at how quickly it absorbs. I&#x27;m using around eyes with no irritation at all.It has improved my skin and it feels a lot softer and is very smooth.  Oz Natural got more products and one of my new discoveries it the Hydration Mask. Hope you get a chance to try that too. Just love it!</li>
    <li> Great product that I use in Am and PM. It helps even out your skin tone. I use Oz Natural moisturizer on top. Very happy with both products</li>
    <li> What a wonderful and natural product. Highly recommend adding to any skin care routine for brighter and luminous skin.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks I see a big difference on my face. I also shared this product with a friend in Europe and waiting for her opinion.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m very satisfied and recommend to other women 60+</li>
    <li> I love this serum. seems to melt right into my skin. and stay there!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, soaks into skin fairly quickly and it may be too early to notice results but I do feel like the overall tone of my skin is more even and youthful looking.</li>
    <li> This has helped to even out my skin tone and have a more youthful appearance. I will definately be buying more of this !! I will never go without vitamin c !!</li>

    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for about a month now.  My complexion is definitely clearer.  I will continue to use this product.  I like the price point and the fact that it is all natural.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product !!!</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 and need to start using serums for my face (lots of sun damage).  This stuff is relatively inexpensive and seems to hydrate my facial skin very well when used right after shower.</li>
    <li> Been using this for sometimes now and it&#x27;s been working great.  Can tell the difference.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem legit to me. I&#x27;ve used really great Vitamin C products before but I wanted to try something organic. This product almost seemed like water...it was just NOTHING. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an expiration date...and says &amp;#34;expires two years from purchase&amp;#34; was not very comforting. So it can sit on a shelf for 5 years and then be sold to me? Not quite sure where all these rave reviews are coming from...</li>
    <li> I love this product - Vitamin C is great for the skin and this product works well for me. My pores are noticeably reduced, especially around the chin area.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, and is completely due to the fact that I cannot believe all the positive reviews for such an awful product. I came off from using another vitamin C serum that worked very well, but due to the reviews of this product, thought I would give it a try. My mistake. After 30 or so days of use, my skin looked like it jumped 10 years in age. Skin tone poor and three pronounced wrinkles on my forehead. Not happy. Using a different one now that appears to be doing what this one should have.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  So far I love this product but time will tell.  I am 71 after all, not looking for miracles, just some softness.</li>
    <li> This has a consistency more like water and I use about 9-10 drops each time as opposed to a oil or other &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; where I would use only 3-4 drops.  I am using it with the derma roller and it seems to be working really well! I already notice a difference in the tone and brightness of my skin after only a week; since I see results so quickly I am giving it 5 stars but I do not believe it would work so well without the roller (which although effective is somewhat like a medieval torture device) because of it&#x27;s consistency.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE VITAMIN C SERUM</li>
    <li> Just love the OZ Natural products. Used as directed they truly deliver firmer more dewy looking skin. Unlike many other vitamin C serums it wears very well under make up with out flaking, just allow it to dry completely prior to using moisturizer. Only tried it for a few days so far so the 4 stars....Given more time I am positive the results will be outstanding.</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s a good c. I have been using it for months now</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet that it is working but my face is immediately tight.</li>
    <li> I am using it regularly , but i don&#x27;t see any changes.  OK</li>
    <li> It is safe for all skin types, even my very sensitive skin, causing me no adverse effects whatsoever. I have used the OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum every morning for several weeks now. It is thin in consistency and goes on smoothly. I started noticing results within just a few days. I use this serum before applying my Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer and/or makeup. It only takes less than a minute to dry. I love the nice healthy glow my skin has after using this serum. It is also softer with a smoother texture. And most importantly, my skin is staying much more hydrated and moisturized during the day, with or without makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure:  I was sent this OZ Naturals products for free in order to perform this review. However, no other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.*</li>
    <li> This serum really brightens up and evens out my skin tone and the results were being seen even only after a few days. I&#x27;m not sure why Vit C does help heal &amp; tone up skin, but it really does. Highly recommend at this price also. Many out there are 10X more!</li>
    <li> Bestt vit c out there.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for about a month and my skin has never looked better. Most of my acne scarring is just about gone, and my complexion is brighter overall! I can actually leave the house without makeup these days which I&#x27;ve never been able to do before. Looking forward to trying other Oz Naturals products now!</li>
    <li> My face feels tighter and brighter.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and hope for good results.</li>
    <li> I use this serum every day and have been using for approx two weeks.  You need to leave it to dry before you use a moisturiser.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I can&#x27;t comment on wearing makeup with it.  It leaves my skin soft and I am sure it is starting to decrease the fine lines.  I am 53 and am starting to see the lines of age and years of being in the sun.  Sunscreen was never really a factor when were were kids - it is now starting to show!!  So trying to find the best products to assist with keeping the ageing at bay. Will definitely be buying this again.  I also use it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Love. I am 28 and starting to get the little eye wrinkles. I use this and my eminence eye cream, and my eyes look years younger. I love this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 3 weeks now. I have to say that I started noticing a difference after the 3rd day of use! I noticed a firming of the skin, not tight it just felt firmer, healthier. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lightening of my &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; although at my age (53) I think they are called sunspots! Ha! Anyway after 3 weeks of use I have noticed that the color, tone of my complexion looks healthier! Yay! As far as the few lines I have, around my mouth and crows feet are not gone. Not that I expect they would be, but they seem to have softened. I use about 5 drops on my face 2 times a day after washing. I then use Oz&#x27;s Ocean Mineral Tonic. Then the C serum. Followed by a AM moisturizer or a thick PM moisturizer.  My skin is definitely softer, but feels firmer. I have always taken care of my skin with daily moisturizers but felt the need to step up my game! This isn&#x27;t the first C serum I&#x27;ve tried. I used a Korres c, which made my face feel super moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t look any different. I also used another brand of organic C which didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Bottom line... Is I&#x27;d definitely use again once this bottle is gone, I&#x27;m 3 weeks in and have only used 1/4 of the bottle! So for the price I can&#x27;t wait to see after 2 months of use! I&#x27;m also using less foundation due to how good my skin tone looks. Almost radiant. Almost :)</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money</li>
    <li> Great product will order again.</li>
    <li> Have defintely noticed a change easing some of the lines around my eyes.  Also several dark spots I had have almost totally gone, cannot notice them at all.  Even thoe it&#x27;s 3 oz a little drop goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends who also like using it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything get rid of my age spots and I used it religiously every night for 3 months. I&#x27;m very disappointed with the lack of results, especially because it costs more than the average brand. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> Gentle enough for my sensitive skin while still tough on Saturday Gma of aging. Kicks dull tired skin to the curb, plumps skin, eases out lines and gives the glow back.</li>
    <li> Works great for the texture of my skin, brightening and helping with dark age spots.  I find it comparable to more expensive brands plus it has no parabens and other toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very good serum! Absorbs fast</li>
    <li> Use it every time I washed my face.  Cannot go a day without it!</li>
    <li> I like the product! I was looking for a product that would perform similarly to the Obagi one with an affordable price and I think I found it.</li>
    <li> It has a foul smell and didn&#x27;t notice a change after 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working! I&#x27;m on my second bottle! So far I&#x27;m very happy and will be trying other OZ Natural products! Love it that they are all natural and no animal testing!</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, easy to use, and it shows noticeable improvement. I would like to note that you have to be patient with it, because you&#x27;re not going to notice any changes after only a few weeks. It may take a month or longer to see the difference, but I loved it. It did great at getting rid of my blemishes I had acquired from my high school years. I actually feel a bit more confident now without any foundation on. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> It came sealed and not in a box. When opened the dropper came off. The product itself doesn&#x27;t do anything. Made my skin itchy. I use skinceutical and that&#x27;s nothing comparable to that. Based on the comments thought would be the same thing but not.</li>
    <li> Great product. My only comment is that I wish it were a thicker consistency so it would be easier to apply.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday!  Tightens my pores without drying my skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I dont like it. It doesnot work at all. My skin is still not smooth with some break out.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed see no change after using the full bottle.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I could see absolutely no visible results from using this product.  I found that Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz, works better for me.</li>
    <li> It works!!! It makes the dark spots less visible!</li>
    <li> I got it for free due to a website, so far so good</li>
    <li> I  sang the praise of this serum in an earlier review, but the formula has changed. At first I though I&#x27;d gotten a bad batch and sent it back, but the next two I ordered were the same: thicker, less able to penetrate, and extremely drying. I just thought they&#x27;d changed the packaging, but the serum has been changed as well. They had a great thing and ruined it.</li>
    <li> No results at all for brightening or discoloration. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> There is a reason for the impressive popularity of Oz Naturals products. They contain only natural products or non-toxic ingredients.  And THEY WORK!!! This serum is the latest addition to my arsenal of natural beauty products. It goes on very lightly and my face looks refreshed and brighter immediately. It absorbs well and my skin feels fantastic all day.  I believe I am actually starting to notice diminished lines as well.  Love love love!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product religiously every morning and nights since the beginning of June 2014 and I have to say I didn&#x27;t work for me. I have &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; skin and I wanted a vitamin C serum with some kind of anti aging agent to prevent wrinkles. I have some lines in my forehead and they haven&#x27;t diminish at all.  My skin looks dull as my skin is dry but I haven&#x27;t got any brightness or softness out of this product.  The product doesn&#x27;t rub in your skin as other serum instead you have to pat it and quickly as it dries very very fast. As it dries my skin felt super super tight not nourishing at all, it seems like this product has no effect whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of $30 for a product that many reviewed fantastically but I&#x27;m pretty sure those people were paid because this serum doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product is okay but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements on my skin type. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews..good and bad.  I bought 2 months ago and do not regret it.  I am 46 and get mistaken for 35 now.  The little wrinkles disappeared... Skin tone has evened out and my skin has actually lifted up.  I will continue to buy this.  It is the only anti aging serum I use now.  I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer anymore.  My neck and chest areas look better and lifted.</li>
    <li> I just received my third bottle of Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum, but this one is being returned immediately.  The ingredient list has completely changed and no longer contains any organic ingredients and it now includes animal by-products.  The box/bottle label no longer includes 100% vegan, although the company has neglected to remove this selling point from the product description on Amazon.  For those shoppers interested in organic and/or vegan products, look elsewhere.  For all other shoppers, you should question the veracity of any claims by a company that is blatantly deceptive in advertising their product.</li>
    <li> use every so often absorbs well</li>
    <li> I use this at night and it makes my skin feel so smooth and tight.</li>
    <li> I am baffled by all of these super positive reviews.  I have been using the product for 45 days now and have not seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old with fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  I&#x27;ve been following the instructions that came with the product and have seen zero difference in the appearance of my skin.  My skin is already in decent shape as I take care of it via sunscreen and moisturizer.  I was hoping to see some of my fine lines reduced through the use of this serum but this did not happen for me.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now and have not seen a dramatic difference. I was hoping to even out my skin tone (naturally uneven and on the redder side) but have not seen the results I was hoping for. I am not as interested in reducing wrinkles, so maybe I just chose the wrong product. However, I will continue to use the rest of my current bottle.</li>
    <li> This Serum works great. No complaints. It seems to do exactly the same thing as any other vitamin C serum and the price is great.</li>
    <li> My skin is improved for sure!  My skin now appears soft without make-up.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum since I bought it and I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> this is a great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry ...I can say.After the first couple of days after I received it. The bottle slipped out of my hand and broke on the floor. Wish I was able to give my feed back .</li>
    <li> This is great - it doesn&#x27;t agitate my skin. I use it before bed and after it dries, I put on lotion. My skin is hydrated and smooth in the morning. At first I was afraid that the concentration would be too high but I have had no problem with it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes my skin so soft and bright. I love it so much that I&#x27;ve ordered other OZ Naturals items and will continue using this product. I recommend it for any age, my teenage sons have used it and it helps clear their skin over night.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not live up to what other reviewers experienced. After a week I noticed some breaking out. I continued with the serum not attributing the acne to it. I have tried other vitamin c serums with no problems. Well after an additional week my skin is a mess. I have several large pimples on my chin and cheeks and my forehead feels like sandpaper. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical now of all the great reviews this product has received.</li>
    <li> Despite being skeptical, I bought this for my 72 year old wife ten weeks ago. In two  months of usage, her face looks at least ten years younger. She can&#x27;t see it because she has been looking closely every day in the mirror, but it is a remarkable change. She also began orally taking a tablespoon of coconut oil daily about 4 weeks ago, and it is also a major help. Her face now appears moist with a healthy glow and much fewer, much shallower wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many other vitamin C serums so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to (just one), but I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way my skin looks.  I use this product at least once a day, sometimes twice a day if I have time in the morning.  Prior to this I had used a vitamin C serum from Kiehl&#x27;s which was much more expensive and not as effective.  I&#x27;ve ordered two of these bottles so far and plan to order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> As a 22 year old, I really care about my skin and wanted a serum to really smooth it and make it look fresh! This does just that! I apply every morning and night and it really makes my skin glow! Have not gotten one pimple since using it and even get compliments about how great my skin looks! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Improves skin with continued use of prouduct.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything and I used it as directed :(</li>
    <li> crap product.&lt;br /&gt;i think the reviewers were all paid or given free supply to write in favor of it on here or something&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m real and this product is a lie</li>
    <li> I did like how my skin felt, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve recently realized I really should be using skin care products on a regular basis, to help prevent some future signs of aging. I should probably have started a decade ago, but better late than never. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product from OZ Naturals mainly because of what is NOT in it. I like that there&#x27;s no alcohol or parabens, and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I strongly believe in choosing natural products when possible and avoiding the use of chemicals in or on my body as often as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this serum on my face, neck and upper chest.  I used it with the OZ Naturals Moisturizing Serum.  I did notice a tightening of the skin and even possibly a lightening of dark spots, but the results were subtle.  Nothing drastic.  It would have been even more helpful if I had taken some before pictures for comparison!  Still, I was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5, because I noticed subtle improvement instead of the drastic improvement in the Amazon description. But I am satisfied with this product. Sometimes, when you choose natural products/ingredients, it takes a while to see bigger results. I also hope that with continued use of this product, I will avoid some of the signs of aging on my face.</li>
    <li> not much if anything happened  very disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Vitamin C products over the years from several different companies, and find that this is the best product to date.  Although I have good skin it has noticeably improved  its suppleness and firmness. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Works well, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Lovey it , I will buy this again and again!!</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing! No more rosacea, smoother, clear more even skin tone. I am hooked! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.  I don&#x27;t dislike it but I jut can&#x27;t tell the difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> As I said before, these two products (the Vitamin C serum and the Hyaluronic acid) are a must have in my faical routine.  I am often told I look much younger than my 60 years so I am going to keep using what works!  I also use a good moisturizer with sunscreen after these two products.</li>
    <li> Excellent serum from reputable company.  Only wish had a pump dispenser to keep serum fresh  Affordable price</li>
    <li> Works great.  Like to apply it every day to face &amp; neck with very nice results (most fine lines &amp; wrinkles are very much improved).</li>
    <li> Does absolutely NOTHING! I applied it every night and many mornings too, for several months. May be this product used to be good but in my experience it might as well be water at this point. I kept it in a dark cabinet too, just to ensure it doesn&#x27;t oxidize. I&#x27;ve used vit C serums before (a cheap one from Avon, nothing fancy, but it worked fantastic!) so I know what to expect. I also have the perfect &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; forehead lines: they are very fine and if I am using something even remotely decent they start to fade within a week or two of using the product. That&#x27;s how I know if something works. Well this serum failed my tester lines too. I am currently using it on my neck because it does absorb very quickly (it feels just like slightly slippery water) and does not leave a sticky residue so I can tolerate it on my neck where I can&#x27;t tolerate much else. But it doesn&#x27;t do anything there either. I am just trying to use up the bottle. Waste of money, cannot recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this product.  It caused irritation and I did not care for the witch hazel odor.  It did not give my skin a glow or smooth like some products do.  Because of my job I have used MANY skin care products from discount store to high end cosmeceuticals  and this was on the lower end of anything I have bought.</li>
    <li> I can notice the result after just a few days is very good I recommend.</li>
    <li> Idem was shipped fast.. Ive been using for about 5 or 6 weeks.. I honestly love this serum. . I wouldnt hesitate to try any of the other OZ natural products.. It doesnt take much to cover my face and neck .. no harsh smell. Smooth feel . I feel my skin is smoother ,dewy and more radiant.  Look forward to trying more of the Oz natural products in the future.. Great price too..</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.  Leaves my skin smooth without dying and doesn&#x27;t make me oily either.  I completely recommend this.  Part of my daily skin routine.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C cleansers and serums. Used to make them myself using a DIY approach using ascorbic acid. Easier to get the ones and this is well packed in a dark bottle. Had no side effects and was excellent. A sample was sent in exchange of a review.</li>
    <li> Had freckles that appeared between my thumb and index finger. After two weeks and no change I decided to try this on my hand. The freckles went completely away in less than a week.</li>
    <li> very light and seems to work well.  I am pleased and have ordered it twice now.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very light feeling to the skin.  I have used two bottles now and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Absorbs quickly.  No smell/scent/odor.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin but I had been using Obagi 15% C serum.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. The consistency is sort of watery, but that is what I love about it. It absorbs quickly and I use it all over. Not just on my face. Unfortunately it does run out rather quickly because I do use it on other parts of my body, but I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. Soft and smooth with a nice glow. It does not have much of a scent which is a plus because I like to apply my favorite moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I think there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product but for some reason it caused me breakout...I use it as my body serum instead.</li>
    <li> I want to start out by saying that I did get this product for free for the purpose of my review my opinions are hundred percent my own I was not paid or told to say any of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research, and vitamin c helps even out skin tone, and also helps build collagen for firmer skin. So it&#x27;s great for the health of your skin. I was a little hesitant to use this product at first because it is a serum and I have oily t-zone but decided that it would not hurt to try I decided to use at night just in case it made my skin oily but I was surprised to wakeup and not have an oily t-zone like I normally do but the biggest change I notice was the redness that I usually have in my cheeks I am so in love with this my skin feels amazing the redness is completely gone and my acne has been reduces greatly I feel confident in my skin I love that I can go out with out makeup and not worry that people are staring at the redness in my face</li>
    <li> I have now used this product for two weeks so I figured that is a long enough time to write a proper review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit of background: I am a 27 yr old male, decent skin but have some smile lines and lines on my forehead from tanning for 4 years strait almost every day ( in tanning booths... I know stupid move, but I was in college and liked being tan ;)  Over the past two years I have noticed my skin was not as bright as it used to be, also I had some darkness under my eyes ( Sun damage I suspect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product every morning and night for the first week, than just at night for the second.  I can honestly say my smile lines are not as prominent as they were ( there still there though).  I also have to say this lightened by under-eye area  ( did not completely remove the darkness).  Keep in mind my darkness came from sun damage, i&#x27;m not so sure it would work for hereditary darkness.  Other positives include that my skin is very soft, it evened my skin tone quite well and brightened by skin tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  Since it is &amp;#34;Brightening&amp;#34; and I am decently fair skinned, this definitely makes your face pale.  I combat that by using a self tanning spray on my face 1-3x a week.  It also has not completely gotten rid of my smile lines or the deeper lines on my forehead... but it also has only been two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  For $30 this will last about two months if you are using it just at night... $15 a month is definitely worth it for this stuff.  Is it going to erase deep wrinkles and lines, definitely not, but it probably will make them less noticeable.  If your looking to erase years off your face get Botox, fillers or plastic surgery.  If your looking for a decent boost for your skin, than this is for you!</li>
    <li> after trying many things....LOVE this</li>
    <li> I think this works.  On my second bottle, and my face has taken on a glow; wrinkles seem softer looking.&lt;br /&gt;I use morning and night.  After applying, give a couple minutes for it to really absorb then use a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> After 3 days seeing good results.  Thank you OZ for giving me directions on its use.  I will definitely buy again.  The small lines over top lip are fading - how great!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a week. I use it in conjunction with the Vitamin C cleanser, toner and sea minerals moisturizer. I have been using Oz Naturals products for some time and bought this based on the REVIEWS. In a week, I have seen a significant difference. Again, I use it in conjunction with the other products, so my results are probably optimal. I have read a few negative reviews, mostly that the serum either &amp;#34;does nothing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; or irritating. Funny, because I had the same experience the first 2 times I used it. My face looked red and irritated (mostly at night after a hot shower), but I decided not to throw in the towel. I kept using it and by day 3 my face adjusted to it I guess. For those who said that they can&#x27;t tell a difference-I really think this product has to be used IN CONJUNCTION with the other Oz Naturals products. In just a few days, I have seen a difference in my skin tone. My skin is smooth and I have less breakouts. I will continue using it and hope to be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best smelling and feeling VC Serums on the market. I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy and have only just started testing all kind of skin products. This one is a winner and very well priced.</li>
    <li> Used for a week and the only results I experienced were newly added red splotches and acne in spits I have not had it before.  Seems to have clogged my pores and irritated my skin. Wrinkles still as visible as they were. Must have to be a certain skin type other than mine to work. I do not recommend this item; not with good conscience. Pictured is my before and after</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and hope for even better results then I have already seen.</li>
    <li> I love hyaluronic acid - all of my friends will tell you I rattle off about it all the time.  I also know the value of vitamin c for your skin, but I&#x27;ve never tried the two together.  These two, along with the amino acids (and I love witch hazel in products too), and the herbs that are infused throughout the serum, makes for a real treat.  Went on smooth, wasn&#x27;t tacky on the skin, and was easily absorbed. Great to use before your moisturizer and before makeup.  This definitely makes it on my &#x27;love it&#x27; list! I</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have a very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to acne and it has discolorations. I thought I will never get to go out without wearing on any kind of coverage but this serum allowed me to do so. I am so happy with results thank God. Thanks to whoever came out with this excellent serum.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used serums before this, and boy was I missing out! I definitely found a difference not only in my skin, but how my moisturizer worked with it. I find my skin brighter too!</li>
    <li> I was having an issue with some brown spots on my face. I had tried a whitening cream but didn&#x27;t see any results. Then I tried this. Definitely made a huge difference very quickly. This is now the third OZ Naturals product I have tried and am so happy that I did. This Vitamin C serum has also greatly improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and some of the lines on my forehead look better too. I have learned my lesson from expensive department store brands that always just cost a lot and seem to do little. This product is worth it in every way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too watery. Not sure if it is potent enough. It should be more concentrated. I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C from a dermatologist and it was very good. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> THE BEST! Drastically improved my skin. I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore. My acne scars have faded tremendously and my skin always looks bright and luminous. I&#x27;m coming to the end of my last bottle. WIll be repurchase #2 very soon.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this serum after using another that was 100% hyaluronic acid (from Cosmedica). I had read that it it works best when combined with Vitamin C. While I can&#x27;t say that I dislike this serum, I also don&#x27;t love it, either. It&#x27;s got an OK texture, and dries just a tad bit sticky. I found that I have to let my face dry completely after application, otherwise my moisturizer doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin (texture, brightness, wrinkles softening, or increased hydration). I don&#x27;t think I would re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I have deep smile line and my skin is a little bit sensitive, before I was so worried. But after read some review, I know that it’s safe for all skin type. So I want to give it a try.I see this serum is very clear and every day I only a apply a thin layer, Afterward I use Clinique moisturizer. And I use it day n night. After using this serum for 15 days, I feel so relieved, this serum will not clog pores, and not just that, I feel my skin is much brighter n firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you want to see a skin product is good or not, it better give the serum 30 days to see the result. I want to buy this serum is because I want to improve my smile line n eye lines. That is the reason I bought this product. Surprisingly, my deep smile line is lessening, and the lines around the eyes are starting to disappear. That is so amazing!!! My neighbor and friends are notice my skin is much better than before, they said I looks more refreshed and younger.  It just so lucky I have try this, my skin is getting better and better.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. Its so good I will never have to look again. You get real results, real fast.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell what this is doing.  Dries very quickly and not sticky though.  I use other products so I can&#x27;t really tell if this helps or not.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mary Kay serum c for about 6 months now and it is expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try this one to see if it is comparable. It is like water!  I do not like it at all and will keep splurging for the Mary Kay Serum C.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 weeks and have seen no changes at all.  I have notice some have said you have to use it for a month to see results.  Maybe.  But so far there is no change at all.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smoothed out my skin, have been using if for about 3 months and has done wonders for my fine lines and dark spots as well as acne scars.</li>
    <li> It does not burn when applied. I like that a lot. It makes my skin feel smooth when it dries. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know what it will do over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this and my skin is looking very good. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out like some other products do.  I will continue to use this as I am getting very good results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the second time I ordered this serum, love it!!! And it&#x27;s cheaper compared with other places.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Bottle lasting into 4th month. My skin feels and looks so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I am a G-ma in early 60s and play tennis a great deal (outdoors). My dermotologist&lt;br /&gt;said to keep it going ---- &#x27;you look wonderful!&#x27;. Bought a bottle for my husband and&lt;br /&gt;he has seen improvement as well. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since sliced bread. I love this Serum. My face has a glow it didn&#x27;t have before. My face is brighter. I have slight rosai (reddening of face) and this Serum has made a huge difference in my skin. A lot of the redness has faded. I had a small seed wart on the upper side of my nose and it was hanging after I knocked part of it lose when I was washing my face. I took the scissors and cut it off.  After applying alcohol and stopping the flow of blood I thought, would this Serum help it.  I applied it to the place where the wart had been. I put it on that morning and again that night. I did this 2 days and on the 3rd day it was almost cleared up.  It left no scar, can&#x27;t even see where it had been.  I have been putting it on the backs of my hands as I have age spots and they are almost faded. A little goes a long way.  My daughter and best friend noticed right away the difference in my face. My guy friend ask me what I was putting on the backs of my hands to make the age spots fade. Today he ask me what I was doing to my face to make it brighter looking and not as red. Trust me he never notices anything. I will buy more of this and keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and have been using this product for 8 to 10 weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite reduction in the fine lines under my eyes and in the crow&#x27;s feet area. My skin feels smoother and brown discolorations are greatly reduced. The real proof is that several people I have asked me what I&#x27;m doing to my face because my skin is so smooth. Where I&#x27;ve seen the biggest difference is on the sun damage on my chest. I can&#x27;t believe how much lighter the skin is. I did a lot of research on Vitamin C serums before deciding that this one offered the most. And I&#x27;m sold! If it irritates your face, try using it only every other or third day until your body adjusts. A slight burning/tingling sensation is normal for a minute or so after use.and be sure to use a moisturizer, too.</li>
    <li> I really love this face serum; I went into it being quite skeptical and was pleasantly surprised. I have been using this for about 4 weeks and have noticed smoother, softer and more even tone skin.  I have NOT seen much of a difference with fine wrinkles disappearing but i still LOVE this product and will continue to buy it. P.S. I break out very easily and this product did NOT do that!</li>
    <li> Using this product daily, sometimes morning and eve. Vitamin C products lose potency very quickly via oxidation (been in the biz), and they are often so expensive, people use them too sparingly. In order to work, it&#x27;s got to get on your face, and regularly! Because the price is so reasonable and I&#x27;ve got a wedding coming up, I am &#x27;going for it.&amp;#34; My skin is looking very nice and feeling hydrated. And don&#x27;t skimp on your sunscreen either! You&#x27;ve only got one face. :)</li>
    <li> not sure if its doing anything. Did not have any burning or raw sensation but I am used to putting on Retin A for the last 20 plus years. I don&#x27;t think I will reorder when it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;Reason</li>
    <li> It made my skin dry! It does not up hold it&#x27;s reputation of quality and the hefty price tag. Very disappointed. I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! This is what I have been searching for in a serum. I have used others in the past and they left my skin feeling gross. This absorbed right away and left my skin silky smooth. I also noticed my skin looked more bright. I even got a compliment on my skin today and that is only after 1 day of use. I am so excited to see my long term results from this. I will be leaving another review after a few weeks to update how it had transformed my skin. I am using this in conjunction with the OZ  NATURALS  Ocean mineral tonic and the Sea Infused herbal moisturizer. I am already liking how my skin is feeling and in have only used it 2 times today very excited for the long term effects. I definitely will be buying more of this vitamin c serum! !</li>
    <li> The key to skin care is doing it routinuly, this is a great product - it&#x27;s helped for sure.</li>
    <li> this serum works wonders.  I apply is after use of the Derma Roller.  My complexion has never looked so good.  I am 45 and suffer from sun spots due to over tanning in my 20s.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t works for me :(</li>
    <li> THE BEST SERUM EVER! SO HYDRATING AND SKIN TIGHTENING</li>
    <li> It did not make any difference in my skin, but I appreciate being able to have access to it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write review, but I am raving about this product and telling everyone. 43 year old female, had some age spots on the left side of my face, from what I believe is from driving (I&#x27;ve seen the left side of face can age faster, just google &amp;#34;truck driver left side of face.&amp;#34;). I put a few drops of this serum in my hands and spread all my face every morning before my moisturizer/spf. The spots have significantly faded after about 4 months of use. And it&#x27;s just improved all around skin tone as well. From what I have read, the vitamin C really compliments vitamin A (I use .05 Retin-A every third night). I highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Better quality and better priced than at the spas</li>
    <li> I love this! Brightens my tired face. I have tried several others BUT in my opinion this brand is the best I have found.</li>
    <li> you can see and feel the difference</li>
    <li> I bought this because I could not use a Retinol product during pregnancy.  After the first application, I noticed my fine lines were smoother and my face had a nice glow.  My skin is also smoother to the touch.  Usually, I wake up to flaky and dull skin even after several applications of moisturizer the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting to wake up with fewer wrinkles, my wrinkles are not gone, but smoother and less noticeable.  In addition, I have not seen a dewy complexion in a long time until now.  I started noticing wrinkles as early as my mid 20s; it is in the genes.  I have purchased very expensive brand name creams that promise results with no happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has definitely exceeded my expectations.  I will continue using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a glowing review about this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the appearance of my skin. The one good thing I can say is that it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> I noticed nothing. I&#x27;ve used two bottles</li>
    <li> Let me give you a little background on my complexion issues.  I am a 30 year old mother of one child, and never suffered from acne until I was pregnant.  Ever since then, 8 years ago, I have gotten pimples usually around that time of the month, or when I&#x27;m stressed out.  Last January I started getting worse acne, but I got a handle on it and it went away.  Then this Summer I moved and started getting worse acne than I&#x27;ve ever had.  I would get pimples that hung around for months, literally months, that would flame up randomly and just ruined my complexion completely.  I did a little research and discovered that those &amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34; were probably hyperpigmentation, because they didn&#x27;t stick out and were just red splotches on my face left over from the pimples.  I did what I usually do and researched the heck out of reviews for different products on Amazon that mentioned hyperpigmentation, and came upon this stuff.  I first use acne face wash (la roche posse), dry my face, then apply this and let this dry before either letting it go before bed or applying moisturizer if I am going out for the day.  After the very first night my hyperpigmentation reduced.  After a week or two some of it has completely disappeared.  The really bad ones are still there but barely visible.  I even got a pimple on my chest, which never happens, and applied this overnight and it was GONE by morning.  This stuff is amazing.  My face looks healthier and feels fantastic, my complexion is back to normal, and I am one happy girl!</li>
    <li> i dont see wonderfull effects</li>
    <li> The delivery to Singapore was prompt and arrived on the stated date. The packaging was good and the bottle was sealed. I think this is important. As for the product whether it delivers the result, I am not sure yet. Like any other face product, this might need a month or 2 of usage before I would know if it is really effective. But, so far, the serum is very pleasant to use. It feels easy to glide on to the face and it does not have the unpleasant smell of some Vit C serum.</li>
    <li> Nice. Other products are needed to go along with this product like moisturizer etc.but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I read that Vitamin C is one of the most important things you can put on your face to keep it looking young. I have sensitive skin, but never have any problems with putting this on my face. I love this!</li>
    <li> This helped my face and it actually brightened it. I would add a few drops to my face at night and it seriously helped my skin looked refreshed.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!  It feels good on the skin and a little bit goes a long way! It helps smooth out fine lines.</li>
    <li> I used this about a month as I got a review sample. I am not sure if this reduced my wrinkles or not. But it has made the  rosacea on my cheeks nearly vanish. The redness has greatly diminished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli</li>
    <li> I like this product I use it over OZ toner and seem to make my skin better.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is so important for cell turn over and rebuilding collagen. After much research I came across OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum. Upon seeing all the great reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;ve been using the serum for nearly 3 weeks now and have noticed my skin is brighter, firmer, and my dark spots have faded significantly! I can&#x27;t wait  to see what continued use will bring. AMAZING! This serum delivers on its promise!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my skin now! Been using this since last June..and for the most part I&#x27;m pleased.  There is still a dark area under one of my eyes, but that has been there since I was a kid. Would and have recommended it</li>
    <li> One of the lightest serums I&#x27;ve tried.  Clean, smooth and fresh skin awaits!</li>
    <li> I love this I have 2 frown lines in the middle if my eyebrows I have fondly named after each if my children. I have used this product for less than a week and (ella &amp; asha) my frown lines are almost faint I love love love this product</li>
    <li> This product is amazing ,i&#x27;ve been using it 4 days now and from the second day i noticed a smother look in my face and i also rub some on my husband&#x27;s face and his face is glowing as well,I really love this product and will buy it again.......</li>
    <li> This seems to make skin look better.</li>
    <li> I do not see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing anything, I will purchase another one and see. My face is certainly softer, as for reducing the appearance of wrinkles, the jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I saw and felt a difference in my skin after just a few uses. My beauty routine is minimal and now this is one product I can&#x27;t live without! Im hooked! Here&#x27;s to looking younger and feeling amazing :)</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Serum by Oz, and completed two weeks of use today. I received this bottle as a free sample to try out, as I had contacted the company with questions about their product line, as I was interested in trying them out. I am in my mid-40s and was looking for a non-greasy, effective, easy-to-use, highly nourishing serum for daily facial use. I started using a few drops of this serum (two to three drops only) in combination with two-three drops of the other serum in the morning and at bedtime. I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works--it is totally non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished. I daresay that I feel that my fine lines have diminished--no one has said anything, but I feel that the fine lines on my forehead and my laugh lines don&#x27;t appear as noticeable as they used to--to my eyes at least! We have been experiencing brutally cold winds and temperaturesin NYC these past couple of weeks, and my skin feels healthy and supple with just these two serums (no additional creams or moisturizers, though they say to use a moisturizer to seal in the hydration and I think I will start doing that just to be safe and derive the maximum benefit from the serums). Agreed that it has just been two weeks, but I am hopeful that this is not just &amp;#34;beginner&#x27;s luck&amp;#34; for me. I plan to try the Vit C. Toner and Moisturizer from Oz so that I can have my facial care regimen taken care of entirely by their line. Once I do that, I will post a follow-up review in case my experience is markedly different from the positive one I have had these past two weeks using just their two serums and their eye gel. As I said in my other review--so far, so very good. No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I was looking for natural vitamin c serum on Amazon and this product popped up.  After reading the reviews. I decided to try it and I have not been disappointed!  My face seems smoother and my age spots seem to be getting lighter.  I use this serum every night and put my nighttime moisturizer over it.  I really like it and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product about a week ago so I can&#x27;t give an accurate description of it, however, I have noticed my face to have a smoother feel after I put the vitamin C on.. I will finish the product and hopefully it works great like the other reviews describe this product..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn. I use with nu derm  from  obagi and retin a.. Just in a couple days I see a huge difference in the over tone and even-ness</li>
    <li> My fault, I should have returned this Vitamin C Serum.  Although it is easy to apply and soaks right in, it gives me milia and dries out my skin horribly.  I tried moisturizing afterward, but it doesn&#x27;t help.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try it on the top of my hands.  I&#x27;ve tried other Vitamin C products, but this one does not agree with me at all.</li>
    <li> The amount of witch hazel in here is problematic; it is a known irritant.  Most people mistakingly think witch hazel is beneficial for the skin but it is not.</li>
    <li> I received my Vitamin C serum and was looking forward to trying it.  I had heard good things about it.  I have to say that I was not very impressed.  When you apply it too your face it felt very sticky and did not absorb.  It took longer than I expected for it to dry completely.  When it finally dried it felt more like a mask than a serum.  It did not absorb very well at all.  Even after it dried it still felt sticky to me.  I don&#x27;t like how heavy it felt.  I will not be using this product again.  Maybe some others have better luck than me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really drying to my face and even after I put on moisturizer it seems really dry. This is not like other vitamin c serums I used, it&#x27;s an odorless and clear liquid. I wish I could still return it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about six months. I apply it each morning and evening to the face and neck, before I put on my moisturizer and cosmetics.  During this time, the clarity and consistency of my skin has improved.  This is now a permanent part of my daily skin care.  Prior to this, I did try to make my own version of vitamin C cream, but my results were grainy or soupy.  I don&#x27;t consider the cost of the OZ serum to be high, and I like that it&#x27;s stable (unlike my own preparation that had to be refrigerated).  So, the value for the price is definitely there and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not working, period. Wasting money.</li>
    <li> May try again, but I couldn&#x27;t see a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> love this serum !  saw a difference in just 2 weeks.  One girl stopped me and said &amp;#34;your face!&amp;#34;  it looks so smooth and better.</li>
    <li> i really like the c serum my face feels better and  some dark spots have become much lighter</li>
    <li> I love OZ Naturals - Vitamin C Serum, two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT~LOVED IT!!</li>
    <li> Seems nice but didn&#x27;t notice a big difference</li>
    <li> I will admit that this product is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried.  I use it before my moisturizer twice a day and it has minimized my deep forehead lines and laugh lines.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know that it did anything. I feel like I haven&#x27;t really seen any results. It is moisturizing so I will keep using it but as far as fine lines and wrinkles, didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have been using it for a couple of months now.</li>
    <li> Was it just me who did not notice this one being &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;? Rather average, like many serums of the kind out there on the market. Did not notice anything better than average, to be honest.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother, she has just used for a week and I can the brighter, smoother skin on her face. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks. I applied it to my face after washing and used it with OZ Naturals 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I liked that I was using all natural ingredients and that made me feel good. I rubbed it into my skin around my eyes and there was no stinging like you get from soap. It did have a better affect on my reddish baggy eyes and it seemed to lessen the tired look. After using this stuff for a couple of weeks my skin appears clearer and more radiant. I recommend this for those who take skin care seriously.</li>
    <li> This Vit.C serum is wonderful.  It is not at all greasy (I was concerned about having something heavy on my face).  The serum goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin in a few seconds.  It has eliminated any dry patches on my face and has helped my skin look great.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> OMG you guys..... I&#x27;ve used it twice and my husband said, &amp;#34;WHHAAT is IN that? It&#x27;s freaky, you look like you got a face lift&amp;#34;   Twice and it literally took off ten years of sun damage. The melasma from my pregnancy is fading already. It doesn&#x27;t sting. It doesn&#x27;t clog my t zone (I have combination skin and almost every beauty product breaks me out) I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did my research before spending money on Claudalie or La Mer.  I&#x27;m 37 and I look young for my age but because my skin is so sensitive I never wear sunscreen and have a lot of discoloration.  This stuff is LITERALLY A MIRACLE IN A BOTTLE!!!!   Update: I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle about to buy my fourth😘it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am a repeat purchaser of this product and can say without reservation that It is great. I have tried many products over the yrs especially because I spent over 20+ years in the Cosmetic Industry. This is a winner for evening out skin tone generally improving appearance.</li>
    <li> It is perfect serum. My skin is better after use it</li>
    <li> I use this serum before bed and think it&#x27;s fantastic.  It isn&#x27;t drying but definitely clears my skin.</li>
    <li> An amazing product, i used it the night before work.... The next day my coworker said I was glowing.</li>
    <li> The best vitamin C out there, can not love without the stuff!</li>
    <li> I think this stuff has made a big difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m 35 and suffer from hormonal acne issues, which only started in the last year or so.  This past year has been really bad.  I feel like using this serum lessens the severity of my breakouts and makes the actual zits go down quicker, which if any of you have really painful ones know, is major.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can see much &amp;#34;fading&amp;#34; action because I get pronounced dark marks after the zit goes away, but I think this stuff helps the healing process, and I feel like I broke out more when I ran out and was waiting for my next bottle to arrive.  Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> After apliying it ,I feel my face craggy and I have to apply moisturizer</li>
    <li> This serum is very good, I see a difference on my pores and the skin feels tighter, it is a bit drying, so if you have dry skin I am not sure you will like it. I believe I am more a combo, mature skin, but you need to lock any serum anyway with a moisturizer after applying it, so be sure to use a very rich cream.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My skin feels great.  Just ran out and need to reorder ASAP.</li>
    <li> Like it, except it contains only 20% Vit C.  Do you have 30% Vit. C serum?</li>
    <li> It works to improve skin&#x27;s texture, but I like the one with the added acid better.</li>
    <li> This is my first product review. I have never given any review for any products I&#x27;ve bought online.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and bought this based on the good reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;ll keep it short.&lt;br /&gt;I doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks, nothing changes. It quickly sinks in the skin and dries very fast,&lt;br /&gt;I applied moisturizer right after that, followed the instruction but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in skin texture or whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t continue to buy this, but it&#x27;s good that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days and my skin is already brighter! Will order again</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.  In fact, I thought it was making my brown spot worse.  It improved after I stopped using it.  It does say in fine print that they have nothing to do with Dr. Oz.  It&#x27;s a good thing for Dr. Oz.</li>
    <li> Seems to be making a difference.  :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I have already notice dramatic changes.  My pores around my nose and on my nose have minimized.  The texture of my skin is the best it has been in my 38 years.  The fine lines near my eyes are diminishing.  I have purchased expensive products that promise to do the same but they have not given me the results that i have seen with this vitamin C serum.  I highly recommend this product.  Also, only use a smaill amount.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have received the product, and I have not had time to give the product a fair try.  Since receiving the Serum,&lt;br /&gt;I have used it, however, I have a 60+ year face, so I believe it will take a little time to see if it helps&lt;br /&gt;in anyway.  Ask me again after a month or so.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other Vit C products and didn&#x27;t get the same results.  This is non greasy, absorbs quickly and gives you an instant tightening feeling.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for 2 weeks and already see a big difference. My face is brighter and has a youthful dewy glow. Love it!</li>
    <li> The serum has made a noticeable difference in my skin.  The wrinkles are less pronounced and the skin seems to be more taut.  I even bought it for my husband!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin just loves it and the serum isn&#x27;t sticky like other products. I don&#x27;t really smell anything but I don&#x27;t care as long as the product works.....which it does. My skin is plump and my acne scarring is starting to heal slowly and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it. It&#x27;s only been a few days and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet. I promise I&#x27;ll have an update for you in two weeks.</li>
    <li> Very good vitaming c serum for the ca I been using these product for about a week and I started to notice the different my sking seen more bright, tbut it does make my sking dry i have to use a heavy moisturizing cream to keep my face hydrate.</li>
    <li> I had been using this serum for about a month to treat my uneven complexion and acne scars. It did a surprisingly great job improving the texture of my skin and evening out my skin tone.  I had to stop using it because it dried out my skin so badly and made it really crepey, creating wrinkles and lines I never had.  I was using it daily and after derma rolling so I think it was just too much for my skin.  I will continue to use this but far less frequently, maybe twice a week, but right now I’m in the process of trying to reverse the wrinkles and crepey skin.  It’s worth purchasing, but if you have dry skin like me, be sure to exfoliate well and use a really hydrating night mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual product itself, it feels watery, more like a liquid than a serum. Absorbs quickly, no residue. A little goes a long way.  Would also be great to mix with a daily moisturizer or night mask.</li>
    <li> dries quickly and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> It moisturizer my skin very well!</li>
    <li> Improved the texture of my skin, but I didn&#x27;t see any big change in my fine lines or dark spots.</li>
    <li> My face looks easily 5 years younger, maybe more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks along with the OZ Naturals HA serum and the eye gel. I can tell a difference with all three, but this is my absolute favorite. My skin is evening out and I am looking more youthful. Though it probably doesn&#x27;t get the results a dermatologist could with certain procedures, I will be using vitamin C serum every day for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Great natural product and I see the results every time I look in the mirror.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. ALSO VERY RUNNY.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t worked for me 😫😫the delivery was quick that the good thing for 2 stars !! But the product did not worked , I have been using it for 3 weeks now and my dark spots stayed like wise</li>
    <li> First let me say that I received an email from this company asking if I would be willing to try three of their products and give a review. I said sure. I had no idea what an explosive subject it was. I guarantee that I am a real person who won&#x27;t gain a penny for my opinion, nor would I want to, as paying for a good review is no different than stuffing a ballot box. So here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about a month. I don&#x27;t typically use a serum (because it tends to make me break out in spite of my age) but this one was different. It was thin and light feeling on my skin. I didn&#x27;t have any problems using it and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction was how incredibly soft it made my skin feel. There was no leftover residue whatsoever. My skin felt clean without that feeling of suffocation I usually get from lotions and foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I have noticed after thirty days-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is still soft and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;-The lines around my dimples (the bane of my existence) are nearly gone. Not that they were terrible before, but they are better.&lt;br /&gt;-The lines between my brows are definitely less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;-Strangely enough the place I&#x27;ve noticed the greatest difference in is the backs of my hands which look fuller and definitely younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that this product is effective and very reasonably priced. Will it take several decades off my skin? Most likely not, but it has definitely removed some of the wear and tear from my face, neck and hands.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether it works or not, but i do like how it absorbs to a non oily and sticky texture. it is really wet when applying and i recommend a small amount, but i don&#x27;t know whether it works or not. OZ naturals eye cream is way better than this.</li>
    <li> get the cheaper micci marine skin care. this stuff costs more and it does nothing</li>
    <li> This product does not work as it was advertised. I did not see any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the fact that the product is odorless and not greasy, great for layering my other products. I should mention after using the derma roller I applied immediately after with no stinging reaction, I do have thick skin and in the past have had many exhilarating facials so I know sting!  Used Vitamin C products in the past really clinical ones and expensive couldn&#x27;t get passed the horrible odor that lingered on my face. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This product blew me away. I didn&#x27;t really know much about Vitamin C serums, or what they would do for your complexion, or even what free radicals were, but I did some research and was excited to try this product. First, again it&#x27;s a vegan product. I&#x27;m not a vegan in life, but I always want the stuff I&#x27;m using on my face to have less questionable products in it. I thought this product was outstanding. I used it for about 10 days total, and I was really impressed in the changes I saw in my complexion. I&#x27;m not a very healthy eater. I&#x27;m in between good food and unhealthy options, but I do drink tons of water a day, and I was always told water would help your complexion, but I never noticed anything. After probably four days of using this product, I noticed my skin had a more noticeable glow and my  complexion looked more even. It got better each day. My skin felt healthy, firmer, more hydrated. I really enjoyed that it had antioxidents to help protect my skin. Sun can be very harsh out here in Colorado, and even sunscreen can leave my face, dried out and somtimes burnt, but this product gave some life back into my skin, and really helped keep it looking as young as I am. I think the product is easy to use, the directions are easy to follow, and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble applying it, or any bad reactions. I think this is a good price for such a quality product and will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given a sample to try, and honestly provide feedback on how it worked.</li>
    <li> I am in the sun a lot and this product helps reduces the ravages of the sun, wind, and weather leaving my skin with a much smoother texture and even skin tone.  We have to really take care of ourselves as we age as anyone over 70 will tell you and this is one of my &amp;#34;go to products&amp;#34;. I like the fact that is is a natural product made with superior ingredients.  I don&#x27;t consider it a luxury, Oz Natural products are a &amp;#34;blessing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;CJ</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actually not ascorbic acid....</li>
    <li> Bought with the ocean tonic. has improved skin tone and shrunk pores!</li>
    <li> Really amazing, my skin feels firmer and brighter, I am 30 years old and have tried many different skin care lines such as Lancôme, Mary Kay and many others but since I&#x27;ve been using this product and I top it with my No7 perfect and protect face serum my skin has felt and looked so much better. I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I didnt see much difference.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical buying this product because I figured that all of the positive reviews were somewhat biased.&lt;br /&gt;When I turned 27 I figured I should start trying to be an adult. I did a lot of research on skin care products. There is tons of information out there. I urge you to go digging. There are many studies that show the benefits of using vitamin c with a combination of acids.&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product. It comes in a dropper bottle. Which works.&lt;br /&gt;It is clear, a little thicker than water.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after using cerave cleanser and my clairsonic. I have read that instead of just rubbing serums on your face, you should be pressing it in to your face to get it in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing when you put it on. It takes about 5 minutes for it to completely dry. Once it dries it tightens your face just slightly. Not as much as a toner would.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 3 months. I have noticed an difference in the elasticity of my skin and a significant decrease in dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;Now you can find a plethora of vitamin c serums on Amazon and at the beauty counter. I think that this is a great company. The products are well made, appropriately prices, and they care about customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;I have given this to many family members and they like it as well</li>
    <li> After having used this product for about 2 months now, I would rate it 4 out of 5. It deserves a 5, however, with my facial complexity it was not able to subside my oily, dry chemical makeup. This product was absolutely wonderful in evening out my skin tone &amp; I would highly recommend it! It relinquished the dryness of my skin, but did nothing for the oily-ness.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff and I am so happy I stumbled across it. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and really needed something more aggressive for wrinkle control. WOW, I am so impressed with this and after only 1 use can see a difference. My skin feels and looks so much more vibrant and incredibly soft, just like baby skin. I have maintained a very good regimen for skin health since my 20&#x27;s. This year I noticed a lot more wrinkles showing. So I dug deeper and ordered this plus two more of their serums. Unbelievable results, and it is suppose to get better with continuous use. I have tried making my own vitamin C serum but none of my tried recipes worked like this, EVER.  I have never tried a product that I could visibly see a difference in just one use , never before!!! I am so impressed and I hope it can shave some years off my skin and some sun damage as well. If you have wrinkles and/or fine lines, you must give this a try!  It&#x27;s a serum and I only need 4 drops to cover my face and neck, putting this at an incredible value. Love this line of products!</li>
    <li> I did not see any improvements to my skin tone .</li>
    <li> The best of everything. thanks</li>
    <li> I love this serum its really easy to use and drys very fast so you can than put on a day or night cream . This Vitamin C serum helps to brighten and give the face a very youthful glow its also very natural with nothing in it that irritated my skin at all. it works well but is not harsh or causes the skin to look unsightly while its working . you also get a lot and only need a little which makes it a fine value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and so far seen zero improvement.</li>
    <li> After purchasing drug store beauty creams most of my adult life, Hitting 60, I decided it was time to search for a new product line. Reading the positive reviews of the Oz products, I ordered a few basics, including the Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 weeks, and have noticed some clearing up of fine lines between my eyebrows, as well as lightening up of some dark spots I&#x27;ve had for the past few years. What a surprise! I just use it once a day, at night, as instructed. So far, I am happy with the results, which are visible.</li>
    <li> I question the quality of this product...it has no scent..no viscosity and has done nothing for my skin. if you look, many other buyers have had same experience.. I am greatly disappointed and will not recommend or purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> this made me break out and didn&#x27;t do much for my skin</li>
    <li> I swear, I never thought Vitamin C topically, would make much of a difference. I&#x27;m 52 and I haven&#x27;t even finished my bottle and it&#x27;s been 6 weeks (I use in the morning) and my lines around my eyes are fading! My skin looks beautiful. I was not given a sample of this to review. This is amazing. I love putting it on. It&#x27;s so soft and silky.</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3wks so...I like the idea of it but maybe it was hyped up too much</li>
    <li> This product also made my face skin dried out and left my skin with some blemishes and breakouts .  I have been wasting my money for two products that made my skin worse.</li>
    <li> I have this serum on hand always since I first started using it about a year ago.  I am very happy with what it does for my skin. People think I am much younger than I am.</li>
    <li> dries my skin alittle</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me been using for over month now.</li>
    <li> vitamin c is one of the best things for your skin, happy camper.</li>
    <li> Great product! Clear glowing skin, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum!!!! I will  get it again..... R:)))))</li>
    <li> Great product. There was actually a noticeable difference. Good ingredients, no crud in it.</li>
    <li> My skin can be described as: Pale, oily sometimes, large pores around nose, uneven skin, dark circles, acne prone...I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and I wanted to correct as many of these as possible AND help prevent impending wrinkles before I hit 30 and beyond.  I&#x27;ve tried several other creams, lotions and serums...some very expensive and some from drugstores.  In searching for my &amp;#34;miracle serum&amp;#34; I stumbled upon this product on amazon.com...the reviews looked great so I figured, meh, why not?!  And i&#x27;m SO GLAD that I did.  I only use it at night currently and I don&#x27;t put a moisturizer over it - my skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to most moisturizers :(  From the first night that I used it I noticed, the next morning, that my skin just felt smoother...it looked more lively too!  I&#x27;ve been using it every night now for the past 2+weeks and it&#x27;s only gotten better.  This product does NOT make my acne worse...does NOT clog my pores...does NOT leave a greasy feeling...and does NOT cost a fortune for the amount that you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES minimize pores, even skin tone, help with dark circles (i&#x27;ve found this gentle enough to go around my eyes...this is not a recommendation to anyone since everyone&#x27;s eyes are different, for me, however, it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t aggravate anything)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is here to stay within my regimen!!!!!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and it works.  I have ZERO wrinkles and no skin blemishes.  During the first 30 days of usage I noticed some peeling and redness.  However, this product cleared up all my hyperpigmentation and brown spots within 6 months and it is absolutely the best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical. I have never been able to find anything that works for my face. Products either did nothing at all, or caused me to have break outs and itchy irritations. During my last pregnancy, my skin became very dry. I was hopeful this would work. In the two weeks I have had it and faithfully used it, my face is clear and smooth. I have even forgone putting make-up on, which is a big deal for me! I love this serum and am a fan! I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone! Shipping was fast and follow up from the company was refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product is the best.  So far it feels like it just creates a barrier on my skin rather than absorbs into the skin.  It&#x27;s ok but I likely won&#x27;t become a repeat customer of this product.</li>
    <li> I like the smooth texture of this serum, I highly recommend this serum,it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for anyone in need of a high quality vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> This serum along with the camucomplex moisturizer,  my skin looks softer, a beautiful glow, and feels softer than it has for years, this is now a part of my daily beauty routine!  Thank You Oz Naturals</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but feels a little dry it hasn&#x27;t done anything to erase brown spots or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday and I love it so far. It seems like it makes your skin a little dry so make sure to use hydrating cream over it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin while using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this Serum!  I noticed a firmness immediately. I am 56 years old and an anti-aging junkie.  Not giving up on the fight till I am in the ground and this stuff is affordable and a great product.</li>
    <li> A true difference... See for yourself!!</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift. The person I gave it to wanted to know where I bought I t because they will buy it agsin when it&#x27;s finished. I know that hyaluronic acid plus vitamins is very good since I use it with vitamin C oil.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum, the Hyaluronic Serum, and the OZ Eye Gel all at the same time.  Unfortunately, a few days after I started using all three products, I was in an accident and scraped, bruised, and cut my face--including stitches and some bad abrasions.  However, after a week or so, I had enough clear skin on parts of my face that I could begin using the products again, and lucky for this review, could do my own comparison of my skin with and without the OZ Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the OZ Vitamin C Serum a lot.  You just need a small amount on your face and neck, and then I rub whatever is left on my hands.  Sometimes, it makes my skin feel a tight, but a little moisturizer fixes that. The best way I can describe it is the serum made my skin glow and look clear and smooth.  It didn&#x27;t make me break out, and after a few minutes, you don&#x27;t even feel it.  I added moisturizer and sunblock on top of the serum, and everything worked fine.  The glow lasted most of the day, and it was cumulative, getting better the more days in a row I used the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I tried the Vitamin C Serum plus the Hyaluronic Acid plus several moisturizers.  In the morning, my skin felt soft and moist if I used a heavy moisturizer.  I suspect that this combination will be a good one to re-try in the winter when my skin is drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was wonderful for me to have some nice facial skin surrounding my cuts that were loaded with greasy antibiotic ointment!  I will keep using this product, and I can&#x27;t wait until I can use it on my entire face.  I have previously used Prevage, which also did a nice job for me, but I hated the wasteful packaging.  The OZ Naturals is 1/3 of the cost of Prevage, had largely the same affect, and is in a glass bottle I can recycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a sample of this product to review, and the opinions in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about 5 days and my skin feels softer and, dare I say, looks &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum every single day for the past 2 weeks.  I use it in the mornings because vitamin C is like a sun barrier.  I still use regular moisturizer and sun block over this but this is the first thing I use after toner.  It feels great.  Absorbed into the skin quickly.  A little bit goes a long way.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just started using this about 2 wks ago - the only place I have wrinkles is under my eyes- unfortunately I cant say that I see much difference there yet but with the way it has been working I am hopeful  - however starting from the 1st day I could tell a difference in how much softer my skin feels - after the 1st week - I started seeing improvement in skin tone and plumpness - I am seeing a huge improvement overall and I use high quality eminence products and had pretty good skin to begin with - I am so impressed with this that I just purchased a bottle for my husband - I wanted him to have his own because I didn&#x27;t want to share mine lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my skin did tend to be on the oily side - this has really helped with that  - I am not using a moisturizer on top but if I had dry skin than I would</li>
    <li> Thanks OZ Naturals and Craig Romero for your excellent customer service. I received my order before the day I expected without any problems. I have been using the product for three weeks and I am very satisfied. After each application my face looks terse and overall I see it as a positive impact on my skin. This is my first experience using the product and using vitamin C, E, and hyaluronic acid as well. I did a search and this product came out as &amp;#34;the best choice&amp;#34; in terms of content, price, and reviews. I have very high expectations and hope to see more improvements in the near future. In summary, I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Not seeing any real improvement in my skin.  I will try a different brand soon.  Very pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product so the results have not been noticed as of yet. However I am impressed with the ease of application and how it makes my skin feel so far. I have also been impressed with the follow-up from OZ with directions and expectations.</li>
    <li> It certainly works for me! I&#x27;m using my 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product and they were right. It&#x27;s one of the few facial products that feels like it is really making a difference. I put it on at night. It feels very high quality. Would definitely purchase again and recommend it for others. Especially those with mature skin</li>
    <li> I live this serum ! It&#x27;s light and not sticky and keeps my skin smooth and blemish free. Not sure it&#x27;s the best one out there, but it is great for the price and sometimes the most expensive ones are not the best.</li>
    <li> I am 60, and have been a sun worshipping beach girl my whole life. After two bottles of this product,  I noticed a huge difference, and so did others. I&#x27;ve never received comments about my age before, but several times young clients expressed shock that I am older than their mothers, and numerous female clients my age have outright asked - &amp;#34;what are you doing?&amp;#34; My skin tone is brighter and more even. Some sun spots have faded. The biggest thing I did not expect was that my face is more &amp;#34;filled out&amp;#34; and not as gaunt. My research tells me that Vitamin C builds collagen and hylauronic acid holds 100X it&#x27;s weight in moisture. Pretty simple, and really great!  The deep wrinkles are still there, but the smaller crepey ones have all but disappeared. Since I have had both Botox and Juvaderm before, my own sister finally asked if I had had cosmetic injections again. She is also now using&lt;br /&gt;this product. I have now been using this for a year and I am usually very critical of products, and I can honestly say this is the single, most important thing I have used for my skin. I wish I had started on Vitamin C Serum 20 years ago. Btw - I am now also using it on the back of my hands and neck</li>
    <li> Combining vitamin C and retinol is recommended for a facial care regiment along with cleansing with an electronic brush, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen during day use.  I have seen a difference but not immediately as others have.  I will definitely continue using this morning and evening and hope for increased results.  Good product.  It&#x27;s kept in the refrigerator as others have recommended.</li>
    <li> Product dries quickly on skin, used for a week so far and it does brighten the skin also. Helping to get rid of female facial hair above lip area.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product. It does help fading the brown spots on my face and brighten up my skin. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I recently began using this serum and absolutely love it. My skin feels tighter rough after using it and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my glow...well, that&#x27;s the serum. But I&#x27;ll take the credit.  It is non irritating and dots a great job on my fine lines. I love that it&#x27;s ingredients are safe and effective. Definitely well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> So far the vitamin C Serum has worked for me. It has definitely improve my skin complexion. It&#x27;s is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Customer service is excellent. This stuff makes my skin feel and look healthier and more youthful must use it consistently everyday to see effects.</li>
    <li> I like the stuff so far. Ive only been using it a week, so probably not a full effect yet. I do prefer to put it on at night instead of in the morning because it doesn give you a shiney glow, and I prefer a powdered look. I do recommend!</li>
    <li> Like this! Need more time using it for long term results!</li>
    <li> It like putting water on my face, I dont see any difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now.</li>
    <li> I use this first,then after it dry&#x27;s I put on my face IMU Oil 100% on face/nect/&amp; chest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I used it for 3 weeks, I can see visible improvement on my skin it looks better and younger, smooth. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve repeatedly bought this product.</li>
    <li> Yes!  I would have to agree that I noticed almost immediately a change in my skin.  That dry, dead, dull, gray, appearance seemed to start to diminish within a few days!  Again, I would like the opportunity to give my opinion again after I have used the product longer.  SO FAR, SO GOOD!</li>
    <li> The Product arrived as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the product itself, I have noticed no real changes.  Perhaps more time is needed.  Seeing as I have plenty of product remaining there is time for a noticeable change yet.  Hence the current rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any dryness as I follow the application with a moisturizer.  That being said, I have extremely sensitive skin and have experienced no harsh reaction, no redness, no burning and no itching either.</li>
    <li> I received my product on time and I started using immediately.  I love it! my skin feels so smooth and refresh!&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I liked the follow-up emails on exactly how to apply the serum. I haven&#x27;t been using the product but a couple of days so can&#x27;t rate it----I gave you 4 stars for the great customer service. I will be purchasing again from OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing!  it arrived quickly and packaged well.  I&#x27;ve already received many compliments on the visible improvement in my skin, and in less than 30 days!!!  I sent bottles to my closest friends so we can all enjoy looking a bit younger.</li>
    <li> Came quickly - great ingredients and involved sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curler is really easy to use and has extra goodie for long life.  Vit C serum is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of the cleansing therapy for Acne.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked well in conjunction with other treatments such as Clearzine, and it is giving good results.</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle of this and really liked it, when I ran out I bought a different brand that stings a little when applied and that was all it did. Other than be very sticky. Didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The difference was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;This one leaves my skin smooth and silky, not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I could also see and feel a big improvement in clarity, pores were smaller. Gives a healthy glow and it&#x27;s safe to use&lt;br /&gt;around your eyes, less puffy in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this over and over, great product, and price as it last a long time even using it am and pm.&lt;br /&gt;At 58, I can really see an improvement! Don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but have a dull complexion, this makes the dull vanish!</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of conversation about the benefits of Vit C on your skin and the combination of Hyaluronic serum with it. So decided to look into it and decided it was worth trying and also decided to use as natural or organic as I could if available. Came across these products and was happy with the info on them. So tried both the Vit C and their Hyaluronic Serum. Have been using for about 10 days and am seeing both better clarity and firmness in my skin so far. Neither product are irritating to my skin or have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days.  Every time I use it, my skin is red and burning.  Also, my skin is flaky during the day after use.  I have tried only using it every other day,  but get the same results.  I usually don&#x27;t have problems with skin products and I am really disappointed that this product isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
    <li> Again have used several brands of Vitamin C this one has no effect like other brands. Would not buy this brand again for any of their products.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t tingle like the DeVita 17% vitamin C serum. I guess it&#x27;s hard to tell when you&#x27;re over 70 and live in a very dry climate. People think I look younger than I am. I used twice a day plus moisturizer. No miracles. Maybe I need to use longer--or just stop expecting miracles at my age. Maybe there was some improvement, just not significant.</li>
    <li> Amazing results with this product.  My skin looks fresher, tighter, more radiant.  Been only using a few weeks so I&#x27;m totally impressed.  I use twice a day, morning &amp; night.  No side effects, no rashes.  LOVEEEEEE this :o)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My skin feels smoother, my pores smaller and my dark spots have gotten lighter.  I don&#x27;t have the breakouts that I used to have and I used to have combination skin (drier around my mouth) and oiler on my forehead.  I feel like this product has balanced out my skin.  It makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> This makes your skin baby soft while eliminating fine lines. Every person I&#x27;ve bought this for can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Very good product! If you have oily skin like myself, It can be a haddle finding a moisturizer that will not clog your pores. After 6days of using this serum I see that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all and the bags underneath my eyes are a lot lighter. Would definetly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It basically feels like water.  There is virtually no depth of texture to the product.  Also, there is no smell.  I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> My skin has smoothened out and simply looks better in tone and hydration</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product, use it twice a day but didn&#x27;t see the different. I still try to finish the item till now let see what happen</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review, but I want everyone to know how awesome this product is. I suffer from MCTD and my face is always red. I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now and I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks. Its less red, smooth, and more even looking. My friends have noticed, my boss has noticed, and even my regulars (I&#x27;m a bartender) have noticed. 2 thumbs up from me. I&#x27;ll buy this product for life!</li>
    <li> I love it works great  best I tried thank you</li>
    <li> The lapis rings are attractive and nicely made.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money! Product has the consistency of water and not a serum! Used it for 1 week and it made my skin really dry!</li>
    <li> Its, ok! I dont see any real improvement in my skin....I have tried before Melora C10 and it was way better, in my skin.....will not recommend or buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Its like you are using pure aloe vera pure  in your skin.....its not grease, but it just dont make the job  that a vitamin c needs to make.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  I get tons of compliments on my skin. Combine with the OZ retinal moisturizer.  A+++.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!! My skin is brighter and my complexion is clearer after just two weeks! I am thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> I only write reviews if I am very compelled to do so – and this is one of those cases.  I didn’t know what to expect from this product and was fully prepared to get no results and ask myself why I fell for another scam product.  NOTE: I also read another review here that said the good reviews are due to people getting a free sample for writing one.  I did NOT get a free sample – I wish I did, but I paid for it, and now can say paid for it with no regrets.  No product will remove wrinkles or stop aging.  This product improved my skin – it looked healthier, more vibrant, and felt better to the touch.  Do all of these things make me look younger …  well, better skin makes me feel like it at least, and that is all that matters.  I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Serum and have seen a difference in the smoothness of my skin after only a couple days. My skin feels light and fresh after using it. I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum and I&#x27;m disappointed. What&#x27;s inside looks WATER and nothing else. I want my money back! This is deception, embezzlement is, is a crime!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best face serum, hands down. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of others, but with this one I could actually see a big difference in the visible reduction of uneven skin tone, wrinkles and significant gain in over all smoothness. I get compliments on my skin all the time, and I&#x27;m 58 years old!</li>
    <li> It is Ok as far as consistency of the product, very light and not oily or greasy. Does not leave a residue behind but doesnt seem to do amythign for dark spots or improvig skin texture. Will update if I see any difference.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this serum. It caused breakouts and I simply did not like it.</li>
    <li> Nice texture nice smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta admit I had my doubts about the claims for this stuff.  I already have pretty good skin and people are always telling me I look at least 15 years younger than my age.  And I was very satisfied with the stuff I was already using.  But it was the new year, so I thought I&#x27;d try something new.&lt;br /&gt;And WOW!  This really does make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed that my skin broke out a bit more, so I e-mailed the company about it.  They told me the product is non-comedogenic (doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs), and suggested that I be sure to exfoliate several times a week,  So I did, and now, after using it for about 6 weeks, I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin is.  I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles, but all the small bumps that I thought were just par for the course at my age have smoothed out AND my pores are so much smaller - AMAZING!  My skin looks fresh and young, and it even seems to have thickened a bit, in a good way.  The small blood vessels beneath the surface are less noticeable, and I feel as if there&#x27;s less sagging.  I don&#x27;t feel the need to wear foundation, and even seem to need les blush!  All in all, I&#x27;m a very happy camper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this and others I&#x27;ve tried. I think I got better results with cosmetic skin solutions and need to go back to their system and stop trying others. I had it right the first time around with them.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that my skin is very sensitive; I tend to break out with any new product, and I cannot use retinol (even Olay for sensitive skin). As a consequence, I tend to read all the reviews before I buy cosmetics. I am in my early fifties and have sunspots and freckles--redhead! I tried, first, Clinique even better dark spot corrector, with almost no results. Then a dermatology treatment with laser on some of the sunspots, twice. They certainly cleared up, but not disappeared, and each session costed $300, plus a little bit of pain and a week of marks on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this serum with skepticism. At least, I did not read much about causing irritation, which is good enough for me. I clean my face at night with Cetaphil and a facial sponge, then I use the serum (yes, only at night, in the morning I just use moisturizer with sunscreen and makeup). It feels like water and it dries almost immediately, leaving a thin film that you can notice, but is not uncomfortable nor leaves my skin dry. I do not use anything else on top, only my eye cream--I think I am going to switch to this brand and try the eye cream too, because the one I am using now, Oil of Olay, does nothing to the area. I am using it preventively, to avoid more wrinkles in future.&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks with this very simple regime, I can already notice a difference with the OZ serum! Amazing! I kept the Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Tracker (a piece of paper with color bands to let you see the exact color of your sunspots and keep track) and I check with an augmentation mirror. My sunspots are two or three tones clearer already. I do not expect them to disappear completely, but it certainly works and my skin looks more even in general. No irritation. I will continue using it and I encourage you to try. Worst case scenario, it won&#x27;t hurt and isn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a vitamin C serum before so I have nothing to compare it to but I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so and my skin looks and feels so much better! It absorbs quickly which I love and has even helped even out my skin a little! Will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a huge difference in using this product than I have with others but I thought I would try it. It isn&#x27;t bad, and I am sure it is good for the skin, just didn&#x27;t notice any major changes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this one at all. It said it was for sensitive skin. I used it every second day for nearly two weeks. I developed an itchy, burning rash. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin radiant!</li>
    <li> I had been desperately trying other serums for acne scars and dark spots. I had been using Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum to no avail. After using OZ Naturals for 3 days, I immediately noticed acne scars healing up, my skin was more plump, and spots getting lighter. They&#x27;re not fully recovered yet, but the rate of change and effect was much more noticeable than other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m now a huge fan of OZ Naturals and plan on purchasing more products.</li>
    <li> Me and my mother are fighting over this product it is that good!</li>
    <li> The new formula is thicker and dries my face, I feel it&#x27;s about to crack...What happened to the beautiful serum that this used to be? I&#x27;m really disappointed, especially since I ordered 3 bottles this time!</li>
    <li> Ordering my third bottle today.  I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;This works as an all in one for me.  I don&#x27;t use a toner&lt;br /&gt;or, moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use Peter Thomas Roth un-wrinkle peel pads, wait 6 minutes,&lt;br /&gt;wash with clean water, pat dry, then I apply the oz natural vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;serum.  I apply it generously as my skin drinks it in.</li>
    <li> I put this on my face before bedtime 2-3 times a week. I think it&#x27;s perhaps a little heavy to wear during the day, especially under additional sunscreen and makeup, but for the evening it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t need moisturizer, and I wake with soft skin.</li>
    <li> it is a great product considering the price</li>
    <li> I received this serum for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. This serum is very moisturizing and I like that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or sticky if I forget to put my moisturizer on after it dries. It soaks into my skin well, doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy or sticky and I never know that it was there. I also have sensitive skin so I like how this doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my skin, or cause it to break out in rashes or acne. This is important as I have used products that make my skin worse. I marked this down one star because other than being very moisturized I don&#x27;t see that it has made my skin any better in regards to wrinkles, skin tone, etc. I really like that it is organic and has a smaller list of ingredients than some of my other name brand products. I am trying very hard to switch over to more natural and less chemical filled products. I have been reading a lot about natural skincare and making your own products and I know the various ingredients are mostly what are listed in several homemade treatments I have been reading about. I like to be able to read the ingredients list and know what most of the things are.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels on my face, no ily residue!</li>
    <li> My skin has improved since using this product. I use a light moisturizer over it because it tightens the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day for about a week now and I love it. My skin is softer and clearer. Its not to watery which makes it fairly easy to apply and has no discernible scent. It dries out my skin some so I moisturize about 15 minutes after I apply this product to let it settle in. Also, I store this in the refrigerator to keep it from going bad. I received this on a discount for a review but all the comments and thoughts are my own.</li>
    <li> It was a good and solid vitamin c serum.  I can tell it&#x27;s good for my skin but I can be picky and didn&#x27;t notice anything outstanding to be honest.  But it felt good putting it on and would recommend trying it out.  Many seem to have great results and everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
    <li> Your skin needs vitamin C this is a great product.I always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> Great product, very good results</li>
    <li> Product works as expected</li>
    <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin! I love this product, and will be purchasing more. It&#x27;s light, not oily and heavy like other products.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of time and money.  It did absolutely nothing.  I&#x27;m guessing this company paid for good reviews to boost sales.</li>
    <li> I have been using the OZ Naturals for about 1.5 months. So far I have seen significant improvement on my face in terms of brightening. I bought this product right after getting sun burnt when surfing. I expected my skin to darken continuously for several days after being sun burnt and then eventually recover to a lighter color after a few weeks. OZ Naturals really worked miracles here. Within a week, I see my skin color go from reddish dark to slightly darker, and then back to almost as light as before I went surfing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my skin complexion has improved a lot, I haven&#x27;t seen much change in the brown spots on my cheeks.  They have been bothering me over the last 6 months. I found that in the customer reviews on this product some people mention this serum helped with their sun spots. So I was very excited to see the same miracle happen on me. Unfortunately, so far the brown spots on my face still look as prominent as before. Some people say it takes at least two months to see a difference. I went through almost a whole bottle in the past 1.5 months and just bought the second bottle. I&#x27;m still hopeful that the serum will help lighten the brown spots.</li>
    <li> best best best!!! I have been looking for a vitamin c that works for my dry skin... this has cleared up all dry patches.</li>
    <li> Made me break out a bit.</li>
    <li> I was dubious when I ordered this, and initially disappointed, because no change in my skin was immediately apparent. After about 2-3 weeks, however, I could see that my skin had improved DRAMATICALLY. My pores are smaller, the redness and little veins from my rosacea are gone, my coloring is even and my tone and skin quality is much improved. I am THRILLED with this product and will definitely not only be buying it for myself from now on, but as a gift for friends and family. I only wish I had before and after pics to share - as I am so happy with how my skin looks now. I use 5 drops every morning and every night after washing my face, then put on my moisturizer mixed with a few drops of 100% golden jojoba oil - my skin looks better than it did was I was in my teens and 20s.</li>
    <li> I liked this so much I ordered one for my daughter.  She says it is working well for her!</li>
    <li> Love it already. My skin felt better within 10minutes!</li>
    <li> This is just okay, however I haven&#x27;t used it on a daily basis. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was anything other than just plain ol&#x27; oil. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and noticeable reduction of &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Did not work as described</li>
    <li> I like this vitamin C serum a lot.  I have used the hyaluronic acid serum by Oz Naturals also, but wanted to add some Vitamin C into the mix also as I have dark age spots on my face.  They are fading!  I use the Vitamin C serum at night, and the hyaluronic acid serum during the day.  They are both good products and easy to get every last drop out of the bottle with the dropper.</li>
    <li> Growing up I&#x27;ve never had the problem of acne or face scarring and I&#x27;ve been self conscious lately because of all the acne and scars on my face. I keep on growing acne and without even touching or messing with them, the scars disappear, however, my skin is very sensitive so I scar. My acne medicine only prevents the pimples from growing and I didn&#x27;t know what to use externally to heal my skin faster. This product is amazing. I was skeptical at first because the reviews were really high and usually reviews are the employees who sell them comment. But Michelle Phan recommended it and I was definitely blow away by the miracles of this product! It has nourished my skin and healed it dramatically within the past 2 weeks. It&#x27;s unbelievable because my scars never seemed to fade away by just doing nothing and using this natural serum has made such a change. I&#x27;m very grateful and will recommend this product to any of my relatives and friends.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> A great product that visibly makes skin better. Mild formula despite being deemed an &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who is approaching their  30&#x27;s and wants to start some necessary &amp;#34;age maintenance&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After a long, long research (I am kind of person do big research for even small things), finally picked OZ naturals C serum.  Just started using from 10 days. Good serum. Can see little visible results. applying ever other day. Planning to give 1 to 2 months time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly i may add OZ naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum along with it to get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving 4 stars as its too early and Will keep update my reviews periodically</li>
    <li> So far so good, light weight and absorbs fast!  Too soon for results!</li>
    <li> great product.  works as advertised.  would order from again.</li>
    <li> Great product for problematic skin (I have acne, discoloration, and hyperpigmentation). I use it after toner and before moisturizer. The smell is not very pleasant (thus, minus one star). With serums less in more: I apply drops directly on my face, and then pat the solution gently on my face. The skin on my face looks brighter and smoother. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I kept getting what I thought was the ~AWESOME PEELING POWERS OF VITAMIN C~ on my face. Then one day, while at work, I barely grazed my chin with my finger and a finger-sized portion of moisturizer/serum just rolled up and fell off my face. What I thought was my skin flaking was actually this serum just SITTING on top of my skin and then flaking/rolling off, taking any and all moisture I put on afterward with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered why this serum was just sitting on my face, so I bought some pH strips and, sure enough, the pH of this serum is AT LEAST 9. Vitamin C serum needs to be at most 3.5 in order to penetrate the skin and do its job. This stuff creates a dried up mask on my face. No wonder my skin was so dry while using this.</li>
    <li> Love this product will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Just started using this about a week ago. It is a very thick consistency but sinks into the skin quickly. I do like using this so far.</li>
    <li> I use this with my prescription strength retinol, and oh boy do I see a difference! This Vit C not only nourishes skin, it help brighten, even out tone, you can feel it working. I will continue to buy thin and keep it part of my beauty regimen as I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and that is very important to me!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I really noticed a difference or not in skin appearance.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a vitamin C serum! I have used several in the past and know how powerful they are and how great they make your skin feel &amp; look. This product definitely does not contain any vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the highly rated reviews- it honestly did nothing except make my face feel like there was a film on it.  Dissapointing and after a month of use I see no difference in tone, color, or feel.</li>
    <li> best vitamin c I have used</li>
    <li> As part of my daily regime, it really works for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Love Love all the OZ serums as well as their moisturizer with retinol and their eye product. Beware there are competitors out there that have written false bad reviews on the OZ products just to make the product look bad. This product is great and really works.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I use this serum every day. Just a few drops will leave your skin smooth and soft. Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far so good  it does not look so dry as before&lt;br /&gt;Just order another bottle  this will be my third&lt;br /&gt;One.  I was interduced to this product by a close friend. It has done wonders for her, but she has been using it longer than  I have. So far so good</li>
    <li> Best, most instantly rejuvenated looking, mousturized feeling ever!</li>
    <li> I just started using this, and I like it so far. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, or my eyes (which a lot of products I tried do). This product does not feel sticky on the skin, I have oily skin, so I hate products that make my skin sticky or does not absorb well, this serum doesn&#x27;t have that. As far as the brightening effect, I don&#x27;t see any changes yet but I&#x27;m really hoping to see some change after some time of using this.</li>
    <li> I could immediately see the effect of this serum as of the first use. I apply in the evening after washing my face and before applying moisturizer. The 3rd day I woke up looking like I had gone on a long holiday and slept for days! My skin looks tighter, clearer and smoother - I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Thank you OZ for a wonderful C serum that truly delivers!</li>
    <li> I started trying this product a week ago thanks to a recommendation from a friend. After  a couple days I saw an improvement on my skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just received All of the OZ skincare products a few days ago, and from the very first application I could see a difference in my skin. My facial lines diminished and my skin seems to glow! I will never use another brand, and believe me I have tried numerous brands that say they deliver, but all have failed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and have noticed a brighter, more plumped-up complexion for my&lt;br /&gt;mature skin.  It is light in texture and does not have any unpleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product😊. Great results....I have yet to purchase ANY bad product from Oz Naturals!  Great Job Keep It Up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this serum I love it and I love the eye gel as well. Oz Naturals have some of the best skin care products I&#x27;ve used at reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> This thing dries on my face and is like a glue at your face and i dont undestand all this coments are fake ? .......</li>
    <li> I am on a second bottle of this serum and I like it</li>
    <li> I love this product it goes on every morning and night!! Wish they had a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months and months and Loved it!!! The bottle I just received id gel like and I am not a fan at all dries out skin and leaves a film. Unable to contact anyone by phone at OZ naturals. Very unhappy!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it does. I have been using it daily after I took my shower. But I don&#x27;t see any visible changes on my face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I&#x27;m a guy in his late twenties who will know be using using this daily are part of his morning routine.  I grew up with a severe case of acne and bear the scars from that period in my life.  Using this product has done wonders with making my skin appear smoother and giving it a much more natural glow.  It really gives me my best appearance throughout the day and it makes me more confident in the end.  I highly recommend using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a toner, followed by this, and finally a moisturizer every morning.  Definitely use this to look after your skin and to give yourself a more even complexion.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out. I was very excited about using it after reading all of the great reviews, but about 2 weeks into using it, I started getting very large pimples. It has literally been years since I&#x27;ve gotten pimples and the only thing that changed about my skin care routine was using this serum. I stopped using it and I haven&#x27;t gotten any more pimples, but am still waiting for the ones it caused to go away completely.</li>
    <li> Love it. My skin felt better after the first use. I won&#x27;t be with out it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed w/ this product.  It said it is 20% Vit C, but have used 10% Vit C with better results.  I can not see any improvements from using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for awhile, and I really don&#x27;t see any improvement.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;When you&#x27;re as old as I, my dear,...&amp;#34; use Oz Naturals. Youth becomes you!</li>
    <li> I chose this vitamin C serum after trying several others. Oz naturals has a slightly thicker consistency than another best selling, cheaper brand, on Amazon. This makes it easier to apply and it seems to last longer. It diminishes the look of fine lines on my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing... Transformed my skin. Goes on nicely following tonic. Will continue to use for years to come.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I uses this and we are both satisfied with the results. My daughter suffers from adult breakouts and since using this she&#x27;s had almost none.  We will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> My face became more dry than before</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Ladies forget all that expensive wrinkle creams, I&#x27;ve tried them all. And this is the best bang for your buck! Your skin will thank you! Several friends have commented on what great skin I have and I&#x27;ve passed on this secret. ALL have called to thank me as they love it too!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  I have noticed a change in my complexion. A must have now.</li>
    <li> Works as good as it can on 74 year old skin.  Dab it on quickly as it drys fast. I like it and will continue to purchase Oz products.</li>
    <li> I have just bought this OZ Naturals vitamin C serum from Amazon. I opened it today and it&#x27;s very dark orange and water like texture. Has it gone bad?? Plz let me know. I am very upset as it wasn&#x27;t cheap!! Can some one plz let me know if they had the same problem or was I just the unlucky one that ended up with oxidised serum in a brand new bottle.</li>
    <li> I have tried several serums and there is a reason why this one has so many positive reviews. The serum comes in a nice bottle with a dropper. It is easy to apply and feels light and fresh on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much so the bottle will last me for several months.  I have used this the past few days and can tell a difference in the texture of my skin. My makeup is going on much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product for my review :)</li>
    <li> Fragrance fee, easy to use product.  Nice packaging and quick shipping.  Hope it works!</li>
    <li> Came very quickly &amp; makes me feel so pampered and lovely! Great price for the quantity too! I just started using it so I haven&#x27;t seen visible results, but I can feel it working!!!</li>
    <li> Great customer service! And so far so good with this product. Serum seems to help skin look its best and takes very little to do so. Performance, value, great customer service.... Five very bright stars!</li>
    <li> I never used Vitamin C serum before, but I read about it in a magazine and decided to try it. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to take a chance and see if it works. Well, I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m amazed at how good my face looks. I am 49 and am amazed at how much smoother and brighter my skin is looking. I use it at night along with a moisturizer after applying the Vit. C serum, and I have to say, it seems to really be working.  I really bought it to try on my neck and chest as that&#x27;s the area that is starting to show my age, so far it seems to look a little less &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34;, but I&#x27;m hoping for even more improvement with time.&lt;br /&gt;It does make your skin a little red after applying so that&#x27;s why I use it at night, but by the morning, after my shower, it looks fine. My makeup goes on smoother and more even now. I am sold on it and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> Product took about a week to arrive, but while I waited I was contacted by OZ naturals and given more detailed information about my product and told how appreciative the company was of my purchase. An actual company representative wrote the email out to me specifically and told me that if I had any questions while I awaited the delivery of the product he would be more than happy to answer them. I sent an email to the representative and received a very prompt (within several hours of sending my email) and concise reply. All my questions were answered satisfactorily. I received my order via USPS and the product was appropriately sealed for my safety and in a cushioned bubble mailer. I used the product that night and I am hooked! The rep is right...a little bit goes a long way as in one drop covers some skin. The product is sold in an amber colored glass bottle with a rubber/glass dropper screw top. The product is like water and has no scent or color. I have super sensitive skin and after a week of using the product just at night no rashes, bumps, or itch. I have noticed a big difference in the overall smoothness and even tone of my face. I have wonderful dark spots and after one week they are significantly lighter which says a lot because my skin tone is clear so any blemish just glows brightly like a pink neon sign that says, &amp;#34; look at me!&amp;#34; I am not sure that my skin glows like some of the other reviews state??? Overall great service from the company and great product! Well worth $$$. Oh just got another email from OZ naturals following up with the receipt of the product and overall effectiveness so far. They really want satisfied customers.</li>
    <li> The trick to using this product is to apply it to damp skin. After cleansing with my Clairosonic, I mist my face &amp; neck with Evian spray. Then while my face is damp, I apply 6 drops to my face &amp; neck. Allow it to dry &amp; follow with sunscreen &amp; moisturizer. My skin texture has improved &amp; my hyperpigmentation has decreased. Excellent, reasonably priced product that I use twice daily.</li>
    <li> Phenoxyethanol can cause shut down of the central nervous system, vomiting and contact dermatitis -- a no go for me.</li>
    <li> Grest customer service and fast delivery. The company contacted to check on my purchase, which I appreciated.  really like the product so far, but it has only been a few weeks. I am hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I have only just begun to use this product, but like it so far.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and the providers were easy to deal with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m a bit confused. It says 20% vit c, but I&#x27;ve used many different vit c serums and they work much better then this one. I was hoping it was going to work better then my other because it claims to have higher amounts but it just didn&#x27;t work for me:(</li>
    <li> Serums are the flavor of the week - today&#x27;s headliner.  This is a good pre-moisturizer - use a few drops, smooth on quickly, and let it dry before doing anything else.  OZ provides extra hydration and healing for skin, smoothing and calming menopausal complexion flare-ups.  In summer, I suffered a large abrasion on my leg.  Once it healed, it didn&#x27;t seem to want to fade.  I didn&#x27;t want to be stuck with a port wine patch for the rest of my life, so I have applied OZ Vit C Serum every morning and night before applying a moisturizer.  This &#x27;boost&#x27; has significantly helped to fade this scar!  I have used the serum to help heal other scrapes, too, with similar success.</li>
    <li> for now I have not seen any changes and I doubt there will ever be.  But I will update my rating if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/07/2014 - I am halfway through the bottle and I added another star to this review.  The reason for this is due to the serum&#x27;s ability to tighten my skin for the whole day.  I have not seen any visible changes to my pores but something is making my facial skin a lot tighter when I apply the serum.  I have tried washing this with Tea tree oil and it makes my face tingle for a few seconds before it dissipate.</li>
    <li> Well. I have used many  vitamin c serum and I can tel when it oxidize but this is a good deal. Better than the mad hippies, the dr lewins n many others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this serum and haven&#x27;t seen too much difference yet but it definitely feels wonderful on my face and leaves it firm and smooth. I use it under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Hi - I have only used this for about 2 weeks - but I am loving the &amp;#34;tightness and smoothnes&amp;#34; that I feel after I put it on!  It also makes my pores appear much smaller!  The product is lightweight and easy to apply - not like some greasy creams, etc.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enought to see long term results - but it looks very very promising!</li>
    <li> It really seems to do as well a job as the higher price eye creams out there. I know for sure that it helps with the darkness under eyes and the age spots are by far diminished before using this bottle. The crows feet and under eye lines are still there but they do not seem as deep.&lt;br /&gt;I must like it because this is my 2nd bottle I am ordering and I am just now reviewing it because I wanted to wait to see if I really noticed any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I for sure noticed the difference within about a week with the age spots and my face definitely looks brighter. As for the lines they appear softer. I feel continued use of this product is beneficial and does not just sit on top of skin but actually penetrates and does it work.  Remember to follow up with a moisturizer after the application of Vitamin C Serum dries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only in my early 30&#x27;s, but I have started to see the effects of aging due to sun exposure. Lots of fine lines popping up on my face and ll around my eyes. For the last 9 months I have been using this product and I can say that this, combined with a retinal cream at night, has completely reversed my fine lines. I thought that once you had skin damage it couldn&#x27;t be reversed but you could prevent further damage. That is what I bought this for, prevention. But it has completely eliminated my fine lines. I didn&#x27;t think it would work that way, otherwise I would have taken before and after photos. This product is amazing, and I don&#x27;t go a day without using it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> A definite decrease in both forehead and neck wrinkles and a glow to the skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  Smoothed out my skin as nothing has done in the past.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with absolutely no expectations as I&#x27;ve learned that you usually end up being disappointed when you have high hopes for something.i didn&#x27;t think about it being the best reviewed serum too much cause what normally works for most doesn&#x27;t work for me. Imagine my excitement when I finally started noticing a difference in my skin after just two nights! I had been battling some terrible hormonal acne that I got prior to that time of the month and was left with lotsa red marks and inflammation.i would look at my face under a light and you could see the cystic acne underneath! I made sure I didnt use any other products and just wash with manuka honey + cinnamon everyday so that I could definitely know that it was the serum working. On day 2 my bumps were dramatically reduced and my marks had been starting to fade.now it has been exactly 7 days and I am completely clear of all bumps and new marks.the older marks have began to fade a bit but with continued use I know they&#x27;ll be completely gone.i just placed an order for 2 more bottles cause my skin could never be without this again!</li>
    <li> Expensive snake oil in nice bottles backed by Dr OZ name. After 30 days of daily use almost no changes. I still have a second bottle to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian</li>
    <li> Excellent. Placing next irder</li>
    <li> As a cosmetician I adore this product prior to put my Mage up. Non greasy and hydrated my skin daily. Good product!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use this as an anti-wrinkle cream and it works wonders as well as reduce my blemishes.</li>
    <li> I try not to post bad reviews if I really don&#x27;t have to. But honestly, this product has not done anything for my complexion. If anything, since I started using it, my skin is not as clear and not as light as it used to be. Now, that might be due to a variety of factors...BUT, you would think that when you buy a product you would expect either no change or some improvement right? Nope, not this one. I am skeptical for all products by Oz Naturals because of the way they obtain all these fabulous ratings. I would not trust the glowing reviews -- which are supposed to be unbiased and objective. Reviewers receive free products for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. And that is not unbiased.</li>
    <li> To soon to really say, but it has quality ingredients and some good reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum - no fragrance, made my skin radiant!</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is probably my favorite one that I have tried, and I have tried several.  What I love about this is that it&#x27;s perfectly clear and odorless.  So many formulas have an overwhelming orangey scent, but this one is totally neutral.  It&#x27;s watery and goes on smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tacky or sticky.  I let this soak in for about 20 minutes before I apply my other skin products, because I want my skin to get all the benefits it can from this little bottle of gold.  It&#x27;s expensive so I don&#x27;t use it all the time, I actually alternate with cheaper vitamin C serums, but when I want to treat myself I use this.</li>
    <li> A few months short of 41. People say I look 10 years younger than my age. After the first application, I can see the result. My skin seemed plumped up, smoother and the laughter line seems less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use olay serum daily and recently started using this before applying the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I switched to this from skinceuticals CE Ferrulic and I think this is just as good.</li>
    <li> Healed my blemishes instantly. I was looking for facial oils on Amazon after a bad breakout, and saw that this was a best-seller with reviews discussing healing properties. Usually acne will go away but there will be redness on my skin for 1-2 weeks after. I used this for 2 days and the redness was completely gone! I am so happy I discovered this serum!</li>
    <li> My face has always looked dull and tired, and that is probably due to a whole lot of things, and yes it shows.  I always put on a lot of makeup to hide my uneven skin tone, as well as my tired looking face.  After I received the OZ Naturals vitamin C serum, I was not sure if it would do anything or make any difference.  But I really wanted to try it because I am always desperate for even the slightest results.&lt;br /&gt;I cleansed my face and followed with the OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Tonic, and then I applied the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  I noticed that the serum was gliding on very smoothly, and my face did not sting at all.  That is usually a problem for me especially after cleansing and my face is usually &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34;.  I also noticed that my face felt a little tighter and firmer, and most importantly, brighter!  I had a very nice glow to my face, and my mom even noticed it!  I am very happy with the brighter looking skin that I have, and since I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now, I can&#x27;t wait to update my results once I see more results!</li>
    <li> Very watery and doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this serum it was kind of thick and didn&#x27;t apply easily but finished the bottle and noticed no difference in my skin.  I foolishly ordered a second bottle and the consistently was more like water and easy to apply and raised a definite red flag because of the two different serums.  I have faithfully tried the second bottle for several weeks and there is absolutely no difference, in fact, could use water and get the same results.  On my first order I just looked at the number of positive reviews; on the second bottle I actually started reading the negative reviews and found I wasn&#x27;t the only one who felt &amp;#34;hoodwinked.&amp;#34;  Try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Works as advertised.  Don&#x27;t make the mistake i did and try to save money by buying a cheaper brand.  I had cancer 1 year ago and a friend who had not seem me since before the cancer saw me at a store and the first thing she said was how good my skin looked. And i had no make up on.  That was a first for me.  Will always keep this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used both Obagi and OZ, this is very inferior to Obagi Vitamin C 20%.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I love how it feels on my skin. Not greasy or dry.</li>
    <li> Is there REALLY vitamin C in here?  There is no smell or taste of it.  I wonder if I&#x27;m just putting colored water on my face!  Haven&#x27;t seen much in the way of results, either.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have recently started showing signs of aging so when I was offered this to review I was excited. I&#x27;m glad I got an email on how to use this product since it was the first time I had tried something like this before. I followed the directions and I really like the results. My face now looks healthier and feels so much better. It did not break me out or burn my face which I was surprised since I have sensitive skin.  I will be recommending to others.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is wonderful... I love that the dropper dispenses the perfect amount of product on my face. The light citrus scent is awesome first thing in the morning. I usually layer this under my normal moisturizer, and it works really well in this capacity. Very happy to have been sent this product for review!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and no change.  Goes on smooth, and not sticky. I think I may return it!!</li>
    <li> I love how this serum absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have such an odd smell.</li>
    <li> Noticeably brighter skin. Helped with acne scars I&#x27;ve had for over ten years! I use it every other day or every few days :) would recommend and would repurchase!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I felt it going to work immediately.  I love the way it makes my skin feel!  I did also purchase the moisturizing cream along with it.  I felt both were a good buy for the money.  I will purchase these products again.</li>
    <li> Does not work... Just felt like water on my face....</li>
    <li> is burning my face but look clean</li>
    <li> This feels great on my skin! I can already see a difference in the evenness of my skin.</li>
    <li> 2 things that have helped my skin stay young and blemish-free are my Clarisonic Mia 2 and this Vitamin C Serum! It has helped brighten my skin as well. It does need to be followed by a facial lotion for moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand is such a good deal! I used to use Ole Henriksen&#x27;s truth serum, which is basically a vitamin C serum as well, and while it worked, it was too expensive to keep purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must-add to your facial routine if you&#x27;re looking to keep your skin looking bright and young!</li>
    <li> The ingredients listed on the bottle do not include vitamin E. I was hoping that it&#x27;d include Vitamin E, as listed on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Ad a drop to my face moisturizer daily and love the results.</li>
    <li> I can see improvement on my skin, great product and will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> Honestly expected much more out of this product since it was recommended by Michelle Phan. But it didn&#x27;t really make a difference to my skin after applying it daily for three weeks. Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t for me ...</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd bottle and i&#x27;m gonna stock up my supplies! It&#x27;s so affordable and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find this earlier! What will i do without this serum?! I love that it&#x27;s really light and it brightens up my face!</li>
    <li> Does not live up to its claims.  Brightens skin and softens it, but does not fade spots or diminish fine lines.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found something that is outstanding for my face, not destructive to my health, and that is very affordable. Prior to finding Oz Naturals, I was using a very good line purchased from a doctor,  but the cost was almost $400.00 for about a 3 month supply. Now, my face looks and feels wonderful and I&#x27;m not breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Ocean Mineral Tonic and the Ocean Mineral Facial Cleanser; the Sea Infused Moisturizer and Vit C Serum in the morning and Hyaluronic Acid and Super Youth Moisturizer at night. I also use the Amino Herbal Hydration mask at least once a week and the eye gel day and evening. People think that I am at least 15 years younger than I really am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you OZ Naturals for all of your great products.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I notice immediate results after applying it. Skin feels tighter and looks smooth and bright. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an OZ product. I was expecting really good results.  I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference in my skin and was dissappointed with this.  The consistency was more like water and no smell as I would expect from a C serum.  Not sure if I got a bad batch or if it&#x27;s just not what I expected.  Just hoping it was a bad bottle and it works for everyone else.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Very happy with this product.  In just a few days I can already tell a difference. My skin already feels smoother and more nourished.  Highly recommend this product.  This product was free for a review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far!  I like that it&#x27;s almost all natural ingredients.  The thick consistency works well with the dropper and also means you don&#x27;t need to use much.  It seems to be fragrance free which is nice and my skin feels great. It was packaged very nicely and has very clear instructions on how and when to use it.</li>
    <li> I was pleasant surprised that this is one product that actually works!  I was skeptical that anything could help me fade a brown spot on my face, but after using this product for 6 months, that is exactly what happened.  It isn&#x27;t totally gone, but it has gone from really noticeable from a distance and hard to cover with concealer, to barely noticeable and easily covered with concealer. I have also noticed a reduction in visible wrinkles.  Would definitely recommend this product!  Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now.  I was pleased with the first 2 bottles I purchased. The serum was fading my brown spot, and the small lines around my mouth were fading.  However, the last bottle I purchased was different.  It is severely drying my skin, to the point that I stopped using it. Maybe they changed their product? I bought a Vitamin C Serum from another company, and will try that one out to see if I have the same results.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I expected it to leave an oily feel. Instead it is very light and does not have an oily texture. It left my face feeling very smooth. My face also had a tight feel and look which I liked but does take a while to get used to. Though I have not tried it for very long it seems to be making my horrible sun spot lighten up. This did not affect makeup application and in fact seems to help keep the makeup stay on longer.&lt;br /&gt;  I got the product free for writing a review but I do plan on purchasing it once I run out!</li>
    <li> My story:  I am a  56 year old woman and I just lost 80 pounds rather quickly.  The skin sagging on my face was embarassing, but I didn&#x27;t care because I was so happy to be lean and trim!  I told my husband that I traded 80 pounds for 80 wrinkles.  The skin &amp;#34;draped&amp;#34; around my eyes and my mouth.  Then I ordered this Vitamin C serum.  Long story short - I love my skin - and my husband has started using my vitamin C serum too!  My 90 year old mother couldn&#x27;t quit complementing me on &amp;#34;my beautiful skin&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t tell you how tickled I am!  I just ordered a bottle for Momma and am ordering a second bottle for my hubby and me.  My 21-year old son said I look like a 23-year old!  (Okay, he may have been exaggerating, but there IS a really big difference!). I&#x27;ve never really had a skin care regimen, but I will always use this vitamin c serum twice a day.  It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
    <li> Burns my skin, even with continued use  dropper broke</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin since using the Vitamin C serum.  The serum has a tightness for a few minutes but then leaves your face smooth.  I will keep using this Vitamin Serum.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s perfect and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Works well, the difference is remarkable and I have just been using 2 weeks.  Fine lines are less noticeable and complexion appears brighter.</li>
    <li> I have just finished 1 bottle that I purchased a month and half ago. I used it once or twice daily. The customer service of OZ Naturals seems courteous that I received a thank-you email from them upon my order, which explained in detail how to use the product. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suggested direction is that you put it AFTER your toner. However, I after some uses, I found that the suggestion was NOT for everyone -  people with specific personal skincare routine will have to figure out themselves where in the course of the routine this product is to be incorporated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a thin serum that dries quickly within seconds of the application onto the skin. You don&#x27;t need to put it a lot but just make a thin sheet of this serum over the face and neck or wherever you would like. You put some drops in your palm and by using the fingertip of the other hand, tap it into the area of concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** The timing is important ***&lt;br /&gt;In my own experience, this product should be applied BEFORE the toner. I have my personal skincare routine for 15 years that consists of:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Booster 1 (liquid) - special \\&quot;booster\\&quot; skincare product that is best absorbed onto the clean skin before the toner&lt;br /&gt;(2) Toner (liquid) - to condition and prepare the skin for the next product&lt;br /&gt;(3) Booster 2 (semi-liquid) - another booster skincare that is a little thicker in consistency so that it is best applied after the toner has been applied to tighten the skin pore to prevent the moisturizer from clogging.&lt;br /&gt;(4) Moisturizer (cream) - to seal the skin with nourishing and moisturizing cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an ACID with hydrophilic Vitamin C and dries up your skin. I used to use it in the process (3), and even after the moisturizer, it dried my skin and made it feel very tight. After 2 weeks, I had this discomfort and no visible benefit on my skin despite that the review says that I should see some improvement in the skin after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I changed the order and use it in the process (1) - right after washing and towel-drying my face and BEFORE my toner. THIS WORKED. The acidic serum quickly gets absorbed into the skin and by the time I&#x27;m preparing the next toner, it&#x27;s dried, so the skin can receive the next liquid. The toner will help ease the dryness caused by the acidic serum and condition the skin for the next. With this order, I no longer felt any discomfort from drying and tightening sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the serum is applied in the very first step of the skincare routine, it gets absorbed completely before the toner tightens the pore and seal the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the next 2 weeks, I began seeing the visible sigh of skin improvement. The folds of the skin from the nose to the corners of the mouth have become less and less visible. The skin complexion has also improved by eliminating some small sun spots and evening out the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing 1 bottle which lasted about a month and half, I can say I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this product is an ACID so it is NOT very good idea to use after Derma Roller treatment as suggested by some websites/reviews. It will BURN your treated skin and make your face all red and swollen - not from the Derma Roller treatment but from the acid on the micro-injuries on the skin. The skin will return normal in 24 hours but not in 12 hours - so if you had a Derma Roller treatment at night and put this product to burn your face, you will have to go to work with red-angry-puffy face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather, I would recommend this product for just a regular daily skincare purpose.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice anything. maybe it works for other people? it didn&#x27;t for me. I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> Wow ! This is Awesome ! I am using the Serum for a one week and I noticed my skin is getting smoother and brighter ! I did order again although I have a sensitive skin but this product is just great !I am very pleased and happy of the result I am getting</li>
    <li> I have a very dry and itchy skin and I bought this product to improve the redness and itching of my face. It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks of daily use and I can tell its already working. Its not a miracle but my skin feels a lot more smother and some of the itching is gone. I still need to see if this product will help get ride of my problem but so far, I like very much the results. .</li>
    <li> I bought this as I had been searching for a serum with high levels of Vitamin C,E and Hyaluronic Acid, and after seeing the many positive reviews I decided to try this. I have used similar products before and they know that serums should not be the consistency of water. If this product did have the ingredient quantities listed, it would be thicker, moisturizing and not the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the ingredients would be moisturizing to the skin, but rather this makes my skin incredibly dry and tight, which would be understandable if this product has retinol, yet it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, upon researching, one will notice many of the product reviewers have reviewed the same exact products as the other reviewers...meaning one must question who these reviews are and where all of the positive reviews are coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the product is being returned and I will only be buying beauty supplies from non-online retailers, albeit a bit more costly, at least you are guaranteed a real product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a week since someone suggested I use a vitamin c serum in addition to my skin care routine. So far I am very pleased with this product. I noticed my skin looked brighter immediately. i use this nightly after washing my face. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure its a fake.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C has done nothing for my skin. I do not notice any difference except in my checking account.  Another gimmick</li>
    <li> This seems like just pure water, made absolute no difference on my skin. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product! I am 53 post menopausal and my skin was not looking great. Dull, sagging, red spider veins, and of course fines lines. I had always had good skin, but menopause trashed it. One week into using thing product my skin is bright glowing and has a youthful firmness. The red spider veins are 60% gone. For reference, I have fair, sensitive, thin irish skin and my skin loves this stuff. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have only been using the serum for a couple of weeks and I am seeing results.  Not dramatic results, but slow and steady results. I was pleased with how quickly the product was sent and also for the customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  not greasy, skins feels super hydrated immediately, no color, no scent, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. My skin seems softer and smoother since I&#x27;ve started using it.  It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product recently and love it! Have used other vitamin c serums and found that this product is so much better. It only requires a small amount and the results are noticeable. It gives my face a nice glow and lightens the dark pigmentation. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this product does not work. I have followed directions for a month and do not see anything different.</li>
    <li> After 3 days of Best Vitamin C Serum my brown spots started fading and skin seems brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a skin care fanatic and have used other products and this has worked the best.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before ordering this product but decided to take a chance after&lt;br /&gt;reading its reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to work.  I did notice an improvement in my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;The initial improvement happened very quickly and the&lt;br /&gt;subsequent results have been slower but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product and will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;The initial bottle is going to last me a long time.  Will order&lt;br /&gt;it again when re-supply is needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Oz Naturals.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> It works well with me, first week I can feel less wrinkles around my eyelids.Thanks for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS laguna woods CA</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing and looks amazing after I started using this. The color is even all around my face, the texture is better and it made my skin look younger and fresher. I love this serum</li>
    <li> love this serum..... not as pricey as some of the other clean ingredient serums...... love this serum..... not as pricey as some of the other clean ingredient serums......</li>
    <li> I like that the fine lines around my eyes are noticeably diminished and my face feels firmer after only two weeks.  I am experimenting with how much to use each time I use it, which is morning and night. I have found 6 drops works prefect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I studied prices  and quantity of other similar products and comparatively speaking this product was the best bargain for the money. This is the first and only Hyaluronic product I have ever used so to the best of my knowledge, I believe the quality of the product is excellent. I would and will recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every day since I received it (about 2 weeks) and it instantly cleared any acne that I had. I have not noticed a change in my hyperpigmentation just yet, but I am still excited for long term use of this product.</li>
    <li> I can tell right away that my 61-yr old face is more vibrant after using this as directed. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Ive only had this product for less than a week but so far I like it.  I think I can notice a little clarity and smoothness.</li>
    <li> I received the product and began using it immediately. While it&#x27;s only been a little over a week, the product appears to be working as described. My skin feels much tighter and not dried out despite the crazy cold weather. I guess only time will tell, but today I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Package arrived promptly and well-packed.  No problems whatsoever.  I apply the serum twice a day and feel that my skin is soaking up its cosmetic benefits.  It feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Product.&lt;br /&gt;good seller.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very charming but thats about it, this is not at all what was posted when purchased very misleading did nothing for my skin and was a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real results and have been using it faithfully for months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 2 months now, right now at my second bottle. I use it twice a day prior to applying moisturizer, I definitely saw the difference--skin got more radiance! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I was excited to try this serum, its actually really good. I love that it is all natural and organic and that it has been working. It takes a week or two to see any results but it does work well, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> very watery.... makes me question how well it works. I still use it once a day, but can&#x27;t say i&#x27;ve seen a difference. it doesn&#x27;t make skin feel softer like some other Vitamin C serums i&#x27;ve used have. but it also doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse or cause any problems. It really feels like i&#x27;m  putting water on my face...</li>
    <li> Recd timely. Have not noticed much difference since I started using this. I probably will not order it again for that reason.</li>
    <li> This little bottle will give you that beautiful youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in the sixties, and asked her to only use this product besides her nightly facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first two weeks she started to some improvement on the fine line and wrinkles. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had a fuller youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit was her completion, which had a more uniform appearance. She would also use fade cream, but not anymore. Also, her skin looked fuller, which is hard to achieve as your skin losses elasticity with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this serum. This is coming from a woman that has been using “St. Ives”, since I was a kid. Now this one bottle has replaced many of her other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> I got this along with the Vitamin Code, I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I think my face is starting to look better.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it after cleaning my face and under moisturizer. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.  I used this after I use my derma roller...It is a glass dropper for the applicator so it is a bit tricky applying it directly to my face but I just tilt my head back and squeeze a small drop on one area at at time and rub in immediately!  Doing it one at a time assures that it does not run down or drip off.</li>
    <li> Second bottle. Will continue to use this product&lt;br /&gt;Have had several co-workers compliment me on my skin</li>
    <li> Still using and hoping for the miracle with the combination of hyaloronic acid .</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
    <li> We have spent a LOT OF MONEY on skincare over the decades....LOT$!!  Make no mistake, OZ Naturals is one of the most effective products on the market.  If only we had known about them sooner!  From Oil of Olay to Nerium ($$$$$) OZ products has them matched or beat.  My wife has VERY sensitive skin. She was afraid of the Vitamin C Serum. Now she tells all her friends about it!  She is phasing out her Mary Kay products &amp; replacing them with OZ Naturals!  I too have used skin care products since my teens.  People constantly have me prove my age by showing my driver&#x27;s license because they do not believe me when I tell them how old I am.  They generally peg me for at least 20 years younger than my actual age.  So I owe my youthful looks to a lifetime of careful skincare, but at a considerable expense.  If only OZ had been around back then. Oh well...I&#x27;m glad they are here now!!  I am replacing my Neutrogena products with OZ.  Great stuff, great performance, great price!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Will continue to use !</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this serum.  I now use it every other day as I found every day to be too drying.  I experimented last week by not using at all, and I noticed my skin was starting to look a bit drab.  I am happily back on this wonder serum.</li>
    <li> Made my skin break out like crazy.  People were asking me what is wrong with me.  My skin isn&#x27;t normally that way. Had to quit using it.</li>
    <li> I love everything I have tried from the oz line.  They respond very quickly if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;Joyce</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (provided to me for review) for a couple of weeks. Do I see miraculous changes? No. Did I expect to see such? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My approach to skincare is rather scattershot, perhaps because there is no known science here, only marketing claims; I&#x27;m not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on fanciful advertising, nor am I willing to experiment with potentially toxic chemicals. So, I aim for products that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t contain chemicals considered hazardous or unhealthful on the  Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database (Yes, I know it&#x27;s not the last word on certain ingredients, but for now it&#x27;s the best I have)&lt;br /&gt;2. Do contain ingredients that make some bit of scientific sense (such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. Feel good on the skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Have no annoying odors&lt;br /&gt;5. Are easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;6. At least fool me into seeing some benefit on my inevitably aging skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received three OZ Naturals products for trial, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with all three: this Vitamin C serum, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and the Hyaluronic acid. (Of the three, the eye gel is my least favorite, but only because I prefer an eye cream; this gel dries quickly and feels very dry. Maybe it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but for those who are looking for more moisture, this might not fit the bill.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the four-star rating, I give most \\&quot;skin-care\\&quot; product four stars simply because it&#x27;s difficult to know if it&#x27;s actually \\&quot;working.\\&quot; I did not knock off a star due to any features of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I apply it every morning to my little-bit-older face before the moisturizer and the sunscreen and my face is soft and I have no way to know for sure, but I believe it&#x27;s holding back the wrinkles. Every little bit helps.</li>
    <li> It works fine. Not really impressed</li>
    <li> Still using this. Haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet. Maybe it&#x27;s too early.</li>
    <li> Works for me by reducing age spots.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product long enough to see results or give it a proper rating.</li>
    <li> I love natural products and was excited to use this serum. It is 98% natural and even has organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing with the OZ Naturals Cleanser, I applied this before moisturizing. It has a watery feel to is and is clear. It went over my skin with ease and absorbed really quickly. I didn&#x27;t experience any stickiness or odd feelings with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few months my skin became so much brighter and even. Old scarring from past acne began to fade. My skin looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with this serum!</li>
    <li> This leaves my face feeling super silky. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and definitely feel like my skin has been better. I have some dark spots I&#x27;m hoping to fade, but that could take months, so I&#x27;m ready to be patient!</li>
    <li> It may be my imagination but I believe this has really improved my skin appearance in tightness and moisturizing.  I recommend you give it a try if you have somewhat aging skin,</li>
    <li> I swear this product works! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but had to with this one. It brightened  and lighten my skin. And after about  1 ½ months using this product day and night my skin was glowing. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Noticeably smoother skin after a couple of weeks.  Will continue to use this product as it improved my complexion.</li>
    <li> Excellent as expected</li>
    <li> This is a real testimony in terms of no one asking me to write it. I get compliments all day long about how radiant my skin looks! They keep asking me what am I doing that makes my skin look brighter? It&#x27;s the effects of this serum. I have only used it for one week and while I can not see the difference, others are complimenting me on how great my skin looks. Also, prior to receiving the serum, I received a customer service email to share with me how to use the product. I highly recommend this product. And if it matters to anyone, I am an African American female in my late, late, late 50&#x27;s, and my skin is dark brown with gold high-lites. I am thrilled with this product and will purchase it again as well as recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is THE most amazing product that rewards you with results more than any other beauty product I&#x27;ve used in my 50+ years. As a retired Stylist, I&#x27;ve  tried more than I can count until the bottles are empty, lastly using Murad for ten yrs.&lt;br /&gt;I apply in the morning under make up and at night. I also apply on the back of my hands under moisturizer. My hands look 10 years younger, my face firmer and dare I say less wrinkled? The bottle is only half gone and results like this? Patience pays off. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this! My skin looks fresh and is tight! My mom bought me my first bottle and now I am buying my own! I use in the morning and night! You only need a little bit, so be careful about applying more can come out if you are not careful! But otherwise it feels light and fresh on face and there is not a weird smell! Love the way my skin looks and feels after I use this! Started noticing results within a week to 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s Review: Very pleased with the results of this serum.  I use it every night and follow it with Clinique redness solutions moisturizer.  The combination of these two products have made my skin smoother and I have more even pigmentation.  Also, I use it in conjuction with the derma roller every three weeks.  I have seen a major difference in my skin and am very grateful I found this product.  I gave it 4 stars only because the lid won&#x27;t screw all the way down and the product was leaking when it arrived.  It took about 2 weeks for me to notice results but they were worth the wait and I continue to see improvements every week.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45, and I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A off and on since I was in my late teens.  I had cystic acne, and this was one of the available treatments at the time.  An incredibly pale Scots redhead with rosacea, I don&#x27;t wear sunscreen because I have chemical sensitivities. Over time, I had developed blotchiness, small pimples, and visible irritation that Retin-A seemed to make worse.  I also have broken capillaries from the rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had basically stopped using Retin-A Micro cream regularly because of the peeling, blotchiness, and acne. Adding this serum to my daytime routine made me not hate Retin-A.  If I use this with Retin-A (the Retin-A at night, and the C-Serum during the day), my skin is clearer, less blotchy, and has fewer breakouts.  The addition of the C-serum even seems to reduce the appearance of the smaller broken capillaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that this is drying.  I use both the Retin-A and Vitamin C serum for three or four days, and then take a day or two off. As long as you can give it a short rest, the combination works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fine lines seem to be getting lighter, and my neck looks firmer, even with only a few week&#x27;s use.  If you&#x27;ve given up on Retin-A, this can really help.</li>
    <li> Very effective. produced a noticeable difference in about a week. Very happy with this stuff and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Not the type of Vitamin C you want! After not being terribly satisfied with the results of this serum I did some further, very extensive, research regarding Vitamin C serum for the face. As a result I discovered that the Vitamin C \\&quot;Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate\\&quot; contained in this product is not the best for your face. I switched to what I have found is a MUCH BETTER product for me.     I&#x27;m using ADVANCED SKIN CARE Vitamin C Serum. It contains 20% Vitamin C+e, Ferulic Acid &amp; Hyaluronic Acid.     The Vitamin C in ADVANCED SKIN CARE is \\&quot;L Ascorbic Acid\\&quot; which is what you want, AA is the water soluble, biologically active form of vitamin C found in nature. AA is the form the body uses to build skin, repair wounds, and protects the skin from disease and disorders. Watch out for Vitamin C in other forms such as \\&quot;Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate\\&quot;, as OZ Naturals contains.</li>
    <li> Satisfied customer. Thanks!</li>
    <li> great product! use with mt roller and am loving it!</li>
    <li> Great product, high quality, fast delivery!! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it does not work as well as the obagi c serum I&#x27;ve used for years. I&#x27;ve actually broken out more and have not seen any improvement with my dark spots. 😔</li>
    <li> L.O.V.E.!&lt;br /&gt;love this product. I can see improvement on my skin when I wake up the next day morning.&lt;br /&gt;The product is in oil/liquid form but it won&#x27;t leave the skin feeling sticky one bit!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but this hasn&#x27;t break me out yet and I don&#x27;t see any reason why it&#x27;d break me out in the future</li>
    <li> Have bought this product for years and have liked it very much. I got used to a texture on my skin as it dries. The last batch feels different. When it dries on my face, it leaves me with stiff/stretched sensation on the skin... like if it is not the same product... :-(</li>
    <li> Being that most of us use a cleanser, eat healthy- or not…it&#x27;s hard to say if the results positive or not are a direct result of the product, however,&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good product…perhaps not enough vitamin C serum in it because there are other things as well in the mix.</li>
    <li> No real difference still using rest of product</li>
    <li> Yup, I think i look better.  Put it under whatever else</li>
    <li> I was so skeptical of this, but I can&#x27;t deny it: Within a week of using this (after washing with African black soap and toning with lavender Witch Hazel), I was doing double-takes in the mirror. I just couldn&#x27;t get over how good my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have great skin already... so I wasn&#x27;t expecting this. I was thinking maybe it&#x27;d do something about the fine lines around my eyes, in a few weeks&#x27; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got? Something eye-catching that I can&#x27;t pinpoint. It must be that &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; thing people keep talking about. Every time I looked in the mirror, I&#x27;d have to look longer than usual as I tried to figure out why my skin looked so captivating. Again, can&#x27;t pinpoint anything -- no spots or wrinkles or patchiness to alleviate -- but I found myself looking over my face and going, &amp;#34;Um... wow.&amp;#34; I stopped for a few days, and the mysterious fairy glamour effect faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to look surprisingly and mysteriously radiant, I guess buy this! I&#x27;m still confused. But happy. Very happy.</li>
    <li> It can visibly lighten my sun-burnt spot on my cheek after I used it for one week. And it can even tone of my face.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very light. I am a normal or combination. I need a moisturizer after that.&lt;br /&gt;It works. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I used half the bottle and did not notice any difference in my skin.  I guess I was expecting more because of all the great reviews, but for me nothing special at all.</li>
    <li> It feels very good on my skin and I feel it working!</li>
    <li> The key ingredients in OZ Naturals&#x27; Anti-Aging Serum are vitamin C, an amino blend, and hyaluronic acid. According to my research:&lt;br /&gt;* Studies have found Vitamin C to be most effective in protecting against damage induced by UV light and also effective in the treatment of photodamage and/or skin wrinkling.&lt;br /&gt;* Amino acids are important to skin health, repairing and generating new cells, and stimulating the buildup of collagen. If you are deficient in these amino acids, your skin will not be able to retain water and may lose its elasticity and show signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;* Hyaluronic acid helps the cells in your skin absorb and retain moisture. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biopolymer naturally occurring is the skin and other tissues. Babies have a high level of HA (hence that soft, supple skin!) and as we age, we have less and less (hence the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C + Amino Blend + Hyaluronic Acid Professional Anti-Aging Serum is my favorite OZ Naturals product. I like that is made in the USA, 98% natural, and 72% organic. I also like that it comes in a dark bottle with a dropper lid for easy dispensing and application. It is somewhat thick, but goes on smoothly and does not leave my skin feeling sticky or tight like some other serums I tried did. This was my first OZ Naturals product that I tried, and I truly saw a difference in my skin after a few months of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who frequently breaks out from skin care products, I was pleased to find that I experienced no breakouts from OZ Naturals&#x27; Vitamin C + Amino Blend + Hyaluronic Acid Professional Anti-Aging Serum. Yet perhaps the best testament to this product (and the other OZ Naturals products I have been using--please see my other reviews if you are interested) came just a few days ago, when someone asked me, \\&quot;What have you been using on your skin? Your face looks fantastic!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is a truly incredible skin care product and vitamin C serum. I have very bad acne and sensitive skin and within a week I could see a drastic difference in my skin. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about how much I love this product! No other skin care product has ever worked so well! I would recommend this product to everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Goes on smoothly and leaves my skin silky soft. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This I love, my neck doesn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; anymore.</li>
    <li> In the few days that I have now been using this product I am very pleased with the effects it has on my skin, it feels healthier and smoother than it would usually be after my daily routine,it is safe to say that this is definitely going to be a great addition to my routine, especially with such fast results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also read an in depth review of this product on my blog &amp;#34;lucycles.blogspot.com&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recently read that Vitamin C might be the most important thing you can put on your skin, so I looked around the internet for products containing it.  Came across Oz&#x27;s serum and decided to go for it.  First of all, the product arrived within 24 hours not the advertised 48.  Secondly, I saw a difference in my skin tone almost immediately (am using it with Oz&#x27;s Super Youth moisturizer).  I gave my products to my daughter, who&#x27;s had adult acne problems for years, and she loves them.  I re-ordered another set for myself.  The entire experience has been extremely positive.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my skin especially my eyes.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great shipping speed! Still can&#x27;t tell if I see a difference or not.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing the intended results?  I would not recommend nor purchase again.</li>
    <li> I noticed little difference in my skins appearance. This serum is odorless and very thin. At times, while putting it on, it seemed as though I was just putting water on my face, rather than serum.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  My dry skin is still dry, even though I used this in combination with their face wash and moisturizer.  I wanted to return all the products, but had exceeded the return limit by three days.  I should have listened to all the reviews saying not to believe the fake reviews where people were given a free sample for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.  I will never fall for that again.  Shame on OZ Naturals to being deceitful.</li>
    <li> This product does not work....I can not wait to get my full vitamin C serum today!!! With phloretin CF!!</li>
    <li> This the best oz naturals I ever used.. It make my face look so clear and spotless.I would recommend this product to everyone. It is so good. .. It is the best product.</li>
    <li> Effective and gentle. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the HA serum and am going to buy it again, which to me is the true test. I try many things but only repeat buy a few. I use it in the morning and at bedtime, it seems to work well with the HA serum, is unscented and does not irritate my eyes - both of these things are huge to me as I am sensitive to strong perfumy smells and have year-round allergies. The combination of C, HA, and moisturizer really softens lines around the corners of my eyes which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day, every day. It&#x27;s so simple. I wash with a natural gylcolic face cleanser first, and after patting my face dry, I immediately apply the serum. Follow that right up with a moisturizer and I&#x27;m done! I noticed dramatic results after about 3 or 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is WAY smoother, and now after like, the 3rd week, the fine lines (that were, quite frankly, scaring me!) are diminishing!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is--if your skin feels too tight when using this--you&#x27;ll want to apply more moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, best Vitamin C Serum. I give it an easy 5-star recommendation!</li>
    <li> Was pleasantly surprised at the good feeling, and easy to use before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This product got top marks from me because it works well, but also for good ingredients and price/quality index.&lt;br /&gt;Nice follow-up with instructions from Mr Romero.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I noticed a improvement right away; my face has a overall smoother appearance. This product did not irritate my sensitive skin. I used a moisturizer after applying. Speedy shipping from the company!</li>
    <li> Wonderful customer service and super fast shipping. This is a very high quality product for an incredible price! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I am one to be very skeptical of skin care products- I WANT them to work, but not very often do I look in the mirror and SEE that they are working.  In this case, I am still hesitant to say it&#x27;s making huge changes in my skin- and yet, I do feel like I look more vibrant and less tired?  SO... maybe.  But even better, the customer service is amazing.  I am a HUGE fan of a company that over-delivers, and this is that type of company. They have emailed me to check in, emailed me on how to use the product.  What&#x27;s not to love?  In a nutshell- it&#x27;s affordable, it may work, and the support is awesome.  Nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I live in Chicago and constantly battling peeling and dry skin for 9 months of the year.  This has really helped.  It&#x27;s not magic but I can definitely tell a major improvement.  As a side bonus, the blackheads and pores on my nose and definitely improved.  Plus their customer service was very proactive and great.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I understand that cosmetic products work differently on people, and I do not like what it does to my skin. This product completely dries my skin. Even though I have been giving it a try for a couple of weeks, this product leaves my face feeling like cardboard. I have used vitamin C serum for a couple of years now and every other product that I have tried leave the skin completely hydrated, feeling rejuvenated. This product is the complete opposite. It is awful and it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Turning 55 I am sick of looking like an old bag.  I don&#x27;t feel like one... so I bought this stuff thinking yeah, right, lets see if it&#x27;s any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... it&#x27;s so good I will hide this secret from my friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried many serums over the past 20+ years and this one is the best  by far.  This is my second time ordering this product and it will be a part of my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this c&amp;e serum for about 5 months now and it seems to have brightened my face a good deal. I have gotten compliments and people question me about why I look so young lately!  I use it on my face, neck, chest and hands and then add moisturizer or sunscreen. It lasts me about 1 month.</li>
    <li> I WAS ABOUT TO BUY THIS FOR MOTHER AS A PRESENT AND LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.. I SAW THE AWESOME RATING ON THE PRODUCT AND THEY ALMOST GOT ME UNTIL I NOTICES THAT, ITS NOT POSSIBLE MATHEMATICALLY SPEAKING THAT  EVERY DAY THIS PRODUCT WAS GIVEN BETWEEN 2 REVIEWS TO 10 REVIEWS PER DAY WITHOUT MISSING DAYS OR WEEKS IN BETWEEN IMPOSSIBLE. \\&quot;AVERAGE REVIEW ON THIS PRODUCT 4 REVIEWS PER DAY\\&quot; NUMBERS DON&#x27;T LIE PEOPLE DO!!</li>
    <li> Very good, has improved my skin. Some of the small wrinkles under my eyes have disappeared. My skin is softer and dry patches on my chin has improved.  I take a lot of supplements and the Phyto-Ceramides is the only thing that has shone quick results.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope to receive a free bottle of PHYTO-CERAMIDES&lt;br /&gt;THANKS, ANA</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I am 56 with both wrinkles and acne, and this seems to keep both at bay.  This is my third refill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this face serum.  I use it morning and night.  Goes on nice and smooth and absorbs very fast.</li>
    <li> I love it! The essence smells good and especially his smell lingers. I believe a lot in aromatherapy so: a few drops on the cushions, ybeds, etc</li>
    <li> The serum makes my face feel amazing.  Definitely makes brown spots go away.  This has become one of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> Not sold on this project after one month. I was excited to find and read about all the great reviews so I ordered. I&#x27;m still waiting to see results and I hope that will come.</li>
    <li> I use it as night serum. When I waked up in the morning, I found my skin is firming and the acne scar became lighter.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is not greasy, easy to absorb. My skin instantly feels tighter and fresher. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Works just as good if not better than the expensive dept. store serums.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrated and kept my skin moist and allowed my make-up to stay on&lt;br /&gt;without peeling.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to eliminate wrinkles.  I am very happy with this product. My skin looks better now.</li>
    <li> This is some amazing stuff.  I noticed improvement in overall skin appearance in just one application.  Pores were diminished after one weeks use and I have received compliments from coworkers about looking fresh and healthy. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using this Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;m not expecting miracles.  But I am very happy with the results I see so far.  Being in my 60&#x27;s I deal with not only aging and wrinkles but a lifetime of acne scars and large pores.  There is a noticeable smoothing of all these negatives, exceeding my expectations.  My skin feels smoother and less oily which is very good for me. It seems the large pores are diminished and the odd colorations are slowly minimizing.  The seller has been very good about following up - being sure that I am satisfied with my serum as well as that it was received on time and in good condition.  It arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied so far.  I confidently recommend this product based on what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.</li>
    <li> This serum has my skin looking better than before, but it is definitely not a face lift in a bottle. I guess I was hopeful and had magical thinking but the results don&#x27;t come near my expectations. That being said, I think for a serum,. it is doing a really good job. My skin is soft and the wrinkles are less obvious than they were. I am probably judging this too harshly, because a serum isn&#x27;t a face lift. It will definitely improve the quality of your skin. It&#x27;s easy to use and comfortable as well. Be sure to follow up with a good moisturizer. I use Jason Age Renewal vit E moisturizing creme.</li>
    <li> If it works do not change it.  Tried a similar product that works and changed it for this one to see.  This one does not do what it calms to do.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Made my skin smoother and definitely made the small lines around my eyes fade. Thank you!!! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> i AM 72 years old and I thought I would see some nice results after using this product, but i haven&#x27;t . Perhaps its my age and it takes more time to see results I dont know, but i will continue to use the bottle but Im sorry at this time I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product or purchase it again. I am not saying it is not a good product but it is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love they way my skin looks using this. Highly recommend. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin... Never burns or irritates or breaks me out. Delivers in a huge way. I am a professional model and a makeup artist for film and T.V. and have been in the industry most of my life. I&#x27;ve used many beauty products and attest to the quality of this, especially for the price! It&#x27;s a must have for my skin care regimen! LOVE</li>
    <li> I researched many different Vitamin C products out there before choosing this one.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this serum and my experience with the OZ Naturals customer service....will definitely try more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to prevent or help with aging skin( I am 41).  I could see a difference overnight in the clarity of my skin and my pore sizes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I do not see any change for the good or bad with my face. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of this.</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to its claims. After a month of using it exactly according to directions, it did not leave my skin either &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;more youthful looking&amp;#34;.  I wish there were a zero star rating.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radiant &amp; More Youthful Looking By Neutralizing Free</li>
    <li> I received the product and it makes excellent work . I have been using it for 4 days but I think I feel results</li>
    <li> Nice smell, and make my skin feel fresh and smooth...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any changes on my skin at all. However I have kept using it just in case it takes longer to see any results.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t been use very long to see any effect , so far so good</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this because amazon decided they would increase the cost of the normal serum I get, so the price sounded great, but I saw not great improvements with my skin. Unfortunately you get what you pay for! :(</li>
    <li> Perfect for the eye and lip areas. Great product, great price and fast service. I will most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and my skin is starting to really look great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Girlfriend loved it.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum. It leaves my skin wonderfully smooth and hydrated without being overly oily. It helps smooth the fine lines around my eyes too. I notice a sheen and smoothness after using only a few days, thats why I keep using and buy it again.  The ingredient list is impressive, and the price does not break the bank. The entire OZ naturals skin care line is very affordable and really works.  The expensive $60. face products? No thanks, I&#x27;m over it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and have received many compliments about the smoothness of my skin. It works. I&#x27;m 56 with adult acne and combination skin and dark spots from the sun. This is a great serum for the cost.</li>
    <li> This serum is great, easy to apply and does what it said it would do for your face. Has not caused any adverse reaction to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin looks amazing after only about 3 weeks of use.  I am going to reorder in the very near&lt;br /&gt;future.</li>
    <li> Good quality ingredients and it leaves my skin very smooth!</li>
    <li> Very  Best Vitamin C Serum!  This is the third brand I have tried and it out weighs all of the other brands including Skinceuticals.  I love this and cant wait for the Retin A Moisturizer to come out.</li>
    <li> Excellant value and great product.  comparable to $100 serums</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better! I use this in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid serum and Retinol moisturizer and everyone has been telling me lately how great my skin looks. As a forty something woman who is getting self conscious about her aging skin. I am loving the comments!! OZ Naturals has been a gem of a find for me. No adjustment period for my skin at all, it just works. I hated my old night cream, it was sticky and I felt like I had to not roll around in bed or it would come off on my pillow case. This combination soaks in quickly and feels like satin. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I instantly fell in love with this serum. It is ultra smooth, absorbs immediately, and is the perfect base layer for my moisturizer. It also is free of any strange fragrances that I&#x27;ve experienced with other vitamin C serums.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Within a few weeks I saw a noticeable improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m 60 years old and have tried just about everything at a very higher price. I will continue to use this product Indefinitely.</li>
    <li> This serum delivers! Radiant, glowing skin that is moisturised and smoothed out. I noticed the difference it made in litrally days. Would&#x27;nt want to be without it now.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as advertised. Working great so far. I noticed a small amount goes a long way.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product.  This serum reduces my fine lines and plumps my skin with light moisture.  My skin can&#x27;t imagine using another product.</li>
    <li> I love all the OZ Naturals products!  I switched from a  high end brand and I am more please with the results of Oz Natural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum and their other products.  My skin looks noticably smoother and feels fantastic.  I am actually excited to use my Oz Natural products everyday!</li>
    <li> I can see my acne scars fading from this stuff, makes me quite happy. The combo of what&#x27;s in the bottle is great for the skin!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever.  Too many people skip &amp;#34;nutrition for your skin&amp;#34;.  If you want glowing skin, this is the product for you.  Use it with other Oz Naturals skin products to maximize the results.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This serum made a big difference in my face, almost from day one.  Face felt tighter and skin was definitely smoother.  I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> Affordable, easy to use and effective!</li>
    <li> I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;The only I&#x27;m not sure if I feel 20% Vit.C in a serum. Feels like pure hyaluronic acid serum.&lt;br /&gt;Good to use before moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I stopped using the OZ serum thinking I could find something l like better...well I am back.  I could really see a difference in my skin  after stopped.  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> This stuff is basically water and doesn appear to have any active ingredients. The seal was broken and I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> Got my Vitamin Serum a few months ago. I live in high desert climate so sun damage and dry ski are an issue. I&#x27;m seeing a improvement in my 44yo skin. Looks bright and tighter!</li>
    <li> Just love how this goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and seems to be helping my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any effects from this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months.  Might be better for someone that wants to PREVENT wrinkles, but not for someone who has wrinkles.  For me it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big change. The smoothness is much better.</li>
    <li> This product is organic and made in the USA. which matters to me.  The product is light, non-greasy and appears to improve my skin tone &amp; texture.  The pricing is superior to other Vitamin C serums although it&#x27;s only 20% Vitamin C.  It works as well as the 100% Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this after reading such rave reviews. I saw nor felt any change at all in my skin. Plus, after only a few uses, it was half gone. It&#x27;s a small amount of product that doesn&#x27;t work for a big price.</li>
    <li> Love.....does not sting, sinks in immediately, can use over my entire face.  Hoping to see improvements in skin texture....will definitely  keep using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3-4 weeks. While ingredients are great for the most part and I don&#x27;t see any negative effects, I am not sure if I see any positive impact either. May be I should give it another 4 weeks to see any difference...&lt;br /&gt;Also keep in mind that the form of vitamin C being used in this serum is Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate which is a derivative of Vitamin C. I have done some research and it seems that pure L-Ascorbic Acid at low pH levels (up to 3.5) would be preferable for the skin to ensure better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I will continue using it and will revisit my review in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. S. I really like OZ Naturals Vitamin C cleanser and Retinol cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little over 3 weeks and can&#x27;t tell any difference. It was basically a waste of money. I certainly won&#x27;t reorder any.  :(</li>
    <li> It certainly does great things for your skin. My mother enlightened me about vitamin C serums that are traditionally super expensive.  You can&#x27;t beat the price here.  I use it every night after I wash my face / before I sleep, followed by a moisturizer. I have very sensitive, yet oily skin.  I would recommend staying away from the eyes because it did cause the area under/around my eyes to dry out and react strangely.  Nevertheless, it makes the rest of my face / neck feel great.  If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend applying it carefully to avoid the eye area.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this Vitamin C for about a week.  I am using it a s directed every morning.  It feel great going on and dries quickly so that I can put on other products on.  I will use it for a month every day and see if the product works as directed. I am very anxious for a month to go by, but I don&#x27;t know if this is attributed to the vitamin C but I am 80 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 65.  I do take good care of my  skin but maybe it is the vitamin C.  Barbara</li>
    <li> Just started using Vitamin C in the am daily. It&#x27;s been 2 wks and my skin is more even in color and glowing.  Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> worked great and cleared skin and evened out pores as well as evened out fine lines</li>
    <li> This is my second order and I really like it.  I can see a difference in my skin and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice. I&#x27;m also having dermabrasion so it seems to compliment well with that procedure. Would recommend the product. Great price..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> I have def seen results and my skin looks much brighter, i would highly recommend this product. Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Marcy Kimball</li>
    <li> Minimal results.  It must take a long time to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks but I&#x27;ve noticed my skin much brighter.  It doesn&#x27;t sting or dry out my face.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing even better results as I keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice, though it seemed to have less effect after first 2 weeks</li>
    <li> It goes on nice and light and can be worn under moisturizer and make up.  I noticed after 5 days, my skin feeling smoother.  The price was right since I received it at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> I use it as a facial treatment  It applies easily and feels good on the skin.  I would order it again</li>
    <li> I am not sure why I chose this particular serum but, it must have had something to do with the fact that it has &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; in the title. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know the true benefits and I doubt I would purchase a second bottle. I have had no bad results but, I am a true skeptic who needs to feel impressed with some part of a product very quickly. I like that they make it fresh. That is a big plus. There is no seal on their bottles and that is very unsettling to me and many others I know. This is 2013 and they make it themselves. They need to fix that issue quick , fast and in a hurry in my opinion. Other than that, the product itself is VERY thin and runny. I hate that. So much is wasted trying to just get it applied where it needs to go. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor which is good. It in fact doesn&#x27;t make my face feel like anything at all. Not smoother. Not tighter. Just ? IDK insignificant impression. I bought it so I will probably finish this one bottle. If I used this at all it would be along with something else but, it just doesn&#x27;t impress me enough to stand alone. I do feel it probably has good vitamins in it and if they made it thick enough to apply better and added something that would give you a tightening sensation at least right after you applied it then people might even get over the fact that the bottle is unsealed. I am not sure what else to say. I used it with the Microneedle Derma Roller 1.5mm depth (OMG, love that thing !) and if I am not going to get any feeling from the product with holes in my face then I imagine I would like it even less with just freshly washed pores. I have been 100% honest and I not being compensated in any way by the company or anyone else  so these are just my personal opinions for whatever they are worth.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product...love it, love it, love it!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great and i have received lots of compliments after just a few weeks of using.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in the size of my pores, they look much smaller. My face has a much softer feel to it and I have noticed a minimization of lines on my forehead. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Oz Vitamin C serum is awesome...wonderful results!</li>
    <li> Within 3 weeks of using this (once every night), my face is brighter, my dark spots have lightened significantly and my face seem \\&quot;lifted\\&quot;. Will try some other brand to see any difference.</li>
    <li> I am redy to buy my next bottle  the product is fabuloso</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My face looks younger, my skin holds the moisturizer better, and I glow!  I will keep using this indefinitely!!</li>
    <li> first time to use VC serum and I love it soooooooo much</li>
    <li> I have spent a fortune on face products over the years..including Skincueticals two times at a hefty price! Found OZ Naturals on Amazon, and ordered it just 2 weeks ago, and really love the way it makes my skin look &amp; feel immediately after applying on face &amp; neck. Hoping it helps my over exposed face to the harsh desert sun &amp; dryness. The price is super attractive too! Thanks OZ Naturals for making an affordable product(s).</li>
    <li> This is indeed one of the finest Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve ever found, besides the fact that it has a whopping amount of hyaluronic acid which will invariably induce a better complexion.  I&#x27;ll always rely on this serum after cleansing and before applying a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This serum really does what it says it does, my face is more firmer and smoother, it&#x27;s not too sticky or nothing.Will be ordering another one soon. I really like there whole line and how it&#x27;s plant base.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Vitamin C Serum.  In fact, it inspired me to not only write OZ naturals seeking out a full product line, but send it to my mom and several friends!  Many thanks to the friend who turned me on to it and gave me his extra jar so I could see for myself the amazing results it reaps!  Thank you, OZ NATURALS!!! Well done!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum - fine lines are definitely reduced!</li>
    <li> Been using for over a year. I am almost 65 years old. I use it Every day and love the results.  I am into products that don&#x27;t have a lot of junk in them, as to why I love the product. Most people remark that I do not look my age. So I know the product helps. My skin is never dry and I have good color . I love the product!!!!! Will continue to keep using. Price is good too!</li>
    <li> I started using OZ Naturals Vitamin C and find it just instantly dissolves on my skin. I&#x27;m 61 years young and have always taken very good care of my skin, and have been wanting to add a Vitamin C to my regimen. After  long research, I decided on the OZ Naturals for my trial run, and will be staying with this brand as the results are minimum at this point, and at my age, don&#x27;t expect overnight results, but have found a difference in my skin and a light sheen to it. My lines are decreasing and thats a plus. Everyone will get different results, thats natural...I will stay with it.</li>
    <li> Best vitamin C serum I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday morning and it gives a natural glow with instant plumping up go the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for one month, I noticed my skin tone has enhanced and the glow started appearing. I feel like I already took a few years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product, will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this serum. My skin is much firmer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin feels and looks so much healthier after just a month! Will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My friend gave it me as a gift for my Birthday a week ago and already seeing great improvement in the look and texture of my skin. 😊</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week.  It with a few other oz products my skin has been getting clearer and less dry.&lt;br /&gt;When applying it soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a product on my face.</li>
    <li> I am a 60 yr old male. Spent lots of time outdoors enjoying the sun, working construction, etc. My brothers have all had bouts with skin cancer so I am now quite aware of the possibilities. For the last few years I have been using OZ vitamin C serum in hopes of warding off the possible effects of the sun. While I am still cancer free, I have noticed, and so has my girlfriend nd family, how smooth my skin has become. I swear it has even helped tighten up the skn around my eyes and under my neck. So, I have recommended it to many friends and family. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My skin is brighter...and younger looking...I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I Love this! It&#x27;s the best under eye serum I&#x27;ve ever used. A noticeable difference within the first week of using it. Good job OZ naturals!</li>
    <li> Great results in just one month!</li>
    <li> I used two bottles of this but I did not see much difference</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have tried a lot of vitamin c serums that were much more expensive and they didn&#x27;t compare! I have been using OZ Naturals for about 2 years now and continue to be impressed. I have also tried their eye serum and retinol cream and both are just as fantastic as the c serum!</li>
    <li> Have tried many expensive products and this is not only a great price it,s the best of what I have used . Great product and great price, win for me and my wallet.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the different.  Don&#x27;t work for my brown spot</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum is wonderful on the skin and I am beginning to see many of my wrinkles disappearing and I only used it 2 weeks. I did use vitamin C years ago but at $150.00 a bottle I just couldn&#x27;t continue. This product performs like the one I used at a great price. I will be a return customer.</li>
    <li> Is this water?! Not effective</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;OZ Naturals\\&quot; serum is claimed to be \\&quot;a high quality neutralizer of free radicals, an anti-aging gel which helps to stimulate the formation of collagen, which is vital to fight the effects of aging.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though skeptical at first at whether such a product could really do that, I was very happy and surprised to find that it really does seem to! The results would have been unbelievable had I not seen it work for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first application, my skin seemed to gain a special radiance, and as time passed, the skin around my eyes, and on my face and throat, became smoother and softer as it actually seemed to fill out slightly and repair itself to give a younger look. The wrinkles that had begun to concern me have simply gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this remarkable product accomplishes this using natural, vegan ingredients, which have not been tested on animals. That is very important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delicate, cool gel feels good when you rub it on, and goes on cleanly. It causes no sense of irritation, no trace of an allergic reaction, nor any other unpleasant sign. It dries and seems to absorb quickly, to create these remarkable effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tiny amount is sufficient to generously coat the face and throat. The small bottle is well made, durable, in a no-muss no-fuss style, and the product is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this find, I have switched away from the other product I used for years. I am very glad to have discovered this line of products, which combines high quality, and high ethics, in that their excellent beauty items have not involved the suffering of animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go OZ Naturals! I highly recommend this product, and feel that the company&#x27;s other products are likely exceptional too.</li>
    <li> The 20% serum is too potent for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many creams, lotions, anti aging serums and could never really tell if I was using them or not.  This is the first beauty product I&#x27;ve bought that I&#x27;ve actually seen results.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this organic vit. c!  This is my first time using OZ products and I am loving all of them!!</li>
    <li> Although it didn&#x27;t work for me, my daughter loves it.  She stated that it helped her with her hyper-pigmentation, I did notice a difference myself as the dark skin on her cheeks started to lighten up.</li>
    <li> It looks really lovely over makeup. I don&#x27;t know how strong its anti-aging effects are, mainly because I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet.</li>
    <li> Really helps with aging skin, excellent results</li>
    <li> We need a minus score for some products and this should be included in that list. The FTC and the FDA shou bring lawsuits against any company that it implies it can work to magically correct seversl problems at the same time. If it were possible, I&#x27;d give this a minus 5 Star rating. But, that&#x27;s my view.</li>
    <li> this serum really makes my face glow and its soft and it looks and feels a lot younger I will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> This is another great product from OZ Naturals to help make your skin look younger.  This will help brighten your skin.  It left my skin feeling and looking softer and smoother.  This is also created to help lighten dark spots.  It is created to help even your skin tone and texture.  This product contains 20% Vitamin C.  It also has aminos and hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free sample provided for a blog review</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I recomend every woman to buy it</li>
    <li> It is my third bottle.........&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stick to this one after I noticed the line on my forehead reduced after one bottle.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews during my search for a good vit c  product to use for my face I ended up with this product based on people&#x27;s reviews, but I am totally disappointed because i didn&#x27;t see any change but rather the product&lt;br /&gt;darkened  my face.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly. Makes my face glow. Really like this product.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use sunscreen and still have the dark spots on the left side (driver&#x27;s side) of my face.  this keeps them in check</li>
    <li> As with everything else I&#x27;ve tried from this company, this is such a great product! I always use either this serum or the serum with the green and white label before I put on moisturizer. I have never had any irritation, it just makes my skin smoother and also helps keep acne away. It&#x27;s very light yet powerful and doesn&#x27;t contain irritating fragrance.</li>
    <li> This little serum has really done WONDERS for my skin. Evened out my skin tone, helped with my acne and fine lines. Thank you again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing- it has helped my skin so much. I lead an active lifestyle and this serum has helped my skin radiate and stay hydrated even on days when I am in and out of a chlorinated swimming pool. Its thin and glides on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. I wear it alone on no-fuss days, and under my foundation when I apply makeup. Its vitamins for your skin!!</li>
    <li> I have had no reactions, my skin feels great and i will continue to use this product and recommend it to others. Thanks</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t live without this! i am on my 3rd bottle and my friends and family can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made to my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!!!! I&#x27;ve ordered another few bottles as a presents to my family!</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for about 6 months and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s the first serum I&#x27;ve used that makes a noticeable&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this product for a week! My skin looks smoother and has less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week now and am wearing less makeup and seeing results!!!!❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Almost immediate results for a smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I love these products! Use several of them and ally friends say I look fabulous. I have recommended them over and over again.</li>
    <li> Over the past year or so Ive heard how effective Vitamin C serum is for your face. I tried many products from skin care sold at walgreens to highend products. and NONE of them compared to Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum. After just a few uses i noticed a difference in dimished fine lines, dark spots and all over skin tone. Since then Ive started to use other Oz Naturals products and im so thrilled with all of them, especially because i finally found a skincare line that i love. and the fact i can pronounce and know the natural ingredients that go into making these products is the cherry on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE YOU !!!</li>
    <li> This gives my skin a nice glow!  Helps firm the skin on my neck which I need.</li>
    <li> Very nice product that leaves my skin feeling very supple.</li>
    <li> It really very good product</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It is high quality and it makes my skin look beautiful.  I recommend this serum and my skin is really sensitive and finicky.</li>
    <li> Great  product, I like it</li>
    <li> This serum is extremely drying on the face, even with a moisturizer over it.  It probably would good for oily skin.  I now use a Vitamin C serum I make myself with vitamin C powder and distilled water that I got the recipe for off the internet.  Not much in it but does the job and not so drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I viewed other buyers review to purchase and I have no regrets whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Vitamin C serum for the first time and after about two weeks using it AM and PM, I definitely noticed the change in my skin. The wrinkles slowly started to disappear and my face was a lot smoother and fresh looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Vitamin C Serum almost 30 days ago.  It took a few days before I received it, and I started using it right away.  After the weather exposure from this past year, my skin needed some help.  And this was the magic bullet for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am well past 50 years old.  This serum actually seemed to plump the wrinkle areas.  Try it for yourself and be surprised.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I will review later.</li>
    <li> I like this serum, I like that it absorbes in your skin so that if you want to apply anything else on your face you can once it dries.  I just received it a few days ago so I only used it about 3 to 4 days, its too early to say how it really works but I will give it a few weeks and write another review. Until then.</li>
    <li> First let me say that you can&#x27;t believe everything you read especially reviews made by people who were given the product for free. Second, I purchased this product. At first I was a skeptic, thinking that I had just wasted my money but it made me a believer...this product works... It took a few weeks before I noticed the fading of the brown spots on my face..and then my skin actually got qbrighter. Ha! Who knew... I ordered my second bottle... It&#x27;s true, you don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars to look like a million bucks! This bottle works!</li>
    <li> Amazed at the improvement in my skin almost immediately! I have extremely sensitive skin and this has not caused me any problems at all. I am a convert! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love, love how this Vit. C serum feels on my face.  I can definitely tell the difference after using it more than a week!</li>
    <li> I love this C Serum on my second bottle</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this was comparable to Obaji Medical Vitamin C 20%.  Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t feel like much is happening on my face.  I notice a slight tightening, but I&#x27;m not even sure that is from this product (could be my cleanser.)  Also, it is clear and only has a mild taste.  I think it is mostly water. It was worth a try, but I&#x27;m not buying this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum and received it 2 days later.  I have been using it as per the instructions on the bottle and so far I am very pleased with it.  A little really does go a long way and I like the feel of my skin after applying it and my lotion.  I have been trying to pay close attention to my face and do see a tiny bit of difference.  I am looking forward to seeing what my skin will look like after a few months of using this product.  I would and probably will purchase this again and would also recommend it to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed the serum, but have found there are others I like better .. seems the hyaluronic acid doesn&#x27;t have enough of a kick in it. so that makes me wonder about the Vitamin C as well.</li>
    <li> The serum was delivered in a timely manner. I have used it a couple of times already. I am anxious to see the results of using the serum for anti-aging purposes.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this I&#x27;m aging and I have been lookin for something to smooth out the wrinkles . I have very sensitive skin and it made me breakout bad. The price and product was to good to be true. I will stick to my highly effective vit c more money but get what u pay for. Thanku anyway</li>
    <li> This review is being written in exchange&lt;br /&gt;For a discount on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. Goes on very smooth, not greasy at all, and the skin on my face has never felt so smooth and soft! I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
    <li> I use it for a month and didi not see any effect on my skin at all! DO NOT waste your money!!</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping my wrinkles, but, only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin. Just about every product out there leaves my skin dry and red, but this serum is great. It feels cool and works really well. It gives my skin a nice glow. I even emailed OZ naturals with questions about the purity levels of the MSM used in their product and Craig got right back to me with the entire spec sheet. I&#x27;m really impressed with the customer service. I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but this one was worth it!</li>
    <li> I use this under my moisturizer in the morning and the evening. My skin feels great only after using this product for a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for 2 months. For the first 3 weeks I didn&#x27;t think it was really working for my dark spots. So I started using it on and off when I remembered. However, a little under 2 weeks ago I started applying it twice a day. This stuff works! I am African American and have had these very old dark marks for 2 yrs now, from repeat pimples in the same areas of my cheeks. My left cheek is pretty much completely faded. The right is almost clear, but that is where the majority of the hyperpigmentation was... I&#x27;m kind of amazed that I don&#x27;t have to apply foundation, just a light concealer over the remaining dark areas. Those spots are only slightly darker than my skin now, not super dark like before. My skin is glowing now.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for over 2 weeks now and i love it! It helped to really even out my skin tone</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have reorder it again you makes my skin feel so fresh and young also for preventative Application I have 29 and I feel like if I could be using this product is going to make a huge difference because I can see the difference just when I put it out a few minutes later</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Makes your skin ~5% smoother when applied daily&lt;br /&gt;2. No smell, easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;3. Dropper is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;4. Dark bottle makes me feel better and less concerned if light will destroy the vitamin c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. No mixable with other oils. Warning, this is a water based solution, so it isn&#x27;t mixable with other oils. If you use rosehip oil, jojoba oil, etc, you must keep the oils separate from the serum. Either first apply the serum and then the oil or vice verce. I tried to mix the liquids together in hopes that it&#x27;ll naturally blend together, but it separated. As a result, my oil went rancid quicker than expected and I had to through the bottle away.&lt;br /&gt;2. Pricy for the amount of solution provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous experience: emu oil, rosehip oil, jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;Usage time: 1 year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by Jerry S.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT FEELS SIMPLY WONDERFUL WHEN APPLIED - TOO SOON TO NOTICE ANY POSITIVE CHANGES.  I&#x27;M&lt;br /&gt;SURE IT WILL BE FINE.</li>
    <li> It cause dryness of my facial skin :(</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using but 2 days so can&#x27;t really give it a rating.</li>
    <li> havent used it for long, so cant rate its effectiveness,&lt;br /&gt;but it was shipped quickly and had no problems at all</li>
    <li> Tried this Vit C serum, and I have nothing but good things to say! The best thing is how after using AM and PM for 3 weeks my sun damaged dark spots no longer peek through my makeup in the afternoon! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and seems to make my skin glow!  Love it!  Highly recommend using day and night under moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It came on time,as they had promised and after using it for just a few days my husband told me that I looked younger and my skin looked brighter. and I myself feel some positive changes in my skin too. So I decided to continue using this serum.</li>
    <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product. Not sure what ingredient it was that made my face go red</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum (one in the morning, and one at night), and I love them both.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away. Even thought I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time my skin seems softer.</li>
    <li> Great product! Skin feels smooth and soft and I notice a more even skin tone and reduction in fine lines.</li>
    <li> This serum is great for the eye area and fine lines.  Very good purchase!  I will use this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Well secret flawless is the best I ve ever used can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere&lt;br /&gt;and the c serum is wonderful was looking for something to clean out pores so far good.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to leave feedback until it was time to re order if I was going to reorder.  Just have to say this stuff is amazing.  I started using 3 weeks ago and someone ask me yesterday what I was using on my face,neck and chest. He yes he said my skin looks,so young. I can also see the difference. My skin feels soft and tight. Not a bad tight a good tight. The dark circle under my eyes are gone. All this in 3 weeks. It says to only use once a day. I use in the morning before makeup and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> I still use it now, my skin feels good.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well so far</li>
    <li> I like how it smooths the skin on my face. Very good product!!</li>
    <li> This did not do what it advertised to do. It was like putting water on your face with no results.  I bought the Reviva brand hydraulonic serum and it worked great.  It may have worked for others since there are so many positive posts but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> OZ NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE CRUELTY FREE !  It is working!  I saw a difference the first day. My overall discoloration is improving. Those super dark large spots are taking some time  as they would with any product, but you could see some fade right away. I skipped 2 days and they got noticeably darker again.  Also, must use sun screen or they get darker  right away if you are at the beach in the sun. Skin also feels tighter and smooth. This is working better for me than the expensive Peter Thomas Roth version which did nothing but dry my skin out!</li>
    <li> Use sparingly.  Can be irritant if apply too much.  But does produce results.</li>
    <li> I love vit C!!!! I got this product 3 days ago and I love it my skin looking nice and soft I Love It❤️</li>
    <li> The product is worthless and if it contains vitamin c I would be amazed.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, since it&#x27;s natural, but breaks me out.  Even makes my hands itchy...where I resorted to using it so as to not waste money.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month. Has no smell so not sure what I have in the bottle. Seems to gently tighten my skin. I use it under an anti ageing lotion. Been on it for only about 1 month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over 3 weeks and I cannot see any changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> Second week and no results yet.</li>
    <li> OMG!, so happy I purchased this serum I see a great difference in the youth and health of my skin and makes me look years younger, a gentleman hit on me the other day, he was in his early 40&#x27;s, and when I told him how old I am, he stated &amp;#34;Wow, I was thinking you were way younger than that! So the proof is certainly in the product and I will certainly keep using, since this is my first time trying the product, the results are amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased three OZ naturals products: this one, the retinol moisturizer, and Hyaluronic Acid serum and started using all at the same time. I don&#x27;t know which one works more than the other, but in concert (which is recommended), they work fantastic! It seems to smooth and even out the texture, tone, and consistent pigment of my skin. I don&#x27;t have any actual wrinkles, although I do have minor fine lines and expression lines.  It made the former less noticeable, although the latter--hmm, dunno if anything can be done about them (I am thin and have little subcutaneous fat, and in addition the years--and decreasing collagen--are catching up to me). :-(  Again, I cannot definitively say if THIS serum is doing all that or if it is more of a concerted effort, but whatever it is, it WORKS!  **UPDATE** It helps shrink basal cell tumors--yes I know it sounds crazy.  I went to the skin cancer doctor and she pointed out that a spot on the back of my neck (which is hard to see without a mirror) &amp;#34;looks like a basal cell cancer&amp;#34;.  She wanted to take it off, but because it was likely not a deadly type of cancer she said that it was okay to wait two months and if it grew in size, she recommended having it removed.  My mindset about medical care is that a healthy lifestyle and diet is your first line of defense, meaning physical therapy, conditioning, diet, supplements, and what is used on your skin.  To me, if that fails, that is when medical intervention is necessary.  So I went home to keep an eye on the spot.  It started to look bigger, so I scheduled the appointment.  In between making the appointment and going to it (they were booked up), I thought I might try using this, since it is so good for your skin, and Vitamin C has a lot of antioxidants.  So I got a waterproof bandaid, soaked the pad in the Vitamin C serum, and put it on the suspicious-looking spot.  I left it on there for two weeks, and when I took it off, it was remarkably smaller in size.  So I canceled myappointment and put on another waterproof bandaid soaked in the Vitamin C Serum.  After another week, it was hardly noticeable.  It hasn&#x27;t completely gone away yet, but the results are very very noticeable! I will update later.  ****UPDATE 11/22/2015**** I have been very satisfied with this product for some time, but my most recent shipment was very runny, not thick like it usually is. So I ordered again; same consistency. Apparently they changed their formulation. I can&#x27;t yet say if this changes the product&#x27;s effectiveness, but it is harder to apply. :-(</li>
    <li> I dont like it....I bought this product 1 week ago for my dark spots and it made my skin really plastic feeling. I am in my 20&#x27;s and I did not have a good experience but everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to rate this, didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
    <li> Using it for over a month, loving it!  Can be drying, so use a lot of moisturizer after it dries, or skip a day here and there. Skin is smoother, feels tighter. Wrinkles look the same, but overall texture and tone have improved.</li>
    <li> I have used vit C serum for years, so I can&#x27;t be fooled by fraudulent products. This was basically a bottle of water. I accidentally got a dropper full in my eye, which should have burned.....Nothing..Bc it&#x27;s water. Very disappointed. I truly don&#x27;t understand all the rave reviews??</li>
    <li> Received as described.... Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C serum I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used the best.  In my late 50&#x27;s with good skin thanks to genes and lifelong excellent skincare regimens but have some annoying dark spots, some lines, red marks (broken blood vessels) and some unevenness of complexion (fair skinned, natural blonde).  Within a month the dark spots are completely gone, the red marks greatly diminished, and my lines and few wrinkles barely noticeable.  This stuff is miraculous!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, it&#x27;s a really good formula that allows me to apply with control. Some oils I feel are watered down, but this is the good stuff! I put this on my face because I have a little Rosacea, and any other blemishes and bad skin areas, dry spots, etc.</li>
    <li> It is working for my face!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any diference</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum. Light and non-oily.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin at all. Been using for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love it...I really see the difference after one month of use.</li>
    <li> I like that this is pure vitamin e oil, with no additives. The dropper top also makes it easy to apply and not make a mess. Im not sure yet if it&#x27;s making a difference with my skin, but definitely no negative effectives.</li>
    <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn when I put it on.  My skin appears smoother and more even.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I gave this produce 5 stars because it arrived fast, the company emailed with reinforced instructions and best of all, it is reducing my fine lines and wrinkles.  My face feels smoother and my skin tone is more consistent.  I was hoping for miracles but didn&#x27;t get that.  I still have plenty of wrinkles around my eyes but they are definitely improved.  I&#x27;m starting my 2nd bottle and will keep using this produce for a long time.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product.  The serum is very light and absorbs quickly.  I use this morning and night and have noticed that my skin glows.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my skin feel. I think my face is losing the dull look and having a brighter look. I&#x27;ll have to use it longer to give a better evaluation. Will give you another review when it has been a month.</li>
    <li> leave my skin pretty soft , you can feel the difference after the first week you use the product...is really good</li>
    <li> Not often that a visible difference in skin comes with a topical product, but this one works to condition skin and to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. And, Oz follows up with detailed instructions and customer satisfaction surveys--they care about their product! All natural, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I tried Obagi, n many other brands, not good as Oz naturals Vitamin C Serum, its amazing, my skin has become smooth ,soft and wrinkle lines are diminishing , honestly ,no one will regret using this product ,its worth the quality and price</li>
    <li> This is the first Vitamin C serum I have used so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands. It&#x27;s a clear liquid thin like water. It goes on very smooth. A little goes a long way. It feels watery on the skin and dries in a minute or two. It feels very moisturizing and not at all sticky. I like it and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other products I use. This is actually the first product I use after I cleanse my face. It goes on watery so I use this first. Some days when I&#x27;m lounging at home I have just used this and nothing else. I like the way my face feels after using it. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and my complexion is looking better. My pores look smaller and my acne scars are looking softer. I do see the results. I use it on my neck and chest as well.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product! Absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and makes skin feel youthful and tight. I have tried many expensive vitamin C serums (Obagi) and this product is far more superior than anyone I have previously tried. I highly recommend it and will continue to purchase for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I have used other C serums before, but none of them have the ingredients, and lack of fillers, that this one does.  I have only used it a short time so far, but have found what I am looking for.  My skin has been soft, but it is now softer and looks great.  I am 55 and have tried mainly good natural products.  I am thankful I found Oz naturals. I love their eye gel as well!  I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> with the weather on the East coast, and the dry conditions in the New York housing, is necessary to have vitamin C to keep the skin replenished.  Is also good to travel with (travel size approved) so your skin stays fresh on the aircrafts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product, I have sensitive skin and does not react to the oil as is a pure oil.</li>
    <li> Not sure where all the great reviews come from. Not impressed with the soapy water, that doens&#x27;t have an expiration date on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after adoption the practice of dermarolling.  I was orginally using aloe vera after rolling, but I saw that this potentially healed the skin faster with the bonus of skin care. I&#x27;m 28 and I cant remember the last time I had a pimple. I would break out all the time thanks to sweaty pilates sessions, but since starting a routine with this and aloe vera my skin has never looked better. I sincerely hope this will be available for as long as possible. LOVE IT! and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was only using this for my acne marks and discoloration,&lt;br /&gt;it does make my face feel tighter when i put it on. though I am 20 years old and have yet to have wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s good, but can&#x27;t see anything drastic as I just started.</li>
    <li> So far, I have noticed no changes to my skin.  But, I keep using it.  It&#x27;s not doing anything bad, but I guess I expected to see changes in my skin that were somewhat notciable.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like anything when I put it on.  No tingle or anything.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Shipped and received on time. Just started using it so no visible results yet but it sure feels good on the face. I plan to keep on using it.</li>
    <li> have only been using a few weeks so too early to say how great the results will be</li>
    <li> This is the stuff to use....I am sure any one who is fighting aging with a vengeance like myself has bought product after product promising results that were miraculous, only to be disappointed and have a drawer full of unused products..OZ NATURALS VITAMIN C SERUM REALLY WORKS.  Not only does it soften your skin, but wrinkles actually soften and fade.  I have used the product for about 2 weeks now, and I have had numerous compliments on my skin glow and how I maintain a youthful face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using it for about two weeks and Love it! Started using it on my hands too for age spots</li>
    <li> It works nice, does the job right!  Wish it wasn&#x27;t as watery, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks and it really works.  My wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes have diminished about 75%.  It seem to work even better when you apply a moisturizer over top of it.  I am very pleased and impressed.</li>
    <li> on a scale of 1-10 I&#x27;d give it a 5 - it&#x27;s not like the reviews say - i&#x27;m going to keep looking for something else</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see the different.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne all my life and use an acne regimen daily.  I had high hopes for this serum but after only a week cysts erupted on the areas it had been used.  They are hard like small rocks under the skin. The skin over the cyst is stretched tightly and has turned a deep purple/red color.  The areas are painful to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a month after terminating use, these cysts are beginning to reduce in size.  Anyone looking at this serum should consider whether your skin can tolerate an oil based product, mine could not.</li>
    <li> I like the feel, seems soothing but as an older woman, I confess I don&#x27;t see a lot of change after 30 days.  Recommendations?</li>
    <li> Very light and absorbs into the skin easily. Non-greasy, does not irritate skin. I have been using product for a week and a half and have already noticed the fine lines around my mouth look better. A little bit goes a long way. So far.....I love it</li>
    <li> Did not notice any change to skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, bought again for me and got one for my Mom also.  She is excited to use it.</li>
    <li> Many long complicated study sessions as a college student, stress, lack of sleep, and years of acne had did a number on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Particularly under my eyes I was starting to show most signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this serum worked like a liquid time machine, or liquid fountain of youth. I was skeptical it would work, to help get rid of my &#x27;panda eyes&#x27;. But it really did the trick, and it made me look at least five years younger. Being a guy, I don&#x27;t get told wow you look so much better. But I can tell women are looking at me a lot more than they used to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention, I purchased a derma roller to use before this to help in opening the pores better and even out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I also follow it with St Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Leaves no greasy feeling.  I like the way it has plumped up my skin.  I would recommend using this product before applying your favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for one week and I must say it really works. Now I&#x27;m not saying my face turned white over night, but my brown spots are fading faster than I expected - much faster than the other products I have used. It makes my face feel a little dry and tight so I use more moisturizer. I&#x27;m no expert but I would say my brown spots faded at least 2 shades in one week. If things continue at this rate I expect my brown spots to be almost invisible by the end of the bottle. I&#x27;m sure I will have to use it to keep the spots away but hopefully not every day.</li>
    <li> She won&#x27;t use her card online. She takes this stuff and mixes it with CeraVE cream and it makes her really soft all over.&lt;br /&gt;She talks to her girlfriends about how to make a good cream so I guess she has it down pat. I&#x27;m not a chemist and I don&#x27;t play one on TV either.</li>
    <li> This serum is inexpensive and makes my skin look radiant.  I have received many compliments about my glowing complexion. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> All the good reviews talk for themselves. The product is high quality, as expected, complemented with an excellent customer support.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with the service I have gotten from OZ naturals.  The product is excellent, and when I called to order two more bottles the rep I spoke with was very helpful.  I felt like he really wanted to know about my experience with the product and was very helpful with the order.  Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> shipped fast!! Works Great!!&lt;br /&gt;I really like this serum it smells like oranges and it&#x27;s not sticky like&lt;br /&gt;some, I Highly Recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Out of all the Vitamin C serums I owned and used, this is the BEST! Quickly absorbs into the skin and no tackiness....I use this serum, right after I wash my face and then follow it up with moisturizer. Even skin tone, brightness etc are a plus...</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly after the Serum.</li>
    <li> came really quickly.  i like the size of the bottle and the quantity.  However, I am not sure how well it works as it seems to evaporate very quickly after i apply it on my face.  That being said, I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients are given enough time to set into the skin.  This is in comparing it to Jason Ester-C serum which I have used for quite some time.  Also, this particular serum seems to be less viscous and more liquid.  I know that I can&#x27;t simply just use the serum and I actually have to apply vit E oil and a face lotion to hydrate my skin enough.  We will see how this works in terms of anti-aging though.  So far the vit E oil and lotion seems to do more for hydration than this serum.</li>
    <li> Product was clear and as described!  I&#x27;ve only started using it for the last week, so I can&#x27;t speak as to its efficacy.  But OZ Naturals&#x27; customer service seems very thoughtful and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy anything from them again :)</li>
    <li> So far, five stars all the way. I am 32 y/o woman. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a couple of weeks, but I saw and felt an immediate result in tone and texture of my skin. It feels tighter and I actually see a dewey-ness to it. There are some forehead lines that seem to be less prominent. It arrived on time and sealed. I was happy to receive the product information in my email. I can reference anytime I like with out having to keep the paper around, and the email felt more personal. It seems like the company actually wants to please their customers. I hope to find more skin products by this company because I could sure use the help!!</li>
    <li> Results are evident within 2 days, in my opinion. The lines around my eyes, and the crease on my brow and on either side of my mouth are visibly diminished. You need to moisturize after this stuff dries, and stay out of the sun to maintain results. Good luck.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum i have used in my life, just few drops and you can use them for the whole face, it last me couples months of using and compare with other brands i used before this one works perfectly and economically as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I am using it, but not every day. So I didn&#x27;t see results. Maybe is my fault.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to see the results.....</li>
    <li> no &#x60; to watered down and ineffective</li>
    <li> I recommend the product 100%&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> There are many vitamin C products out there but this has got to be the best on the market.</li>
    <li> A nice serum that I have been using about a month. I think there is some improvement in my skin, but hard to have miraculous results at age 62.</li>
    <li> It is so refreshing and I have noticed changes in my face as age spots and my hands. I would tell ladies to pick up and use it alone of sue it with you night cream.  No problem with it I just love it.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Oz Natural products.  I am using a number of their products including the vitamin C serum.  I am a 64 year old female with fair skin, red hair and freckles.  I love the products.  Finally, I have found something natural that gives visible results.  My crows feet have softened and the lines around my mouth too!  Believe me, I have tried so many different lines of skin care, and this by far has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the bonus is, the prices are so reasonable.  Thank you to Oz Naturals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am receiving a discount for my review.  Give their products a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed:)</li>
    <li> I received the item earlier than expected. I was contacted by the vendor via email explaining thoroughly how to use the product. I cannot comment on the product yet (too early, I haven&#x27;t seen any major improvement) but I&#x27;ll keep using it and hopefully will be able to post a detailed report.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased overall. I&#x27;ll purchase again from this company.</li>
    <li> I have use this several times before and can see the difference.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 months. This is great after for after cleansing. My forehead has fine little horizontal lines that run across it. My husband calls them my fret lines. I use this on those lines , around my eyes and neck. This doesn&#x27;t make the lines disappear but it does plump up the skin so they are not so apparent. Nice serum.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and the price is better than the Vitamin C serum I have purchased in the past.  It has a nice feel on my face and I feel it is healthy for my skin.  I was told that Vitamin C serum is the best thing I can apply to my face and of the ones I have tried, I like this one best.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan, Vitamin C in general is great stuff and this is the best price point I&#x27;ve found. ALSO, the company e-mails you directly to make sure you have received the item and are happy. GREAT GREAT customer service! Will continue to buy - it&#x27;s removing all my acne (really picking) and sun scars :)</li>
    <li> It goes on okay but then your face feels dry and tight.  wish it was more emollient or had oil so not to dry my skin.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle.  My skin seems softer and more supple.  I will reorder this product and keep using.</li>
    <li> No expired date on package</li>
    <li> It has taken me a while to write this review, since I didn&#x27;t see results at first.  I&#x27;ve used it faithfully every day since it arrived.  I thought I was going to be disappointed, but a couple of days I go I noticed that the ages spots on my face were significantly smaller.  If there has been other improvement, I haven&#x27;t noticed, but I still have quite a bit of the contents to use.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ve used it for a month, I cannot say if it&#x27;s really doing anything, but feels good since I know vitamin C helps the skin a lot.</li>
    <li> See no difference after 2 months</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oz Natural serum under my moisturizer at night  and it makes my skin look fantastic in the morning.  I used to use the Obagi products but their C serum irritated my skin and was extremely expensive.  This serum is not sticky and absorbs quickly.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 2 weeks, but I immediately liked how it brightened up my face and took away some of the redness on my cheeks. Now I see it working on the small lines around my mouth. I have continued hopes for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also contacted the company with a question and got an immediate and pleasant response.  Customer service with this company is excellent!  I am considering buying the under eye serum for puffiness and dark circles.</li>
    <li> dislike bottle dropper. have to drop liquid in hand to spread on face, hand absorbs quite a bit before you can get it on face.  dropper to face doesn&#x27;t work well either</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with pretty severe skin problems (acne, eczema, red inflamed skin) since I was pregnant with my daughter and NOTHING helped. I strive to eat healthy, drink plenty of water, take my vitamins and use gentle cleaning/ moisturizing solutions on my skin. All of this with little to no results. I tried this product on a whim and immediately noticed a difference! My skin&#x27;s texture improved, the redness went away and the acne is slowly clearing up and scars healing!! I am so happy to have found this product and plan on continuing to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like the vitamin c. serum. It goes on well and has not caused any irritation. I am sure it will be good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this serum initially after washing and applying a toner daily and didn&#x27;t see any results..I used The dermaroller 0.5 after washing with a mild soap then I applied the vitamin c serum and whoa!  The results have been amazing! I am 44 and have been told that I look 10 years younger! Would definitely recommend this product.**using the dermaroller/ vit c serum only once weekly **</li>
    <li> I really can feel a difference to my skin, has a good glow, and so smooth and soft!  I have been using it a little over a month and I still have over half the bottle left.  Very happy with my purchase, will continue to use this as a daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I bought this in January. I thought I&#x27;d already reviewed it. I am 53 years old, and wanted a good serum. This is it! I totally noticed a difference within days...but here&#x27;s the kicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Botox to my forehead in April, and gently used this serum as usual. This serum healed my Botox within 2 days, rather than having a puffy face for a week. It also quickened the results of the Botox. I was so impressed with how this serum worked. I am still noticing the difference, and feeling the Botox 4 months later. 4 months is about when Botox wears off, and I can hardly see where I needed it. I&#x27;m getting it again in August, and will use this serum as I always do. I think it&#x27;s a good as the high priced serum at the make up store.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and targeting specific areas on my face and neck.  So far I have seen no changes.  I&#x27;ll give it 6 months to one year before discontinuing to see if it actually works.  Since it is not inexpensive, I don&#x27;t plan to continue forever paying for something that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have used other C products and thought I would try this one.  I&#x27;ve only been using this brand a few weeks.  I am hoping for very good results as this has Vitamin E and also Hyaluronic Acid (I&#x27;ve heard this is good?) so I&#x27;m hoping to have better results with the brown spots.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Best vitamin c:  It did absolutely nothing for my skin. Waste of money. It had the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;Total rip off.</li>
    <li> Thanks  for good product! Immediately  results</li>
    <li> Did you know that ALL the OZ natural products are not from Dr Oz? How many of you thought this thinking that? I bought this thinking so. It really was no better than what I buy at cvs! Don&#x27;t be duped.</li>
    <li> I am nearly finished with my first bottle of Vitamin C Serum and I feel the wrinkles across my forehead have diminished somewhat.  I ordered a second bottle and, in the Christmas rush, was sent a DVD instead of the Vitamin C Serum.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately reimbursed me and then I re-ordered from OZ Naturals with no problems.  The second bottle came very quickly.  All in all, a very good job by both OZ Naturals and Amazon.  I would recommend trying the Vitamin C Serum.  I am 67 so I have deeper wrinkles to overcome…..I would suggest starting this serum when you are in your 30&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> So far, I see no difference in my skin at all  so therefore I&#x27;m not thrilled with the product.  I guess I expected more.</li>
    <li> This is a great compliment to use with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I use the Vit C at night and the Hyaluronic in the morning.  These are great products.  Stop looking and buying all those other offer priced items - this is what you want.  Dr. Oz is the best and a man at that - but one who knows what women need!!!  Love, love, love this...</li>
    <li> So I bought this product an received it 2 weeks ago. The consistency is of water.  Since applying it twice a day for two weeks, I have seen ZERO improvement....not too promising if you ask me. Thank goodness for the guarantee!!!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C based serum induced itching all over my body(not just face). Applied it thrice to test it. But had to return it, unfortunately. Though Skin did show improvement in one use.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face feel so silky smooth! And, I love that they followed-up with an email to make sure that I knew how to correctly use the product.</li>
    <li> MY FACE FEELS SOFTER AND LOOKS BRIGHTER- CANT WAIT TO AFTER LONG TIME USE IF IT HELPS WITH CROWS FEET.  ONLY USED FOR 1 MONTH --</li>
    <li> Great product! Saw improvement in fine lines within 2 weeks! Would recommend this product to everyone. Great value as well</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within 1 week of daily use, and you need only a dab! Got my mom and sis hooked too :) Tried other brands to save a buck, but you can&#x27;t even compare!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product a few times and like it. But its not a miracle product. I&#x27;m not crazy about the container as I have accidentally forgot to tighten the dropper several times and spilled the contents...</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I have been using it for  four months now and my lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.  I have tried a lot of products and this is the first one that has worked.</li>
    <li> Am giving the Seller 5 Stars because the Product was well packaged, arrived before expected and included a sales receipt.  I knew going in that this was not a Dr. Oz product but purchased after reading other reviews -- And because it claims to be &amp;#34;THE BEST&amp;#34; of all the Vitamin C Serums. Have been using it faithfully for 4 days. Will update in a month.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum! It makes my face feel terrific, smooth and not irritated. I have used it for 2 days and have seen a noticeable improvement in my breakout areas. Some people asked about shelf life.... Per box... shelf life is two years, it has 20% vitamin c which is one of the reasons I purchased it after reading reviews of numerous other products.  I have the skin of a 55 year old smoker with wrinkles and acne scarring.  Although I am not used to spending $30 for a bottle of face serum, I intend to buy more. Oh and the product shipped very fast.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Everyday when I put the serum on I look in the mirror and think &amp;#34;can it be true?&amp;#34; I am 57, and have laugh lines around my mouth. Or...I did. It&#x27;s crazy. They seem to be gone. This stuff works miracles.</li>
    <li> using it for 2 months and can see effects. my skin looks better and I will be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> This made me breakout! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for sensitive skin. I also don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does what it claims at a fraction of the cost of other similar products.  Very happy with this purchase and will continue to order from OZ Naturals.  Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Expiration date is hard too see, I just got my order, and I think the expiration date is either 2015 or 2016.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for several months now. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and can see a significant improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it a fifth star until I know whether or not it works and I know that will take time.&lt;br /&gt;For now, I believe this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and was as described.  Easy to apply and seems to be working although I&#x27;ve only been using a short time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought such a dissapointing item online. Just &amp;#34;holy water&amp;#34; in a bottle. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, there is always a slight sour taste to all of the vit C produts. Well, this is just water, smells like water, feels like water. Too bad for me. Good for the seller, looks like they are making money of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum twice a day for several weeks, and my skin is absolutely fantastic.  Fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared my skin is an even tone and the redness is gone. After putting on the serum wait about 5 minutes then follow with a good moisturizer that has an SPF. I have tried other products in the past, but nothing compares to OZ Naturals. I can&#x27;t believe the number of negative reviews.  Apparently, they are not using the product correctly or expecting results in one application. Just give it time and it will work. I would highly recommend OZ Natural and I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals vitamin C serum has all the right ingredients for a healthier face! I am happy with it and will update my review as time goes by to say how well it&#x27;s working.It feels good going on and I really have high hopes for this product.I love Vitamin C serums and believe they are essential to great skin!,I was lucky enough to get a coupon code but the opinions expressed are my honest feelings about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about eight months now and have noticed (starting around the three-week mark) a definite lightening of my slight rosacea and at the age-darkened outer corners of my eyes. The texture of my skin has also gradually changed, smoothing out slight imperfections, although the actual lines have not changed visibly (though I didn&#x27;t expect that). Top that with a price that&#x27;s so much lower than many other vitamin C serums, I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find one I liked better. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this product after previously using a more expensive product.  I follow the easy instructions.  The company even sends out an e-mail with instructions and contact information for any additional questions/help.  I try to take care of my skin after being a FL beach bunny in my earlier years.  Unfortunately, it takes years for sun damage to show up...wish I knew that at an earlier age.  I do &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; things that have been proven to help.  It must be working as I am often mistaken for my daughter&#x27;s sister and my husband&#x27;s younger girlfriend, which is sometimes embarrassing, but still flattering.  This company is great and I love this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference using this. Didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin though, which is good. Didn&#x27;t moisturize much. I would use again if it was there, but I might check out a few more to see if I find anything better.</li>
    <li> Customer service is exceptional.  I love the personal emails I have received.  Thank you very much!  I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for Your Face.....for about 10 days, only at night.  I do use a Chanel moisturizer over it.  My face seems to be drier than usual when I awake.  I have very sensitive skin and there haven&#x27;t been any flare-ups with facial irritation.  I continue to use it, hoping I will be able to give this product a 5-star rating.  I am tired and discouraged trying various new items only to find they are not as great as what consumers are told.  I sincerely want this product to work so I can stop my endless search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can be of assistance in advising me with any suggestions, I would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I guess it is a good product, but didn&#x27;t change my skin that I could tell</li>
    <li> I am on my my second bottle and have been using it religiously everyday.  Unfortunately, no significant change that I can detect.</li>
    <li> The new formula is so terrible. The first one I bought is perfect. The new one makes skin so dry</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the serum long enough to rate it but so far everything is good. Service has been great. Thanks for inquiring. I will be ordering again if I see improvement. I ordered just based on other reviews. Thanks much!</li>
    <li> Second time purchased, love this stuff and will keep purchasing can&#x27;t go without...</li>
    <li> ive been using this serum for about ten days and i like how it gets my skin tight and fresh and smooth...will continue using it ....i recommend it to all....the shipping was good too</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger and have wonderful smooth texture to their skins.  It really has given me some compliments that I enjoy getting.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product that&#x27;s all natural which is important to me to keep my whole being healthy.  I always check ingredients to make sure there are NO toxic chemicals and Oz Naturals has it covered!</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to all my friends. I have had photo facials that didn&#x27;t render as positive results as this serum. I don&#x27;t notice much benefits for wrinkles, but I did find much brighter and more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> would recommed this to everyone, the benefits are really worth the price&lt;br /&gt;and have already purchased my 3rd bottle, and gifted it to friends and&lt;br /&gt;family</li>
    <li> My friend says this product improves face&#x27;s smoothness. It is useful by now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product at this price.</li>
    <li> Does make my face feel smooth and seems to be doing what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone and decide if I want it again.</li>
    <li> My skin type is light-medium and I get oily skin more easily the older I get.  So maybe this product is just not meant to be, for me. I only tried it for 1 week and noticed 2 pimples (I never get pimples anymore) It may be that I have some sensitivity to the product, but my skin rarely gets sensitive to any topical cream/lotions.  I will wait a few weeks and give it another try.  In the meantime I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to put it on scar/stretch mark areas, and the serum is doing fine there. No breakouts or anything, weather it&#x27;s making a difference for my scar/stretch marks or not I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m sure a little vitamin C wont hurt.</li>
    <li> I love this - good price, feels great.  But my daughter stole it so now I have to get another one...</li>
    <li> I have only been using the Vit C product for about 2 weeks but my face feels great. It seems smoother and brighter. I use it at night on my face and neck and have not had any issues of redness or dried out skin. I do use a good moisturizer over the top.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face twice a day for 2 weeks and there is a noticable softness to my skin.  AFter a week, there were fewer fine lines and I can&#x27;t get over the smooth feeling to my cheeks and forehead.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Is the first time that I bought this serum, but is really good, I&#x27;m start to feel my skin more soft, my melasma still there maybe with the time it going to be noticed much better and disappear.</li>
    <li> It is not Botox in a bottle, but my face is a bit smoother. It is not Botox in a bottle, but my face is a bit smoother. I use Oz Naturals hyaluronic acid at night and Oz Naturals  Vitamin C in the morning.</li>
    <li> Skin looks and feels great</li>
    <li> Was using for about a month before i stopped because it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for me. I do have problematic skin, this may just not be the product for me just because its not what I need at the moment</li>
    <li> After using a week I&#x27;ve seen improvement on my skin ... will update after a month, so far so good. Plus this product is not like $50 or more so it was not big risk of wasting money.</li>
    <li> great stuff- saw improvment within a week of use</li>
    <li> Still in trial stage. So far I like what I&#x27;m seeing...time will tell.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful with the derma roller - turning my frown upside down from bad skin back to awesome skin</li>
    <li> So, my sister actually got this for me for my birthday after a long and frustrated conversation about how terrible I feel when I look in the mirror now. I have never really been into the whole tanning scene or wear a ton of makeup to cover up. So, I thought that my skin would look a little bit better than it does. I have started to get age spots and my skin just generally looks splotchy and lifeless. &amp;#34;Wear foundation,&amp;#34; you say? Well, I have never been able to wear it without my eyes burning...even the hypoallergenic stuff. I was tired of people asking me if I was sick or tired just because my skin looked that way.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so after my VC serum arrived I was kind of skeptical because I figured it was probably just another gimic like most everything else in the beauty market. But, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. It doesn&#x27;t have anything in it that will hurt me. So, I tried it. And a little over a week later I started to notice that my skin looked a little more even and bright! It still wasn&#x27;t wonderful, but I could tell it was doing something and that was what mattered. So, I have kept it up for about a month now and it has changed my skin. I have even been sick lately and my skin doesn&#x27;t look like death walking. The other plus is that my moisturizer seems to be able to work better on my skin now. I live in a very dry climate. Everyone struggles with dry skin here. Before it felt like I had to apply moisturizer at least three times a day to keep my skin feeling nice. Now, it seems to only need one application. On top of everything, my cheeks have gotten their slight natural blush back!&lt;br /&gt;So, yes. I would definitely recommend this product to people. My experience has been nothing but good.</li>
    <li> I will repurchase this product. It feels great on my skin and and I can already see results with my pigmentation. Very very happy with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now. It has brightened up my skin tone. I have to hurry to apply it because it gets soaked in fast. Not sure yet if I will buy again. I&#x27;ll decide when the bottle is almost empty and see if it has kept working well.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and of course I used it as soon as it warmed from the cold, it feels really good on my face I have fine lines by my eyes but I have what I call my disappointment lines on my forehead between my eyes and would love to see these lighten up. I will be back in 15 days to let you k ow now this product is heing me</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightweight serum. It does a nice job with those fine lines on my face that were beginning to bother me. I used to use Fruition by Estee Lauder and this is the first serum I&#x27;ve liked since Fruition was discontinued. Oz&#x27;s serum doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight and sticky and isn&#x27;t too heavy to be worn under any sort of facial moisturizer, even night cream.</li>
    <li> I didnt  see any result with this product and the contrary it left my skin too dry.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Keeps my skin looking young.</li>
    <li> I really like it. It is not oil, and the flavor is good. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now, I can tell the difference, My skin feels softer and my tone it&#x27;s getting even! I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Making my own now for pennies - works the same. Bulk Supplements carries the powder - all it takes is some of the Vit C powder - distilled water and a bit of vegetable glycerine...shake-shake-shake and your done. ALSO - if like me - this was too strong - you can change the strength. Just do a little studying.</li>
    <li> 50 years old. Not a goddess nor do I sleep like a Geisha. I eat normally, so going to have some skin issues. This product has reduced my pores GREATLY and also the tiny lines. Wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle just something to help. THIS DID IT! Great price and makes my skin feel great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has only been using it for a week.  I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference already.  She agrees.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> I like how makes my skin feel.  I do already see results after only about a week. I would recommend this to all the ladies out there that want beautiful skin. I am coming up on 54 and my skin still looks pretty good. No Botox or injections for this girl. Just nice natural creams</li>
    <li> Great seller. Item arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve been using for a week. So far so so good and certainly much cheaper than the last brand  I used.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks  !!</li>
    <li> The moisture retention in my face has increased with regular use of this produce along with the use of a good moisturizer.....</li>
    <li> Simply loving this serum. Will be buying more as I&#x27;m starting to run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased the vitamin C serum and have only been using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smoothness it gives my skin.</li>
    <li> I give five stars for the wonderful product and the good service I had for buying the items. I love the all organic and natural staff in it.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t see what the hype is about. This &amp;#34;vitamin c&amp;#34; is nothing but water, nothing but snake oil. Regardless I used the product and saw no difference in my skin or hydration. I&#x27;m considering sending this product to my friend who works at a lab and decipher what the real &amp;#34;vitamin c&amp;#34; percentage is on this lousy hyped up product.</li>
    <li> I love this! Only thing is; after you put it on your skin, my skin feels dry, so I also use my aveeno cream afterwards. But it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it every night before bed!...after only a few days my skin feels great and looks amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I like this brand and I have used other products. It is one of the best serums that I have ordered. It fades my brown spots and I recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using PCA Skin&#x27;s products which are much more expensive, and effective.  I will likely go back to that.</li>
    <li> Have not used the product long enough to give higher rating at this time; I am happy that it is a little heavier than the last serum product ordered from OZ Naturals, doesn&#x27;t tend to run all over the face with use; also takes smaller amt. to cover areas desired.  My skin is smoother after use but that may be attributed to conditioner also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only starting to use this product for the first time but I&#x27;m liking the way it feels on my face so far</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with adult acne and decided to take action. I heard of three things that everyone loved. Two recommended by Dr. Oz were Phytoceramicides that plump the skin from underneath, and a good vitamin C serum. I also heard good things about Clairosonic skin brushes....so Ive been doing all three and my skin is clearing up finally! This serum goes right in, doesn&#x27;t clog pores or leave a film. Fast shipping also. I would highly recommend doing these three things, as I am a cosmetologist and nothing else worked, but this regime does. I do not work for any of the companies mentioned. I wish I had taken a before and after picture!</li>
    <li> This serum is incredible. I believe this serum has such high reviews because it is one of those rare beauty products that actually creates a visible effect on your skin. And we all love to SEE the results in our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I knew vitamin c was a good skin care product, but when I ordered this serum I had no idea how well my skin would react. It lightens, brightens, and heals. Really. Try it for yourself. I have a dark mark on my stomach that has continued to lighten with the use of this product. Same with freckles (after I saw the first spot lighten overnight, I had to keep going-it was addicting!). However, I have not had any spot completely disappear. Just lighten by several shades. And from what I understand, you MUST use a good SPF during the day after using this or the sun will just darken all the areas you have worked to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly- I had a major sunburn recently- bright red skin, blistering up- and this freaking serum calmed my skin down overnight. It actually has helped to heal the skin from my sunburn faster- who knew?! I am talking about the blisters, which would normally lead to pealing skin, went away or decreased in size overnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used every last drop of this serum and have just reordered. It is a great bargain and is highly effective. The ingredient list has a lot of natural and organic ingredients listed (which I suppose it what this brand is all about being called OZ naturals after all) and if you compare it to other serums on the market, you will see a difference in ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are usually listed in order of weight/volume/prevalence, so the first ingredients are what makes up most of the serum and the last ingredients listed are usually too minimal to make much difference with your skin. Here there are quality ingredients listed at the top (organic herbal infusion, organic aloe, vitamin c are the top 3). You&#x27;d be surprised how many vitamin c serums are out there that list vitamin c/ascorbic acid as an afterthought as one of the last few ingredients on the list. So watch out for marketing ploys and learn to read ingredient lists! This stuff works though and is worth a try.</li>
    <li> It has been about 30 days since my purchase of this serum, I have to say that my face looks brighter and my acne scars have faded.  I tend to wear a lot of make-up to hide the scars and I find myself applying less make-up and going more natural.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten their facial skin tone along with reducing facial scars and/or wrinkles.  I have already run out of the serum, I probably over used it.  Once I have another bottle I will use less as a little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m not sure if this is pure vitamin c or not. Because Vitamin c should be yellow right? Anyways I have been using it now for 2 weeks. I was expecting it to brighten my face like other vitamin c does. But this is working slowly. I was also expecting to erase my sun burns. We will see if it does. They should make it more stronger and mixed with kojic acid.</li>
    <li> I had a serious dry skin problem on my face and lip area (red ring chapped lips with cracking and bleeding) which was spreading so after researching and trying numerous products I decided to give this a chance. I watched the You-tube presentation by Dr. Oz and then I took a leap and tried this 20% Vitamin C solution with the Phytoceramides made from Sweet Potatoes and vitamin E capsules as recommended and its been four weeks now and my skin is looking great. I will continue to use the combination of the products as long as I get results.</li>
    <li> this is one of the most inexpensive serum I&#x27;ve got but it turns out not bad at all. I think that my skin is more smooth now but hopefully not placebo effect. :)</li>
    <li> The follow up from OZ Naturals was great.  I received 2 personal emails from them explaining the best way to use the product.  Very personal, what great customer service</li>
    <li> I can see a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and, just like the title of this review says, my skin has never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried almost every one of the creams, serums, lotions, etc. that a person can possible buy from the drugstore and nothing seemed to hydrate my skin. I would always experience no results at all, or experience irritation or burning to my skin from those products. This Vitamin C Serum from OZ Naturals is really the BEST! I have such dry facial skin and this product soaks in fast, leaving my skin feeling moisturized and looking rejuvenated. I&#x27;m only 26, but I think I have the skin of a 40 year old sometimes. I had dealt with acne for years and the sun has really taken its toll. Nothing I ever tied evened out my blotchy skin tone until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stop raving about how well this Vitamin C Serum actually works. My face doesn&#x27;t look tired anymore! All of the hundreds of reviews praising this product are well worth the read. I religiously put this serum on every day after my shower and regardless of whether I put on makeup. This serum takes away all of the redness and blotchiness in my skin and for the first time...EVER, I have a completely even skin tone. This serum is actually even clearing up the small amount of acne flare-ups that I would have from time to time and preventing others from starting. My skin looks and feels healthy and smooth. It even looks smooth under make-up and my foundation and powder go on so much easier. I am so very glad to have found this Vitamin C Serum. I no longer have to waste my money on those name brand creams that leave behind empty promises. I have experienced no irritation or burning with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I would like to give a shout out to OZ Naturals. They are such an amazing, caring company that truly stands behind its product. When Amazon confused labels and sent the wrong OZ Naturals product to me, I contact OZ Naturals. They jumped right on the problem and within just days I had the right product at no inconvenience to me. So very kind and above and beyond the call of duty! Even though the mistake with entirely Amazon&#x27;s fault, OZ Naturals took it upon themselves to make me as a customer happy by stepping in to replace the product. They even apologized and treated the issue with sympathy (keep in mind it was Amazon&#x27;s fault, not theirs). I was blown away at this company&#x27;s dedication and outstanding customer service. For this alone I am a customer for life! Oh, and I can&#x27;t forget that they sell and make some AMAZING products!  I look forward to trying more products from OZ Naturals.days I had the right product at no inconvenience to me. So very kind and above and beyond the call of duty!

    <li> I have been using this for about over a month and I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  My pores seem smaller and my skin looks and feels healther.  I like to use it after using my dermaroller on the problem areas on my face to promote quick recovery.  There is no scent and it does not leave behind a sticky or uncomfortable residue.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I had terrible skin. I have tried everything for skin-care, from high-end shiseido products to cheap skin care. Nothing worked. However, this serum works like magic. I apply it everyday at night, and wake up with bright glowy skin. I noticed the acnes scar are healing really fast, and no new acnes have appeared. Best serum ever.</li>
    <li> I am a new user, I love this product.  I can feel a difference right away.  I recently went on a 5 day vacation, I decided I would take just the minimum.  I left my Vitamin C serum at home, I could tell that this was a bad decision right away.  I am not sure how a face can be thirsty, but mine sure was by the end of the trip.</li>
    <li> The best Vit. C serum. Amazing light texture with lots of state of art ingredients to fight with aging. I use twice a day to lighten my acne marks and fight UV rays. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product and started to use it right away and I have to say that I felt the effect almost immediately. It absorbs really quick and leaves your skin firm immediately. I use it just at night for now but might start using it two times a day soon. I will definitely buy other products of this brand.</li>
    <li> Great Vitamin C serum. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered a different brand the second time around because this one was way better.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me and I had read alot of the reviews before purchasing it. However, I am disappointed it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It literally feels like I&#x27;m putting water on my face.  I don&#x27;t notice any tightening or any brightening...  :(</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very good, and smooth.  I typically have combo skin more on the dry side, with a blemish once in a blue moon.  I apply several drops of Vitamin C Serum after I wash and dry my face and before I put my moisturizer with SPF.  At night I follow the same process and moisturize with a drop or two of pure argan oil, I feel like at nighttime is for my body and skin to rest and heal therefore the concentrated argan oil.  I&#x27;m split between 4 and 5 stars, because I do love the way my face feels, but have a lack of understanding as to what its really doing for my skin.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Product is in new condition, original packaging and sealed. Is not expired. I have previously used the Obagi brand of the C Serum and I paid 5x the price for it. This product is the same exact thing, ingredient for ingredient. Great purchase!! I love that it comes with the glass vial. Note to all users: There are no instructions on how many drops to use. The Obagi serum says use 6-12 drops. I use 7 exactly, sometimes a 2 more if my face is very dry. Will order again when it runs out. Will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. 20% Vit C with other fantastic ingredients help fight wrinkles and signs of aging. This company also constantly provide informative articles to help customer  take care of our skin.</li>
    <li> Love this serum and all the other products I have purchased from Oz Naturals. Great serum, one of the best I have used for a great price.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have used this serum daily, morning and night, for the last month and a half and am hooked. My skin is super soft and my pores are virtually invisible. I use this after my rober, then I apply the OZ hyaluronic acid and then add my moisturizer. I also apply it this way to my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;. Fantastic! Soft, smooth skin.  And it&#x27;s all natural. I would read the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I&#x27;m so happy I tried this brand.</li>
    <li> Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It is light and delivers good results as promise. I use it before my regular moisturizer. My skin looks smoother and brighter. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used. Light and not too greasy. Never go a day without it!</li>
    <li> great produce. nice smell. wonderful effects on my mature male skin. very well price too.</li>
    <li> I love the OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum!  It&#x27;s the best on the market as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  OZ Naturals is a trustworthy company and uses high quality ingredients to give its customers the best results!  I have sensitive skin and this serum works well and does not cause any irritation.  I use it in the morning and at night as part of my cleansing, moisturizing, and nourishing facial routine.  My goal is to do what I can to keep my skin looking healthy and the best it can as I age.  This bottle lasts a long time.  Also, the company is very responsive to its customers and I&#x27;ve had nothing but excellent experiences with all my products and purchases.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The most incredible Serum THERE IS! Have tried everything and you will NOT be disappointed with this incredible product. As a 49 year old - I admit to 34 - I have literally tried EVERYTHING. Have been a devoted Le Mer client for years ... This was suggested to me by my yoga instructor who I thought was about 10 - 12 years younger than me. No. She&#x27;s 53. I bought the whole line that day. I literally have nightmares about running out of this Serum - so I bought two extra bottles. If OZ Naturals ever stops making this there will be anarchy among women my age - and younger - my 21 year old swears by this too and I am so happy she is taking care of her skin - never too young!</li>
    <li> I have tried several vitamin c serums over the years and I like this one. It is light , soaks in right away, has H.A., good amount of vitamin c, amino acids, jojoba oil and more. I have been using this for a couple of weeks and the age spot on my nose is definitely getting lighter. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this great vit c product, oh and the price is fantastic. All of oz products are good quality with results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum and so quickly absorbed.  Love it.</li>
    <li> make your skin dry,but work very good</li>
    <li> Love this serum. My face feels very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> My skin is LOVING this product. It feels so good, and gives me a nice tone on my face. I am seeing a difference almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse, scrub, tone, apply this serum, then as recommended on the bottle, I apply face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this. Goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t sting after derma rolling.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for sometime now and everytime I apply it to my face it feels very hydrating. It feels as though your face drank a glass of water. It helps to give you that special glow.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....pamper your face.</li>
    <li> This serum was one of the better ones I have used. It goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling soft. I did notice changes in my skin tone about two weeks after using this product. While it does not have as much Vitamin C in it as several other brands, I noticed this at about a 5 on a scale of 1-10 (1 not noticed at all and 10 definitely noticed). I have very sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t cause any problems or adverse reactions. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful product! I use this product when my skin is really dry and I apply this at night ! Just two drops and you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Tried this serum after running out of expensive department store product.  I noticed a difference after the first use and continue to see results a few weeks into it.  The serum makes my skin look brighter, clearer and more radient.  Not sure about any wrinkle reduction but that may come with continued use.  I will not go back to the expensive brands after using this.  It is superior and a great value.  I wish there were an eye moisturizer from the same company.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product. Skin has not dried out from the cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Made my face peel and flake.  Only can use on neck; softens but I was hoping it would reduce some wrinkles there.  No such luck.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I like this product did a nice job but no drusstick differents . I guess we all liking for a miracle ! But would absolutely get it afain soon as I run out of the existent one</li>
    <li> This serum brightens my skin so well!! It doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy on my combination skin and layers beautifully with my moisturizer.  I have noticed such a change in my skin&#x27;s tone using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and it has made an incredible difference! My skin is much clearer, much less redness (I assume it will continue to get better over time), and a definite improvement in fine lines. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet so I don&#x27;t know about that, but so far I have seem a definite improvement in my skin! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> THE BEST--Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> this serum is easy to apply clear non oily not sure it is totally comparable to SKinceuticals CE ferulic but it is 1/6 the price and I can buy 5 of these for the price of one CE Ferulic</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Black don&#x27;t crack but definitely like to maintain the luster when I can. I used OZ Naturals for 30 days and noticed a slight improvement to my skin. Nothing significant, but considering this was far less than what I was paying for Estee Lauder products, I decided to order another bottle. By this time, I discovered the benefits of derma rolling. The combination of a .5mm derma roller and vitamin C serum has made my skin look amazing. I still have discoloration, but it is definitely improving. So much so that one day out of the blue several people  told me that my skin looks really good.  To be fair, I am going to list my entire skin care regimen. I wash my face twice a day with facial cleanser and a Clarasonic cleansing brush. Afterwards, I remove the excess soap with 100% witch hazel. I let the witch hazel dry completely before I apply vitamin C. Once the vitamin C has dried, I apply moisturizer and follow up with sun block. Two to three times a week, I use a .5mm derma roller on my face and neck. For me, combining all of these products has rendered the best results.  FYI, there is no need to purchase expensive skin toner that only contains 50 - 70% witch hazel. Save the money and go to Walgreens and purchase a 16oz bottle of witch hazel for $6.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for one week. I use my Derma Roller first on my face and then I put the Vitamin C Serum on my face. I see a huge difference already. I definitely recommend the product ( along with the derma roller).</li>
    <li> Absorbs very well into my skin. I felt my skin looked more even and radiant; and I suffer from acne scarring.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m putting water on my face with this stuff. I&#x27;ve been faithfully using it for a few months now, noticing zero results or improvements...</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very soft! Would recommend! Put it on my face after shower before bed and in morning sometimes too. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face with a heavy feeling like most skin moisturizers do my face feels refreshed after applying to skin.</li>
    <li> I like the bottle however I have not seen anything different from my face. However, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts as well.</li>
    <li> I have been putting on in the morning under my regular day cream.  No irritation.  Goes on nicely and is quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I have seen very good results in the 3 weeks I have been using this product. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this serum and highly recommend it. I am 53 and my skin looks much firmer. After only a few applications I began to notice a real difference in the way it looked and felt. I have a brown spot I&#x27;m hoping the serum will help fade with time. I will continue to purchase the OZ Naturals brand of Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  I used it as directed and every night.  I didn&#x27;t see a change in any discoloration, fine lines, anything.  I have good skin to begin with, but this was just like slicking on water...good thing it wasn&#x27;t real expensive.  If you want a great skin combination, use pure Argan oil mixed with seabuckthorn oil.  That makes a great overnight moisturizer.  You&#x27;ll wake up with gorgeous, radiant skin.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is amazing.....  I love the way it makes my skin feel and it seems to make my skin very hydrated.....</li>
    <li> My skin is brighter and the hyperpygmentation is clearing. I use every night. I don&#x27;t use during the day because it makes my skin oily. I&#x27;m combination oily. I also use microdermabrasion crystals 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed! I was so excited to try this serum after reading all the reviews. I ordered it right away and I had been using it every night for last 2 weeks and only used about 1/4 of bottle and tonight when I opened the bottle it slipped onto the floor and broke into a dozen pieces. I am disappointed about how delicate the bottle was....it just broke right away. I wish it wasn&#x27;t that delicate. I didn&#x27;t even get to use all of the product in it! :(</li>
    <li> I just give a 4 Star even I like the product very much and it is very good but it is very liquid, mean that I often just loos several drops. I used before the VITAMIN C SERUM and this one is much thicker than the OZ serum. Nevertheless it is a very good serum and I am looking forward to rewrite a review after one bottle.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Obagi C Serum and love it. After reading a few reviews for this product and seeing the lower price, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks and don&#x27;t notice any affect at all. It&#x27;s completely clear as well. A lot of online sources state that good C serums are typically brown (like Obagi and other higher end brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I&#x27;ll save up and buy Obagi again instead of this brand. No results at all.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s the percentage of the vitamin C? Why is it only one kind of vitamin C in the ingredient? What is the PH? This kind of vitamin C oxidizes quickly no mater what &#x27;stabilizer&#x27; is used. Anyone benefiting from the product is benefitting from the Hyaluronic acid, MSM, AND E .  2-3 weeks on the shelf and the bottle is already at 50% strength of vitamin C it was formulated at. How long did it take to get from the factory to the store? How long until the store brought it out from their backend shelf to the display?&lt;br /&gt;The only vitamin C that penetrates deep into the skin and DOESN&#x27;T oxidize quickly is tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, which is fat soluble.&lt;br /&gt;Women wize up! You can make your own topical vitamin C with ascorbic acid. It&#x27;s cheap, It&#x27;s pure, water soluble,  and easy. You can add E and MSM to it. Get litmus papers to adjust the ph. A whole year&#x27;s supply and more for the same cost of one of these bottles.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long ways, and that little does a wonderful job in all respects. I wouldn&#x27;t want to ever be without it.Those pesky little laugh lines at the corner of my eyes have all but disappeared.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any one who wants immediate results! My eleven year old daughter noticed with in the first ten minutes of coming home from school. She asked me what I did to my eyes.  I put a drop on my finger and rub it into an unwanted wrinkle and it works!!! I only use it once a day but you can use it more. I can not believe the immediate results:) I do follow up with vitamin C face crème that I got at The Body Shop.</li>
    <li> Going back to first C I tried. This one not same results - dries more too.</li>
    <li> I accidently left the lid unscrewed and most of it evaporated. Come on Dr. Oz get the pump!!!!!!!! overall good except their packaging of the product  NOT SMART WAY TO PACK, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE YOU PAY. YOU CAN UPGRADE YOUR BOTTLE</li>
    <li> Perfect!! I loved it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Vit C serum in many years but my skin was looking a bit dull so I thought C would help.  I only use once in the a.m. and I&#x27;ve noticed brighter skin, smoother &amp; tighter pores.  Completely absorbs with no oily after-feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product yet, so far it&#x27;s working well. I just hope to finish all the product and see the final result.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.....dries out skin</li>
    <li> Works great.. clears skin and brights within a couple of uses. Great product. smoothes out your skin and gives a radiant look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product along with insta natural for a month I am already seeing some improvement in my skin.My daughter say&#x27;s she sees it also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when I see an inexpensive product that claims to do everything that I want it to do have SO MANY 5 star reviews. I always think &amp;#34;they&#x27;re paying people to do this, they have to be.&amp;#34; I am pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I am about to order my second bottle of this product after using the entire bottle in 3 months. I am 25 and starting to notice very fine aging lines, I&#x27;ve read repeatedly that Vitamin C is a must for people my age. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction of these lines as well as a reduction in acne flare ups. If I have a spot to come up, this product is very effective at reducing it&#x27;s size and color overnight. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. This serum actually dried out my skin and my skin is never dry. The product did not feel moisturizing so it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping my skin. I would recommending layering this product on top of your regular moisturizer to get the full results.</li>
    <li> I can see the difference  from my skin. It absorbs  from your skin right away. It feels softer and I can see after I put my makeup that has different glow.</li>
    <li> It is just ok.  I did not achieve the results I was seeking.  I will be trying another product next.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if its working yet. I do think maybe it needs a little more vitamin C in it.</li>
    <li> I was exicted to receive it but very disappointed by the product. After putting it i my face gets dry and i have white powder on it. I do not understand why.</li>
    <li> At first I was thinking oil? All over my face? Hmmmm. But then I used and it soaks right in without leaving any trace of oil and leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve been mixing my with Hyaluronic acid serum and use everywhere on my face and eyes with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use it everyday &amp; feel like I am doing the right thing for my skin!  I have ordered 3 times now &amp; it comes quickly.</li>
    <li> The product was not the same as previously ordered. The first one I had ordered was thinner than this product that I had just received. This one is very thick and leaves a sticky residue on my skin. Even when I applied a thin coat. When you wash it off in the morning you can feel the sticky film coming off on your hands. I preferred the last product better than this one. If you change the product back to the original, let me know. If not, I will not be purchasing this product again. Also, it smells like fish.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my grandmother. She loves it and swears it does wonders. Used in conjunction with the hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> Super great serum for the price and it made an improvement to my skin&#x27;s texture after the first use.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.. I could see a difference with my first application. I am in my early 30&#x27;s my skin feels tighter and looks brighter. It also minimizes pores. I have had numerous compliments on my skin since I started using this product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed with this brand of C serum. I&#x27;ve used better. It&#x27;s a start for someone just starting out. May I say a younger person.</li>
    <li> After reading the myriad great reviews I was really excited and hopeful about trying these products (I purchased a cleanser and eye gel as well), but unfortunately they weren&#x27;t for me. I liked the idea of a really powerful, all natural and almost all organic line, but from the day I started using these products my skin became very dry, I broke out, and developed these random patches of scaly, tiny bumps on my face. I stuck with it for about 2 weeks hoping it was just a transitionary thing, but eventually I couldn&#x27;t stand what was happening to my skin. Switched back to a tried and true line (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson) and my skin is already looking better after 1 night, and on the road to recovery. If the the switch didn&#x27;t make it so drastically clear that the Oz Natural products were doing my skin a disservice, I may have thought, &amp;#34;Hey, maybe these just aren&#x27;t the best products for me.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve tried other products that maybe didn&#x27;t transform my skin and I didn&#x27;t necessarily *love*, but none have actually made my skin worse. Not to say that these products don&#x27;t work for others, but I guess you have to balance out the thousands of success stories with at least one unsuccessful one :/</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me! Essentially I have sensitive skin so I was a bit nervous about trying a new product. So far i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I could honestly say I love it! I feel my face very different it feels more smooth and I don&#x27;t feel my face dry. In a sense it feels hydrated. I would recommend this product to anyone who has any type of skin, mine being sensitive it reacted good to the product.</li>
    <li> i bought this previously and loved it. wanted to give it a 5 as soon as i ordered my now 2nd bottle. but then i received it a week ago and THE DAMN FORMULA CHANGED. previously it was so soft and watery that i could feel my skin drink it up and it was great putting it under makeup or any other products. now it just leaves a sticky layer of film that is visible. and if i try to layer anything over it, it just rolls up into clumpy dirt-like substance. sigh. what did you guys do to the formula?!</li>
    <li> great product, I use ir under my regular spf moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Notice no change at all while using. I used the whole bottle along side other items. I also tried this alone for 3 weeks. Nothing.</li>
    <li> I have been faithfully using this product as directed and see absolutely NO results. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome  u  know the vitamin c is working, it clears and brightens</li>
    <li> I have bought several bottles for friends and myself.&lt;br /&gt;We love the product.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Our skin has gotten better over time and the glow that it gives is addictive.</li>
    <li> Best cosmetic ever! Not just serum, cosmetic! Makes my skin smooth like a baby, maybe even better than a baby. It&#x27;s very thin which can be very easy to absorb, so you can put other serum you like after this. But this product itself is already did enough magic for me. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for two months and it isn&#x27;t working for my malasma caused by birth control. Didn&#x27;t cause irritation but also didn&#x27;t lighten the spots at all. I had my husband try it on a spot he has too, and it didn&#x27;t work for him either.</li>
    <li> I give this product two stars- one because it is cruelty free and the other because it didn&#x27;t cause my skin to breakout.  It did nothing positive or negative for my skin.  It simply did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second order for this product.  It feels great on the skin, makes your skin soft and the texture much smoother.  I will continue using this as it is helping me fight the look of aging.</li>
    <li> I say that I haven&#x27;t finish the bottle and so far so good.  I can see my skin clarity and I did not break out</li>
    <li> I love this.  When I use it in the evening with my regular night time routine, I wake up with the smoothest skin!</li>
    <li> Helped my skin look refreshed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 and the lines around my eyes have practically disappeared! I apply a moisturizer cream with hyaluronic acid immediately after applying the serum and it works great. I started using it twice a day at the beginning and after 4 weeks I started applying it only at night for maintenance. my skin looks healthy and bright.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum approximately 3 months ago; and, am very pleased.  I am soon to turn 50 and have never experienced dry skin until the last year, or, so.  After the very 1st use I could feel the difference! I highly recommend this product. I also use &amp; am very pleased with the OZ Naturals Facial Cleanser.</li>
    <li> A failed experiment for me.  I tried it for 2 weeks.  It sounded good but it actually did the opposite of what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It was okay, I saw some results not what I expected. I suppose I would need a second bottle. At this point I think I will keep it on the back burner.</li>
    <li> First: My skin looked more radiant after one application.&lt;br /&gt;Second: Almost immediately after the first application several small painful pimples that I already had surfaced and were gone the when I woke up the next morning (I apply the serum in the evening).&lt;br /&gt;Third: My forehead creases are smoother (my most aged area, stupid sun).&lt;br /&gt;Fourth: The day after I received the serum I got an e-mail from the company with directions on how to use it. Directions were both on the box and the bottle, but I thought it was nice for the company to send me an e-mail anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Fifth: Actually showed up 2 days after ordering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Just get the serum. You will not regret it. The price is fair and the product is a really good quality. Good for young and old skin types. Safe for even delicate areas like around the eyes. Seems to be clearing up my acne (Hooray!!), my fine lines are literally disappearing and the company seems to really care about customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: I apply probably a little more than directed but since I recently got it I wanted to give my skin an edge. I apply a drop to my forehead, one to each cheek, one to my chin, and two on my neck (I smooth these two drops down to my chest as well. After I smooth it all over I let it dry and apply raw unrefined Shea butter as a moisturizer. I will probably decease the amount I am using as I see results. The company claims less is more so After a month or so I will probably decrease to 3 drops for my whole face and one for my neck and chest. It really does spread nicely.</li>
    <li> Super product !!! Really works!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as strong other brands I&#x27;ve used but it does seem to do the job.</li>
    <li> This serum works!  After one month of use, I&#x27;ve noticed that it reduces wrinkles, evens skin tone and reduces pore size.</li>
    <li> Great deal; fast shipping; packed well, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. My complexion has greatly improved.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say about this.  I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin.  I rarely have acne but was using it to make my skin look younger.  I don&#x27;t see any change and have been using it for several weeks now.</li>
    <li> I truly believe in this product</li>
    <li> I like how it goes on, easy to use with the dropper no mess a few drops and your done. I use it on my stomach to tighten it up. I heard the serum was good for that also.</li>
    <li> Good serum.  Does not go on oily.  Does not break out my wife&#x27;s skin. Use after washing face and toner.  Then moisturize and use sunscreen.  A little goes a long way.  She was using Dermaceutic C 25, which costs a lot more money.  Her face looks good, and she is glad she gave this a try.</li>
    <li> This serum caused me to break out.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the visible effects of using this product to revitalize my skin</li>
    <li> This stuff was awful. I&#x27;m not sure how it got all of those positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It made my face dry and wrinkled looking. Had to wash it off and apply some cream...and my face was healthy looking again.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it as soon as possible!&lt;br /&gt;Hate to claim that they have bogus reviews...but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It&#x27;s super gentle on the skin: no irritation or adverse reaction of any kind and it has no smell. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and (granted it&#x27;s not all in my head :-) I think my skin is getting more radiant and even tone. It&#x27;s not a magic pill of course, but in conjunction with a healthy diet and other good things I am doing for my skin, I am hoping it will help me in slowing the aging process. Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this serum. I&#x27;ve used various serums from drug stores to department stores. I&#x27;ve used Skinceuticals, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Dior, Clinique, Loreal, Olay, Mad Hippie, Missha, etc. You name it I&#x27;ve probably used it! I&#x27;m a skincare junkie. I juice, exercise, and love taking care of my health, skin, teeth, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE WORST SERUM YOU CAN BUY! WORST VITAMIN C SERUM ON THE MARKET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astonished with so many positive reviews on this product that I quickly placed an order for this serum. A week later it arrived and when I opened the package I was shocked to see this serum was packed in a zip lock bag, it had no manufacturers box and had no safety wrap around it to confirm it was not previously opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum smelled awful, watery, and dried my skin on contact. I honestly believe OZ Naturals is a SCAM. The bottle was cheap, the dropper was cheap, and the product I doubt had any Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want affordable Vitamin C that contains Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate -- try Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve used it with great results.It is sold at most Whole Foods Markets. In addition, it is PROPERLY packaged,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS SERUM!</li>
    <li> Hope this will show some results and isn&#x27;t just a hyped up product.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on fine...a tad sticky but nothing to really complain about.&lt;br /&gt;I use the eye dropper and just add a few drops here and there all over my face and neck, then rub in with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I moisturize...just have been using it in the morning before my make-up.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I love this serum!</li>
    <li> I arranged for this product to be tested by a professional model, whose image has appeared throughout the country. Of course, her appearance is of supreme importance. She tested two products: The Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Vitamin C Serum. Here is her professional assessment, in our own words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These two products are excellent! I REALLY love these ones. I put on the vitamin C one first and let it dry which only takes less than a minute. Then put on the H.A., let it dry, and then use my regular moisturizer. The HA particularly feels like it is lifting my skin up and tightening it, but not in a bad way. Makes me feel instantly younger. The bottle with the stopper on these items is a real plus so that they stay fresh without vitamin depletion. I would definitely purchase these. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, excellent product--happy to give a big 5-STAR RECOMMENDATION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[note: sample product provided by OZ Naturals]</li>
    <li> Great product...really changed the texture of my face. My friends say I glowed...worth the $.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. I either apply it straight or mix it with my face moisturizer. Feels great! and noticeable difference in skin.</li>
    <li> While buying this product I was sceptical, But anyway I thought I will try and if I don&#x27;t like it it won&#x27;t be a big deal, but it works, really nice product, I use it every day and I feel that my skin looks brighter and softer. Thank you I will order it again ...</li>
    <li> I immediately loved this product I felt immediately the smoothness and it felt like it was healing my skin I have used it for one month and still love it as much as I did on the first day</li>
    <li> great item my 18 yr old daughter loves it also</li>
    <li> I liked very much serum&lt;br /&gt;And purchase another set of it</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t have an any problem and I loved it, it is amazing result and my skin feel smooth and younger after only two-three weeks use..</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this item.&lt;br /&gt;She told me it is easy to apply it to and be absorbed to the skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent Vitamin C Serum.  Will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation-review when I purchased the Derma Roller.  A lot of folks who bought the roller (Which I LOVE) also said to pair with a vitamin C Serum.  I went poking around and this item had great reviews and also was fairly priced.  At this point in my life I basically only buy organic face products or items with simple ingredients and this fits the bill.  I am very happy with the item.  It does go fast however so I may purchase a bigger one next time.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t get the point of the product.  After several days use I could clearly feel that I needed to exfoliat.  I could not see the product working until I began gentle exfoliation.  It works.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something which can improve facial aging. I purchased OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum, but I didn&#x27;t really expect its effect. However, after I use it everyday for a week, I saw the effects. I can tell that it is working for tired skin! When I use it before sleep, next day, I don&#x27;t see puff eyes and dark circle. Also I don&#x27;t feel face dry when I use computer for long time. The experience I would like to share is that when I stop using clarifying lotion, after wash face, directly use OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum, then I could see the effects. I think, at least, OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum can be a replacement for the clarifying lotion (basic face care step two). I ordered second bottle recently, and also some other products from the same maker.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have deep hyperpigmentation, and this serum is fading the dark spots.</li>
    <li> It just takes a few drops of this Vitamin C treatment to help rejuvenate the natural collagen in your skin, and I swear I could see a positive difference the very first day, though the directions clearly state that most people see improvement after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was grateful to receive an email that described the proper three-step process for using this product, starting with washing the face (preferably with cold water) with a gentle cleanser. The second step is to apply the OZ Naturals serum, and a few drops definitely is all it takes. You can tell you&#x27;ve got the right amount when as you smooth it all around your face you can tell that you&#x27;ve covered everything. The third step simply involves applying your favorite moisturizer, which helps ensure that your skin gains the full benefit of the Vitamin C and has some moisture to work with as the lines in your face noticeably begin to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a marvelous addition to anyone&#x27;s skin care program, as it helps ensure your skin is receiving the kind of nutrition it needs to really glow!</li>
    <li> I just started using this 2 weeks ago.  I do see a big difference in the smoothness of my skin. Looking forward to more results.</li>
    <li> When I work up, my face was 5 year younger than the night before :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the OZ Naturals product line.  This is the 2nd product of theirs that I have tested for free for review purposes, and I have loved them both.  I washed my face, used the OZ Naturals Ocean Tonic spray and then followed it up with this serum.  My skin is the smoothest it has been in a long time and I am extremely pleased.  It barely feels like I need a moisturizer after the serum because it works so well.  I love that it is cruelty free AND organic.  All in all, it&#x27;s a great product.  I will definitely be purchasing more of their product line in the future.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 5 days and have already noticed a difference in my skin. It feels so much softer and looks brighter and healthier. I wash my face with my normal face wash, use my normal toner, then I use this serum. It is nice and thick so you do not have to worry about it dripping and running all over. It goes on smooth and does not sting or have a weird smell. After I let it dry I apply my normal moisturizer. Just by adding this to my routine I feel so much better about how I look. I am excited to see more changes to my skin as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given this item for free to review and express my unbiased opinion, my thought and feelings on this item are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally have sensitive skin. This works well for me. Use it at night only. I discovered my makeup doesn&#x27;t stay on as well if I use it in the mornings hence the nightly routine.</li>
    <li> Oily, did not help at all and smelled to much like perfume. I did not like this product at all and would not buy it again. I try many beauty products and this is a miss.</li>
    <li> but it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  I was hoping for the glowing reviews of glowing skin.  But not so much.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Even after the first couple uses my face was smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. I couldn&#x27;t even wait a month to write a review. The laugh lines I had a disappearing. The lines on my forehead from all the funny and crazy faces I make are slowly but surely disappearing. The shipping was great got here when it said it would. I used a couple drops right when I received it. I wish it smelled like something like oranges or lemons or something. I apply it once in the morning after washing my face and apply my morning moisturizer. Then again after taking a shower for bed then apply my night time moisturizer. My face looks and feels alive, soft, and smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to anyone looking for a boost in appearance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;customer service is great also which is a plus!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me with my skin care and it is pretty good, so far. For a product that requires a topical application, this is the one to go to. If you are looking for a product that is similar but does not require a topical application, I use [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q Phytoceramides]]. This product is pretty good but another problem I have is that it becomes back-ordered from time to time and that is most likely due to it being an OZ product. Oz says buy and people follow. I say try [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q these]] and you will get them right away, save money, and be happy.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product. I received my Vitamin C Serum in about 2 weeks started using immediately.&lt;br /&gt;The results are great. I have furrows between my brows and they have already shown improvement. I can&#x27;t believe&lt;br /&gt;the results. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, this is an amazing serum for your face.  And, the price is fantastic.  You can&#x27;t loose with this.</li>
    <li> I usually use Obiga, but decided to try this one.  I loved it so much that I have order it for a second time.</li>
    <li> This product is just like everyone else described!  It starts working from day one and feels great.  Just a nice, simple, no frills, no fuss great product. This is the last Serum I will ever use, it is THAT good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I feel it is great. Very good product. I very love it!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this, which is a great testimonial because I have seen results.  My pores appear smaller and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> This product is not only affordable, but it REALLY WORKS!!  Using this Vitamin C Serum once or twice a day really does the trick - it keeps your face young and youthful looking and firms it up even better than the more expensive products out there - and its all natural and safe to use - I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> Using daily. Agrees with my skin and smooths it.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and a little goes a long way.  As I use different products for night and day I cannot speak to the long term benefits as I would be able to if this was all I was using.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be a good first step before I apply my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Best costmetic product ever. smooth wrinkle.was very surprise how it works so well.my face looks younger.many people noticed it.love it.will absolutely recommand it. great product</li>
    <li> Very good type Useful I advise him</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum Changed my skin care routine.  My freckles are getting lighter and my skin is glowing.  Vitamin C is an essential part of my skin care regimen.  I&#x27;ve tried 4 or 5 different brands and this is by far the best.  It is cruelty free, pure and organic.  It neutralizes free radicals in your skin.  I have very sensitive dry skin and this doesnt bother me or even make me red. Amazing.  Defiantly worth a try.</li>
    <li> All this product did was dry out my skin....total waste of $</li>
    <li> Love it!!! I am really impressed with this line of all skin care. Prices are reasonable and you see results. Love clinique also but don&#x27;t like the prices on their line. I think, no, I&#x27;m definetly switching to  Oz naturals. When I was 23 that was 19 yrs ago. I was pregnant with my 2 nd child and I had a major pimple. It started to get brown we&#x27;ll here it turned into a mole. My dr wanted to laser it off but I didn&#x27;t do it. 19 yrs later I started using the vitamin C serum ever nite before I go to bed and the pimple mole is fading. You can&#x27;t see it anymore. I&#x27;m really impressed with this product</li>
    <li> I am loving this. I makes my skin smooth and with less brown sports. It seems to be exfoliating my skin too.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of the product.  Not sticky.  Dries pretty quick.  Looking forward to improved skin!</li>
    <li> This review concerns the Oz naturals serum for dark spots on the skin.  There was no noticeable difference after the use of one bottle. I have decided not to pursue it any further.  Joanne Taylor</li>
    <li> Received a fake product, the prints on label is blurry than real one, smells different and texture is much more thin than real one and I&#x27;m breaking out like a teenage girl, I&#x27;m almost 40 and had no acne at all. Returning it. But got the other Oz serum which is real, works fine with me, no more acne since then.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with Oz Naturals products!  I love when a product does exactly what it says it will do.  The serums soak in to your skin not leaving a sticky residue.  Makes their Retinol moisturizer work even better.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I can&#x27;t say it enough.  My face is already showing improvement.  If you haven&#x27;t already researched the benefits of this stuff you should.  I am so thankful that I heard about it and then found this,  the very best of the best!  Thanks Oz Naturals.</li>
    <li> excellent vitamin c for the face and neck!</li>
    <li> Again OZ Naturals doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  I have been using this under my makeup and I love the way it feels.  My makeup goes on and stays put throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I was hoping it got  Rid of my brown spots&lt;br /&gt;BUT NO</li>
    <li> Not sure how much this helped, but my skin did get a lot clearer around the time I started using this product.  The bottle is nearly empty now so I&#x27;ll have to order another!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, per instructions, for well over a month. I see absolutely no change in my skin! I think that the owner of this company is capitalizing on the word OZ as in Dr. Oz of television fame who has absolutely nothing to do with this product. I also believe that any similar products recommended by Dr OZ are also a total scam. I will continue to use this product for awhile, primarily because I paid for it, but I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum from OZ naturals for a couple of weeks and love the beautiful glow that it gives my skin.  This has a wonderful and light citrus scent that is perfect in the mornings when I apply it before I put on my makeup to help me feel more awake, in addition to making my skin look and feel healthier.  I like the OZ Naturals thinks about their ingredients and uses quality ingredients while not over charging for their products, which keeps me coming back for more.  It is easy to use (a little goes a long way!) and has great results for plumper, fuller skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product!  I first purchased this just over 3 months ago when I was looking for a serum that would help with minimizing wrinkles and give my skin a healthier glow.  Soon to be 50, I&#x27;ve been noticing lots of changes in my skin.  I love the results I get from this serum!  Although I realize nothing will eliminate all of the signs of aging, I can definitely see improvement.  I use just a few drops into my palm and apply with my fingertips.  It is clear and the consistency of water and quickly absorbs into my skin.  Immediately I can feel my skin tighten and firm, and I love the baby soft feeling it gives my skin.  I follow it up with my moisturizer and make-up goes on great. It has become part of my daily morning regimen!</li>
    <li> I am still using. I like this product.</li>
    <li> so far I do not see any changes and I use it AM &amp;.PM.</li>
    <li> This product is great really see a difference</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Feels so good on skin and if your skin needs it, your skin will appreciate it.  Soak in, fast acting and just that little extra touch.  Love, love.&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
    <li> OZ NATURAL IS THE BEST LINE EVER!!</li>
    <li> I think they are just selling water with some glycerine in it. No difference after applying many times. I am surprised by number of raving reviews.Probably fake I guess !!!</li>
    <li> I have never tried any of the products that are advertised on the internet, so it is difficult to determine how effective it has been compared to other products.  I am not even certain if I have seen any improvement in my skin.  I think there may be some improvement and I am still using it.  However, I am not certain I will purchase another bottle.  The fact that there is no obligation to buy monthly is the reason I bought the first bottle.  Its diescription sounded it good and it made my skin feel smoother, but I am not certain it helped my wrinkles disappear any.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if it works or not but it&#x27;s cheaper than skinceuticals and it goes on smoother and non greasy</li>
    <li> Not too watery,not too thick.it makes your skin feel smooth and it made my skin glow a bit too.would buy this again..</li>
    <li> I did use it consistently. Not sure if it makes skin sensitive to sun. Skin became dark when I went out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m been using Oz Vitamin C serum for over 30 days and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m willing to give it more time to work.</li>
    <li> I believe it has helped minimize some of the fine lines on my face.  I try to wait a few minutes after applying before using other products over it.</li>
    <li> I am about to order my second bottle of Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and thought I&#x27;d take a moment to post a review.  I don&#x27;t  post reviews for many products, but the Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum is worth the time and effort of a positive review.  I love this serum!  I was highly skeptical when first ordering this product, but am at that age when skin just starts looking old.  You know how it is... stressful career, raising kids, lack of sletp, sun damage from my youth...  they&#x27;ve  all taken a toll on my skin.  I&#x27;d  read about the benefits of using a vitamin C serum, spent some time researching various brands, and decided to take a chance on the Oz Naturals line.  I am so glad I did!  This serum makes my skin brighter, plumper, and provides a healthy youthful glow.  I find I need less makeup as my skin just looks and feels better, younger and more dewy.  Outside of my cleanser and moisturizer - this serum has become my one essential skin care product.</li>
    <li> Oh I love this product! It makes my skin soft, beautiful &amp; radiant! After 1 week use of this product I noticed the difference  &amp; I&#x27;m so happy with the result. It&#x27;s light in the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!  Oz Naturals has the very best products.  You actually feel it working. Follow directions. Allow time to dry. Do 1/2 face.  You can see!!!</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.  It absorbs into the skin and helps the skin feel soft and smooth.  I just started using it so I can&#x27;t see any true results from it yet but it does definitely feel soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mid-50s, sun damaged skin, medium skin tone.  Been using this for about 4 months, but haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines or pores.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I had to review this product because it really works.  I can&#x27;t judge all the benefits it claims because I&#x27;ve been using Retin A on my face and neck daily since 1988, I&#x27;m 60 and wrinkle free.  But what I started developing a few years ago was undereye circles and a bit of undereye sunken look.  Tried all sorts of recommended products but nothing worked.  I started using this product about three weeks ago, and I really have noticed a great improvement under my eyes.  The dark circles are almost gone, and if I&#x27;m not dreaming, it seems like the hollows are filling out.  Also, I had a cancerous mole removed from my face a few years ago that left a white scar.  This discoloration, hypopigmentation, appears to be fading , too, or rather, blending in with my natural skin tone.  Retin A and this product are now my only go-to&#x27;s, so I highly recommend this product--because I really don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a hype.  I am seeing remarkable improvements even Retin A couldn&#x27;t address!  Update:  still a bit bothered by a negative comment about my use of Retin A and developing basal cell carcinoma at age 60! (Am very fair skinned and was a sun lover for years.) for those interested that Retin A may PREVENT skin cancer, please review skincancer.org&#x27;s positive comments about the possible benefits of Retin A. Again, just sayin&#x27;...</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night before I go to bed and I can tell the texture of my face has drastically improved.  This bottle will last me awhile and I am very pleased with this product.  I have several scars from acne and it has really smoothed them out, dark spots under my eyes have lightened and my lines around my eyes have even decreased.  It does not take much each evening and I will be using this daily.  Thank you great product.</li>
    <li> This is really good serum! Keeps my brown spots in check.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of using this product, noticed that my face looked worn down and a lot older.  I actually broke out even more.  I was hoping to get the positive results from over 900 highly acclaimed reviews, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product and have only used it a few times, so it is probably premature to write a review.  Nevertheless, I am so pleased with how this feels on my skin that I wanted to chime in right away.  I have sensitive skin, and other vitamin C serums I have tried have caused prickling, itching, and even red blotches.  This product causes none of that.  It goes on easily and feels great on my skin, very soothing. Whether it will live up to the hype, I can&#x27;t say, but so far I am impressed!!!</li>
    <li> So far I can&#x27;t my darkspot fading.  But I don&#x27;t see any more darkspot showing.  So I think I will need more time to see the effect.</li>
    <li> Of all the different liquid vitaminC serums I&#x27;ve tried this is the best!  Mixed with Hylauronic Acid it&#x27;s moisturizing and plumping to the skin, and it showed FAST results as far as my skin tone, skin texture and freckles fading!  Be sure to really clean your face before applying, so it doesn&#x27;t mix with residual cleanser residue or it may sting/irritate face.</li>
    <li> Great serum to use after a glycerin-based cleanser. Then use Oz Naturals Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum to keep skin hydrated and youthful.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected. Its too watery for me. I watch the youtube to test a good quality vitamin C serum. When you put one drop in your palm it will create like water drop.</li>
    <li> Applied before bed to clean dry skin, followed by my regular Olay nighttime moisturizer and was amazed at what the serum did to my skin when I looked in the mirror in the morning!  My skin looked plump and smooth,and the fine lines I usually notice in the bright morning light were already diminished!  I know it says to apply once a day but since the results were so dramatically good I applied in again in the morning under my moisturizer/sunscreen.  I have already placed an order for a second bottle because I do not want this to be on back order when I run out  It is THAT good! Please never stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!! This is my third bottle! I have seen great clarity on my face since using this serum! I use it at night before my Retin A cream. I love that combo!</li>
    <li> So far my skin feels smoother and softer and wrinkles are a little less noticeable.  I think it is over priced.</li>
    <li> Magic in a bottle! This serum has brought out the best in my skin. I was suffering from hyperpigmentation and scarring on my skin. It reversed the discoloration, helped lighten the scars, and brought out glow in my skin. I have now incorporated into my everyday face routine.</li>
    <li> I just got off the phone with Amazon because similar to some 1-star comments that I have read so far, I noticed a pattern of product descriptions, reviews, pictures and ingredients – all worded exactly the same among a handful of companies.  I have made a list of 20+ beauty companies on Amazon that I ultimately believe is 1 company, pedaling mislabeled and harmful products to Amazon customers by lying about ingredients and padding their reviews.  OZ Naturals is at the top of the list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon because this infuriates me!  These beauty products are expensive and as a consumer who doesn’t want to throw money away, I felt cheated.  I rely on Amazon for almost everything I need and I use their review system on a daily basis for items I even want to buy in a store.  I read reviews thoroughly and I do my research before every purchase, big or small.  Calling a company fraudulent, or in this case 25 companies, is a hefty claim that needs backing.  I’m no Erin Brockovich and I don’t have a chemistry lab at home, so I should stick to what I can prove in order to make a legitimate claim, such as Ingredients and Mislabeling of Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance:  this product in particular - OZ Naturals ‘The Best Vitamin C Serum For Your Face’, claims that it is completely Natural and Organic.  However, their product which is actually called “The Best Vitamin C Serum … “ contains Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate) which IS NOT the best Vitamin C.  Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate) is a SYNTHETICALLY DERIVED version of Vitamin C.  What people want in skin care products is vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid), the purest form of Vitamin C.  Also, this is a skin product but it contains Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, which is a KNOWN SKIN IRRITANT that can possibly damage and irritate eyes and is known to cause dermatitis.  Many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; companies use this as an alternative to parabens as a preservative, but no matter what their label claims, it is not a natural preservative.  So I find it very hard to believe that this product actually received 4,173 reviews and maintains almost a 5 star rating? That is not even close to being possible!  Not one single iPhone listing on Amazon even got close to 2,000 reviews and everyone has a cell phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list goes on and on with these companies. So far I have definitely identified OZ Naturals, OZ Shape, and InstaNaturals as companies that have Blatantly lied with regards to their ingredients.  With any of OZ Naturals Retinol products, which claim to have 2.5% Retinol Cream, they don&#x27;t even contain Retinol and that is not even listed as an ingredient.  Instead, it&#x27;s made with retinyl palmitate, an ester of retinol, a far inferior derivative.  To make a long story short, I believe that all of these beauty companies on Amazon with astronomical ratings are all the same company with fake reviews based on inferior products and ingredients.  There are people who have commented that they got cysts, rashes, and breakouts just from using some of these skin care items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon today and said exactly what I just typed.  I also noted the enormous amount of reviews these companies received (which all sound exactly the same among products with different company names), yet no one has actually heard of them or seen their products in the store.  I encourage anyone else who notices the same pattern to call Amazon.  It is simply not right that a sub-par-conglomerate-company ruin the Amazon review system that the rest of us rely on.  I do not appreciate these companies taking advantage of people and stealing their money. If these companies are lying about the actual listed ingredients that we can see on Amazon, who is to say what these moisturizers, serums and creams actually do contain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is still reading this, Please call Amazon!  And definitely don&#x27;t order this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products with Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid before that did wonders for my skin. I&#x27;m not seeing those same results with this brand. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help or hurt my skin at all, it&#x27;s just kind of...there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum for a few weeks now and am very pleased with the results. Brown spots are fading and with no irritation or burning feeling.  I&#x27;m also using the Super Yourh 2.5 Retinol Cream and  Eye Gel.  Super happy to find good for me skincare that doesn&#x27;t contain artificial ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce. I&#x27;ll definitely try other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Decided not to get any serum.  .The is aren&#x27;t just only slightly wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I have to say I love the way it leaves my skin. My skin feels smooth and I can see an evenness in it. I have purchased several other OZ products and I must say I am happy with all of them. I hope all of you have the same experience!</li>
    <li> Very good I love it so much I will order it again for me and my sister&#x27;s and friends again  it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! I bought some for my mom since she is very modest with her skin regiment and she actually loved it too!! Ill be purchasing more for her birthday coming up :)</li>
    <li> This is an okay Serum, I have seen some reduction in light sun spots on my face, but I don&#x27;t see any improvement in the texture of my skin</li>
    <li> Without these five-star reviews so good, now I don&#x27;t feel any obvious change in the wrinkles</li>
    <li> This serum helps reduce lines - I think.  At age 71 I still have very few, and try to remember to use this every morning after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Love it more than Cellex C.  With Cellex C, you need 2 products for the treatment.  The OZ product contains both components in one bottle.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working  need more time. but seems o.k. now.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I guess I was expecting too much! I have always had very nice skin with no blemishing but the product seems to have caused breakout.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if maybe I just needed to get used to it so I continued with the product but everyday it is the same.  One day it was so bad that it looked like I had a rash all along my face. I also am not getting the luminous effect I&#x27;ve seen others right about.  Maybe the product is too harsh to use every day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not all negative though - I do feel like the area around my eyes is looking better.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with minimal wrinkles but I feel like the product has improved the area around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep with it because I want so badly for all of the reviews to be correct.  I will change my reviews if this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I won&#x27;t be putting the serum on my face anymore but I will around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Like many I purchased this product with high hopes. However, after faithfully using it as directed for 4 months I see ZERO difference. I agree with other reviewers who said they might as well have been applying water for all the good it did. I finished my bottle today, but will not be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Very good product..I am very happy with it..I will be reordering soon...</li>
    <li> This works wonders.  I recommend it.  A little goes a long way too</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference yet after using it for three weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product by itself for two months now and I love it.This is forever a part of my beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;Results: I started seeing results within the 2nd month.  My forehead wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes are almost non existent. The lines around my mouth are less defined. After years and years of using expensive Retinol products I can say that this Vitamin C serum has worked way faster and with better results.</li>
    <li> Moving from sunny, cool breeze, Southern California to Lower Louisiana where the weather is stagnant and humid and the food is greasy my face broke out in horrible inflamed acne. My daily facial regimen wasn&#x27;t working and knew I needed to try something new. After doing some research I started using this product and noticed significant changes. Skin was brighter, acne reduced enough that was manageable, and even sun damage (dark lines, dark spots, etc) faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is use this product during night time and wear sunscreen or a moisturizer with spf protection during the day for better results.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It goes on smooth under makeup and dries quickly.  I have only been using this product for about a month, but I am seeing an improvement with my skin.  I still have wrinkles, but they have seemed to soften.</li>
    <li> Overall, my skin looks smoother and younger after a few weeks of using this product. However, I don&#x27;t see much improvement on the lines around my lips.</li>
    <li> Not sticky nor is there any nasty smell, soaks in right away.  With some time we&#x27;ll see if it works.</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with this purchase.  Thought it was a bit pricey, but, the bottle should last a good long time.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  My skin has improved since using this product.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any different yet!!!</li>
    <li> It definitely helped even out my skin tone. I used it once a night after my nightly shower with bio oil as my moisture.  I am allergic to lotions. Lotions cause my skin to itch and break out. I had a lot of small zits and blackheads on my forehead and face from pregnancy.  This serum minimized the zits a lot by the 3rd day. I got too distracted to keep my routine after my zits disappeared.  They didn&#x27;t come back for a month. I only used it for 4 days. A friend&#x27;s teenage daughter had a breaking out problem. I lend her my serum and after 2 weeks no more zits.</li>
    <li> I was surprised, this is a very high quality serum.  I have been using Obagi for years but I have converted to Oz.  Also, it is a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I have learned a very valuable lesson on Amazon especially with new or non brand name products they may have some reviews planted to up consumer&#x27;s confidence in their products. Personally this felt like water and dried out my skin. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Given the high expectations set forth by the claims of this product, I was a bit disappointed. Then again, I suppose there&#x27;s no magical cream you can put on your skin and suddenly expect it to improve drastically. As long as you have realistic expectations, you&#x27;d be satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you follow a regular skincare regimen (cleanser, toner, moisturizer), you&#x27;re supposed to apply the serum between the toner and the moisturizer. The cool thing about serums is that you only really need a couple drops for your entire face, so the 1 oz bottle can actually last quite a while. Since the bottle comes with a eye dropper type of dispenser, it&#x27;s very easy to limit how much you use each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the serum itself, there&#x27;s a very light smell-nothing too strong or offensive, and upon application, there&#x27;s a very relaxing cooling sensation. There&#x27;s no ingredients here that would dry your skin or anything, so it should be fine for all skin types. I find that it works best to apply it right before sleeping, though many apply it in the mornings as well. It does contain a plethora of skin-boosting ingredients, and the label claims that it&#x27;s 72% organic, though I have no way of verifying that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t guarantee that this bottle will magically make you look younger or anything, but it does do a great job of moisturizing the face. As always, the best way to have healthy looking skin is by having a combination of a healthy diet as well as a healthy skincare regimen, and it can&#x27;t hurt to add this to your daily skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this review updated as I continue to use the serum and note any significant differences.&lt;br /&gt;-Note that I was given a review sample</li>
    <li> Not heavy and absorb fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping for great results just as the reviews stated.  Unfortunately after using it for a month I find absolutely no change at all.  It doesn&#x27;t have an adverse effect, it just doesn&#x27;t have any effect.  I&#x27;m going back to the drawing board to find a less expensive product.  The price is a lot to pay for having absolutely no change at all.  It&#x27;s not that I hate it, it&#x27;s just that it is expensive water in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product, lasted forever!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time,excellent product,recommended to several friends</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum is a must for all skin.  It is like a facelift in a bottle.  I think Vitamin C serum is the plastic surgeon&#x27;s worst enemy or their greatest secret!  No other company has a better Vitamin C serum.  I will never be without this product. It is not only a great performer, it is cost effective!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C products do very well on my face, I sometimes mix it with other vitamin C products for its moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I use the serum first, and then my moisturizer. Research does indicate that Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid are important components in achieving radiate skin. If you continue to use this product keep in mind that a diet rich in plant-based nutrition, drinking good clean water, and moderate exercise will also enhance your results. The company that sells this item are very professional and helpful if you have questions. Hope this review is helpful in some small way.</li>
    <li> As good as all the other reviews say it is... will be buying it often. Great.</li>
    <li> Effective and lasted longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Who knows the quality. Too early to the wrinklers.  Klara</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!  It certainly rivals the super expensive department store products sold at Macy&#x27;s, Dillard&#x27;s, etc., but at a much better price.  Once you try this product you&#x27;ll be convinced, and will never go back to your old serum again, regardless of the cost.</li>
    <li> been using for a week still hasn&#x27;t made a difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The third bottle I received this time was filled low in the level of serum.  it barely got to the top edge of the label.  Unlike the two others that the level of the serum was up to the neck of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Good communication. Great directions!&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to seeing results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prone to pigmentation.  After using this product, within a week my skin started to even out.</li>
    <li> This serum caused me to have a break out. wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Oz vitamin C serum for about 4 months now and am so impressed with the results. I cannot tell you how many compliments I get on my skin and why is it I don&#x27;t age and I suffer from hyper pigmentation. I get microdermabrasion treatments once a month and my estitichian who likes to sell products is so impressed with my skin that she never makes any suggestions to me on what to use. I do have several items I use to protect my skin but this product has made a huge difference. Plus it is much better priced than anything you can get from an estitichian. I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
    <li> Good product. Have used it for a month.</li>
    <li> Great face serum.  Reduces wrinkles, doesn&#x27;t smell and lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> Noticeably improved  skin at the eyes.  Overall improved skin appearance.  I have sensitive skin and had no negative reaction, only positive.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seem any differents</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I try to have a spare on hand so I&#x27;m never out of it. It really does help your wrinkles, especially if you use a derma roller first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still young and wrinkle free, but I&#x27;m using this as a preventative. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks brighter and smoother since using and it will hopefully keep me as wrinkle free as possible for a long time.</li>
    <li> I suffered from acne for six years. I was desperate to try anything, so I oughttgis little miracle in a bottle. I didn&#x27;t expect massive results, just for a chance of some scars to go away, but imagine my surprise when I wake up a week later acne-free! I can&#x27;t believe it. My self esteem has sho through the roof. So glad I spent the money.</li>
    <li> I just started using together the OZ Naturals - THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin, OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face and ORGANIC Argan Oil For Hair, Face, Skin &amp; Nails - 100% PURE and I will update later.</li>
    <li> Love all of their products. They are natural and are great for your face &amp; neck.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Vit C serum, unfortunately it somehow disappeared from my bathroom after I had about 25% of it left in the bottle. So I&#x27;m trying another brand that was on sale at the time of purchase, not sure if it&#x27;s as good as this one yet.</li>
    <li> It seems to be great but will take time to tell how well it works</li>
    <li> My face is glowing after just a week and it feels incredibly soft! My skin soaks this up in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this!&lt;br /&gt;Also, no scent. I only need about 3-4 drops for my entire face, so this should last awhile.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I have been using it for less than a week and already see results in brightening of my skin. I&#x27;m in my early twenties and I love it! I also have acne prone skin which is why I got this serum, in hopes to brighten my skin and also get rid of beginners crow feet/smile lines. No breakouts so far and leaves my skin feeling super silky.</li>
    <li> I was an esthetician for over 4 years and have used my fair share of high end products (innovative skincare, skin ceuticals, pca, etc.).  I was a little skeptical at first, but just decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did because this stuff is great!  Highly recommended by someone who doesn&#x27;t waste time on a bunch of crappy products.</li>
    <li> Love it! My skin looks great after using this.</li>
    <li> Really good vitamin C product.  It isn&#x27;t as oily as I expected, either, which makes it even better in my book.  I hate feeling sticky or slick all day, and this doesn&#x27;t really have that problem!</li>
    <li> I earnestly tried this for about 40 days. This Vitamin C serum did not integrate well with my moisturizer, cleanser, or eye cream.  It made my pores appear bigger and created a film between my skin and moisturizer. This serum made my forehead breakout with redness (which prompted me to buy neosporin) and actually etched the first lines in my forehead.  The \\&quot;glow\\&quot; from this serum accentuated my fine lines.  I am a little baffled as to why this is a top seller (perhaps the price?) and why it is being lavished with exalting reviews from everyone.  I do not think it even comes close to the Skinceuticals C E ferulic in which the vitamin C seems more stable and derived from L-ascorbic acid.  I generally buy top selling/highly reviewed skin care items on amazon, but I would not recommend or buy again.  Unfortunately, it took more than 30 days for me to realize that this serum was doing more harm than good.  Also I am skeptical of the advertising copy.  I could not find any article from Allure Magazine touting this product.</li>
    <li> a great serum. . . will keep using it and buying more.</li>
    <li> disappointed will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Just started using this, hope  it helps!</li>
    <li> This might be a great product for some, but for me it gave me an itchy rash.  I&#x27;m hoping I will be able to return it&lt;br /&gt;and try another type of vitamin C topical serum.  All reviews I&#x27;ve read about it are positive, but there are some of us whio&lt;br /&gt;seem to get a bad reaction.</li>
    <li> This is liquid gold! It feels light.  My skin sucks it up.  It does not burn or have a smell. It feels natural and my skin loves this product.  I have tried other serums but nothing compares to this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference after over a month of use. There is not really a smell to the serum and I don&#x27;t feel anything working either.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s not sticky and dries quickly. Winter is always harsh on my skin and as I get older it takes longer to bounce back so I&#x27;m looking forward to improved skin!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> Love it! Been using it for 2 weeks and can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> love it, I&#x27;ve seen great result in just 2 weeks. I wish I would have found this serum when i was younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with this purchase. The bottle is a little too small, I&#x27;ve used it of less than a month and it&#x27;s already more than half used. But I do feel my skin feeling brightened overall. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> From the first use I could see instant results. I Usually buy all my skin care from Macys because I have sensitive skin. But after reading the reviews on this vitamin C I could not ignore it and bought it with the derma roller.  Both items worked as promised. I use the vitamin c day and night and my skin looks refreshed and rested when I get up in the mornings</li>
    <li> OZ naturals is a brand with trusted quality. Their products are reliable and this one is no less. Any treatment takes time to show resulta so have patience and wait for your product to work for you.&lt;br /&gt;this serum helps in reducing wrinkles and fine lines, it also helps in restoring vitality to the skin and making your skin texture more even and radient. This is a very good product and very easy to use thanks to the dropper style design.&lt;br /&gt;i was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a short time but I do like it</li>
    <li> I received  this in the mail after using the discount  price  so this is my  own  review of this product.  I been only using it  for 3 days so far after it came in the mail.  I been using it  2 times a day  , morning and night.  and I have noticed  that  my skin feels very soft  . I have not been using anything else  but this  product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best when your face breaks out</li>
    <li> There is also Phenoxyethanol which is a carcinogenic organic compound…..</li>
    <li> I see a clearer skin already, after only two weeks....will check out other products.</li>
    <li> I feel its a small start but i don&#x27;t feel strength is high enough. I did order a recent 2nd bottle while i research to find a higher grade  , strength and quality.</li>
    <li> Bought it for malasma and its working fast and perfectly fast meaning in just a couple days the darkness gets lighter</li>
    <li> Simply put, use of this serum for 1 week caused my husband to say, &amp;#34;You look 30 years old.&amp;#34; (I &#x27;m in my  60s.) It sounds implausible , but It &#x27;s true. It is smoothing&lt;br /&gt;and softening. I will definitely continue to use this and may try other Oz products as I like their ethics and natural ingredients .</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so good and soft, or looked better!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My face was brighter within 2 weeks</li>
    <li> The serum comes in an amber glass container, which protects against oxidation. The lid is a medicine dropper for dispensing the clear liquid.  The serum has a light scent, but I can’t really describe it.I used it on my forehead, cheeks, and around my mouth. I had some fine lines and wrinkles I was trying to make less evident, and also some spots on my cheeks. I didn’t want to just drop the serum on my face with the medicine dropper, so I put some on a Qtip and applied it to my face.  It doesn’t take much serum to cover all those spots. I only used about 4 drops for my entire face. The serum spreads nicely and the scent doesn’t stick around. Since you have to wait for it to dry, I apply it before brushing my teeth. It doesn’t take long to dry; when I’m done brushing my teeth, it’s dry, and then I apply my moisturizer. My moisturizer goes on very easily and I don’t have to use very much because the serum is a delivery system for ingredients.After using the serum for 12 days,I do think my skin looks brighter and more youthful. Also, the spots on my cheek aren’t as dark anymore, which makes my skin tone more even. My teenage daughter agrees that my skin looks brighter. That’s good because next week we go back to school/work and maybe my 2nd graders will stop telling me I look like a grandma now!  One can only hope.</li>
    <li> Once again impressed with Oz Naturals! Love this serum and I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Okay, I am almost throught the bottle of this OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is drying so you will have to use a moisturizer after.  No problem.&lt;br /&gt;2. I see absolutely! No difference in the color, texture of my skin.  Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;3.  Therefore it is a waste of my hard earned money!  As with many potions and lotions, very few really are cracked up to be what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and try something else if you want tangible results. :)</li>
    <li> I am  a 24 years old african american so i am dark skinned, came across this product, saw the reviews and decided to try it. I used it for about a month and half. It worked quit a bit i noticed a marked skin lightning  on my face. My dark sports i would say faded about 30%. Prons (It gives you a glow especially when you wear it under make up, it will help lighten up your skin to make it look radiant also it will help lighten dark sports if you dont have a very thick dark sports. Corns (its not very useful in terms of lightning up very large or very dark sport, it takes a while for you to notice a diff and also its really watery.  My doctor recommended Triluma for me so thats what i am using now. :)</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.  I use it nightly under my night cream.  Goes on easily, and seems to help smooth and tone my face/neck area.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference</li>
    <li> Delivered super fast.  I can see a difference after just 3 days!</li>
    <li> Great product, great company! I love the way this serum makes my face feel healthy, bright, and a soft. I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
    <li> Iam 38 years old and use it for the brown spots on my face and a few lines on my forehead. I combined it with a retinol night cream and works very well. You can see a brighter complexion and smoother skin in the first two weeks of using it. Iam on my second bottle and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing how quickly this product will clear up dark spots.  I tried everything over the counter I could find for the last year, but this one did it.  It took about 30 days for the spots to significantly fade.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed major changes in my three weeks of use, not saying it doesn&#x27;t work but this product is not magical. It might take longer. I am personally not loving the presentation and the cap, it can be tricky to use in comparison to other presentations; I tried the serum from 100 percent pure and I liked their texture and pump a lot better; it was easier to use and spread around the face. I will continue the product as my face is taking it well but might try a different one next time.</li>
    <li> The serum still gives great results, but with the addiction of new ingredients, it dries crusty. This makes it inconvenient to wear during the day.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I think some fine lines and wrinkles have gone away. A little goes a long way. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I can&#x27;t believe the difference you feel within a few minutes of applying it. It&#x27;s like some kind of a wonder medicine from Star Trek or something, truly. Everything written in the description is 100% true, which is really all you need to know to be confident that this product is worth buying every time. Cruelty free, check. Made in the USA, check. Organic, clinical strength, vegan friendly, check, check, check. It&#x27;s basically just liquid healthiness for your skin, your mood, and your overall well-being. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider buying another Vitamin C Serum after trying this.</li>
    <li> Love It, works well under make-up, and under ur SPF, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin gooey, it absorbs right in..</li>
    <li> I have not used this on a consistent basis to notice incredible results. Maybe incredible results could happen. I like how little you have to use, there is no odor and it makes my skin feel more firm and soft. Usually, at the end of I look tired my skin looks grimy.. but instead when I use this my skin looks more even and has a nice glow. If I decide to put makeup on I let it dry which does not take that long to do so. My mineral powder goes over it very nice. Whenever I decide to wear makeup now I always put this on first, it makes a very nice base.</li>
    <li> Some serums are too watery in consistency. This one worked out well. Still need more time to see changes in my skin. It is softer. I haven&#x27;t seen the brightening effects yet.</li>
    <li> I am quite positive that this solution did not have active Vitamin C at all. It would just sit like an oily mess on my face. No tingling that one normally gets when applying 20% C serum. I purchased another brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum for about a month. This is a great product. My face and neck appears to be firmer. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Wow! I started using these drops and my girls noticed how nice I look; pretty. I 68, and have been looking for a product like this for a long time. Most other brands cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive to all sorts of makeup and skincare products, so it takes a lot of time and effort for me to find something that works. I am ecstatic to say that this Vitamin C Serum really works! After only a few days of using it, I can tell that my skin is more radiant, smooth, and bright. I have a few wrinkles on my forehead and they are slowly disappearing. I was using the Estee Lauder Perfectionist CP+R Wrinkle Lifting Serum right before this, it was working but it wasn&#x27;t helping my skin tone as much as the Vitamin C Serum so I returned it and will stick to the Vitamin C from now on. Thank you for making an amazing product! :)</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It smells better than other vitamin C serums I have tried and has a higher concentration of vitamin C. It feels great going on and I feel good using it. My dermatologist said that vitamin C is one of only 3 things that helps skin look better (as in anti aging ingredients). I think this fits the bill nicely for my serum!</li>
    <li> it really does work and when i consistently used it i had people compliment on my skin. i have acne prone skin and it does not break me out. i recently switched to a cheaper brand and dont notice an improvement. i will go back to OZ naturals once im done.</li>
    <li> Arrived in timely fashion in good condition. Having been using for a few weeks. Haven&#x27;t really noticed any great improvement. Will finish bottle, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, will not reorder.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a dramatic difference after all the glowing reviews here but I finished the whole bottle with no results. On the flip side it did not cause any break outs so thats good right? I have used the mario badescu vit c serum in the past with more success but it was a little expensive for me... so I guess I&#x27;ll continue to be on the lookout for a good vit c serum to fit my budget.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so far but i like it</li>
    <li> The best Vitamin C Serum for your face - bar none. And all OZ Naturals products are CRUELTY-FREE. There are many lotions and potions I will leave at home when we travel, but OZ Naturals is not one of them. I can literally feel and see my skin brighten and tighten with the Vitamin C Serum. It is the first thing I do in the morning after using their Vitamin C cleansing lotion. Truly a gift to my face!</li>
    <li> I recieved it on time , and just applyed it being honest it doesnt really tighten your skin .. i feel it smooth and soft but lets see how this goes .. hopefully it works !</li>
    <li> Between all the Hyaluronic Acid Serums in the market Oz Natural is the best product in my opinion. I have never get such a perfect result from other products. I can say that when you use this product you will not feel any burning feeling on your face. You can use it with your daily moisturizing creams as well. You see the results like a shiny, moisturized and anti-aged skin. You feel the good results in a short period of time. My skin generally shows some allergic reactions so easily but with this product my skin never showed any allergic reactions. Thank you for everyone that contributed in the making of such an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> did not see a big difference after using it for few months.</li>
    <li> I was using a vitamin c serum from another company and decided to give this one a shot because of the reviews and the price. Within a week I was breaking out in HUGE cystic acne on my forehead and chin!! Nothing else changed in my routine other than using this serum. I stopped using it and no new pimples have formed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that many of the &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; reviews for this product are fake.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted customer service and they said the ph level is 9.2! My last serum was 3.5 so no wonder my face reacted poorly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and don&#x27;t see any good result on my skin AT ALL!! It&#x27;s a waste of money, really!! So disappointed! It&#x27;s not even as good as the vitamin C serum I used before this one. No smooth, no brighten, no wrinkles reduction! I&#x27;m back to the old product! Save your money guys. I wonder how many good feedbacks for this product was actually fr the seller...</li>
    <li> I thought it is over rated, it actually bright my skin. And help to remove acne scare, worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have done a comparison of Oz Naturals -- Vitamin C Serum against Lilian Fache&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. Let me say a little about myself...I&#x27;m a 48 year old female, white, blue eyes and take exceptional care of my skin. The feedback I receive from others (unsolicited) is they are amazed when I tell them my real age. I apparently look like someone who is in her early 30&#x27;s. It&#x27;s very nice to hear but I&#x27;m not quite drinking the Koolaid. haha! I am a firm believer in taking fish oil daily for healthy hair, skin and nails...and I have brainwashed myself into thinking it has heart health benefits, too. The main reason I take fish oil (Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega) is because I don&#x27;t eat enough fish on a weekly basis, so there is a need for me to use a supplement. I also take a daily multi-vitamin supplement (because I find it impossible to get all of those vitamins in my daily consumption of relatively healthful food). My skin care is all on my own. I wish I could spend $$$ with my derma doctor on some advanced skin treatments for those little lines around my eye area and get a V-beam treatment for my rosacea but that is not happening right now. I wash my face with a creamy low suds face wash, blot dry and then apply serum (let dry for a minute), face cream (SPF 50 in the AM and one without SPF at night), a good eye cream and I use a Clarsonic 2x weekly (I think too much use can be irritating to my rosacea). So, that&#x27;s my background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the serum. After reading about the benefits of vitamin c, it&#x27;s supposed to help break up those evil brown spots, overall brighten the skin and even out skin tone. I started with the Oz Naturals product first because it features 20% Vitamin C (very potent) + Amino Complex + Hyaluronic Acid, using it twice daily on my face, neck and decolletage. I finished the Oz Naturals bottle. There was a VERY noticeable difference in the brown spots on my face...they actually faded a good amount! It also did a good job in helping reduce redness from my rosacea (which I am cursed with) and brightened up and evened out my skin. I decided that I&#x27;d do additional research and try a different brand that also had very good reviews which was the Lilian Frache brand. I finished the bottle, using it twice daily on my face, neck and decolletage. I think it somewhat maintained the results of the Oz Naturals but I think my skin back peddled a bit. I am not convinced it&#x27;s as good as Oz. The LF bottle is finished and I will not repurchase. Hands down, I am now repeating a purchase of the Oz Naturals serum because IT IS THAT GOOD!!! I get nice results from it. I highly recommend you try it and see for yourself. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Feels light and absorbs beautifully -- I saw an immediate glow after my first application and more dramatic changes after a few weeks.  I love the fact that it contains high-quality natural ingredients and is cruelty free.   Will be putting this on my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Received as expected!</li>
    <li> I am 40 years old with malasma/sun damage on both checks. I have combination skin and some fine lines around eyes, mouth and sadly, the skin on the neck is simply not taut anymore :(. All the rave about vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid led me to search amazon for a product with these ingredients. The rave reviews prompted me to buy this product. I finished the entire bottle, applying twice a day about 5 days/week for several months. It is very drying to the skin, which makes the skin appear even more wrinkly before I apply moisturizer to soften it.  It has a musty odor that you get used to. It is very liquidy, not gel-like at all. It lasted a while. It absorbs quickly. I had no reactions to it. Unfortunately, it did nothing else. I wonder if it is the product itself or if simply, vitamin C and H. acid is not  living up to its hype?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this it&#x27;s awesome thank you Jesus, I hope to get more asap this really works great so healthy for our faces</li>
    <li> Finished.  Don&#x27;t see much difference.  Maybe just not for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. I recommend</li>
    <li> My mom loved it. She&#x27;s in her early 50&#x27;s, and she said she noticed her skin looks significant different, more radiant, and wrinkle reduction. Will keep buying for her.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work ...unfortunately we can&#x27;t always get what we want ! I waited to review this product until I finished the bottle to give it a fighting chance. Pro&#x27;s : It&#x27;s not oily... It virtually has no smell. Con&#x27;s there was absolutely no visible difference. It was as if I was applying water every single day for a month. Nothing!  So my opinion is.. please don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  Up there with more expensive cellex-C!</li>
    <li> Love it. No stinging feeling. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! My daughter has suffered from extreme acne for several years (she&#x27;s 21 now) and has tried every medicine and treatment on the market and available through her dermatologist. This serum was the first thing that we e found to keep new acne at bay and diminish existing acne scars. We are so thankful for such an amazing and affordable product line!</li>
    <li> Used it for 2 months. Not see any difference for my pigmentation</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and have not noticed any visible results. However, I&#x27;d like to give this serum 90 days tto allow for more significant results. No beauty product will work overnight. For now it receives 3 stars as it is not a miracle product that works wonders at lightning speeds.</li>
    <li> Wonderful feeling, not greasy,&lt;br /&gt; morning and night! Will definitely by again!</li>
    <li> Does actually  what the description  says this product improves skin tone and texture.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped with discoloration or fine lines :(</li>
    <li> It IS a good serum FOR,the PRIce!!!L</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this on my skin. My skin is looking brighter and more healthy</li>
    <li> Do help to reduce the dark spot.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Haven&#x27;t finished my first bottle just yet ( close) but it definitely has faded some brown spots on cheeks &amp; gives skin an amazing glow!  The spots aren&#x27;t gone but they ate faded and less visible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and the formula seems to be working for my skin type (oily).  I feel my skin is brighter and glowing more and it doesn&#x27;t break me out, which some Vitamin Serums tend to do.  I am very happy with this product and I use it in conjunction with the needle rollers (needle therapy).</li>
    <li> Did nothing To my skin. Did not tighten it, did not close the pores or lighten blemishes. I applied it diligently twice a day for at least a month. I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product works great it make my face feels tight.</li>
    <li> Not a good product at least not what it promised,I am better off with a honey and coconut mask made from natural ingredients , don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Not sure about the product.  Doesn&#x27;t feel good on my face.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My favorite store...</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles and I&#x27;m on my second bottle (used about half on 2nd bottole). Results? nothing. I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do on your skin since there was no difference on my skin after using 1 and a half bottles. Not buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but not great when it comes to other Vitamin C serums I have tried.  My personal issue with this one is that it made me break out really bad. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have reasonably senstive skin but have never had this issue with other C serums.</li>
    <li> Honestly, cannot tell any change in my skin since I have been using this product. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Within a couple of days I saw a noticeable difference in my complexion.  I will definitely buy this again and continue to use it. I use it at night after I wash my face and then put the OZ Naturals Super Youth Retinol Cream.  Awesome products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Immediate results!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 33 year old male, and I can see immediate results in the density and firmness of my skin. I will mention I take many herbs and detoxifiers which I economically purchase from Amazon, which hepls! To me the product has immediate and satisfying results.&lt;br /&gt;-Leonardo Fuentes Vargas</li>
    <li> In a few days I noticed the difference.  I used product on my entire face including under eyes. I have sensitive skin and I was impressed.  Great for all skin tones.</li>
    <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Works just like the $$$$ brands for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;My face says thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product! My old acne scars are gone!</li>
    <li> You can feel the tightening of your face after applying this serum. It is not at all greasy and fully absorbs into skin after thorough cleansing. Let it completely absorb and allow your face to dry before applying a moisturizer. Really helps brighten the skin and reduce appearance of lines. Really.</li>
    <li> Have used daily aprx 3 weeks as directed. No tingling, nothing. Water goes on and feels the same way. No change in appearance either. Not asking for miracles here but doesn&#x27;t perform at all. Save your money.</li>
    <li> My wife is a big fan of quality cosmetics and a Mary Kay director so when Oz Naturals offered me a sample of this for review I decided I&#x27;d let the expert decide. She&#x27;s been using this serum as part of her beauty routine for a few weeks and I recently asked her for some input for my review and she loves it. She said, \\&quot;it&#x27;s working!, especially next to my eyes, I can totally see the difference babe, give it 5 stars\\&quot;...well, for a woman that spends that much time in front of the mirror AND sells cosmetics professionally, that&#x27;s a huge statement.</li>
    <li> first off I am not a paid reviewer. not a computer. OMG this vit c serum is the best , the reviews are right! I have acne prone skin and it did not clog my pores, it really really works. I want to buy a dozen of these just to save them . my skin is glowing . its hard to find a anti aging product that wont clog my pores . this one is it!!! my new favorite skin product.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  A clear difference in skin texture.</li>
    <li> I am about to start using my second bottle of  this serum. It really made my skin look great... Smooth, younger, hydrated. I even have my husband using it now. It is one of the better vitamin c serums that I have used( and I have used a lot)!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It works very well.  I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have sensitive skin, and have no problem using this serum.</li>
    <li> Friends noticed change in skin right away. I was surprised they noticed.  Smoothed out skin texture.</li>
    <li> Nice and light serum.  Reacts well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought OZ Naturals The Best Hyaluronic Acide Serum and the Best Vitamine C Serum, I have been using both every day/night. It is not greasy,  and easiler to apply, I  do not see skin improvement, not lighten the skin, nor reduce fine wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Great antioxidant, I use it once a day on clean skin and I find the product to be very good and not irritating on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on having seen it in a magazine and reading the thousands of reviews.  It is not potent AT ALL!  Going back to my original vitamin C serum.  This is like water....not sure it has active vitamin C.</li>
    <li> Great serum and although I can&#x27;t comment on anti aging effectiveness as I&#x27;m 29 and stay away from the sun however the upper fine lines under my eyes have disappeared. I also have super oily skin, this doesn&#x27;t make it more oily, I&#x27;m able to wear it under any moisturizer without any issues. The scent is pleasant , will be re ordering again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and really works</li>
    <li> I will order another.</li>
    <li> Pretty good oil. My wrinkles are still there though.  Lol!  I guess it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Used a whole bottle every night after my face cleanse, didn&#x27;t see any difference. I bought a different one before on Amazon that was like 13 bucks and that one actually made a difference.</li>
    <li> I never leave product reviews but had to for this since I was hesitant to buy it.  It seemed to good to be true at this price, when every other &amp;#34;dark spot corrector&amp;#34; is so expensive.  In just a few weeks, the huge dark spot on my forehead has faded.  Not only that my my skin tone in general is WAY better.  I apply in the morning &amp; evening to a clean face as directed and followup with Aveeno moisturizer.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I highly recommend it. I get more compliments about my skin after I started using it. I spread it thin as recommended and it does wonders for my skin. In fact, it makes your look younger after about two days of use. I&#x27;m in my 60s, but have been told I look as if I&#x27;m in my 40s.</li>
    <li> Honestly worth the wait and money , you just feel the ingredients kicking in right after the first second . Skin feels new and supple , healthier !! Def a 5***** product .</li>
    <li> My new favorite facial product. Seems to balance out my skin. Feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Everybody reaches for the vitamin C  when cold season is around and the benefits to boosting the immune system are established. But with all the emphasis on &#x60;age reversal&#x27; (or at least retarding) other aspects of ascorbic acid are in the spotlight. Vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid) is key to the production of collagen, a protein that aids in the growth of cells and blood vessels and gives skin its firmness and strength and helps your skin repair itself. It is an antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage - free radicals are unstable molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, place OZ Naturals high dose (20%) Vitamin C serum coupled with Vegan hyaluronic acid on your face  and all the &#x60;science info&#x27; becomes visible - almost immediately. Oz Naturals has a fine line of products and combining them or finding the particular ones that work best with your skin type (Fitzpatrick + quality of moisture inherent in your own skin) will give you near instantaneous satisfaction and the appearance of younger integument. Grady Harp, August 14</li>
    <li> This is the first facial serum I have ever found where I actually saw immediate results. I am 50 years old and purchased this serum to reduce my wrinkles and dark spots. The dark spots were instantly diminished and continued diminishing even more over time. Within a week my crows feet also were smoothing out and my face appeared more toned and youthful overall. I know this sounds like a commercial and I too have tried many face serums that made claims which never actually happened. But for once a product actually does all it claims and more. I was so pleasantly surprised at the immediate results and even more impressed with the longer term improvement. I am also extremely impressed with the natural ingredients that are 72% organic.</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands on products for my face.  I have melasma (dark spots).  I have used this product for a week.  I am SOLD.  I am now on-line ordering another two bottles because I can see that I will go through this bottle within a month. I have rarely used a product where you can see a significant difference in the lines in your face and the texture of your skin.  This is a great product.  I highly recommend.  I also bought the OZ Best eye gel.  That is a great accompaniment to this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning. Item caused a terrible chemical burn.  I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t normally have any kind of sensitive reactions. My face broke out in little whiteheads and I had a rash that reminded me of when I use to get poison ivy every place I applied this.</li>
    <li> Great serum! Absorbs quickly. I have applied this first then use Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Facial Cream for nighttime use. I have noticed positive improvements in my dry skin.</li>
    <li> MIRACLE WORKER in less than a month my black spots dissapared. I had used all other conventional creams to help me with acne spots  in my face, this SERUM is a MIRACLE WORKER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was involved in a car accident that left me stitches in my face, with an obvious disgusting mark. The scar is almost invisible to the naked eye, and its all do to this serum.</li>
    <li> Oh yes !!!!!! This product is wonderful . I have 3 family members that are using it as well after seeing my results in just 3 short weeks.</li>
    <li> this serum is SUPER GOOD GOOD GOODDDDD, this is my first time using serum and  I&#x27;m so lazy to describe how it is but you gonna try it and you won&#x27;t regret !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I doubt if it is even real Vitamin C serum. Seems like just sticky water and does nothing to the skin. I would never buy this product. I think, all the positive reviews are rigged and given my associates of the company or the owner himself/herself.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  used it for many years.  lightens wrinkles and smoothes skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all OZ Naturals - this is a winner and I will not let myself run out of this product!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle. love it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately haven&#x27;t seem a great improvement in old acne scars. My skin tone doesn&#x27;t loom more even either. Bummer so many people had great reviews. Not for me.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel so soft and smooth with regular use.  Will definitely buy more when my bottle runs low.</li>
    <li> This product goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t take much and I love the product so far. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Face turn lobster red almost immediately. Found out I am also allergy to this. So frustrating. Again took 3 days for face to return to normal.</li>
    <li> No Change, no improvement . Don&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> waste of money, doesn&#x27;t work !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 3 days since I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m not going to say now my skin is gleaming with beauty and radiance with no blemishes because there&#x27;s no such thing as an overnight miracle product. However I used this product after using my derma roller at night. I woke up and my face was still a little swollen from derma rolling but after an hour, my face just looked healthier. I suggest using this at night with no moisturizer. And if you&#x27;re going to use it during the day you should moisturize your skin after using OZ Naturals. I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple or blemish appear since using, so I&#x27;d like to think this is helping (plus dermarolling). Oh also, only get this product if you&#x27;re planning to use a dermaroller because the dermaroller allows the awesome ingredients in the OZ Naturals to get deep into your skin!</li>
    <li> So far, it is keeping my skin very firm, the verdict is still out on the brown spots...</li>
    <li> I used it for a few weeks and didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I could&#x27;ve been using water....</li>
    <li> Moisturizing.  Don&#x27;t know if this stuff works but it makes my skin feel nice.  Only been using for a week so far.</li>
    <li> I think its a very good product!! I can tell a difference!</li>
    <li> what can I say? I am almost 40 years and all the people who know me thinks I am 30 wow I feel awesome !&lt;br /&gt;Definitively, I recommeded this serum 100% Today, I just spent 144.00 in more products just because I love them so much&lt;br /&gt;I am Erika Lohr</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me ...waste of money</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the BEST serum there is! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I see and feel the great results!</li>
    <li> best vitamin C ever! Im so glad i bought it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 29 and am new to using serums and vitamin c serum in particular..I started with body shop vitamin c and I dint notice any significant difference but I liked using it cause I dint have any breakouts since I started using it..&lt;br /&gt;When it got over, I did my research n tried to find something that I could afford and had good reviews..this product is good..it keeps the skin firm n taught..evens out the skin tone..and reduces breakouts..sometimes I even use this as a base for my moisturizer and foundation</li>
    <li> Very good product me and my wife see the diferent withing a week</li>
    <li> It may work for other people but my wife can&#x27;t use it because her skin turned really red after only one time use</li>
    <li> I really did like this serum..It was a bit watered down..or lack of consistency but overall I honestly did see results in about 3 days. I saw a much more clearer and brighter complexion. It does the job it says it would and a little more. My pores were less visable..I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. It leaves my skin softer than another brand I bought.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is very gentle to my face which is quite sensitive.  I have noticed that my complexion looks brighter and more hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with sun spots and acne scars. They were horrible and I hated them. I love this serum! It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all, and I think it has diminished those spots but it has given my skin a glow that it did not have before. I am still continuing to use this and I am happy to say that it is still working great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for over a month now and my skin looks firmer and feels incredible. Will definitely keep buying!</li>
    <li> goes on like water, and can&#x27;t say I see much difference.  Don&#x27;t hate it, but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> Works great. I still am looking great at 74.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Lite to wear all day.</li>
    <li> I bought it to get rid of my acne scars and marks. Its been 5-6 weeks and yes, I can see difference. My skin is very bright now and looks fresh. Acne marks and pigemtation as well as scars are the same but I believe this will take time. Its only a month so I am optimistic about it. I didnt know that I was suppose to use it once a day. I used it every daY twice a day :( But now that I know, I use it in the morning. I use this with my dermaroller</li>
    <li> Broke me out. No effect seen.</li>
    <li> Cheating, i bought the oz vitamin c  it was very good product, i told all my friend buy it. Last week i order 2 bottles they was same lable, but the product was totally different, i try to applied it ,  my skin was itching and turn red, i have to go to see dermatologist doctor.  It was terible.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks better - softer and brighter.</li>
    <li> Finished the whole bottle and it didn&#x27;t do anything. Will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, have been using it for about six months and see much improvement.</li>
    <li> There seems to be a lot of hype around this product and in my case it didn&#x27;t live up it. I found this product watery, and could see no changes to my skin despite using it twice daily for two months. I really wanted it to be great! So feeling disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I believe there are two vitamins for my face, A and C; and I prefer at 20% at a minimum. OZ C holds its concentration longer than most and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin clear and look younger! It will not take away my eye wrinkles but smooth out skin. This is my second bottle and I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, part of a good skincare regime.  The only negative I might mention is it made my face feel a bit too tight, BUT for some that&#x27;s a good thing, me I like my face feeling a bit &#x27;softer&#x27; but it&#x27;s great value and I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the Super Youth night moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a semi-thick gel like consistency and spreads nicely on the face.  The problem is that once it dries, it leaves my face feeling tight (definitely not hydrating) and feels like it&#x27;s coated with a dry flaky mask. On the first night I used it along with the Super Youth moisturizer, I noticed the moisturizer was having a hard time blending with the serum and left thick white streaks that took a while to absorb.  I tried it only once during the day with another moisturizer and my normal SPF under makeup and my skin looked horrible.  I&#x27;ve resorted to using this only at night and using Alpha Hydrox Retinol ResQ or AH Souffle over it.  During the day I&#x27;m using the Super Youth with my SPF and cushion compact.  I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s finished then look for another Vitamin C serum that I can use more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really bummed about this because I read so many glowing reviews and was excited to try it, but it seems like the formulation might have changed and I got the new batch.</li>
    <li> I ordered the second bottle since I liked it a lot. However, the consistency is not the same as my previous order. This one is almost like gel (not watery) and the color is a bit yellow. I was afraid that this could be a defect but I tried it on anyway. Luckily, there has been no reaction on my skin. Not sure if I should return it or just keep it.  Update: I just found out that they changed the formula so that&#x27;s the reason the liquid is thicker.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! As a woman in my early thirties, it is a must! Lightweight, effective and lasts about 6 weeks (I only need a few drops  a day:)</li>
    <li> Any oz natural product is amazing. I use it all. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old, just had my first baby so my skin was in horrible shape, Pregnancy hormones did a lot of damage to my skin especially my face. I tried many brands to help my face get back on track. Now being a mom looking younger is a must.This product does it, my face look younger,smoother, more vibrant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over two months and I my skin has never looked more radiant and bright. I am over 60 years old and people compliment me on my complexion all the time. I take good care of my skin and this is part of my daily regimen to flawless and wrinkle-free skin.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great. I have used this for awhile. I don&#x27;t like to give reviews until I have used a product long enough to make a concise opinion on it. ( I don&#x27;t like reading a reviews about skin products after being used for two short weeks; this tells me nothing!) Anyway since using this product I have had several compliments on my skin. My skin is toned and has a youthful look to it. One lady asked me why I didn&#x27;t I have any noticeable pores. Also I used it alone without any other major products for quite sometime to make a proper judgement on the product by itself! I just recently bought some niacinamide serum; vitamin B3; which I have used forever to go with this product. However I used this product without the niacinamide serum to make a true judgement call on it. So all in all I love OZ Vitamin C Serum and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I honestly did not like this serum. There are other serums out there that work much better. This didn&#x27;t do anything for my face at all. I did not receive this product free for a review like so many of the reviews here.... just putting that out there.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has no smell and does a great job at supplying your skin with vitamin C. No stickiness and absorbs beautifully. Much more reasonably priced than other brands. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum, it does not leave a greasy feeling. I use it morning and night following washing my face with the Oz cleanser</li>
    <li> Great to soften skin and makes my face feel so much younger!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried vitamin C serum from several top product lines such as Skinceuticals and Skinmedica, and OZ Natural works better and faster at erasing fine lines and discoloration from sun damage. Products ship quickly, are packaged well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. On my second lot of it. Suits my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I loved using this serum. I was very surprised how well it worked considering how inexpensive it is compared to other products on the market. It absorbs into my skin well, and I only had to use a small amount. I noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin almost immediately, and an improvement in texture in about two weeks. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me at all. I ended up throwing it out and buying a vitamin C serum from Murad.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky on my skin, glides on not sticky</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I have seen great results since I started using this.  My skin is no longer red or bumpy.  I love it.</li>
    <li> First time trying it and I loved it. Will definitely continue using. I have acne scars and am trying to reduce them with the use of dermal roller and this. The dermal roller helps the absorption. I&#x27;m noticing a difference and my skin feels better than ever.</li>
    <li> Great but should have been a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> This is my first amazon review, and I am happy it is with this product. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this didn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. It made my skin smooth and bright. It has had a very dull appearance lately as I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with an autoimmune condition that has completely destroyed my skin. This is my relief right now. I use it after the Oz naturals Vitamin C face wash. I feel great about what I&#x27;m using on my face. Its only been two days, but I cant wait to see my skin in a couple of weeks if these are the results I&#x27;m getting already!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. I love this stuff. It goes on very nicely. My 45 year old skin looks amazing. I do get chemical peels to assist with my skin tone, but I feel that this has helped tremendously to keep it looking fresh. My skin is very soft and hydrated. Wear sunscreen.</li>
    <li> my skin feels softer i think</li>
    <li> Made my feel firmer and the lines are almost gone! I will continue to buy this, I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> Love it! I noticed in the beginning of the year the effects of not properly taking care of my skin. Now in my early 30&#x27;s I noticed my skin not being as firm, my pores were larger, and my skin tone being uneven. After receiving a couple of samples of pricier face serums such as Philosophy, Chanel, and Dior I was hooked. I realized the difference serum can do to your skin. The only downside was the price. These serums ranged from $75-$180, which was not in my budget. I decided to see what I could find online. After researching and reading a ton of reviews for this brand and this particular serum I decided to give it a try. I have now used it for 1 month everyday, morning and night. Along with a facial toner device and moisturizer I have noticed a big difference already in the short time I have been using it. My skin looks more toned, even, and my pores looks smaller. I would definitely recommend it, in fact I already have to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I have only had this serum for a few weeks but I like it so far! I had read a lot about the benefits of vitamin c and hydralauric acid  (spelling?? Haha) and this seemed like a great choice from all the reviews. I put it on morning and night. I feel like it has made my skin look fresher and it looks slightly firmer too. I only gave 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to reap the full effects but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I honestly do not know why this product has so many five star reviews. I actually purchase a vitamin C serum from my dermatologist that contains 10% vitamin C (this product allegedly contains 20%!) as well as other similar ingredients and you can tell the difference when applying the products. There is a noticeable tingle when applying the product from the dermatologist and when I actually tasted both serums (weird, I know....) to see if I could detect acidity there was none discernible in the OZ product. NONE. It is extremely watery for a serum that did nothing ... unless I received a completely different bottle than all these other reviewers have received I cannot in good conscience recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! It does exactly what the manufacturer promised. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks and there is a definite improvement in the look and feel of my skin. I highly recommend this product and I will definitely reorder when my current supply runs out.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find an affordable vitamin C serum with so many excellent reviews. I ordered Oz Naturals Vitamin C Serum and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The serum spreads easily. Even better, a little goes a long way. My skin looks wonderful and works perfectly with my moisturizer. I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle! (BTW:  I&#x27;m a real user and not in any way associated with Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product. I have been searching for a good vitamin C serum  and I end up purchasing the OZ naturals. It was so refreshing and was absorbed quickly. It helps fade dark spots and I felt that my skin was starting to produce less oil. Best vitamin c serum and much cheaper than the other serums. Must try! ☺👍</li>
    <li> This product really works. My skin felt nice and tight. Great to put before your regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to start my process to younger looking skin. I am 31 and live in Arizona. The conditions are rough during the summer and we spend a lot of time on our boat. I have a few sun spots and some crows feet by my eyes. I have been using this serum for a few months now and have not seen any difference. It actually clogged pores on my nose and forehead. I never get blackheads on my forehead either. I was really hoping this would work for me. Hopefully I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> my skin broke out after using this product and had extreme dry patches. I would recommend using &amp;#34;Belitae Organics - Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Helps Fade Dark Spots and Smooth Wrinkles!&amp;#34; instead- it is far more cheaper and better results which gives a radiant glow on the face and helps in pore minimizing and provides anti wrinkling effect to prevent aging</li>
    <li> I use it about a month so far, feels discoloration on my dark spot I got by sunshine or whatever. I really notice the difference on me, keep working please</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply and feels good and does not look greasy. It dries quickly too. So far I haven&#x27;t seen crazy changes in my face however I do notice a difference and my face does look better. I am enjoying this product and hope to see more improvements as I use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with hopes of having better skin tone/complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Combined usage with rose water, I have found my skin to be at one of its finest state.&lt;br /&gt;My enlarged pores and blackheads have been drastically reduced within days of usage.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> OZ Naturals Anti Aging Serum. I am 30, almost 31 (Sunday is my birthday) and it&#x27;s a sad truth that I am starting to get those dreadful bags under my eyes and dryer skin. Boo hiss, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Natural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Serum is an organic Vitamin C serum clinically proven to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, give you a much smoother and even skin tone/texture and leave your skin youthful and radiant.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be fabulous if we could all turn back the clock and enjoy the skin of our youth? Or at least have appreciated it more at the time?  Sounds great, right? That&#x27;s what I thought so when I was given the chance to try it out thanks to Brandbacker, I jumped at the chance. Obviously a week is not a long time to test out a new product but they guarantee that you will see brighter and more radiant skin instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a before and after photo (see photos) and was surprised and impressed to actually see a difference - in the same lighting (don&#x27;t you hate those before/after pics that are taken in different lighting or at a different angle). The skin as a whole was brighter (wow!) and I loved how the OZ Naturals Anti-Aging Serum had a light and water-like consistency so I didn&#x27;t feel like I was caking product onto my face. Also, it does NOT burn and my skin is very sensitive so it has been none to rebel against various beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, and interested in finding something to add to your beauty regiment that brightens and rejuvenates your face, I would happily suggest checking out OZ Natural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Serum. They promise a 30-day money back guarantee that you will see results so what&#x27;s not to love about that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: This product was gifted to me by Oz Naturals but all opinions and photos are my own.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, but I can tell that it&#x27;s working. I can feel a tightening in my face when I use it and I know it&#x27;s not in my head because when I look at my &amp;#34;laugh&amp;#34; lines around my eyes, they&#x27;re significantly reduced. You can tell where the lines were at one point because they&#x27;ve been there so long and the skin is lighter in the folds of the wrinkles, however the wrinkles themselves are not there. My hope for this serum is that it will even out the coloring around my eyes so that way you can never tell I had any lines. I like the way that the formula isn&#x27;t sticky and how it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it. I&#x27;ve used others that did the same, but left my skin feeling tacky. It lasts about a full day for me and by the time I go to bed, you can tell the skin is definitely back to what it was pre-use, so I will have to continue using if I want to keep up this façade. :)  I also use this under a different brand&#x27;s moisturizer and have not had any bad side effects or rashes.  That may depend how strong the chemicals are in your moisturizer though. I experimented with the combo on my hand before I tried on my face. Overall I am not sure it&#x27;ll give me the &amp;#34;results I&#x27;ve been looking for&amp;#34; because that would be a permanent solution to end the signs of aging (which there is no such thing), however I&#x27;ve found this as a good solution to temporarily reduce the signs without having to resort to risky Botox. This is probably the way to look more natural anyways. I think I will be sticking with this serum unless my face decides to stop reacting to it. If it does, I will make sure to update.</li>
    <li> I use this serum after vitamin C serum, overall I liked the improvement on my face, the skin became softer after several months. Did a small test on the sunburn dark skin from last summer (half treated with this serum, the other half as control), couldn&#x27;t really tell if it helps. And one more layer of moisturizer is a must after this.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it softness the wrinkles and makes the face look fresh.  I also use Roc after the serum drays. Possibly the combination of the 2 works for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 3 months now.  I wash my face using a konjac sponge, use Thayer rose witch hazel and then apply the Oz serum.  I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in the first 2 months so for me it required some patience.  In my 3rd month I have finally started to notice my skin changes.  My lines around my mouth and eyes seem less noticeable and my color overall appears more even.  I&#x27;m giving Oz 4 stars right now because I&#x27;ve seen improvement, but haven&#x27;t been blown away by it.  I will try to update my review after another 3 months to see how my skin is doing.</li>
    <li> Great product...love it!</li>
    <li> I like OZ vitamin C serum.  It&#x27;s is helping to tone my face so my face is one color.  I had two tones now I have one tone.  My face feels really good and smooth.  I will be ordering it again soon.</li>
    <li> I just turned 63 years old.  I&#x27;ve had so many people compliment me (when I have to reveal my age)!  They always say, &amp;#34;you definitely do not look like you are 63 years old!  The only thing I&#x27;m doing differently is using the OZ Naturals vitamin C Serum every morning!</li>
    <li> This works well to fade facial age spots in a relatively short amount of time.  I have very light skin and only had spots on my left side (due to driving I suppose.) Now they are almost gone.</li>
    <li> feels smooth on skin and absorbs instantly</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I love it.  And so affordable. :)</li>
    <li> Great results. This is good stuff. My skin is becoming healthier after years of sun damage from surfing.</li>
    <li> As we all know, Vitamin C does wonders for the skin. This product is light in texture and absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin looks smooth with a nice, even tone.</li>
    <li> I am 58 with normal skin but intent on keeping aging to a minimum. I have used many very highly priced facial serum&#x27;s, creams, toners etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best products that I have ever used with grate results! I am now hooked on Dr. Oz products. Effective, natural and fairly priced. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;ve tried a few, and I must say this is my favorite. After using for several weeks, I noticed my skin tone was more even and appeared brighter. I love that it&#x27;s 100% vegan and cruelty-free too. This serum was a great addition to my beauty regimen. I was also thrilled to receive an email with directions and ingredients for this product. I&#x27;ve been thrilled with the customer service at OZ Naturals. Great product from a great company!</li>
    <li> Lines above lips are disappearing. That is why I bought this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is totally worth trying.  I was skeptical but after using for two weeks people have said &amp;#34;your face looks pretty,&amp;#34; your skin looks good,&amp;#34; and one person said &amp;#34;your face is glowing.&amp;#34;  I can also tell a difference even with minimal make-up. I like this product a lot.  Try OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> My face felt so smooth and brightened after this! I put a liberal amount on my face at night and in the morning my skin looked so refreshed. I don;t have wrinkles yet so I don;t know how much this helps for that, but I do suffer form oily skin and acne and this doesn&#x27;t make it worse. It&#x27;s not oily and it absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not too tacky. Although this doesn&#x27;t heal acne per se, I think I see it lightening old acne scars a little and helps calm inflamed acne. I recommend it, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife who is 70 and useing this product with moisturizer has made a big difference as the lines in her face are almost gone and she looks at least 10 years younger</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic by nature, and did not want to believe the raving reviews.  However, since I turned 40 this year, I decided it is time to find something for the large pores.  I could not believe this product!  I saw a difference after only one use, and I feel like a new person after a month of using it.  You only need a little, so I know it will last a long time.  I am buying a second product by this company to try for my eyes, and will return to review that also.  PS: I have fair, sensitive  skin with few wrinkles, but large pores.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It absorbs quickly and leaves no sticky residue. It has helped my skin look brighter and healthier.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product, I&#x27;ll be honest I can&#x27;t really tell yet if I see a difference, but it hasn&#x27;t been a month yet.</li>
    <li> skin looks even in tone</li>
    <li> Too early to tell......will decide after 4 weeks use...</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin.  I did some research, and vitamin c helps even out skin tone, and also helps build collagen for firmer skin.  So it&#x27;s great for the health of your skin.  One caution - keep it in the refrigerator so it stays fresh and effective, vitamin c is not terribly stable so it&#x27;s not that it will go \\&quot;bad,\\&quot; it just won&#x27;t work as well for your skin if you leave it at room temperature for too long.  I&#x27;ve used this with a variety of skin care, and it works with other creams and cleansers, so you can add it to your skin care routine without any problems.  I would put this on first, it absorbs very well and quickly, then you can put on your cream or sunscreen or whatever you use. Don&#x27;t use too much, it will make your skin sticky and when you put on make up or creams, it won&#x27;t go on smoothly and you&#x27;ll end up with residue on your face.  I use it every day and I&#x27;ve tried it in the morning and at night.  I don&#x27;t see any difference in effects if you use it at either time, I found that at night after a shower works better for me.  I did use it both in the morning and at night for awhile, but I didn&#x27;t see any greater benefits using it twice a day, once a day has worked very well.    I like this because it adds an essential vitamin that your skin needs to be healthy.  And it really works - I had dark spots on my face, and they have gotten a lot lighter after using one bottle.  I really recommend it, just keep it in the fridge.  Using this product got me to look into other products that give skin vitamins, etc., and I found this [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]] - this adds to the vitamin c serum with more vitamins and fatty acids, omega 3&#x27;s, and the two products have made such a difference in my skin - it&#x27;s softer, the lines around my eyes (including under my eyes) are gone, my frown lines are much much much lighter, and the fine lines around my lips (especially onmy upper lip) are gone.  My dark spots have faded to being barely noticeable, my skin stays hydrated all day, and my skin tone has really improved.  I am getting compliments about the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; my skin has, and how refreshed and younger I look.  Plus I know I&#x27;m giving my skin healthy ingredients to make it better.  If you are into natural and healthy, you can&#x27;t beat these two.</li>
    <li> I have been using vitamin C serum for several years and went with this brand because it is less expensive.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> seems to work well on wrinkles after a week</li>
    <li> saw results in the first aplication, magical by now</li>
    <li> Love the Vitamin C Serum!  Will re-order.</li>
    <li> I fell for all the positive reviews and now wish I had never ordered this.  I have been using it for just a few days and my skin is breaking out worse than it ever has in my life.  It&#x27;s all over my face like a rash, resulting in an emergency trip to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> no results noticed, but it feels good on the skin. No irritation to eyes or skin.  but still have same mouth lines, wrinkles, crows feet.... I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, and don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;proof in the pudding.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Really don&#x27;t see if it&#x27;s doing anything. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping just as described thanks!</li>
    <li> I made a couple of changes to my skin care...this was one of the items I added and love the fact that my skin had a positive response to it. I used to think I had sensitive skin; but not anymore...this serum has helped balance my sensitive/oily skin. Even breakouts have significantly been reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I gave this a try!! Definitely will be using it for years to come....</li>
    <li> I received this free to review on my blog.  This serum is thin and one squirt covers my whole face, neck and chest.  I appreciate that it has natural ingredients and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way.  It takes a bit to absorb but once it does, it leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff which helps fight signs of aging &amp; for the price it actually does help ones skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed for three weeks. I saw no improvements what so ever. I&#x27;ve had better results from inexpensive drug store brands. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite Dr. OZ serum.  Truly a treatment!  My skin felt soft and had lots of elasticity.  It felt resurfaced!  I alternate daily with the Hyaluronic Acid)  I will be gifting some to my sister for the holidays!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  I did not feel any tightening.  Altho it a absorbed well, I saw no improvement.</li>
    <li> Good product and very quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I use this serum everyday.  It is absorbed by the skin really quickly.  I love using it right after I exfoliate, and before I moisturize.  I think the accumulative preventative care I take each and everyday helps to keep my skin looking pretty good for my age.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great products, very gentle.</li>
    <li> all I can say is this is Magic Serum!! Came quickly, packaged nicely and makes a huge difference on your face I would tell anyone to purchase OZ naturals vitamin C. Will be ordering again from this seller ty</li>
    <li> A noticeable change in lines on my forehead</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  The serum is light (not heavy like some facial products) and works very well with any type of moisturizer.  I have seen immediate results with only two weeks of usage.  My skin is radiant and glowing.  I highly recommend using this product if you want to see immediate results.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do what it claims, it feels like I put water on my face, the only difference is that it dries instantly. It has no smell or taste or anything that tells that I have something put on my skin. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin benefited from it. I gave it two because it didn&#x27;t bother my skin either.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin:(</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Nothing Has ever worked for my face ever, I have very sensitive skin so every time I try to use something my skin breaks.  I have to say this is the best thing that has happened to my face.  My skin is clear, I started seeing results in a week and in 2 to 3 weeks I can see my dark blemishes fade away. I use the serum twice.  My skin color is light brown, from India.</li>
    <li> .  Used about a month ,so far no noticible results at all...  I have to wonder about all these great reviews. There is no magic potion or pill.</li>
    <li> I feel this product is too heavy/thick on my skin and gives me blackheads on my face. I have been using for 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen no changes at all on my skin other than making it worse. I&#x27;m on my late 30s and have a few deep lines on my forehead and dark spots from the sun. I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil on my whole body and face, and I have seen more results from it than the OZ Natural Vit C Serum. This is a waste of money. I&#x27;m returning this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a little over two weeks now. I love it. Have always had a problem with enlarged pores. I can see a huge difference already in the size of my pores. Also, my overall skin texture is much smoother. The little lines around my eyes are less pronounced. And to make it even better, my skin seems tighter and firmer. I read all of the reviews before I bought this. I know everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently to products. Glad I took the leap of faith and bought it. To get results like this for my &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; is much more than I had even hoped for! My face seems brighter and reflects the light like a younger person&#x27;s so my skin looks good even without makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now, and I am convinced this product does what it is intended to do. Dark spots are gone! It is definitely a must have for anyone looking to take care of their skin and maintain its vitality!! OZ Natural products are cruel free as well which makes it even more fantastic. Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin and absorbs easily!!  Love love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Greetings! I had never tried vitamin C serum to my knowledge, but when I contacted my last supervising MD (I&#x27;m a Family Nurse Practitioner), she said  Nerium didn&#x27;t help her and that she was using OZ for her patients and herself. I sent them a before and after pic of my forehead and eyes and they recommended not only their vitamin C serum and eye gel, but many dietary changes. I&#x27;m impressed. You flat out tell me that your products alone won&#x27;t fix the problem. Honesty! After 3 days of use, my med assistant stopped me in the hall and said, &amp;#34;something has changed around your eyes&amp;#34;. I feel like I have less dry, flaky skin using this product and I&#x27;ve used both on my entire face and neck.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Great Price!!!! No sting!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Once I saw on Dr. Oz that we can get more youthful skin, almost like a lift would, I hurried and ordered this vitamin C serum and I have not regretted it since. There are plenty others but this has everything you need from one f the best companies around. It&#x27;s obvious why they are the best sellers. I have seen huge improvements on my skin (late 20s) such as better complexion and tightness. So much so that I have my husband apply some at night with even better results in his skin (40s)</li>
    <li> I love the oz naturals vitamin C Serum. This is my 2nd bottle. I put some on my face every night after I use the Oz toner and then I put my moisturizer. I also use it every morning. My face looks and feels feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extra sensitive skin. Overall I see improvement in my skins texture and dark spots are fading . For sure I will be ordering again!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, affordable with great results! I am a new user and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using vitamin C serum for a week but find it has made a tremendous difference in making the application of foundation go on easier without the dry look.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my first product.  The reviews seemed very promising.  I like the idea of a product that you can see positive results from the first application.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week now.. It absorbs to skin quickly  result dry feeling to skin after, but not a negative dryness.. Need to put moisturizer after...  Thus far, I am content with it.. Can&#x27;t really see dramatic improvement on my face but i do feel and look better ...</li>
    <li> saw quick results, skin smoother and lines less visible. Need to use longer to really know how it is.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF HAS MADE MY FACE GO THROUGH A METAMORPHOSIS.  TIGHTENED LINES, BOT RID OF PROBLEM AREAS I&#x27;VE HAD FOR YRS AND I TRULY HAVE YOUTHFUL BEAUTIFUL SKIN.  I HAVE OTHER GREAT FACIAL STUFF I USE BUT THIS IS A FANTASTIC ADDITION. I WILL BE RE-PURCHASING.</li>
    <li> amazing on my face!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this serum because of the wonderful reviews here on Amazon. I have a very severe hyperpigmentation, which is treated for many years with hydroquinone/Kojic acid, etc., with very little improvement. I tried other vitamin C products but they gave no results and some of them were also irritating to the skin. This serum from OZ Naturals is simply amazing. I saw results the next morning and after a month my skin looks clearer than ever. I even stopped applying makeup on days without important meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from hyperpigmentation - this may change your life.</li>
    <li> Just got the product yesterday. Did rely make my skin a little brighter but too soon to decide if it&#x27;s good for me or not. I also ordered a 1.0 dermaroller because alot of people are saying that the serum works well after dermaroller use. If anyone used this serum along with dermarolling can you let me know if it works or not. And if it does what would be the best way to use it. Before or after dermarolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks in advance</li>
    <li> Woooow i like it my skin look good thanks oz natural</li>
    <li> I love it! I am on my fourth bottle.</li>
    <li> Really does what it says, &amp; for a great price. Love this product.</li>
    <li> No visual improvements on skin. Good price, but shady reviews. Most reviews are from people who have only reviewed other Oz Natural products, which leads me to believe that these reviews are fake. Another reviewer pointed out that the guarantee or your money back claim simply falls under the 30 day return policy of Amazon, even though it takes longer than 30 days to see results. I will continue to try this, but will likely be returning it. I will make sure to update this review if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 1-26-15:&lt;br /&gt;No improvements on skin at all after months of use. Will not purchase form this brand again.</li>
    <li> I love Vitamin C Serums. They are a huge favorite of mine. I like this one because it&#x27;s thinner than most serums so that you don&#x27;t over-apply the product.Because it&#x27;s thinner,  it also absorbs easily and quickly into your skin. That&#x27;s the entire point of using the serum. Also because the C is organic I believe that my skin likes it better.  It&#x27;s 20%  strength Vit C + amino acids and hyaluronic acid! Why put the HA in? Because they synergistically work better together than apart.This vitamin c serum does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types.  The price for a 1 oz bottle is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks &amp; my skin feels amazing!! It absorbs well &amp; brightens my skin. People keep asking me if I have recently gone to a medical spa for a fancy chemical peel and nope!! It&#x27;s this bottle of fabulousness!!! I will definitely be re ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I mix with my face cream, it is an active ingredient in more expensive products. Jury is still out, but hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> Love this serum  on my 2nd bottle. Use at night and skin looks awesome in the morning. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so watery.</li>
    <li> Really like it. Tightens and makes my skin feel nice. Seems to improve the look of wrinkles. It is much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have normal skin with a few age spots near my jawline so I figured I would try to raise my skin regimen up a notch by finding a good Vitamin C serum. This is my first purchase of a serum and I would agree with another reviewer that the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any active ingredients, it just feels close to water. In fact it slipped out of my hand when Ai first bought it and a third of the liquid fell out before I was able to pick it back up..that was unfortunate. I was expecting more of a gel consistency possibly? In any case I&#x27;ve been using it day and night under my&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer for the last few weeks, and I haven&#x27;t seen any  noticeable results. My skin does feel a bit smoother but I really was hoping for better results. So,  I decided to get some vitamin c serum samples from  Sephora and I&#x27;m already feeling and seeing a big difference with these Ole Olrekson samples. I think the hard pill to swallow is the price you end up paying for these these better options, but in the end it&#x27;s a question of what really works for your individual skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used in a couple of times but so far I like the way it feels on my face, it&#x27;s really light. My only slight issue is that I already have somewhat oily skin so it makes it a little shiny through out the day so I have to reaply my foundation which is ok. I&#x27;ll write more when I use it a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering my third bottle.  Definite improvements in skin tone and texture.  I&#x27;ll be 68 in a couple of months.  This has become a staple in my skin care routine and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love all of OZ naturals products. This is a great value, 20% is exactly how much vitamin C is recommended to keep your epidermis healthy, along with retinol. Great product, great price; I ran out awhile back, and I started getting spots again, and my skin was not as soft. I have all my customers on OZ naturals! thanks for a great product line!</li>
    <li> great product, my skin looks amazing!!! I have access to all the serums on the market including those thru dermatologists and plastic surgeons, this one is by far the best I used so far. What a great product!!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It really brightens my skin and minimizes pores.</li>
    <li> Just did not work for me</li>
    <li> My skin tone is changing for the better. I have dark spots on my face and I&#x27;m noticing them fading away. I will difinitely use this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> so far it&#x27;s working...good stuff</li>
    <li> like this product a lot! It&#x27;s</li>
    <li> my skin is smoother and helps fill in my fine lines</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this product is as highly rated as it is.  I&#x27;m a 46-year-old woman with lots of sun damage on my face I thought only IPL and chemical peels would fix.... until I started using this!  I also use it on my neck, hands, and forearms and have noticed a drastic, extremely positive difference in my skin tone and overall complexion.  I also use gently under my eyes in conjunction with my eye cream to work on the wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve also switched to using 2 times a  day (morning/night) and found even more drastic results.  I could NOT be happier with this product and just ordered my second batch. I also use trentinoin and this combination seems to be working magic!  I went to Costa Rica a couple years back and came back with tons of age spots on my hands and forearms.  It too has faded these dramatically.  I&#x27;m not looking for perfection....just darn near close to :)  I&#x27;ve been using this for close to two months.  You need to use it religiously to see results .... but once you do you&#x27;ll be forever hooked!  I also have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and have had ZERO issues with this product.  I have very little time in my completely psychotic schedule but have been meaning to post a review of this product bc I am so ridiculously giddy over the results.  Thank you OZ Naturals - you&#x27;re helping me turn back the clock!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Honestly, I bought this product trying to save money over Mario Badescu&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum.  The reviews I read were effusing with how great this particular Vit. C Serum w/ Hyaluronic Acid is.  It&#x27;s good, though not as great as Mario&#x27;s Vit. C Serum.  I will go back to Mr. Badescu&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly after washing my face. I follow the directions I received from the company after I made the purchase. So far I can&#x27;t tell that this product if having any kind of positive or negative affect on my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin is loving it. Being in my early-twenties I was looking for a good but gentle serum to treat my skin with the vitamins it needs and prevent premature aging. I would reccommend this product especially to those girls who aren&#x27;t interested in anything fancy (or are too young for anti aging serums) who just want a no-nonsense way to take care of their skin. This has become one of my FAVORITE products in my daily routine!!</li>
    <li> I now use olive oil.  Better results.  Cheaper.  Did not care for product.  But reusing bottle for olive oil</li>
    <li> Fast shipping-great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks,&lt;br /&gt;along with the Hydro Oz Serum. The change IS noticeable!</li>
    <li> Like this one as well. Saw changes already and I only have been using it for three days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst product I ever had. After I used two weeks, I looked at least 5 years older than my actual age. My skin becomes very dry and wrinkled.</li>
    <li> This is a great product , it really smooths and adds comfort to my skin ! I use it under my moisturizer. I will order this product again , love it</li>
    <li> So far so good... I&#x27;ve been using for maybe two weeks :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use, brightening smoothing and clearing</li>
    <li> So far so good can feel it tightened</li>
    <li> Love this product - and OZ Naturals overall.  The price is amazing for the quality and I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I liked my other C serums better.  My skin didn&#x27;t react to this product at all - good or badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past caused my skin to either glow because it was amazing, or it irritated it because it was too strong for my sensitive skin.  This product did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, but I like how it makes my face feel.  I use it on a thin patch of skin I have on my forehead.  It seems to have filled in the patch, which is now barely visible.  Like polyfilla for the face!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like clear water. I&#x27;m taking care of my skin very seriously, so I think other steps also help my skin improve. Not sure if my skin is getting better because of this or for all the steps that apply on my skin every night. I may of switch to other brand with same quality since the product getting pricier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is freaking amazing! Seriously loved the way it made my skin look and feel after putting on in the evening...and before make up! I am trying to make and replicate this because it goes so quick!  and LOVE thew results (a clean- plant based organic diet helps tremendously also!) &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I think it slightly lightened some dark spots on my face. Mostly I like what it feels like when I put it on. Not sure about wrinkles, etc, I didn&#x27;t do before and after pics.</li>
    <li> Smooths, reduces pores, healthy and beautiful skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> Hands down this product is amazing! I was looking for a vitamin c serum to add to my skin care, and this product fits my budget. I took a picture before and after application.  There was an obvious difference - my skin appeared hydrated.  After my  first application I knew my skin needed it. But to prove a point, I took another photo after 7 days and my skin tone appeared more even. After 2 weeks, my skin appeared more youthful. Thank you for a great and affordable product!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and noticeably reduces lines!</li>
    <li> Here is the thing, I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serum on my face for a while now. This is the second time I buy this brand and I am not certain if this is actually working or not. One thing I can say, this is the only one that did not turn yellow/brown, meaning that it did not oxidized, but here is the catch.. As far as I know, all vitamin C serums oxidize, I&#x27;ve used a recognized brand in the past, skinceuticals, which did turn yellow and so I contacted the company to ask if the product had gone bad and they told me that it is completely normal for vitamin C serums to turn oxidize, turning yellow, and that it doesn&#x27;t not mean that the product is not good, specially because it turns pretty quickly, I only had the product for a couple of weeks and did hide it from any sort of lighting as they recommend it. With that said, that&#x27;s the reason why I don&#x27;t know if this product is good or not, the results from using vitamin C comes with time, all I know is that this product does not feel like water, it does have a thicker consistency like the other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, also, when I put it in my face it feels like it hydrates it right away. Unfortunately, there is no possible way to know for a fact that this actually have vitamin C in it or not.</li>
    <li> Best facial product I&#x27;ve used so far. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I like this one so far nothing better. Works for me. I&#x27;ll reorder and recommend it. Delivery time ok</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face after using a derma roller. My face feels incredibly soft and smooth just a few minutes after using. The serum is light and not at all greasy. I have oily skin and am always worried that I&#x27;ll break out after using oily products, but my skin loves this serum. Seems like everyone else loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this vitamin c serum for almost 2 months. I have noticed that my fine lines were getting much worse and I didn&#x27;t know why. I thought I needed to drink more water or something. Then one day recently I was in another bathroom in my home (where I did not have the Vitamin C serum) washing my face. I had some old moisturizer in that bathroom that I decided to apply to my face instead of going to get the serum I had been using. I was very surprised to see that instantly my skin looked better than it had in weeks! I realized that it&#x27;s the serum that is making my face look terrible. I had always used a moisturizer after applying the vitamin c serum but I guess just having that serum on my face was causing the looks of premature aging. I stopped using the serum and my face is looking much better now. I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I feel like I have been damaging my skin for the last 2 months and now I have to try to repair the bad things that this serum has done to my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to return this item, but couldn&#x27;t because I was a week too late.  I wanted to have&lt;br /&gt;time to see if it worked or not.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t.  It drys your skin and so you need to put&lt;br /&gt;on a moisturizer after you apply it to your face.  Does not work, only made my delicate&lt;br /&gt;skin flake in spots.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few months. No results.</li>
    <li> I tried this based on the amazing reviews but I had a bad experience with it.  It broke me out so badly that I did look younger - like a 13-year-old girl going through puberty.  :)  I will stick to making C serum myself.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with my order</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic, it is not going to perform miracles if you have deeper wrinkles. However, the serum has worked so far when I use it consistently. I have noticed it had diminished fine lines after several days of using it and  that my face feels firm right after I apply it. I use a toner that doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol (neutrogena), then this serum, then the OZ Natural Super Youth 2.5% retinol moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily daytime serum and my skin definitely looks brighter, more supple after using for a few weeks. I use it as part of my skincare routine so I can&#x27;t say that just this product has made the improvements but it&#x27;s definitely part of it. My pores are looking clearer! Goodbye free radicals! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Use after cleansing &amp; toner. I massage it all over my face &amp; neck. Don&#x27;t forget your neck, ladies.</li>
    <li> I think it helps.  Use it every night</li>
    <li> I bought the whole line. I am insanely happy! Not going to write a book here. If in doubt buy it! I have spent so much money on spas that did not make my skin look and feel this good!</li>
    <li> Love this as I love all OZ products. Feels smooth on the skin, smells fresh and will re-order</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery, great product, great packaging, great experience!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This serum is very good light not heavy on your face. I have been using it for 2 weeks my poor is getting smaller, my face I a lot more smoother. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> waste of money.  I thought Dr. Oz had something to do with this product but he doesnt.  Cheap product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it.  Ask me in about another month</li>
    <li> Another miracle-product that does not work. I used it for two months without any results.&lt;br /&gt;Positive note: fast shipment and follow up costumer service</li>
</ol>
