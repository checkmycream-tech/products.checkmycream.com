      <li>I like them better than Wahl Detailers, the T-blade does not get out of alignment like the T-Wide blade.</li>
      <li>I would put more pressure and I would have to go over the area 3-4-5 times to trim a hair or two (this is without any clips, just the hair clipper alone).</li>
      <li>Well....... I love it.....</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>

      <li>Worked pretty good.</li>
      <li>Feels good in hand, cuts true and clean.</li>
      <li>Brand new works great.</li>
      <li>May be good for different hair types but, not to good for ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>In general, I like Wahl equipment, but these are not so great.  </li>
      <li>They are professional grade and handle nicely!</li>
      <li>Nice, gentle, and accurate.</li>
      <li>Also it is great for facial hair as well......</li>
      <li>It was almost as cheap to buy another pair, than to just buy the blade.  </li>
      <li>Pin point precise.</li>
      <li>Light weight,</li>

      <li>Very useful at my salon.</li>
      <li>He loves it said it was very powerful.</li>
      <li>In general, a good investment.</li>

      <li>power sounds like it has a short of some kind</li>
      <li>Love the edgers, had to replace my old set.</li>
      <li>Before you buy from other places selling similar products, this is the best place to buy!</li>
      <li>Other than it jamming it was good.</li>
      <li>Once again, nice  clean sharp lines.</li>
      <li>If they make a mistake, even in the smallest way, they take full responsibility for it and go above and beyond to fix any problems quickly!</li>

      <li>when I first got them, they bit because the blades had zero over-lap.  </li>
      <li>Works internationally with 220V 50Hz with a travel adapter although it will vibrate a bit more than it should.</li>
      <li>The first was purchased from a local store at a greater price.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never had them run hot.  </li>
      <li>They do take some adjustment at first so that you are not cutting yourself, but they trim nice and tight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not figured out how to not leave marks on people with this ... blade is to sharp or out of place or something</li>
    <li> Normally I&#x27;m an Andis man, I was kind of skeptical about venturing outside my realm of comfort. Not only did I get these clippers light years cheaper than buying them at Sally&#x27;s, but these trimmers are AMAZINGLY ACCURATE!!! Pin point precise. In fact, I had to adjust the blades so that my bone wasn&#x27;t exposed!! Anyway, just for the record, if they are too sharp, all it takes is a little adjustment with couple of screw turns (as with any clippers that you normally get right out the box; either they feel like they don&#x27;t cut, or they&#x27;re too sharp...simple re-adjustment!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for line ups. Wasn&#x27;t sharp enough for lining facial hair though. Works internationally with 220V 50Hz with a travel adapter although it will vibrate a bit more than it should.</li>
    <li> This thing couldn&#x27;t cut a thing seriously garbage. My first liner and after using it doesn&#x27;t look like you cut anything</li>
    <li> Beautiful, I love this product</li>
    <li> I use this clipper on my husbands high and tight military style flat top. It is sharp and powerful. The blade is a little short on the ends if you are used to a T-edger. However it does make nice sharp lines for outlining.</li>
    <li> This is all good.  Good dry Shaver cuts close and a lot cheaper than the other edgers I normally buy which cost 50 and up.  A real good buy</li>
    <li> there good but not razor edged by a long shot</li>
    <li> These trimmers cut very precisely straight out of the box.  Being an andis man I was very skeptical about buying these but whal has made me a proud and almost surly a repeat customer but hopefully not for the same product...</li>
    <li> T&#x27;was brought as a gift, because its a WAHL, I&#x27;m confident its receiver is satisfied with this product...Thank You.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a number of clippers and I struggle between finding one that can provide a close shave, while not being overpriced. This clipper I purchased on Amazon works well when it works, but by the third month of using this product (3 times a week on average), I noticed it needs about 5-10 minutes after being turned on before the blades begin to move. The blades will literally not move and I now find myself hunting for another clipper because I quite honestly don&#x27;t want to be waiting the same time period as my wife does with her flat iron to heat up, each time I want to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the blades to see if any of them were loose and I even checked the electrical socket to see if I was using the wrong cycle - its never been a problem with my other clippers but I wanted to cover my base and be sure. I had chosen Wahl because I had confidence in the brand but with this experience I now have another clipper search ahead of me.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good. Use it to line up hair, and also do beard line up. Will need to adjust clipper in order to get closer line up for beard.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a barber&#x27;s go-to.  Bought these as a spare when my other ones get too hot.</li>
    <li> Great! a great trimmer this completes my clipper set. Now I can start saving money year round on hair cuts, which are $12 a pop where I live. \\&quot;IM SEEING GREEN!\\&quot; THANKS A MILLION</li>
    <li> Very useful at my salon.</li>
    <li> I am a pro Master Barber &amp; these trimmers work great on ALL hair. They give a great line up if you zero gap the blade. I like them better than Wahl Detailers, the T-blade does not get out of alignment like the T-Wide blade.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a corded Edger for a while, and the Battery operated ones, although good, I felt are not as good as a corded one. The Wahl Professional 8051 5-Star Series Razor Edger definitely proved my thoughts were correct. The only thing needed out of the box was a little oil on the blades. The results are magnificently and drastically better. I was amazed. I am highly satisfied, and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great, able to make nice clean lines, razor sharp!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to all my friends. I have been using this product for six months</li>
    <li> Looked used, but not sure since it seems they cleaned it up. Tried trimming by beard and it wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair. I would put more pressure and I would have to go over the area 3-4-5 times to trim a hair or two (this is without any clips, just the hair clipper alone). Took too long to use it for the first time and the 30 Day return period had passed. I would sell it but feel I would be robbing the potential buyer....</li>
    <li> Not good for short-haired faces. Not close enough. Clippers are much larger and heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> Love the edgers, had to replace my old set.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son for Christmas. He loves it. He cuts his own hair. So far no issues with it.</li>
    <li> Great item for the barber in your family</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for all barbers or personal usage. Nice razor sharp edges. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t is the color. Its not red at all, it&#x27;s the color of the 5 star balder.</li>
    <li> Cuts good, however could be a tad sharper. I like that as close to razor cut; you don&#x27;t get that out of the box but could certainly adjust them so. A review that I read prior to purchasing them gave the impression that they were that sharp, so if I wasn&#x27;t expecting that closer cut I would give them the five stars. Can&#x27;t go wrong with them though. They are professional grade and handle nicely!</li>
    <li> After lengthy search for a razor that shaves close to skin, especially on my neck, this one works pretty well. I use it for my neck, as well as my sides (over my ears). Works great for what I use it for!</li>
    <li> This product truely gives a professional razor edge but the machine blades bite (irritate the skin)leaving scrathes. Maybe someone can advise me on how i can stop that.</li>
    <li> Nice, gentle, and accurate.</li>
    <li> If you work it as much as i do you will need to constantly oil the blade to keep it cutting correctly and it does not ever heat up to the point of burning your clients so if you dont use razors to outline and finish this is the best and quickest alternative</li>
    <li> I am extremely picky when it come to my hairline. Perfect edgers. Perfect 90 degree edges and great at curving.</li>
    <li> I use my clippers daily, this product make some great lines and can keep you looking good, until you make it to the barber shop!</li>
    <li> Great piece of equipment</li>
    <li> Just got my Wahl 5star edger. I inspected the edger &amp; Looks to be in good shape.Turned it on &amp; off. Its working very well. I was pleased to see it came with an adjustable blade device you can use to zero gap it👍👏. FYI zero gap the blade if its not sharp enough for you. Im a happy camper😄</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my son who&#x27;s in barber college - he&#x27;s really happy with the product and it&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> Clippers are very sharp and have plenty of power.</li>
    <li> Great for edging and lining. Warning, this clipper can cut you if the blade isn&#x27;t aligned correctly.</li>
    <li> This is the best edger ever!!!  I normally use them to shave my head but this works out so much better!!!</li>
    <li> good transaction, item was as described.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make a close cut like a razor like I thought they would. I have a larger pair of balding clippers for cutting your head hair that cuts closer.</li>
    <li> The Razor Edger lasted less than 5 weeks before I had to purchase new blades. The Edger overall, is decent but I had to purchase a backup pair since I have a high customer base.</li>
    <li> My husband is from Africa and has had so much trouble with bumps after shaving.  This particular product was recommended by a friend and it&#x27;s been working awesome for him!  Nice smooth face...no more bumps!</li>
    <li> I have Wahl clippers that are amazing and I thought this would do the same for me. Well, for my friend that I give haircuts to. Before I purchased the straight razor, I wanted to use this to create sharp edges around the head and groom my friend&#x27;s facial hair. This didn&#x27;t do that well. It gets the job done to an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; level, but if you really want to get an extreme edge, get a straight razor.</li>
    <li> I fully recommend this product. Bought it so that my brother-in-law can cut my nephews hair, and it works great. Excellent quality blades, etc.</li>
    <li> As described.  Great Wahl quality.</li>
    <li> I used this razor twice weekly to trim a very light beard and mustache.  It was adequate but not great.  At almost exactly 6 months it simply quit working.  It won&#x27;t cut at all and I can&#x27;t adjust it to make it cut.  Just junk as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> It barely works and doesn&#x27;t cut that close. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it and kept the money. Still haven&#x27;t found a proper replacement though.</li>
    <li> Brand new works great. Looks cool cuts well. But the straight razor still is much sharper. Its bulky for self use.</li>
    <li> This are not cheap but after a few months of use the blades jammed. I unscrewed the blade n cleaned it out...still wouldnt work, kinda wasted my money. Other than it jamming it was good. I used to line up my blk bf hair bcuz i was not confident n usibg a straight razor. It worked pretty well til it jamned:(</li>
    <li> Well....... I love it..... It really does cut as close as a razor. My customers love the  nice clean sharp lines , even the ladies love it when we do a short style and have to get rid of those pesky neck hair........ They say it cuts  so close the don&#x27;t have to get a friend or their husband/ boyfriend to do it, in between services........ There is nothing bad I can say about this......... It does not get hot like other I have had, so no more burning your client...... Also it is great for facial hair as well...... Once again, nice  clean sharp lines.</li>
    <li> With all the hype about these, I was excited to get them and begin using them on my clients.  As it turns out, they are pretty lame.  In general, I like Wahl equipment, but these are not so great.  I would avoid them if I had it to do over again.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing machine.it cuts lower than i expected without irritating the skin.cuts with precision. i don&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
    <li> I am easily past my 5th year with this edger and used it just this morning for my line and for trimming my mustache.  It has never let me down in all the years of use.  I oil them every 2 or 3 uses and I&#x27;ve never had them run hot.  Through the simplest of care they have held up incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, when I first got them, they bit because the blades had zero over-lap.  I adjusted them by the second use and have never had to adjust them since.  A truly excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less I forget, they have been discovered by my kid and in true 80&#x27;s retro fashion, are now etching designs on his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked them up out of curiosity to see if they were still made.  Nice to see that Wahl stuck with them.</li>
    <li> These edgers were a replacement for a pair I bought 2 years back!  It was almost as cheap to buy another pair, than to just buy the blade.  I have sensitive skin and use these instead of a razor and everyone wants to know what type of razor do I use to keep my skin so smooth and shave so close....definitely a BUY if your skin is sensitive, like to keep your beard lined up nice, or for an alternative to a razor!</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m pretty sure this was used before I received it.  It broke after 5 uses.  I&#x27;d return it, but I can&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if it was the product or the seller, but this was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very precise when its clippers.  I use it all the time and because of it I stopped going to the barber.  Its a money saver for me.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for lining yourself up between haircuts, or even (as I use it) to keep your facial hair under control if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t use a razor. It&#x27;s also much thinner than a t-blade, so its easier to use if your not a professional.  In general, a good investment.</li>
    <li> This is my second razor purchase.  The first was purchased from a local store at a greater price. And by the way, the first one cuts like new. This razor was bought for my son.</li>
    <li> Before you buy from other places selling similar products, this is the best place to buy! If they make a mistake, even in the smallest way, they take full responsibility for it and go above and beyond to fix any problems quickly! They earned a place on my list of top sellers!</li>
    <li> I use the Razor Edger as a professional Barber.  In my opinion, these trimmers cut as good as if not better than other major brands, if your client has clean dry hair.  They are especially crisp when edging young boys who don&#x27;t have a lot of nasty grease and sweat.  Most of my clients including my son get compliments on how crisp their hair stlye is.  The narrow blade on the razor edger comes in handy when edging above the eybrow and the client has a low hairline.  They don&#x27;t get as hot as the Andis outliner, but does require oil as well as all other trimmers.  This is a great tool to have in your kit.</li>
    <li> Not bad but could be better!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. Please note, the item that you get is not the RED with Black Letters, instead you will most likely receive the Maroon trimmer with white letters. Works Great though, super close shave with the zero overlap blades. Be careful, this thing can cut when on zero overlap.</li>
    <li> I purchased this model because a barber said it works really well but it does not line the hair as well as the T-Edger. May be good for different hair types but, not to good for ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> For anybody wondering whether or not to purchase these let me tell you that as a Licensed Barber these are really good trimmers. The Razor Edger does exactly what it advertises. No adjustments were necessary for the trimmer i received. These are Tap and Go&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great product just as seller said</li>
    <li> These are good edgers. They just don&#x27;t cut down as far as I would like. I have adjusted them but still not close enough.</li>
    <li> best trimmer i have ever used always used andis but wahl did a good job with these razor sharp low vibration cool to the touch&lt;br /&gt;great clipper</li>
    <li> After some adjustment and tuning I am very happy with this trimmer/edger.  Feels good in hand, cuts true and clean. The only negative is that I received two 1/2 attachments and one 1 1/2 attachment and I am missing the 1.  Didn&#x27;t want to return the whole thing and have to wait - may try Wahl customer service and see where I get with that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son at Christmas 2013. He loves it said it was very powerful. Great item. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Great product for trimming my mustache.</li>
    <li> Love them. Light weight, precise cutting without adjusting the blades.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered TWO.  His original one is old and has fallen apart. He was pleased with the price and availability.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well o was expecting a sharper cut due to people saying i would have to adjust to not knick anyone out of the box but sadly that was not the case still a great outliner, but i prefer the Andis outliner.</li>
    <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
    <li> These are the worst pieces of s*** you will ever buy. I got them with hair still in the box and they didn&#x27;t cut a d** thing. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> On time delivery no issues</li>
    <li> power sounds like it has a short of some kind....doesn&#x27;t seem new. tried it on different outlets in different locations...same thing. Using my old clippers I THOUGHT I was replacing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend for Christmas he has only used it a few times and its now not working 8 months later. Kind of disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an hairstylist and generally ho with Andis products however I was amazingly surprised at this product. I love them. Nice...precise cutting ability</li>
    <li> Had them since Christmas now they no longer work, what the hell! What a waist of money.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes these clippers. They are a great choice for the price. They do take some adjustment at first so that you are not cutting yourself, but they trim nice and tight.</li>
