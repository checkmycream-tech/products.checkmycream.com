<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cream. Feels so good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Use on my face daily. Never causes a break out. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> we love this cream, it really works to heal dry skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> My wife says it makes her skin softer than any other cream she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It definitely eases the itch from my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream I use. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the third time I am buying it and the seller is A+. The delivery was free and it delivered in less than a week. I was so pleasantly surprised. Will recommend this seller and product to others. Very very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Great cream for face and body. I like the organic ingredients and love the fact that it is NOT fragranced. Excellent product. All my friends are using it now. Very delicate, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Updated Dec 31,2015  -  Happy New Year - There is really no new words to add about Deluvia Miracle Aloe Cream  -  We just received a new order for 2 jars.  So my wife is still happy with the job the cream does for her.      This home has been ordering and using Deluvia Miracle Aloe Cream for a few years now.  The order that this review request come from was one of many.  I am not the actually the user but probably should be.  My wife asks that I do the internet shopping and this one has been a constant for a long time.  She has very sensitive skin and is quite particular about the application of any skin condition treatments.  Many other highly acclaimed products from some very recognizable producers have come and gone very quickly as she has found that the ingrediants cause irritation in the application areas.  The Deluvia Cream has passed every test for her sensitive skin over the years.  If there are folks looking for a skin treatment that has no possibility of causing a negative irritation this may be the last skin cream product they will need to try.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Use it every day! 😊</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have really sensitive skin and most lotions will give me a rash, but not this one. And it lasts forever... A little bit goes a really long way. You can use it anywhere on your body including your face and eyes. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My daughter gave me my first jar of Deluvia Miracle Aloe Cream. I loved the softness of my skin after just a few days of use. Since then, I have ordered 2 more jars of cream and plan on continued use. It has truly improved my skin! Thanks..</li>
    <li> All items were we&#x27;re just fine thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it but my wife and daughter really like it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try this, mainly because of the price.  But my heels were so cracked, it hurt to walk and they bled.  After one application, the cuts closed up.  I continue to use it to soften my heels, but as a busy mom of three, ages three and under, I often forget.  Just applying this once or twice a week does wonders.  I can&#x27;t imagine if I was using it consistently.</li>
    <li> Best Best Best cream every.  I sue it on my face to my heels.  It makes everything so soft.</li>
    <li> I love the aloe cream ... this is why I ordered more. I&#x27;m not crazy about the price (expensive) but like the product. It&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
    <li> Amazingly good for eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I just cannot express my appreciation more to this product. I have two children, one is two years and seven months, another one is six months. They both have eczema. I just wished I would have known this product long time ago for my older child. It works better than steroids creams. Only one day of applying the product on my little one, I see the improvement on his skin. Thank u again. Do u give out coupons for referring other customers? LOL. It is a great product. Just try it. They have money back guarantee anyway. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after three days of using. The effect kind drifts away and the eczema returns back to normal conditions. Well... I may not blame the product because ecazema is quite tough to heal.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Really lasts a long time.  Would definitely recommend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in Tennessee and loved it.  Now that I am in Arizona I&#x27;m even more impressed. It is so hot and dry here. This is the only thing that has worked to keep my skin smooth and dewy.</li>
    <li> wonderful cream, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I discovet deluvia cream and I love it,my skin is soft feels good.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. A+++++</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I am a middle aged woman of color who has been to several dermatologists for dry, itchy patches.  Several different remedies were prescribed (5 lotions/creams; months of antibiotics and useless advice).  I itched, scratched and felt hopeless.  After receiving Deluvia Miracle aloe cream and using it for 2 weeks the itching is gone and most of the patches are clear. I&#x27;m ordering several more of these for myself and sister.  I will never go without these creams!  And I use them from head to toe!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> My grandson also loves it for his eczema. He is 16 and this seems to work the best. I use it on everything, even on my face at night.</li>
    <li> Love this aloe cream.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel so soft after one time.  It is a miracle cream</li>
    <li> We really love it!  works well on my granddaughters eczema.  Nice face cream for nights too without too much smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion was for sale temporarily at a local retail warehouse store.  I have issues with dry patches on my hands especially in winter.  An employee told me that several of her co workers use the lotion for a variety of issues and they love it.  I tried it and have been hooked since.  I make it a habit to use it every morning and my hands stay super soft.  Trust me I had tried every lotion I came across and this is the only one that works.  My sister even asked what I was using on my hands bc they looked noticeably better</li>
    <li> Very creamy and not greasy.  Just wish it worked better on my ezcema, but I haven&#x27;t really found anything that does.  This is great as a standard body cream and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> I like it because I can useit bothnight andday andfor my whole body not just my face.  I use aloe cream on a burn and it is a miracle cream  Thank you for this all purpose cream.</li>
    <li> I am seventy years old and have had dry skin for years and no matter how much lotion I might put on my legs and arms especially, I still have flaking, but since I started using the Deluvia Mirical cream I can put it on my legs and arms right after getting out of the shower and won&#x27;t have to re-apply it again for several days. And I see no flaking.</li>
    <li> Have used before, always a good consistent product.</li>
    <li> Great product, last a long time, not greasy</li>
    <li> Has the desired effect -  no more flaking, non perfumed, no adverse reactions.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought the single, just found the double. This stuff is AMAZING. I have VERY DRY skin and this handled it. Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This cleared up red dry patches on my face when nothing else would work.  It is very hydrating as well.  I am recommending it to others. Love it!</li>
    <li> This  is  great  stuff.  Made primarily from organic ingredients  with  NO  PERFUMES  added.  Probably the best  cream  I ever  used;  overall.  Try this,  you will not be disappointed. Good for  Women and Men------- use on the face, hands,  or as a  complete body  moisturizer.  Love the Natural smell.  I&#x27;m  hooked.</li>
    <li> This cream has cleared up my daughters exezema, when nothing else worked. My neck area looks ten years younger and just having had some skin cancers removed from my face, it cleared up the sites in no time. I have extremely sensitive skin, and can not use anything that has fragrance in it unless it is an essential oil.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t like reading reviews if a product is just recently used and I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews.  However, I have to for this one!  I have very dry skin and have been using it for a few days on my whole body at night and I am amazed at how in it keeps me moisturized the next day, especially on my face.  This never happens. HERE&#x27;S THE BEST PART... I just looked up the ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t identify on The Environmental Working Group website and nothing rates over a level 1 for toxicity!!!  Forget how well it works, using this won&#x27;t give me cancer!!  It is all natural and paraben free!  Check your ingredients on the other stuff you use on your skin.  It&#x27;s virtually impossible to find products like these.</li>
    <li> This was my 2nd purchase of this cream and we love it. It&#x27;s great for dry skin and even helps my grandkids eczema.  Good on my dry summer heels too</li>
    <li> Best I have found to soften hands and arms</li>
    <li> Love it,use every day</li>
    <li> Great cream, soaks right into my skin, non oily.  Light and not heavy at all .</li>
    <li> I enjoy using Deluvia  Miracle Aloe Cream applying on my face and other dry areas of my body. This is my second set of jars that I&#x27;ve purchased. Next order will be Clarifying Toner and Shea Body Butter. It&#x27;s definitely a good product that works well for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product every day.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> This cream has handled my eczema without need of drugs, only this organic product was necessary and now I am eczema free!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I originally discovered this product at SAMS.  We are hooked.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and the comment I got back was–&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;OK as a hand cream, except it is thick - hard to spread - and the fragrance is an artificial chemical/almond smell.&amp;#34; Other reviewers have also written about the poot smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out not be the greatest gift idea!</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first time I used it.  This time is no exception.  Leaves no greasy residue and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Deluvia Miracle Cream.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Worth the amount spent.  Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Good product always delivered on time. I have never used the product but my wife loves it and make me order all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This very good product it&#x27;s really work my son have very bad problem his skin peel off his foot he start using and now skin clear that work axima too</li>
    <li> Great product.  Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at SAm&#x27;s club during a first  time sales offer. I was skeptical so I purchased one 8oz jar. This cream  was so effective and the results of my were  all positive.  Uses; dry skin,face,neck, diaper rash,mosquito bites,skin irritation,  hands, and other external  skin problems...  Had to order  2 more jars from amazon. ...the price was pretty good.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream. I have extremely sensitive skin and am also very sensitive to strong smells. Deluvia Miracle Aloe Cream is so gentle yet effective. It is not greasy and the smell is very light and mildly pleasant. I use it as a whole body moisturizer and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The name fits...great product! I have been suffering from dry, irritated, flaky skin on my face for weeks, and nothing I have tried has made a difference. I visited my mom and she had a jar of this. Not having much faith, I applied a small amount to my face. I felt immediate relief, and now 24 hours later, I can&#x27;t believe the difference. Dramatic improvement For me, and I am leaving her house with a jar. This will be a regular order for me. Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> This Aloe cream is all that it says it is and more. It works well and does not leave any unpleasant smell or feel.  It absorbs well into your skin w/o feeling greasy.  I would suggest you try it if you have dry skin from age or weather or problem skin of most any type. It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This was the second order of this cream I have bought.  The first time I bought at Sam&#x27;s Club, but hadn&#x27;t been able to replace it there.  So I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I love this cream for face, hands, arms--everywhere.  The aloe seems to keep down redness and the creams are a happy medium between enough and not greasy for the face.  Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it at night.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Perfect for dry skin or skin allergies or eczema. Only product son has used successfully..it does not cause problems with his .lanolin allergy. Large jars really last. Absolutely no odor.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I use it all over. I can&#x27;t believe the difference on my hands and feet.  Much softer!</li>
    <li> My husband has suffered with psoriasis for 16 years and has tried a variety of treatments. Besides the sun, which isn&#x27;t available in our Michigan climate for most of the year, no other natural remedy has worked as well. Many of his spots are clearing up. He has to apply at least every two days, but is working beautifully. He highly recommends trying this. So do I...far fewer dead skins flakes in the house!</li>
    <li> Second time I have bought this product.  Love it</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s amazing. I had had dry cracked feet, after using this for a couple of days they are not dry anymore</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very dry skin, dermatitis and eczema and this is the best cream to help with that.  I highly recommend it. So glad I stop by at Sam&#x27;s Club when they were demoing this product, it has changed the way my skin feels.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff - it feels so good on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my dry cracked heels. I have tried everything on the market...from perscriptions to over the counter products...everything. This works wonders! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. I have very dry skin and after a shower if I do not use this on my legs and arms, with-in a couple of hours my skin looks like a snakes, when I use it my this does not happen for a couple of days. The only thing I am not thrilled about is the smell. The smell is less than inviting, but that goes away by the time I dress. It truly is a miracle as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I use it on my Psoriasis and it works better than anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> It is the best cream that I have ever used for face, hands, and feet. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is very good i likes it a lot and it really refreshes your face when you need it. May not be for every one.</li>
    <li> Love this creme. Really helps with dry skin. Used it during breast radiation treatment and the results were amazing as well will continue using b</li>
    <li> I bought this cream several months ago, never used it!!  I decided to take it back and get the money refunded,&lt;br /&gt;then...I thought, why not try it..I am 87 years old, and I had never found a good cream before, after trying&lt;br /&gt;50+ kinds over the last 45 years. Well.. this is a miracle cream, my skin looks like a young skin.  I have never endorsed anything in all my life, but this cream can not be praised enough.  IT REALLY IS A MIRACLE CREAM!!</li>
    <li> My husband has the driest winter hands, and we have probably purchased every commercially available lotion on the market, with little success. This lotion really has been the miracle for him, and now we all use it. It has been well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best I&#x27;ve used for dry skin, healing blemishes and cracked heels. Great product!</li>
    <li> Aloe is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve suffered the past two years with dry, itchy red and painful skin on my forehead.  Dr said it was rosecsa.  No ins. so had to use OTC med which made it more sore and irritated.  This product calmed it down quickly.  After 1 week, I added two of my Young Living Essential Oils to it and, ah I am in love.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! My skin is very dry and this is truly a miracle.......This is my second order of this amazing Miracle Aloe Cream.. I even gifted a jar to my Sister.  She loved it too.  We both have dry skin and live where we need to use a Humidifier in the house during the winter.  it helps but not enough.  This cream is a God send for older post menopause skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this cream for almost two weeks and I already send you three customers I hope this tells you a lot,,, it is great</li>
    <li> I have eczema, so when this first came out, it worked wonders for me. This is a newer version of the old one. I still have the bottle of what this used to be when it first came out. By comparison, the old container for the cream held just a little bit more, and the cream was thicker than it is now. The cream now seems watered down, but hopefully still has the same effect.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I first discovered it during a product demo at Sam&#x27;s club.  When I ran out, I turned to Amazon to see if they carried it.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  I use it as a daily moisturizer on my face.  It leaves my skin so soft.  I will also use it as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this from SAMs club, when the sales guy put some on my hands, I was skeptical. However, I do have try skin and have been looking for any effective lotion. After I shopped around in SAMs club, my hands feel so smooth and the skin looks so nice! So I decided to buy four of them! I am so glad to find out that amazon also has it, so when SAMs club is out of it, I can find it in amazon! Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Ok my cousin came a week ago with skin that look like she was 35 she is 60... I asked her what her secret was. She told me about this Miracle Aloe cream so I order it. I live in Vermont and it&#x27;s very dry here so my skin is dry and flakely . Well after 2 days of using this cream it has totally changed the appearance of my whole body. It&#x27;s really amazing and I just love it. I got some small jars and put it all over the house just in case I wanted to put it on. Usually you put on cream and your skin looks great and then you wake up in the morning and you are not happy the way your skin looks.... Not this cream after 3 days of use my skin is baby soft no dry skin just perfect . It&#x27;s natural and I will use this the rest of my life. So I really recommend this Miracle cream...... Wonderful</li>
    <li> I love this cream and  use only this one.</li>
    <li> love this cream, good for the whole body....</li>
    <li> I just love this cream!!! It&#x27;s smooth, non-greasy and really helps my dry skin, better than any other cream I have used in the past. Believe me, I have tried them all!</li>
    <li> I am a man and this is the best cream for hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year and rarely used it until just recently. With winter setting in, my hands and lips have been feeling very dry. So I started trying to use this cream before bed and before work, applying it to my hands and face. In the morning I apply to my hands and just a dab on the lips. My skin feels really good...soft and not dry. I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply lotion or chapstick constantly all day long anymore. A little of this does seem to go a long was as well, so though it&#x27;s expensive I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the investment. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is how it feels on my face right after I put it on...it takes a bit to absorb I think. If it works though that is a small price to pay.  update: I found a new use amazing benefit/use for this cream. Imagine you have a mishap in the kitchen involving near boil hot liquid that results in a pretty nasty burn...well that happened a week ago. The pretty severe burn is still healing, but with the application of this in the morning and before bed it has not peeled at all and the burn marks get a little smaller each day. I figured that aloe would be a good thing for it and it has really done a great job. Hopefully I won&#x27;t see any scaring either. Would probably be awesome for healing a sunburn...it&#x27;s not as soothing as aloe, but would be great for the days after to heal up that skin (I&#x27;d suspect with out peeling).</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this! It&#x27;s Paraben free and fragrance free. It&#x27;s all natural. This stuff is wonderful. It really is what I would call a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super dry; sometimes acutely dry, skin. This cream is incredible. It&#x27;s like my skin drinks it in. It makes my skin supple and soft.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Cleared my eczema of 3 years quickly</li>
    <li> This seems to keep our skin soft and moisturized with no additional perfumes.  It does, however, have an odor all it&#x27;s own that may or may not be a turn-off.  Only an added perfume would cure that so we like it as is.</li>
