      <li>, honestly, I cannot say that this is the cure, but,,,,the skin rash I have been experiencing IS getting better.</li>
      <li>I had thought that these salts were coarser when I ordered, but they are very fine grain.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better bath products I have purchased.</li>
      <li>My skin always feels nice and smooth after I get out of my bath, and I feel relaxed.  </li>
      <li>These, however, almost magically disappear as soon as I put them in the water.  </li>
      <li>I can not say enough good about these!!</li>
      <li>hotter the better in terms of water temperature</li>
      <li>that I was able to transfer it into.</li>
      <li>I decided to do a detox bath with this instead, and I swear it works better than anything I ever used before.</li>
      <li>is it dissolves quicker and more fully.</li>
      <li>I mix 2 cups with a full tub of warm bath water.</li>
      <li>I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and soaking my feet in these salts and hot water did not make them feel good.</li>
      <li>but I was hoping that the salt wouldn&#x27;t be so finely ground.</li>
      <li>It always makes me wonder if it&#x27;s genuine or not...</li>

      <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for Dead Sea bath salts.</li>

      <li>Granules a small to medium size and perfect for the homemade bath salt gifts I was making.</li>
      <li>They dissolve quickly and just make the bath water feel... silky?</li>
      <li>I love, love, love the dead sea salts.</li>
      <li>I mix 2 parts of these salts with 3 parts epsom salts, then add essential oils, and make my own bath salts.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favourite bath addition as it&#x27;s natural and has properties that make your skin look better and your muscles more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
      <li>But I do love another brand a little more, (</li>
      <li>I have dry skin on my face and scalp, so I fill the sink with warm water and add some of this salt.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, it was just a little to course for the application I wished to used it for.</li>
      <li>These pads are mild and I found them useful on a long trip (good way to get around TSA regs on carrying liquids) because they are useful for refreshing the face, cleansing the face, hands, a quick sponge off  in the midst of travel (under arms and other areas needing attention when a bath is not possible).  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin in good condition and I find that it&#x27;s most effective to use after a bad day in work (these happen far too often)</li>
      <li>In todays economy more is better for example two weeks at least.</li>
      <li>My skin is soft, smells sweet, and isn&#x27;t irritated.</li>
      <li>It worked really well for that</li>
      <li>but it really did not.</li>
      <li>Very soothing for my irritated skin.</li>
      <li>I added some lavender, clary sage, and eucalyptus essential oils to mine to make my bath smell fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It actually works better when you scrub it all over your body with some natural oil.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>and it seems to help my skin it makes my bath water feel nice its hard to explain</li>
      <li>They really do make my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find them that much better than other similar wipes, which is why I gave them a three.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>You can go purchase generic Epsom Salt for considerably less and get better results than with this bag</li>
      <li>It makes the bags last a lot longer than filling a whole bath with it.</li>
      <li>I found their website, they are based in the UK (wow, go figure) and even then still found no ingredient list.  </li>
      <li>I have been doing any number of natural things to help so</li>
      <li>The product us good, it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount they put in the bags.</li>
      <li>I instinctively closed my eyes when I first saw it.  </li>
      <li>I have a hard job teaching high school English, and a good soak in these salts helps me decompress after a hard day.</li>
      <li>Not really sure how it works, but dead sea salt is amazing.</li>
      <li>After each bath I always use the silky smooth body lotion which I apply at least twice a day to help keep my condition at bay</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I add it up to what I already have with an oil base and I just use it as a scrub instead of a bath. It actually works better when you scrub it all over your body with some natural oil.</li>
    <li> Not really sure how it works, but dead sea salt is amazing. I have dry skin on my face and scalp, so I fill the sink with warm water and add some of this salt. It makes the bags last a lot longer than filling a whole bath with it. I definitely recomend it if you havent tried it before.</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis and my derm advised to take warm baths so I purchased this in hopes that it would reduce the inflammation or at least have an effect on my Psoriasis, which it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. It doesnt have any fragrance which is good, but i just didn&#x27;t see results. However, I do work out occasionally and would use this to alleviate the muscle soreness. Not what I hoped for but worked for something.</li>
    <li> These salts dissolve like a dream.  Most commercial bath salts that I buy at, say, a department store, take quite a while to dissolve and end up sitting on the bottom of the tub making it uncomfortable for awhile.  These, however, almost magically disappear as soon as I put them in the water.  The salts themselves don&#x27;t have any aroma.  I added some lavender, clary sage, and eucalyptus essential oils to mine to make my bath smell fantastic.  My skin always feels nice and smooth after I get out of my bath, and I feel relaxed.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> My reiki instructor suggested this for me as a replacement for epsom salt for my baths. I decided to do a detox bath with this instead, and I swear it works better than anything I ever used before. I recommend doing it the night before a day off, because you will be very tired the next day. I recommend drinking lots of fluids and allowing your body to relax afterwards. You will feel great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and she swears by it.  The only thing I wish is that the bag was resealable.  Good thing I had a few empty jars lying around that I was able to transfer it into.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better bath products I have purchased. Very soothing for my irritated skin. And the aroma is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> These are terrific bath salts. They really do make my skin soft. I have a hard job teaching high school English, and a good soak in these salts helps me decompress after a hard day.</li>
    <li> I needed a fluffer bag of Dead Sea salt to maintain my skin in between shipments from Saltworks, a.k.a. They Who Supply Utopia in Salt Form, so I got this 2 lb bag of crap made by \\&quot;Spa Magik\\&quot;.  I normally do not trust any business that intentionally misspells its name out of scorn and disgust for their poor vocabulary skills, but I was desperate to keep my psoriasis (and RA--I&#x27;ve hit the Autoimmune Powerball, yay for me).  How horrible is their product?  Let me count the ways...  Quality Dead Sea salt is a quite dingy shade of off-white.  The whiter the salt, the poorer the mineral content and quality.  Their salt is so blindingly white I instinctively closed my eyes when I first saw it.  Quality manufacturers include a list of their quality ingredients.  Spa Magik includes a breakdown of the mineral content of unprocessed Dead Sea salt, it is not indicative of the bag&#x27;s makeup.  I found their website, they are based in the UK (wow, go figure) and even then still found no ingredient list.  Spa Magik does admit however that it is not a luxury brand, and then promotes its sister product which they claim is luxury.  I contacted the MagiKians at Spa Magik and politely asked for a list of ingredients.  The phone call was dropped, how convenient.  The email I sent has yet to receive a response.  To summarize, THIS PRODUCT BLOWS!!  You can go purchase generic Epsom Salt for considerably less and get better results than with this bag o&#x27; crapple. Salt lovers, stay away...you and I both know that Dead Sea salt does not make bathwater cloudy or skin itchy &amp; greasy at the same time.  Idk what this is, but I DO know it&#x27;s not solely salt from the Dead Sea as the advertisement claimed.</li>
    <li> I have had a sudden onset of eczema on my hands. NEVER had to deal with anything like this before in my life and I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s now.  I read that people who had psoriasis or eczema who went to Israel and soaked in the Dead Sea actually had marked improvement in their condition. Well I can&#x27;t afford to go to Israel, so I brought some of the Dead Sea Salts to me, and soaked my hands in them.  Hopefully, it&#x27;s helping!  I have been doing any number of natural things to help so, honestly, I cannot say that this is the cure, but,,,,the skin rash I have been experiencing IS getting better. Slowly.</li>
    <li> I mix 2 parts of these salts with 3 parts epsom salts, then add essential oils, and make my own bath salts. I had thought that these salts were coarser when I ordered, but they are very fine grain. They dissolve quickly and just make the bath water feel... silky? Vastly different than just using epsom salts, even though I&#x27;m mixing the two salts together.</li>
    <li> These pads are mild and I found them useful on a long trip (good way to get around TSA regs on carrying liquids) because they are useful for refreshing the face, cleansing the face, hands, a quick sponge off  in the midst of travel (under arms and other areas needing attention when a bath is not possible).  I didn&#x27;t find them that much better than other similar wipes, which is why I gave them a three.&lt;br /&gt;But I did appreciate their mildness.</li>
    <li> [...]  The finest Dead Sea cosmetics and beauty products based on natural ingredients found only in the Dead Sea.  The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the dead sea salts. I use them when making bath salts and they rock!! They mix well with other salts and hold the essential oil smell well.

[[ASIN:B0013G388Q Dead Sea Spa Magik Body Lotion 350ml/11floz]]</li>
    <li> Great for a relaxing bath</li>
    <li> Everything as expected. Granules a small to medium size and perfect for the homemade bath salt gifts I was making.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make a variety of bath salts for the ladies in my family. It worked really well for that but I was hoping that the salt wouldn&#x27;t be so finely ground. It looks prettier in the jars if its a but chunkier and less uniform.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel like salt idk what this was . Crap!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money . Shipping also took too long</li>
    <li> This is by far my favourite bath addition as it&#x27;s natural and has properties that make your skin look better and your muscles more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 3 times a week and find that throwing in a handful usually does the trick. Its best to add the water first, add the salt and then mix it with your hand to separate and disperse the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hotter the better in terms of water temperature and I soak in it until the water goes coldish (30-45 mins). It keeps my skin in good condition and I find that it&#x27;s most effective to use after a bad day in work (these happen far too often) or after a hard session in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wouldn&#x27;t recommend though is to thrown the salt water over your hair because it makes it terribly dry and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a bigger bag next time in order to save a few £££££.</li>
    <li> When my daughter was an infant she had horrible eczema, so every night we would give her a sea salt bath in the kitchen sink and it help a lot.  Through trial and error we have thankfully found a moisturizing regimen that works for her and she doesn&#x27;t need this anymore so my wife sometimes putrs it in her own bath.  It does leave your skin feeling very nice.</li>
    <li> This is great cheap salt and it works great for baths. The only problem is that is contains grains of sand or dirt as well as salt (not a bunch but noticeable).</li>
    <li> The product us good, it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount they put in the bags. For those who bathe daily &amp; have jetted tubes, the product does not but a week. In todays economy more is better for example two weeks at least.</li>
    <li> I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and soaking my feet in these salts and hot water did not make them feel good. Sorry. That is the reason I purchased this product. Never did soak in the tub with this, so I can&#x27;t say how it would affect the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my husband. He has psoriasis and it did make a difference on his skin. It worked great on his hands.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, it was just a little to course for the application I wished to used it for. Great it you were usisng in for bath salts.</li>
    <li> I like it, use it for my baby girl who suffers from ezcema.  But I do love another brand a little more, (One with Nature Bath Salts, Dead Sea Mineral, Eucalyptus - 32 oz  also comes in lavendar and another scent) simply for the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead sea salts are the only way i have found to keep my baby from having flare ups. it soothes her skin and i believe it calms her.  I mean, come on, who doesn&#x27;t love a nice salt soak??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus this brand has over the other is it dissolves quicker and more fully.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for Dead Sea bath salts. It always makes me wonder if it&#x27;s genuine or not... Anyway, I gave this as a gift to someone for Christmas. Got a good review from him. That&#x27;s all I can ask for, I guess.</li>
    <li> I been using it when I take a bath and it seems to help my skin it makes my bath water feel nice its hard to explain but I&#x27;m pretty sure I will buy again</li>
    <li> Cannot tell you about the quality , it looked  god just barely enough for a couple of baths. , I realize the weight is on the order guide .</li>
    <li> Around the time of the changing of the seasons I either have tons of rashes in secret places or just dry skin due to eczema. This salt soothes my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take the place of fexofenadine or expensive creams, but the redness and stinging pain does get better after a long soak in this stuff every 5-6 days. I mix 2 cups with a full tub of warm bath water. In the summer I even make powdered milk or tea baths and mix in a cup of dead sea salt. My skin is soft, smells sweet, and isn&#x27;t irritated.</li>
