      <li>Thank you for such a nice product, I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner if you have fine dry hair :)</li>
      <li>I tried so many different shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>These are my opinions only, but I&#x27;m trying to be as Truthful about my results as I can.  </li>

      <li>This has helped my damaged hair so much!  </li>
      <li>They really work!</li>
      <li>Thanks Much!</li>
      <li>Amazon really puts there customer first.</li>
      <li>Shampoo was really runny and didn&#x27;t even lather, which was really upsetting at first.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>I can really tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>I much prefer the &amp;#34;Repair&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Things just cost too much not to have them work.</li>
      <li>, you got to watch where you buy some of the products because they water them down, but i was pretty pleased with this.</li>
      <li>After one use my hair was repaired and looked virgin new and super soft.</li>
      <li>It does take care of my hair better than any other shampoo.</li>
      <li>Was using a cheap shampoo from store and hair was so dry.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it</li>
      <li>After just 2 washes it is shiny and soft again after trying many other crappy products to no avail.</li>
      <li>I like this much more than some of the other professional repair shampoos on the market.  </li>
      <li>Also they were sealed &amp; new.</li>
      <li>Have tried many products for my dry fine hair &amp; this has made my hair fee; &amp; look so much healthier in a week, no more brittle &amp; breaking hair!!</li>
      <li>Works great on my very long thick hair!</li>
      <li>Keeps your hair soft and shiny</li>
      <li>Run in the hair and rinse what else do I need to say its expensive shampoo that I pretty much got the conditioner free for..</li>
      <li>Very drying for my finer, colored, long hair.</li>
      <li>When I bought this, I thought it would be more similar to Biolage, thick and creamy.  </li>
      <li>Lost lots of my Baby Fine Hair in the comb, so if you have thick or curly hair, don&#x27;t get this.  </li>
      <li>For thick, Curly Hair I would use Pureology and for hair like mine, baby fine, I&#x27;m going back to Biolage Hydratherapy and Balm Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to people with color treated hair, helps lock in your color with minimal fading.  </li>
      <li>I did not have to wash my hair everyday with this, i only conditioned everyday. :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> the shampoo sucks- makes my feel super crappy and difficult to work with. The conditioner literally saves the day but I still need to put in leave in treatments or oils. Doesn&#x27;t feel like salon quality.</li>
    <li> Works great on my very long thick hair!</li>
    <li> Have tried many products for my dry fine hair &amp; this has made my hair fee; &amp; look so much healthier in a week, no more brittle &amp; breaking hair!!</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived on time. Overall, I am satisfied and pleased with both the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> this is great shampoo , glad i got it !</li>
    <li> Came sooner then expected! Very pleased! Will definitely be ordering again</li>
    <li> My hair was so dry I tried so many different shampoos and conditioners. When I finally tried this one it was the best shampoo and conditioner that I have used in a long time just love it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I should buy this product. I always read people reviews before I want to buy a product and every time the &amp;#34; good, excellent&amp;#34; product bought it and tested for other people I feel Disappointed. NOTHING seems to work for my hair. Its thick and heavy and I got A lotttttttt!!!!, believe, even with professional queratine treatment its heavy. This is another &amp;#34;waste money&amp;#34; product for me</li>
    <li> bought as a gift and the price was great!</li>
    <li> I love Matrix products and this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Duo is great for keeping hair smooth and managing frizz.  I also use Matrix Leave in Conditioner to help manage frizz.</li>
    <li> Not too good of a smell</li>
    <li> Received items as described. Also they were sealed &amp; new. The shampoo and conditioner lasted a very long time! The only downside is I didnt realize a difference in my hair, but that may just be because of the damage.</li>
    <li> This has helped my damaged hair so much!  My  hairdresser can&#x27;t even believe it.  I would recommend it to anyone with alot of breakage.</li>
    <li> I love Matrix. It&#x27;s affordable and does wonders to my hair. I like it better than Nexus and it costs a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and this is the only product that works great with my hair . It mends my the hair where I don&#x27;t have split ends..love this it works great on natural hair as well. Everytime I stop using it I notice a difference in my hair. Will always order this stuff, wot petah the money</li>
    <li> I have used Matrix products for the past 10 years.  I have always purchased them from a hair salon and have always had great results.  I have very thick, naturally curly hair which requires a lot of moisture.  I saw this great deal on Amazon and thought this was a great deal as these products can be a bit pricey.  Well it did nothing for my hair, it was a complete waste of money as I landed up purchasing from a hair salon.  I can really tell the difference.  Too bad . . . .</li>
    <li> The shampoo was a bit thin, I thought there was something wrong with it.  It is actually fine, the formulation is moisturizing and I like using it.  It smells like a st. ives (?) jojoba shampoo that I used occasionally when I was a youth.  It is repairing and moisturizing, may make hair a bit limp.  I recommend it for my needs.  (Heavier hair that is flyaway, drying from graying and heat styling)</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Sleek&amp;#34; was sent to me in error.  I much prefer the &amp;#34;Repair&amp;#34; version, but still a great product if it matches your hair type.  my hair type just happens to prefer the repair version.</li>
    <li> This product is JUST like the one you buy at the store.  Leaves my hair soft, smells nice and easy to brush afterwards!  I highly recommend this to people with color treated hair, helps lock in your color with minimal fading.  I did not have to wash my hair everyday with this, i only conditioned everyday. :)</li>
    <li> I had bought this product at a hair salon and I loved it, i found it here in AMAZON and i couldn&#x27;t believe the price, i got a LOT more product for a LOT LESS money!!!!! this is where i am buying my shampoo from now on !!</li>
    <li> I made a really bad henna mistake and destroyed my hair 6 months ago. I wanted Pureology but found this kind for a much more affordable price and quantity. After just 2 washes it is shiny and soft again after trying many other crappy products to no avail. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and the after effect of the shampoo and conditioner.  When I bought this, I thought it would be more similar to Biolage, thick and creamy.  It is not and after the shower,  just dry &amp; tangly.  Lost lots of my Baby Fine Hair in the comb, so if you have thick or curly hair, don&#x27;t get this.  You likely will loose the teeth in your comb.  Even if you bought the Leave In Conditioner or Detangler which is another cost, I&#x27;m not sure how that would help.  Three products costs a lot.  For thick, Curly Hair I would use Pureology and for hair like mine, baby fine, I&#x27;m going back to Biolage Hydratherapy and Balm Conditioner.  These are my opinions only, but I&#x27;m trying to be as Truthful about my results as I can.  Things just cost too much not to have them work.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo/conditioner, but I don&#x27;t necessarily notice a difference in the amount of breakage in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! My hair looks and feels so much more healthy after just one use. My hair also smells extremely good! I would definitely buy again! ✌</li>
    <li> I bought this duo in the mall at a beauty suppy store, NOT FROM AMAZON. But i had to write a review to rave about these products. My hair is very thin and brittle. Its very hard to grow and very damaged due to the fact i was diagnosed with type 1 dabetes at the age of 8. So because I take insulin and many medications it all comes out of my hair and make my hair very imposible to grow and look healthy. UNTIL I USED THIS DUO! My hair feels thicker. It looks healthy and smooth and fabulous. AND IVE ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS! I cant believe how my hair looks. I may also mention i only add heat to my hair 1-2 times a week. Otherwise its up in a bun. But trust me this product is amazing!</li>
    <li> My hair is severely damaged. i been coloring it probably 5-6 times a year for 20 years. After one use my hair was repaired and looked virgin new and super soft. Only drawback is its expensive and smells odd smells like unscented lotion lol. I purchased it on Ulta Liter sale.</li>
    <li> I like this much more than some of the other professional repair shampoos on the market.  Smells and lathers nicely.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It does take care of my hair better than any other shampoo. So pleased! Plus the size is so convenient as I don&#x27;t like running out form conditioner once and once again.&lt;br /&gt;I read bad reviews about the smell, but WHATTTT?? It smells great, I like it. it has a sweet smell</li>
    <li> Run in the hair and rinse what else do I need to say its expensive shampoo that I pretty much got the conditioner free for.. It works pretty well.</li>
    <li> If you have dry or damaged hair at all, this combination of shampoo and conditioner may help. My hair is damaged at the ends from straightening and heat, after using this my hair feels soft and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Works well with my fine hair.  Makes hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected and good price for the quantity. I don&#x27;t buy the highest end for my teenagers as they use to much but the cheap target/walmart brands strip their hair so bad making it dry and frizzy. So we decided on the Matrix product which worked out beautifully and girls are happy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud or what but these actually make my hair worse.  It makes my hair feel dry and brittle. The shampoo is watery almost like half the bottle has been replaced with water.  I have used Matrix for a long time but have always bought from a salon.  I am very disappointed that I bought from Amazon and it wasn&#x27;t the quality I expected.  Never again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! 😊</li>
    <li> They really work! Amazed</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this set at all. I prefer herbal essences to this in both smell and quality and that isn&#x27;t great shampoo either. back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; DID NOT&amp;#34; Received what I ordered. Veryunhaapy because the $$ amount to retun is kore the cost. I order &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; what I receive actual &amp;#34;stinks!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Reida W.</li>
    <li> Matrix and Bioloage are my two favorite brands of shampoo and conditioner.  Excellent price on this i couldnt pass it up, you got to watch where you buy some of the products because they water them down, but i was pretty pleased with this. Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe just how good this shampoo and conditioner smells. I brought it for my daughter but I am tempted to steal it back from her.</li>
    <li> Immediately the first time I used this stuff, my hair felt so good. I have noticed the great results over and over the following days of use. Thank you for such a nice product, I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner if you have fine dry hair :) Thank You</li>
    <li> good quality, pleasant smell! I love it very much!</li>
    <li> I had good service, but returned the products. Very drying for my finer, colored, long hair. Very different than Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie. Won&#x27;t order this one ever again.</li>
    <li> Smells good product as described hope it works would purchase again a lot of product for money spent got better price than anywhere else</li>
    <li> Best hair products ever! I recommend Matrix hair product line to any and all! I&#x27;ve been using this kind for quite a few months now and my hair already feels smooth, healthy &amp; shiny! I&#x27;m a huge fan of Matrix, I&#x27;ve also used their volume enhancing line and loved it as well!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Was using a cheap shampoo from store and hair was so dry.  Got this stuff and in a month it has already improved.  My daughter says it&#x27;s helping her hair too.</li>
    <li> Do not use for curly hair!!!! Made my hair feel like straw!</li>
    <li> Really like this product.</li>
    <li> Works Great!  Thanks Much!</li>
    <li> Amazon really puts there customer first. I received these products in a matter of 2days. Love the shampoo makes an awful lot of suds and conditioner makes hair extremely soft.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was really runny and didn&#x27;t even lather, which was really upsetting at first. However, I noticed it worked wonders for my thin dark straight hair. It makes it shiny and soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for if you have flat hair like mine.</li>
    <li> This product it great for color damage hair, or it you use a blow dryer/curling iron each day.  Keeps your hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> I spent $30 on this set in hopes it would make my hair at least shine a little! It did make my hair FEEL smoother but it doesn&#x27;t LOOK any smoother than it did. Not something I would spend that much money on again for sure!</li>
    <li> I needed something that would help my damaged hair without making it feel dirty.  It did the trick! It was also bigger quantity than I expected.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this was matrix, I think it was refilled with something different. Will never buy shampoo from internet again.</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that works on my curly hair. Absolutely amazing!  Fast shipping &amp; neat packaging!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for long time. This is the best for my hair</li>
