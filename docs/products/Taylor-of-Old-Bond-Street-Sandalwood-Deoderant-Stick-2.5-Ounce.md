      <li>Like my heading says, nice smell, but not anything like sandalwood.</li>
      <li>I liked the aftershave,  cologne and soap</li>
      <li>I notice many reviewers did not experience this, so it must have just not been a match for</li>
      <li>Love this...</li>
      <li>I LOVE TOBS Sandalwood Shaving Cream...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding product, I would recommend it to my friends &amp; family.</li>
      <li>But it is more of a &amp;#34;Deoderant&amp;#34; rather than an &amp;#34;antipersperant&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I use this most every day.</li>
      <li>Love this scent.</li>
      <li>and then this on top.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still there giving off its stink-pretty and pissing off some of your co-workers! :-)</li>
      <li>Personally I love Sandalwood (ergo 5 stars) and look forward to buying a stick.  </li>
      <li>Well, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very clean smell that people will notice, but not be overpowered by.</li>
      <li>THE FRAGRANCE IS VERY CLEAN</li>
      <li>I noticed my underarms becoming redwood</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re one of those guys that wants to smell good but doesn&#x27;t want to draw attention to yourself, this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I purchased three more.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, does not stain clothes &amp; the scent lasts all day &amp; then some.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the screw top does replace very easily, the scent stays throughout the day and the stick retains its very pleasing aroma through its life.  </li>
      <li>It is a great scent, and looks like it will last a while.</li>
      <li>Smells Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Parabin free.</li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s aluminum free but check for yourself.</li>
      <li>Plus you are part of a great tradition and smell like an English gentleman&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>This one not only met that need, but its scent is so appealing that I decided to buy the matching Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood cologne, which is also an excellent choice.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy Taylor&#x27;s shaving products but the rest of their wares leave something to be desired.</li>
      <li>Good product - I got this because I use the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream and aftershave.</li>
      <li>It has major flaws, but comparatively superior.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean to my nose.</li>
      <li>BUT because I love it so much, I still use it!</li>
      <li>This scent is for men, so if you&#x27;re looking for sweet teenager smell</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had issues as some reviewers saying it dries out too quickly.</li>
      <li>I feel super fancy when I wear it.</li>
      <li>great fresh scent and now use it all the time...going to try to get other sandalwood products</li>
      <li>, Old Bond is the better &amp;#34;old brand&amp;#34;  I enjoy Taylor of Old bond shaving cream better the Trumpers btw</li>
      <li>Excellent scent, matches the sandalwood shaving soap exactly, long lasting.  </li>
      <li>The stick goes on smoothly and works very well.</li>
      <li>I love all Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood products and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>I am a traditional deodorant kind of guy (the white stick), and this one is nice around the house vs.</li>
      <li>Smells great ( old time scent) and really last all day, even in the heat.</li>
      <li>but it smells great and seems to last longer than most other deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street has an amazing line of classic products for men.</li>
      <li>so much I bought the deodorant and was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>(That&#x27;s what we all want, right?)</li>
      <li>Meaning if its hot out my pits sweat more than they do if were using Old Spice.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my husband after he tried the old fashioned shaving cream in the same scent and loved it.</li>
      <li>As I like the scent very much I expect I shall, reluctantly in view of its faults, buy it again.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought this deodorant</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I love the TOBS Sandalwood shave cream, and the scent is pretty similar to that product.</li>
      <li>My mass market Jovan Musk works better and still has some left even after a year.     </li>
      <li>so I will pay 13 more dollars for the next one too.</li>
      <li>I bought my first Taylor&#x27;s sandwood roll on stick in London about a year ago, out of curiosity.  </li>
      <li>Nothing like real classic sandalwood deodorant stick</li>
      <li>In the first week after being opened, the sandalwood aroma dissipated.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed everything I have ordered from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
      <li>Do not believe any positive feedback.</li>
      <li>Also, seems to last a good long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and has a classiness that can only be found in the London boutique that everyone knows as Taylor.</li>
      <li>If you are absolutely set on buying this, do yourself a favor and try it out before you go to the pool or on a date.</li>
      <li>My Wife really likes the smell.</li>
      <li>Very manly scent</li>
      <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT LINE I HAVE PURCHASED</li>
      <li>Smells very manly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they can charge so much for barf de la barf.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>So it complements those fragrances very well.</li>
      <li>Very manly in every regard.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have seen what is different in this &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; to know what to avoid in the future.</li>
      <li>You can also apply this to other body parts for more of a cologne type effect.  </li>
      <li>The first time I opened the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Deodorant Stick, it had a transparent plastic dome over the working end of the stick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great fragrance, not sticky, no stinging/burning. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Parabin free. I believe it&#x27;s aluminum free but check for yourself.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Taylor&#x27;s shaving products but the rest of their wares leave something to be desired. This deodorant, in particular, is one to avoid. After using it a couple of days I noticed that my armpits were discolored and extremely sensitive. This has never happened to me with ANY other deodorant and I would not describe my skin as particularly \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;. If you are absolutely set on buying this, do yourself a favor and try it out before you go to the pool or on a date.</li>
    <li> Smells so good on my husband.  He loves it. Thank you. A++++</li>
    <li> I liked the aftershave,  cologne and soap so much I bought the deodorant and was not disappointed. Keeps me dry and fresh and it&#x27;s pleasing to smell. Haven&#x27;t had issues as some reviewers saying it dries out too quickly. I would buy this again .</li>
    <li> Great product. So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed everything I have ordered from Taylor of Old Bond Street.</li>
    <li> Not completely satisfied with this product.  Still smells more of generic \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; than anything resembling sandalwood, but it is at least twice as authentic as the Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood deodorant at half the price.  This is a superior product to that one.  It has major flaws, but comparatively superior.</li>
    <li> It is now a month and a half since I bought the Taylor deodorant stick. Let me revise my review: the first paragraph is the same as before but the next two are not.  The first time I opened the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Deodorant Stick, it had a transparent plastic dome over the working end of the stick. I removed it and applied the deodorant after my evening shower. That first application was wonderful: fully aromatic that lasted through the morning. Altogether, what one would expect of a preparation designed for English gentlemen of uncertain toilet.  In the first week after being opened, the sandalwood aroma dissipated. This may have something to do with the plastic dome that I was unable to replace: the screw-on cover wouldn&#x27;t close. Also, the deodorant stick has shrunk and now rattles in its container. In any event, regardless of how much I now apply, little aroma seems to stick to my underarms and what little there is doesn&#x27;t last very long. What&#x27;s worse, the stick now is prematurely finished: it certainly contained less than 2.5 oz. of actual deodorant. My mass market Jovan Musk works better and still has some left even after a year.     Earlier I said that, sadly, I should not be a repeat purchaser. I have changed my mind. In the meantime I&#x27;ve searched the web for sandalwood deodorant sticks and there seem to be only two: the Taylor and the Geo F. Trumper Sandalwood Deodorant, which is twice as expensive and has had bad reviews. If one wants the sandalwood aroma, there&#x27;s little choice: the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Deodorant Stick is for all practical purposes the only game in town. As I like the scent very much I expect I shall, reluctantly in view of its faults, buy it again. I leave my numerical rating, as before, at 2 because I think the faults are severe.</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash like other people. Went away when I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought this deodorant and I bought it blind. I am very happy with it.  The world would be a pleasanter place if everyone wore this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the Smell Will not Buy This again</li>
    <li> I love all Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood products and this one is no exception. I adore it.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a truly masculine deodorant, instead of some oddly smelling one.</li>
    <li> My Wife really likes the smell. Home run! I add I scented Mitchum roll-on prior to this.</li>
    <li> Do you like the smell of bactine? Well, you&#x27;ll love this. Or maybe the smell of dead dying musk? Then this is. I don&#x27;t know how they can charge so much for barf de la barf.</li>
    <li> Re Michael A.&#x27;s comments.  If this is an alcohol-based deodorant, you can expect it to &#x27;evaporate&#x27; a little.  As for not being able to close the top, turn the bottom thingy (sorry to be so technical) until the product is even with or below the top edge - quite often stick deodorants won&#x27;t close properly unless you do this.  Personally I love Sandalwood (ergo 5 stars) and look forward to buying a stick.  But I also know that I won&#x27;t smell it all day - as you wear it and get used to the aroma, you&#x27;ll feel as though it&#x27;s no longer disturbing those around you who can&#x27;t stand the smell of any sort of &#x27;parfum&#x27; - but it&#x27;s still there giving off its stink-pretty and pissing off some of your co-workers! :-)</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Very masculine but also very refined. I layer this with Creed&#x27;s &amp;#34;Spice and Wood&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Royal Oud&amp;#34;, but could be used with just about any wood based fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has an &amp;#34;old world&amp;#34; type of smell. Some people refer to it as a &amp;#34;gentlemen&#x27;s barber shop&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> Smells Fantastic.  I like the Taylor of Bond Street Products.</li>
    <li> This brand is great...no complaints whatsoever. Taylor of Old Bond Street has an amazing line of classic products for men.</li>
    <li> Nothing like real classic sandalwood deodorant stick</li>
    <li> Good product - I got this because I use the Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream and aftershave. So it complements those fragrances very well. I will not recommend this by itself.</li>
    <li> It smells great. It&#x27;s not too strong and has a classiness that can only be found in the London boutique that everyone knows as Taylor.</li>
    <li> Always preferring a scented deodorant that comes in a stick, I searched for one with a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; fragrance that would coordinate with a few different colognes in that family that I like but that don&#x27;t come in a deodorant stick.  This one not only met that need, but its scent is so appealing that I decided to buy the matching Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood cologne, which is also an excellent choice.  This is priced roughly mid-range for scented deodorant sticks, which can be less than $10 or more than $20 apiece.  I prefer classic fragrances that have been around for a long time and are produced by a well-established company, because it greatly lessens the likelihood that I will like a particular scent and then find it&#x27;s been discontinued, which is a common occurrence.  Taylor of Old Bond Street is in that category.</li>
    <li> Very manly in every regard. Easy to apply, does not stain clothes &amp; the scent lasts all day &amp; then some. Outstanding product, I would recommend it to my friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I found my new scent! This scent is for men, so if you&#x27;re looking for sweet teenager smell this is not it.</li>
    <li> Like my heading says, nice smell, but not anything like sandalwood. To me it smells like a classic barbershop aftershave. Very fresh and clean to my nose. I can&#x27;t detect any wood aroma in it. The scent lasts a good while on me ( 5 hrs-ish). I won&#x27;t buy again, but I don&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT LINE I HAVE PURCHASED THE AFTER SHAVE AND BALM. THE FRAGRANCE IS VERY CLEAN AND NOT SO OVER POWERING AS THE STUFF YOUNG KIDS ARE WEARING.</li>
    <li> Love this... great fresh scent and now use it all the time...going to try to get other sandalwood products</li>
    <li> I love TOBS stuff!  I use their shaving cream and my wife loves the smell, too.  I would caution that this is deodorant and NOT antiperspirant, so I do use Ban unscented antiperspirant and then this on top.  Other heavily scented antiperspirants can irritate my pits, but Ban doesn&#x27;t and I like the smell of this so I compromise and use both.  You can also apply this to other body parts for more of a cologne type effect.  Smells very manly.</li>
    <li> Pricey but it smells great and seems to last longer than most other deodorants.  I will keep using and buying it.</li>
    <li> Plenty of it, great scent.  But it is more of a &amp;#34;Deoderant&amp;#34; rather than an &amp;#34;antipersperant&amp;#34;  Meaning if its hot out my pits sweat more than they do if were using Old Spice.  But i like it and when the occasion calls for something a little different from Old Spice original, Old Bond is the better &amp;#34;old brand&amp;#34;  I enjoy Taylor of Old bond shaving cream better the Trumpers btw</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased a single stick of this deoderant.  I liked it so much I purchased three more.  I will be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this, however, after a couple weeks of daily use I noticed my underarms becoming redwood it&#x27;s kin irritation.  Never had this happen before.  It could be just me, but I&#x27;ve never had overly sensitive skin.  The rash went away after about 72 hours of not using it.</li>
    <li> once again, good product line</li>
    <li> good scent, lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> Smells good but it did cause some red places under my arms.</li>
    <li> I have been using ToBS shaving creams for a while and thought I would try their sandalwood deodorant. I am very pleased with it. The scent is not overpowering. The stick goes on smoothly and works very well. Also, seems to last a good long time. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood deodorant. It&#x27;s there, but not overpowering, and it complements the TOBS Sandalwood shaving cream that I use on occasion.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great ( old time scent) and really last all day, even in the heat.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TOBS Sandalwood Shaving Cream...can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I was hoping to get that scent in this deodorant.  It does NOT smell like the cream.  I&#x27;ll probably try the TOBS aftershave and cologne.  There are places that sell samples, so I won&#x27;t have to buy a bunch of it, just in case it smells like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but this does not treat my armpits well.  Oh well, I still have some Speed Stick...</li>
    <li> Buy this only if your intent is to smell like an old man. I can picture a bunch of gray haired guys with bad combovers wearing this stuff. It reeks.</li>
    <li> Great product, but the screw failed and I must advance the stick with knives and such --&amp;#62; messy</li>
    <li> It smells great, and is one of the best &amp;#34;roller&amp;#34; deodorants out there. I am a traditional deodorant kind of guy (the white stick), and this one is nice around the house vs. outside/work. It does have the sandalwood scent to it, which is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love the TOBS Sandalwood shave cream, and the scent is pretty similar to that product. I used this for no less than a couple weeks when my skin started breaking out in a painful rash. I&#x27;ve used many deodorants without this side effect, so I had to unfortunately throw this out. I notice many reviewers did not experience this, so it must have just not been a match for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion to the company would be to list the ingredients on their product. I would have liked to have seen what is different in this &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; to know what to avoid in the future.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re one of those guys that wants to smell good but doesn&#x27;t want to draw attention to yourself, this is the way to go. It&#x27;s a very clean smell that people will notice, but not be overpowered by.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, hands down and use this entire line. However, I have to take breaks from this stick because it does at times cause me to itch like crazy under my arms. BUT because I love it so much, I still use it! Yes it is that good!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  My wife loves the smell too.  Kinda pricey but it last a long time.  It&#x27;s a keeper!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this most every day. This is my third reorder and will order again. Very long lasting.  I bet I get 5 to 6 months on one tube.</li>
    <li> This is a big disappointment. Has no smell. When it was shipped all the deodorant leaked out in the&lt;br /&gt;Packages.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! It is a great scent, and looks like it will last a while. I don&#x27;t use anti-perspirants, and most of what I find on the shelves contains aluminum, so I was very happy to find TOBS Sandalwood!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband after he tried the old fashioned shaving cream in the same scent and loved it. He is extremely picky about his deodorant scents, as he can get turned off to them if the scent doesn&#x27;t hold up to heavy perspiration during his workouts - he says some scents &#x27;mix&#x27; with the perspiration scent and warp into a horrible new smell. This did not do that, it held up for him.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Taylor&#x27;s sandwood roll on stick in London about a year ago, out of curiosity.  I&#x27;m on my third now and still just as enamored of it as I ever was.  For anyone who has suffered through the repellent odor of Mennen or the other down-scale deodorant only men&#x27;s sticks, this sandalwood is a revelaton.  It&#x27;s easy to use, the screw top does replace very easily, the scent stays throughout the day and the stick retains its very pleasing aroma through its life.  In my case, the first stick lasted several months.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever used.&lt;br /&gt;  Very manly scent last all day...will not stain shirts. Content last ovet 3 months. You&#x27;ll be vety satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Gerrycel</li>
    <li> Smells good and my wife enjoys the scent but it does smell different from all the other sandalwood products I have.</li>
    <li> Sanderwood deodorant men&#x27;s deodorant it was open it was used when I got it</li>
    <li> excellent scent, not too strong... would purchase again... thank you...</li>
    <li> As a long-time user of Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving soap, I was expecting a quality product.  Unfortunately, this is not one such.  It&#x27;s heavily over-scented, filled with a bunch of artificial junk, and rather ineffective as a deodorant, preferring to simply batter other smells into submission through direct competition.</li>
    <li> This stuff lasts a long time. Yes, its spendy for pit stick but I bought my last one on August 31st and it is still going. (As of this writing Feb. 28th) I think I can probably get another month or so of everyday use. I have never owned a deodorant that lasted 6+ months so I will pay 13 more dollars for the next one too. Note that it is not a “pure” Sandalwood fragrance but is a fragrance blend that works for me.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Scratch that. Smells GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the job for me. I feel super fancy when I wear it. (That&#x27;s what we all want, right?)</li>
    <li> Excellent scent, matches the sandalwood shaving soap exactly, long lasting.  Item was fresh, not old stock.</li>
    <li> Do not believe any positive feedback. This will make you smell like the old lady you pass in the pharmacy, or sit behind in church. Unless you are trying to impress the blue haired ladies, look for another option. Smells like Este Lauder. No one under the age of 78 will find this the least bit appealing.</li>
    <li> Lasts forever, great scent. This is really good stuff. Plus you are part of a great tradition and smell like an English gentleman&amp;#62;</li>
