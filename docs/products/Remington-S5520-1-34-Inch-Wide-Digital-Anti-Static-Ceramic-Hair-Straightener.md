<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I chose to give this 5 states based on the GF&#x27;s feedback. Things that I personally like about it is IT ONLY TAKES 30 SECONDS TO HEAT UP! This means I&#x27;m not waiting 50 years to just go down the block for a quick bite to eat. It has a and lock to keep the plates closed and a swivel cord so when I put it away when it&#x27;s left out it&#x27;s a much simpiler process. The only con mentioned to me was it doesn&#x27;t remember your preferred temperature and must be re-set each use. For the price this is a good product and I would recommend it for someone like me that was going to give it as a gift. There are many types of these hair flatteners out there and I waited like 3 months for the Gf to research and tell me which one she wanted to no avail. So I researched them myself and picked this one. Anyway she likes it, so I hit a homer with this one because she mentions she loves it every so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing my original review of 6/10/13 because this morning it failed to fire up, plugged it in and zip, nada, nothing. Less than a year after buying I now have to find a recycle facility that will take it AND my GF had to buy a new one. I would not recommend or buy another. Downgraded review to 1 star. (3/14/14)</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! My hair is very thick and wavy and usually my hair wont last an hour after straightening it. But, this keep it straight all day, plus it made my hair very shiny.</li>
    <li> my daughter use it all the time . It work great and it is easly to use . the temperture readout is great</li>
    <li> Unfortunately both the Amazon site and the Remington site still say this Dual Voltage. It is only 120V. Here is copy of another review sent May 8 by another person. Unfortunately I ordered before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Remington recently deleted the dual voltage feature of the S-5520 model. The current models are 120 volt only. So if you want dual voltage this is not the one to get despite what the Amazon listing says. After complaining to the Remington company (even their website shows it dual voltage) they were kind enough to send a dual voltage replacement. Wife has not tried this model on 120 voltage yet.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It leaves my hair very straight and silky and I have thick and course hair. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!!!!!!!!!100% worth for each penny you spent . I will strongly recommend this</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dog. I was tired of the curly poodle hair, so I use this to straighten his coat. A couple of hours with this Remington straightener and a little bit of hair product and he has an awesome spiked coat. When we go to the dog park, all the other dogs are like &#x27;DAMN! Check that guy out!&#x27;. Before he got no play, and now he&#x27;s nailed two Newfies and a St. Bernard (I knew he always had a bit of an eye for the chunky chicks).</li>
    <li> I always buy this particular straightener because I love it! For the price it&#x27;s a great steal. I moved so I had to purchase another and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere near me so I figured i&#x27;d try amazon. Bad choice. The power button doesn&#x27;t work, and it will not work.</li>
    <li> Well, I have mixed hair, of Native american, Black, and white. Black hair being my most dominant hair trait I have kinks and crap. My friend allowed me to borrow her straightener and it took me a total of 2 hours to finish it. It made my hair so soft and it actually was healing it as I straightened it. In all honesty the Remington tool is amazing!  My friend has Caucasian hair and it works VERY well. and I used it on non relaxed African american hair and it made it just as soft and luxurious. I really recommend this product and im 15 so it cant be that expensive!![[ASIN:B003V21WO2 Remington S9520 Salon Collection Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 2 Inch]]</li>
    <li> The whole time the straightener is on it smells like burning chemicals. When I first got the straightener, it had a few scuff marks on it, making me wonder if it was previously used. The straightener also doesn&#x27;t close all the way; the plates only meet at the top of the straightener. This makes it very difficult to straighten your hair. I will most likely be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I recently just bought this straightener and tried it yesterday. I have to say, I am very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m Asian so my hair is generally thin but it&#x27;s also naturally wavy and frizzy due to humid weather.  I straightened it around 8 in the morning and went out for the entire day during a massive heat wave. After the whole day of sweating and wind blowing in my face, my hair was still straight! Usually after an hour of commuting my hair goes back to its wavy-self and poofs up like a frizzball.  How amazing is that. It also heats up very quickly and my hair does not get caught in the hinge unlike my old straightener. It takes me only a couple of minutes to straighten and I only have to run it through my hair once. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great quality, last very long</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for a trip because it was dual voltage.  I have only used it for about two weeks, but so far I have loved it.  I used it in Israel and did not even have to move a switch for it to work on their 240V system.  Of course an adapter plug was needed for their wall socket, but all in all this worked out fabulously.  It heated up very quickly and has a kind of lock on it so it closes up nicely to put in your luggage while still warm.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast, I&#x27;d recommend it. Good value as well, buy this over a chi. Four stars for me.</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightener for the price. It does the job!</li>
    <li> I have out of control hair. It doesn&#x27;t wave all over, but has wide waves and cowlicks everywhere. Especially one very stubborn one in the back, I didn&#x27;t have to turn it over 330 (My hair is REALLY thick), and as I started using it I almost went into shock. My hair was actually getting straight and I loved it. Even the evil cowlick in the back. Though I am getting my hair cut a wee bit shorter I know this iron will still work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the width. I think for women with longer hair that is like mine this would work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets rid of flyaways very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast and stays at the temperature you set. I like the temp gauge. It shows you when it is at the desired temperature. When you are done, it does take a little while to cool. The clip that keeps it shut when not in use is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am super, super happy and would recommend this to anyone. The lower the heat the better! Works great.</li>
    <li> wife loves it. nuff said</li>
    <li> The Remington flat iron is a superior hair straightening product - highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my broken flat iron, and after comparing prices and reviews on Amazon, chose this model. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and it&#x27;s actually much better than the old hair iron I had. (Don&#x27;t remember the make, sorry.)&lt;br /&gt;The wide blades make it easy to work with larger portions of hair, making hair styling much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;I like the digital temperature control that lets you pick the perfect setting for you hair type.&lt;br /&gt;The unit sits flat and steady on your work surface because of a swiveling junction where the electric cord joins the hand unit. Once the blades cool, there is a small sliding bar at the base that lets you lock the blades in a closed position for easy, flat storage. This product is a winner, and it&#x27;s less expensive than several other similar models. Buy this one!</li>
    <li> I looovvve this straightener, they do the job perfectly well with little or no effort. It heats up rapidly and makes the whole straightening process fast. I can go on and on and on, but this is definitely a good deal especially with the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the part where the blade is gets extremely hot and could burn you if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am very impressed and would definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this straightener before purchasing and figured since it was sort of mixed in opinion, I would try it out for my own liking. Here are the pros and cons with this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does straighten your hair. I have thick curly hair and I use Dove Heat Defense before straightening. It still takes just as long to straighten my hair as a normal, smaller sized straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swivel is nice. That is common sense though, we all know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital display is different from traditional straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets WAY too hot. I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective, but the picture states that it can go as low as 270 degrees. However, mine does not go any lower than 310. I have burnt myself numerous times, including getting a blister on my forehead where my bangs come down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the heat, it does seem to damage my hair, even with use of my heat defense spritz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
    <li> so this item is not dual voltage. there is written on iron 120v-60 Hz-so why are you saying to people when u write on its description that it is dual voltage? it is clearly written inside the iron when you open it. i have bought it and can not use it</li>
    <li> It is just what I hoped for. Straightens quite nicely and heats up very fast. the thickness is okay too.</li>
    <li> Excellent.. Straightens your hair really fast...&lt;br /&gt;Really worth the price&lt;br /&gt;I have really long hair and so this one turned out to be best</li>
    <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift and it broke on the person after two uses.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a christmas gift for my wife, This is the one she said that she wanted. I am very happy with this purch</li>
    <li> Overall this straightener was easy to use and made my naturally wavy hair straight within 15 minutes. I did seem to have less static throughout the day that I used to have with my old straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing i do not like about this straightener is that it does not have noise notifications like my old straightener did. Because of this the straightener would sometimes shut off and I wouldn&#x27;t know it.</li>
    <li> So far this product works really well and is very smooth. I do have straight hair already and this just helps smooth out the weird sleeping kinks. When pressed together, there is a slight gap between the plates. This doesn&#x27;t really affect me but just so everyone knows! :) Enjoy</li>
    <li> Remington recently deleted the dual voltage feature of the S-5520 model.  The current models are 120 volt only.  So if you want dual voltage this is not the one to get despite what the Amazon listing says. After complaining to the Remington company (even their website shows it dual voltage) they were kind enough to send a dual voltage replacement. Wife has not tried this model on 120 voltage yet.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product before buying and they were pretty much half good and half bad. Honestly this straightener is great! I recommend it to anyone looking for a straightener to STRAIGHTEN your hair. Yes the plates don&#x27;t touch at the bottom but there is not even a centimeter of space between the plates at the bottom, makes no difference to me. When you first turn it on, keep it on the low setting! It gets very hot very fast. Overall a great straightener for a great price.</li>
    <li> Holy toledo!!  This flat iron is amazing!!  I&#x27;ve previously owned a CHI and this one beats it in a second!  I mentioned it to my co-worker, who&#x27;s looking at a $150 flat iron, and I&#x27;m totally proud of my $16 flat iron.  Don&#x27;t hate on this bargain find!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It gets hot very quick, the temperatures is great!!! And it flat irons my hair perfectly!!!!!!! Omg and it is super cheat! wow I was truly amazed!!!!!!! Best buy out there and no regrets! There is no smell at all and if it breaks, I will buy another one!</li>
    <li> Iti is the first time I brought this stuff, Easy to use. Good quality and it works so good. Recommend it !</li>
    <li> Best Iron hair ever! My hair looks so beautiful and shiny! :)&lt;br /&gt;Perfect and excellent price.!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could not be more happy</li>
    <li> The Item works like a charm, I have no complaints for the price currently, only have had it for two months so lets wait and see.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this straightner!! I have really thick corse hair that is really hard to straighten, it usually took me up to or more then an hour to do my hair, with this iron it only takes me 30min or less, and it make my hair look like i just got back from the salon!</li>
    <li> This is my third time purchasing this model.  First I bought one for my daughter. She loved it, so I tried it out and was very pleased with the results.  I ordered a second one a few weeks later.  The second one was  hit and miss.  Every so often, I would not be able to turn it on.  Since I used mine daily, and my daughter only used hers once in a while, I switched with her, and very happily used the Remington S5520 for approx. 13 months.  At that point, it too began to not turn on every once in a while.  I figured I had gotten a good years use out of it, so I ordered a new one of the same kind in March of 2015.  It is only April, and I can no longer turn it on. I have tried every outlet in my house, and it will only turn on one out of 15 tries.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time to outlet-hop in the morning, so I would like a new one.  When I came on line to report this (which I have been meaning to do for the past 2 weeks), it is no longer eligible to return.  I am very disappointed. Remington is a company that has been in business for many many years. I expected much more than this.</li>
    <li> i love it but you can also buy it at walmart!! you save and avoid paying all the shipppping!!! but other than that love the way it works!</li>
    <li> Pros: Good quality for the price. Heats well and straightens my incredibly thick hair. It still takes me a significant amount of time, because I have so much hair, but it is comparable to other straighteners I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It always smells when it heats up. I have had this problem in the past (perhaps its just hair oils or something that is heating on the plates), but its something I can live with.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Heats up quickly and the digital temperature control really helps prevent burning to your hair. Has really good heat distribution so all the hair within the plates get straightened equally. I bought mine nearly 6 months ago - started malfunctioning last month; doesn&#x27;t turn on. Disappointing that is broken bc it&#x27;s a good quality straightener, but I&#x27;m afraid to buy another one for it to break so quickly as well. Especially since my first one (not Remington) lasted nearly 2 years. Overall, very good product.</li>
    <li> I have owned several straightener irons including a chi and nothing works like this one, it igets really hot and leaves the hair shiny and smooth, because of the size plates you can straight your hair really fast!</li>
    <li> warm up fast, gets extremely hot. straighten hair really well ! i would recommend to anyone with any type of hair .</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. In fact, it made more static electricity in my hair therefore I do not use it.</li>
    <li> This ceramic straightener was more than I had bargained for. Excellent price for a name brand styling product. I would definitely recommend it to a friend!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!! Product is brand new, it heats up fast and leaves hair so soft. Will use for a few more days and update.</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well for me and I am happy I purchased it. I like that it is wider then ones I have used in the past, it seems to work better with my hair.</li>
    <li> It get hot really fast, and my hair looks shiny when I use it, I love it, it is really easy to use.</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well. This makes my hair so straight and smooth. My hair is normally wavy and frizzy, so this has been a great help. I love the digital temperature setting also. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and gets really hot. It smells and the smell stays on the hair. The ceramic plates are not smooth at all, it drags on the hair. I only use it to straighten my bangs. I wouldn&#x27;t use it all over my hair might damage my hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener was purchased just six months ago, and already it has quit working! I am very disappointed with it, especially for it being a Remington brand. I will not purchase one of these again!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it is a really good straightner. I have really thick and poofy hair and it did an amazing job leaving my hair straight. Prior to this, I had a Remington straightner that cost me $20 and lasted me for years. It is definetly a brand can be reliable.</li>
    <li> I have thick and curly hair and this is a good solutions for my personal care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really hot, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Bought 1 for myself first, went on vacation with friends around Christmas time, and they all used it and asked where I got it.  I ordered 2 more for my friends as Christmas presents.  They really liked it and because it is 1 3/4&amp;#34; it cuts down on straightening time.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, wavy hair that usually takes me 30-45 min to straighten with normal straighteners. While it can fry your hair if you&#x27;re not careful, this puppy has my hair straight in ten minutes or less when on the 390-410 degree setting. And the wide plates let me go through my layers quickly and efficiently. Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I owed one before and loved it.  It heats up fast and gets really hot.  I received it quickly.  However, I ordered two and one came and did not work.  I did return it easily and got a refund with a couple of days no problem.  Amazon made everything quick and easy.</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and this flat iron works great on my hair! Heats up fast and I like that I can read the degrees on it instead of trying to guess on those really small dials!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something she might break or lose.  I have a Chi straightener that I spent a lot more money on and thought I must be getting the best results from it.  I decided to try this out, out of curiosity, and this works WAY better than my Chi!  This puppy gets hot, and makes my hair very straight with absolutely no strays.  I have recommended this product to many others.</li>
    <li> I do not like this flat iron, It gets too hot and the lowest setting is 310, and even with that my hair feels fried.</li>
    <li> It works great for me. For a low price its pretty good. Only complain it gets hot &amp; yoy cant hold it where you want</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener!!!! I have super curly hair and this keeps my hair from frizzing and it keeps it straight all day!! Best straightener ever!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener, and it works like a dream. Heats up fast, has 3 different levels for types of hair. Cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift to my wife when she came to USA from India..&lt;br /&gt;She is in love with it ..&lt;br /&gt;She had a philips one before but that wasnt great ..&lt;br /&gt;But this makes her look more beautiful..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot Remington..</li>
    <li> This has a temperature control setting (digitally) and it heats up quickly and is able to flatten very quickly.  The wide plates are great.</li>
    <li> I enjoy having this straightener. I think it does what it is supposed to do, yet at times shuts off randomly on me. I can&#x27;t quite remember whether or not the instructions were located with my product, but it seemed a little sketchy it was not in the original box but yet was wrapped as though it hadn&#x27;t been opened. This product overall works wonders!</li>
    <li> To my bestfriend and she says she loves it, it makes her hair so soft and silky looking which is hard considering she has really long hair</li>
    <li> Almost nothing can get my hair straight because it is so thick and just crazy lol.. This thing works like a charm. I love it</li>
    <li> The best one I have ever purchased! My advice is buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. It straightens ok, but it smells, and I cant take it anymore. It smells like melting plastic to me- it has since day one and I thought maybe it would wear off but it didnt. And its not that its burning my hair- the straightener itsself stinks up my house, and makes my hair smell for days.  Im going to buy a nicer one- you get what you pay for with straighteners.</li>
    <li> Bought this in Sept and after using this MAYBE once to twice a week, it&#x27;s broken. Will not turn on. I&#x27;m so angry about this seeing as though every other straightener I&#x27;ve had has lasted 5+ years. Straightens your hair...but will not last</li>
    <li> i have been using this straightener for a year now and i like it a lot. i have a very thick hair so i used to straighten my hair at the most high temperature which resulted in a lot of split ends on my hair. since it is wide, i have hard hard time styling the tip of my hair but other than this, very good product and some how satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I have had it over a year and it is still working great.</li>
    <li> Packing was intact but it looked like it has been used before and returned by someone. Has brown scratches.&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it right away. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best value possible in the ceramic straightener department. I&#x27;ve had better, but there are no big downsides to these Remington&#x27;s. If you need something cheap, but decent and reliable, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;  Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;  Digital temperature control works great&lt;br /&gt;  Locks in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Plates dont align perfectly towards the bottom(could just be mine)</li>
    <li> bad chemical smell. and the plates dont come together. stay away do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Your hair gets stuck between the plates and rips your hair out. Awful straighter! The plates don&#x27;t even come together</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim for my girlfriend. She has a hair straightener that she would travel with between her place and mine. I wanted to alleviate that burden while also getting her a quality product that she likes. This worked out great. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from a man, take this with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> I returned this.  The plates didn&#x27;t touch unless you held on to the tip (and it&#x27;s hot, so I didn&#x27;t do that more than once).  Bummer.</li>
    <li> The iron works very well, is easy to handle, very practical and comfortable, I really like!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product good value for money.</li>
    <li> I was bougth three hair straightener and twice of this are damage today and don&#x27;t be functionality, the true is I can&#x27;t recomend this product</li>
    <li> Excellent product, as we say in the posting, good stuff. I&#x27;m very pleased that I give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Wife and she loves it. excellent product and works to her needs. would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and works very well. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this six months now. As far as a straightening iron goes, this does the job just fine. My one complaint (and I see several others here mention it as well) is that I&#x27;ll turn it on, the light will blink as it&#x27;s heating up, and then it just turns off. I usually turn on my iron while I&#x27;m blowdrying so it can heat up and be ready by the time I&#x27;m done drying, and it&#x27;s really annoying to pick up the iron and try to use it only to discover it turned itself off and is no longer hot. Strange thing is, if I just turn it back on, then it stays on. I looked up the manual online to see if I was just missing some kind of safety feature or needed to push a button or whatever once I turn it on, but it says nothing about that, so there must be something wrong with it. I can still use it and will continue to; just have to turn it on once, wait for it to shut off, and then turn it back on. Totally annoying and clearly a flaw, but I&#x27;ll use it until it totally quits working. Most small appliances are  disposable junk these days anyway, so if I get a year of nice smooth styling out of a cheap thing like this, I consider myself lucky.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and works great</li>
    <li> Love love love. Easy use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really write too much about this product because my little sister took it. She asked to borrow it one day and now SHE uses on the daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like all the features, the temperature settings and the auto shut off (not that I ever forget to turn it off or unplug it) but it helps give me extra peace at mind.</li>
    <li> ok this product is great, particularly because it fires up in about 20 seconds, and it&#x27;s wide, so it straightens fast.  The only thing is, it tends to break my hair a bit.  But if your like me, you take quickness of hair breakage.  I set the thing high, so, I suggest setting it lower :)</li>
    <li> Not dual voltage as indicated on here...bit of false advertising amazon! Really, how hard is it to label this correctly? Not sure how the product itself works since I have to return it but just a word of warning, do not purchase this if you are expecting it to be dual voltage as indicated on the description.</li>
    <li> Works just like the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightner! I had to get the 1 3/4 in one Bc my hair is so thick but it is a very very good flat iron!</li>
    <li> very good product is just what I expected for the price we paid, satisfied with the purchase, and would recommend to buy!</li>
    <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair that always puffs up crazy no matter what (even on low temp and low humidity days) LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have expensive flat irons and my hair still puffs out, but this flat-iron had my hair completely straight and I flat-ironed on low heat.  I&#x27;m amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this flat-iron to any and everyone (especially my natural hair sisters).  You can&#x27;t beat the price and you&#x27;ll be very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Works great especially on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> i rank this product one star because this product was sold to me USED , and did not said used when i purchased it</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Heats quickly.  Works well for my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> For the cost, this is the flat iron you want.  I am amazed at how well it straightens my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used.... mind you i&#x27;ve bought and used many but none have ever worked this well! It does have a bit of a smell to it but it dissipated after few uses! :)</li>
    <li> Works better on long hair because of the thickness of the iron, has less satic than other flat irons and makes it smooth.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my new flat iron but as soon as I tried it I hated it.... I could NOT handle the smell it was awful.. It gave me a headache so I had to give it away.... To bad</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a birthday gift for my daughter. Although it works the way she wants it to, the color wasn&#x27;t what we expected. It was pictured as being purple and there were no indications that I&#x27;d receive anything different. The actual color we received was white.</li>
    <li> I have tried many straighteners, and a lot of them were higher priced, but this straightener is affordable and does the job well! I had my hair done in 20 minutes, silky, smooth and straight. It glides through hair with ease. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it!! Excellent product</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly. My daughter is extremely happy with this product</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good straightener, but VERY HOT. burned me a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dual voltage hair straightener that was of good quality but wasn&#x27;t too expensive. I had a single voltage Remington hair straightener for years before purchasing this one so I knew it was a trusted brand. Overall, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using it a couple of times and so far it s good!&lt;br /&gt;I have very static hair and the anti-static component seems to work well.</li>
    <li> It heats u p really fast and the broad blade helps to straighten my thick hair faster. The swivel cord makes handling extremely easy- loved it!</li>
    <li> awesome product.. very pleased. good quality. exactly what was described. I am very happy with the product. No problems with it!</li>
    <li> This is a good straightener for the price! it came in good packaging and arrived quickly. It does give off a strong smell the first couple of times you use it though. It straightens well and keeps your hair straight for a good amount of time, overall, I&#x27;m please with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as an xmas gift, she seemed to really like the anti static feature, but then told me that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even turn on. After a few months, it&#x27;s shot.</li>
    <li> This product rocks! It straightens both my wavy hair and my sister ringlet curls hair. It is the perfect thickness and really works. I can&#x27;t say anything about it lasting, since I have only had it a few weeks, but so far, I am in love. Cheers to bad hair days no more!Buy it before they raise the price because this item is a STEAL!</li>
    <li> muy bueno  y tiene buen uso  muy útil  no tardo en llegar  y en perfectas condiciones  el color es bellizimo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used flat irons and curling irons before but never got good results. I would always have to wear my hair up in one ponytail or in a bun because it would get frizzy even with the recommended styling products. About a year and half ago I bought a 1/2&amp;#34; Remington flat iron to straighten the shorter hair at the nape of my neck and I was pleased. I wished that my larger flat iron would work as well. Then about a month ago I bought 1&amp;#34; Remington and I was impressed because I really got good results. A couple of weeks later I bought this model and wow! My hair is straight, smooth, soft and shiny. Great results! Great quality! Great price!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Heats up in only a couple of seconds! Good quality heating plates that wont fry your hair. Can use it as a straightner or if you want some loose flowing curls. Love this product and delivery  was excellent!! Fast and boxed well</li>
    <li> Love it! Best straightener I&#x27;ve had in quite a while. :)</li>
    <li> Worked very well but broke in 6 months. Not very happy with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Works great, heats up quickly and makes my hair nice and straight! I have thick hair, and it is the perfect width to help me get my hair straightened without it taking FOREVER. LOVE how fast it heats up!!!</li>
    <li> Love this straightner, I have long thick hair and since I&#x27;ve started using this it cut my straightning time in half compared to the last generic one I had from walmart.  It also heats up very quickly and I like the digital screen that displays the temperature.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this straightener as an early Christmas present and he was going to return it because I told him it wasn&#x27;t something I would buy because you can get it at walmart and I usually buy mine at beauty stores, I have really really thick wavy hair and not any straightener will do.  I then saw the price and thought no this will never work, well I was wrong it works better than my chloe tourmaline straightener my hair is so straight and smooth I&#x27;m mad that I&#x27;ve been using a different straightener for so many years.  It doesn&#x27;t catch your hair like some of the other reviews state, it glides through my thick hair just fine.  If you don&#x27;t have over $100 to spend on a chi you don&#x27;t have to just buy this one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of Conair hair products until ALL my Conair straighteners kept breaking (they would just stop heating up). So, I decided to make the switch to Remington and I am thrilled that I did! As soon as I received this straightener, I just felt the difference. It feels heavy (but not unreasonably so), and well made. I like that the temperature setting is digital and easy to read. I can&#x27;t wait to see how this holds up over time, but it seems that I won&#x27;t have the same concerns I had with Conair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally, this works great! I have thick, hard to straighten hair that puffs up with any humidity (even in the winter!) It usually takes me about 45 minutes to an hour to straighten my hair after I blow dry it but with this it only took about 35 minutes. I am so impressed!</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing, I have very, very, thick wavy hair and this heated up really fast and cut the time to straighten my hair in half. It leaves my hair silky and incredibly strait. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great iron, especially for the price. Although I have fine hair, I have had trouble finding a decent iron that works without breaking the bank but this one fits the bill. Heats to 410 degrees and has floating plates so I haven&#x27;t had problems with my hair getting caught in the plates. It has a lock to keep it closed as well. The only thing I wish it had was a loop in order to hang it on a hook. Great iron for the price!</li>
    <li> It stopped turning on at times within a few months of purchase.  There is a short in the on button.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not knowing what to expect but im HAPPY I made this purchase.I have medium length COARSE THICK HAIR. it worked PERFECT. It has 3 different levels of heating it has a beautiful blue background light where the temperature is set. Handle is long and it doesn&#x27;t burn while doing my hair. It so FAST EASY and WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its long cord is very convenient on vacations with hard to reach outlets. Compared to another straighter i had, this keeps my hair for 2 complete days straight with no touch up needed. Its CERAMIC which is THE BEST FOR HAIR it wouldn&#x27;t damage pull or destroy your hair. The only down fall is its a lil curve on the heating part and I had 3 family member purchase it with great results.</li>
    <li> I must say that this hair met my expectations is digital, easy to use, safe, and very good price thx</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter and she loves it!  Straightens her hair in just a few minutes beautifully. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> super good it works perfectly fine and my wife love it a lot, not really expensive but good and excellent for the money, it does the job excellently. what else</li>
    <li> Very good , has lasted me more than a year (: worth the money i payed .</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! Remington is a wonderful brand I recommend this to anyone who loves straight hair and wants a quality iron!</li>
    <li> Kind of yanks my hair out and isn&#x27;t anti static, but it does a great job at smoothing out my hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this when it actually worked, I have had it for a little over 3 months and it started not turning off, the only way to turn it off was unplug it then it started to not even turn on. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the results were amazing, just like coming from a salon and in no time at all.</li>
    <li> Did not work and was used.</li>
    <li> I think the issue is that this is the wrong iron for me.  This get super hot - coldest temp is 310 degrees.  So this is for people with really coarse or curly hair.  I have actually burned my hand on my hair while using it - so I don&#x27;t use it around my little kids.  So don&#x27;t get this if you have fine or thin hair - totally unnecessary</li>
    <li> This straightener is a great bargain! Keep in mind, this is a $30 product, so you really can&#x27;t expect it to work like a $100 product. My expensive straightener died, and I needed something in a pinch, so I grabbed this one based on the good reviews. I have been VERY pleased! To be honest, I&#x27;m in no hurry to buy a more expensive one because this one is working really well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you&#x27;re looking for the smoothness of an expensive straightener, you need to buy an expensive straightener. But if you&#x27;re looking for something to get the job done well for less than $30, this product is amazing! I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter I was wanting something that would last and work well for her long thick hair but did not cost an arm and a leg. I found it. This was a great deal and has worked very well so far!</li>
    <li> como hago para que la plancha quede encendida? luego de calentar se apaga sola</li>
    <li> Loved the product. No fizzy hair and static charging.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works very well. It is comfortable to use and has wider plates than a previous flat iron I owned, which helps with straightening more easily. This is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible but works amazingly, worth the price, i got the wider one so now i can&#x27;t curl my hair but far straightening its perfect !</li>
    <li> Its a good items and good seller</li>
    <li> Up until now I&#x27;ve had bad luck with hair straighteners. Two of them were by babyliss, which made me stay away from this company forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very untamed hair. I can brush it and five minutes later it&#x27;ll look like I didn&#x27;t brush it in the last week. It has lots of volume and little hairs sticking from all over my head, which gives me a very unkempt look. The only thing that ever worked for me was chemical straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern was that my hair won&#x27;t remain straight as it happened with previous straighteners. I never knew if this was dew to the structure of my hair or the straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried the Remington s5520 for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. It straightened my hair much faster when I thought. And at the temperature of 200 degrees it stayed straight for more then a day. The straightener didn&#x27;t pull, didn&#x27;t burn and didn&#x27;t do any of the nasty stuff I read about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its only downside is the heating time. It&#x27;s stated in the instruction that the straightener heats up in 15 seconds. It does heat up in 15 seconds, but it reaches its maximum temperature after more than 5\10 minutes. But it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
    <li> A very good gift for my girlfriend.  she loves it. and the price is not bad, very good quality!!!! A very good gift for my girlfriend.  she loves it.</li>
    <li> is exactly what I needed, I am satisfied with this item and it was exactly as described on the page. thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best flat irons i ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;If makes my hair really straight with just one touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly long hair so it grasp more hair than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I use to always let someone else do my hair but now I do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;After I flat iron may hair, it looks like I went to a beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheap straighteners in the past from drug stores and such, but I decided to look on amazon and try something new. I decided on this one because of the great reviews, and the price!. I love this straightener! It heats fast and leaves my hair silky straight. I love the digital aspect of it. It is also very stylish. **Just make sure you use leave in conditioner or some kind of hair protectant when using. I am very impressed with this product; it is a steal for the price!</li>
    <li> great item, the only thing is the smell that is no annoying but have the smell.the rest is great, heat up fast and other things we are looking for.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, but smells of burnt plastic when it&#x27;s turned on. Also, doesn&#x27;t clamp down on hair that well. Hotter than other straighteners so wear a glove if you&#x27;re using it to curl hair.</li>
    <li> I totally love it. its easy to use and fast. I use it after a dry my hair and it makes it looks natural silky and soft.</li>
    <li> This one gets super hot which is what gives you that super stick straight hair - which I love.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the outside of the plates that you would be touching get hot as well.  Not uncomfortably hot, but hot enough to notice.&lt;br /&gt;I love how straight my hair gets though!!  Beauty is pain people!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter that has very long thick hair and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Good evening I would like to know how I can get back to tracking purchases as I need for removal of the product with the couriers that carry the product. thank you very much</li>
    <li> Great quality straightener for the low price point. Tames even the craziest hair.</li>
    <li> Get really hot, but leaves a burned/ chemical smell whenever used on your hair. Whether on wet, damp and dry hair. wiped the flat iron several times, still has bad smell when used.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using and bought a different iron.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a pinch at a nearby store because I was traveling, needed a flat iron, and it got excellent reviews from everyone.  I love that it has an adjustable temperature.  Even though my hair is fairly coarse, I was surprised to find that 350 was just right for my hair, and that 370 was too much.  (Seems to go up in 20 degree increments.)  So it definitely gets hot enough - I don&#x27;t think Remington is skimping on the temperature.  Specs say it goes up to 410 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really dislike....is that the plates don&#x27;t quite meet.  You have to squeeze down quite a bit on the handles in order to get them to actually flatten your hair, which can be hard on one&#x27;s wrist.  If you&#x27;re grabbing huge hunks of hair and raking it through repeatedly, that might be okay, even though it&#x27;s likely that the heat won&#x27;t penetrate completely through, and you&#x27;re risking damaging the layers of hair on the outside while not quite getting the inside.  But if you&#x27;re like me, and want to grab smaller clumps of hair in order to get it right with as few passes as possible and thus minimize damage, you&#x27;re going to have to press the plates together pretty hard to get them to actually flatten your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I had pretty hair that weekend.  :)  If you&#x27;re on a budget and you have healthy wrists (I have a history of carpal tunnel), it&#x27;s probably workable.  I recommend getting a thermal spray or something similar, since in order to get it flat enough, you are probably subjecting your hair to more heat than you would with a higher end flat iron.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as damage-prone as some inexpensive flat/curling irons I&#x27;ve used in the past, but mostly due to the way the plates are, it&#x27;s still no ghd or Chi.  (I guess what I&#x27;m missing are the \\&quot;floating plates\\&quot;, which causes them to meet even when they&#x27;re not grabbing much hair.)</li>
    <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat, and this straightener works great! No complaints here :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, pretty heats, the only thing I dislike is that heavy. others at this well, especially in the price and Venezuela are super-expensive.</li>
    <li> Is soo cute and the best iron ever.&lt;br /&gt;muuy Buena compra</li>
    <li> Product was a Christmas gift and seems to be working just fine.  I would order this type of product again.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to tame my hair. By the time I finished doing my hair, I had to re-straighten it again. I also use hair straighteners to curl my hair, and this one never got hot enough to hold a curl for more than a few minutes. Now I am testing the [[ASIN:B0009PVV4A Conair CS31TP Infiniti Instant Heat Pure Ceramic 1 Inch Tourmaline Ceramic Flat Iron]] which at least gets hot enough to do its job.</li>
    <li> Works great, looks exactly as pictured. Love it.</li>
    <li> Forget straightening my hair, I bought as an experiment to use on my clothes. I have several shirts that are supposed to be no-iron, but after a while, they still need it. I hate to use an ironing board and iron and taking the shirts to the cleaners doesn&#x27;t work very well either because the shirts are fitted and the ironing presses at the dry cleaners usually puts more wrinkles in that it takes out. I also have several pairs of pants that could use some sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this hair straightener do a great job of putting sharp creases back into my cotton clothes, I can also reach the tailored seams to take the pucker out of them. It works better than a hand held steamer and is more portable, so it will be great for travel as well. I threw out my ironing board and have no intention of going back to a regular iron.</li>
    <li> Best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used. So happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Got it and never worked...sent it back.</li>
    <li> As someone whose never used a hair straightener before I can say it does the job although I have trouble managing it at times. It can leave an unintentional crimp at the bottom that is hard to get rid of. Next time I would probably get one not as wide.</li>
    <li> Brought it for my mom who have rough wavy frizzy hair. She straighten her hair in 3/4 of the time she use to. She also claims that her hair is much smoother. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. It&#x27;s the perfect size and does a great job straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for close to 4 years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it about 4-5 times a week on shoulder length wavy hair. If this ever breaks/when it finally dies, I&#x27;ll definitely replace it with the exact same model (as long as they still make it).</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever used in my 8 years of straightening my hair pretty consistently.  I have rather thick, awkwardly wavy hair that gets rather frizzy if I don&#x27;t straighten it.  I found most straighteners would tame my hair well if I really worked on it for ahwhile (15-20 min).  I got this straightener yesterday and used it for the first time this morning and am so pleased.  It took me about 5 minutes to straighten my whole head (just a little above the shoulder and like I said very thick).  It was paper straight. and has stayed that way (it is about 5.5 hours since I straightened it).  It does get rather hot, so if you are sensitive to dealing with the iron getting hot, maybe think twice, but you are done so quick.  And I dont feel like I fried my hair.  A must have for the price!</li>
    <li> not the product you purchase, very very very bad, very very very very bad, very very bad I want my money</li>
    <li> Amazing!I SIMPLY love it! I bought this hair straighter for my mom because it was her birthday and I was a bit iffy about it... And well let&#x27;s just say I gave it a shot. And well she has very THICK hair! She LOVES it! I usually straighten her hair and yes I am GUY and NO I am Not GAY! LOL... I bought at Target for $23.00 on Amazon a tad bit cheaper... however same product except our product color is violet. Bottom line... YES buy it! WORTH the PRICE cheap price, great quality, and makes your hair silky smooth! :)</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best flat irons ever!! I just purchased them and they work like a charm. Best money I have ever spent. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Works better than my $99 her styler flat irons</li>
    <li> cut my styling time in half and heat up time was 1/4 of the wet/dry straightener... im really going to love this one - (my third straightener - all have been Remingtons - the first one i bought 6 years ago was the wet to dry with 1 &amp; 3/4 plate - and i LOVED it - but my dog ate the cord.. ugg...  (hubby repaired it - i dont recommend doing this - but it lasted for 2 more years after that happened) i purchased another with 1 1/2 inch plate - didnt like as well as the first one - and my new pup ate the cord a year later...  borrowed my daughters PYT which is a P.O.S..(dont waste your money on these! in the mall) ...  just got this one (S5520) yesterday - i have long hair and it took me literally 5 minutes to straighten for just running around the house style.  i love my Remingtons! thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this iron. I can get my hair straight a lot faster now. Works great on my thick hair. Heats up fairly quickly and especially love how it locks closed.</li>
    <li> I love this fast to heat wide flat iron and it is also attractive with the purple color.mmmm mmmmm mm</li>
    <li> Works well. Good value for money.</li>
    <li> I needed an extra straightener to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place, since I already have a different remington (which I love), I decided to give this a shot. I did not like this straightener at all, There is a gap between the two plates which barely touches my hair while &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34;. My hair was basically the same after I was done using this item, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener to replace one I loved and I had it for 10 years or so, I didn&#x27;t think I could find another one just as good.  This straightener does just as well as my old one, if not better.  It&#x27;s lighter than what I&#x27;m used to, and it can get very hot.  I don&#x27;t even have it on the highest setting and it still gets my hair so hot that I can&#x27;t touch it for a few seconds after straightening that section of hair.  I have thick hair, and this has not problem straightening it.  It also gets my hair shiny, which I like.  The buttons are in a good place and I can&#x27;t bump them easily (which was a problem on a different straightener I tried).  To turn it off you have to hold in the power button for a few seconds, which is another good feature.  It heats up fast, and is easy to use.  The one slightly negative is that the outside (where the blue part is in the picture) gets pretty warm, and it&#x27;s too hot to touch.  Other than that I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Am a first time user of a straightener and its very easy to use by yourself. Neat work done. I would ve given 5 stars if there&#x27;s no gap between the ceramic plates (at the inner edge) when I press for straightening.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  No problems with it and my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and leaves my hair silky!</li>
    <li> Works really well especially for the price.</li>
    <li> i bought this a few months ago and the power button doesn&#x27;twork - i have tried every way to press it.  i dont have the original box or else i&#x27;d be taking it back -lesson learned!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a retail store to replace my old Remington and it is the WORST straightener I have ever owned.  The plates meet only at the very top and that is the only part of the straightener that actually straightens hair.  I&#x27;ll be posting a photo.  Also, it snags and pulls your hair out.  Lovely.  This piece of garbage is going back to the store.</li>
