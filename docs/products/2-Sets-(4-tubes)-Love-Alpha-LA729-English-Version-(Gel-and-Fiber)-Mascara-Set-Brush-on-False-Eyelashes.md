<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best and most believable thing I ever purchase</li>
    <li> This product cause me an eye infection. As soon  as I apply it, it make my eyes completely red. DON&#x27;T EVER BUY IT</li>
    <li> Came within the expected shipping time, but the instructions are not in English... Still I like this mascara a lot</li>
    <li> I wanted to try fiber mascara but I was about to pay $30 for the name brand version. It&#x27;s easy to apply but I&#x27;m not sure it does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference between regular mascara and this stuff. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I already have pretty long, dark lashes. The fibers do irritate my eyes a little bit. They seem to fall out and by the end of the day my eyes feel dry when I go to bed. Overall, not quite what I expected and after waiting over a month to get them, I think I&#x27;ll just stick to normal mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my lashes longer and the color is dark. I can use the mascara with or without the fiber. Only draw back is that every once in a while a loose fiber will get into my eyes, doesn&#x27;t hurt but its irritating. Did I say that I love this product? Try it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I expected more results.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Youngique for a fraction of the price. I ordered two sets of two, no problems with either. They were not dried out. I have had no irritation or problems. Easy to apply, stays on all day, nice black color. I would recommend watching YouTube tutorials before attempting application to learn the technique. I will definitely order again. Shipping does take a long time, but the savings are worth the wait.</li>
    <li> It works great but the fiber lashes ran out after just a couple uses.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to get this because a lot of the reviews said it was empty almost but I got mine way before I was suppose to and it was full! It took a little to get use to putting it on and not getting it all over but looks amazinnnnng</li>
    <li> This Product does the trick. I can make my lashes as long as I have time for and everyone loves my look of exceptionally long and full lashes but not false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offering this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much that I have already reordered it.  The only negative thing I can say is that because it comes from China the delivery is quite slow but well worth the wait and once you get it if you reorder you will have plenty arrive before you run out.  I find it as easy to apply as any regular mascara with much better and fuller and longer lash results without the clumping you get from some of the traditional mega mascaras.  Easy to remove but no black eyes or specks under the eyes during a full day of wearing.</li>
    <li> Save your money and don&#x27;t purchase this knockoff from EK. Completely different product than what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I like this product when I 1st put it on but....As I blink my eyes throughout the day the fibers fall off</li>
    <li> Awesome product, amazing price! Don&#x27;t buy the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> My dad has told me &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; my entire life. I&#x27;m 41 and I&#x27;m a slow learner. I thought this would be just like the Younique mascara that I get from a friend who sells it.  The tubes seemed to be dried out and it didn&#x27;t do even 10% of what Younique does for my lashes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Don&#x27;t bother buying the younique brand! This product works better then younique,  the younique seems to clump a lot. There is absolutely no clumping with this! It is amazing and half the cost of younique! I&#x27;ll never use any other mascara again. Also I wear contact lenses and had no problems with fibers getting in my eye or falling on my face.</li>
    <li> Great for the price and very good quality, flakes a tiny bit but your lashes still look great.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I have used the Younique mascara like this and I can tell no difference between the 2 except the price. Very good stuff!!</li>
    <li> No good this stuff seems old . Can&#x27;t get it to stay .it&#x27;s very flakey. Want buy again</li>
    <li> takes a while to get it on, flakes (fuz) falls in eye and you have to clean out our eyes. The product does work. it does make your lashes longer. It just takes layers and time.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product, especially since I have never used fiber lash products. But it definitely beats drugstore mascara, though it&#x27;s not the BEST THING I&#x27;VE EVER USED IN MY LIFE--you know? Still, I am impressed that it does extend my lashes and makes them appear thicker. I&#x27;d still like more volume and length, but perhaps I need to experiment more with application (???), OR I need to start making money like the Kardashians so I can get faux mink lashes glued on like every 6 weeks. Then again...I think I&#x27;ll stick with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO like that the price was a bargain! AND, I was very pleased that my purchase came with two sets. Holler! Perhaps this is the awakening of my inner sexy secretary, minus being a secretary. Anyways, this is a good product and definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re trying to get Hollywood lashes without the Hollywood price.</li>
    <li> Product flakes off-fibers dont stay on at all.  I had high hopes for this, but should have read other reviews better.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely slow shipping from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time or money trying this.</li>
    <li> This is way better than Younique 3D in my opinion. Lasts all day and washes off easily. very little flaking if any,just make sure you use the gel after last fiber application</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used Younique and I purchased Love Alpha due to the price and to see if it would also work.  Unfortunately there was no comparison.  I had to apply multiple times in order to get somewhat close to the look as one application of the other brand and then I kept feeling like stuff was in my eyes for the rest of the day. And yes I do know to apply gel than fiber than gel again to set.  I would have loved it to work because of the price.  I will say that it was very nice as far as how it is packaged.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your 12 bucks or whatever but the real deal. -younique. Besides the fiver gets all over your face and you can&#x27;t read the ingredients. Look up reviews on love alpha vs younique. Love alpha doesn&#x27;t even come close. I give it one star for the cheetah print doe.</li>
    <li> This product made my lashes look AMAZING. However, it also made my eyes burn any time they watered, and caused a noticeable amount of lashes to fall out that only occurred while using this product and immediately stopped upon discontinuation. Lastly, it has a strong chemical/glue scent. I already have very long, thick and curly lashes, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m letting mascara ruin that. Despite the compliments I received, I could in no way comfortably recommend this to anyone. Especially someone with few to begin with. Scary.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent as well as the price, will definitely buy it again from this company though it was from China and took a bit of time to get it.</li>
    <li> I think I just have to get used to putting this product on. It is a little difficult for me, but I am a beginner to this, so I&#x27;m giving it the benefit of the doubt. It&#x27;s really pretty when everything is all put together, it makes my lashes fabulous! No fallout which is nice, that was one of my main concerns. If you&#x27;re new to applying fiber lashes, this is a good product to start out with.</li>
    <li> Poor quality--appear to be old. Very little product in the wane.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, after the first application I noticed a huge difference and I didnt have to keep cleaning my makeup through the day, I would pay much more for this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible! I&#x27;ve used younigue before so I knew what I was doing. I was so disappointed! I wanted something cheaper than younigue but you obviously get what you pay for. The fibers got all over my face and in my eyes. Then not even 5 minutes of having it on my eyes got very irritated and red. I had to take it off. Sucks I&#x27;m stuck with 2 sets of this stupid cheap knockoff.</li>
    <li> Love Alpha fiber lashes,This product is exactly what it has claimed to be.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience with this item i tried it as soon as it came in my mail and it dose extend the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Makes lashes look fuller longer more noticeable,when i put it on i said to my self wow i have lashes i can see now.&lt;br /&gt;I just do not recommend over doing it yes ladies you can put to much on or maybe it was just i put to much on,but&lt;br /&gt;when i did it like the directions state it looked very good a lot better than sticking glue on your lash line risking eye damage.&lt;br /&gt;The packaged dose state that it is all natural fibers and not supposed to hurt your eyes so that is always a plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people as a alternative to false eye lashes.Although sometimes it dose have a bit of fall off but not enough to bother me.</li>
    <li> You can pay for Younique or you can buy this product at a less expensive price and it lasts the same amount of time as Younique.</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with this product. I have next to nothing eye lashes ( very thin and very short ) . With this product I actually have long lashes. I never did like the way fake lashes look so i just used mascara . I did coat them with my own mascara after they dried, just cuz I read the reviews and most said they used their mascara to prevent flaking. Great product , came a week early . Very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as youniques in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Complicated. The fiber loves to get into my eyes while i&#x27;m trying to put it on… And throughout the day. Personally I would rather stick with false eyelashes.</li>
    <li> great 3D mascara and much more affordable than the competition. The fiber tube runs out long before the mascara, but it makes lashes look longer and thicker</li>
    <li> Just love the results for the price  !!..</li>
    <li> Really disappointed looked great when first applied, but all day long the fibers fell in my eyes and under my eyes which made me look like I had dark circles under my eyes. If anyone has a solution for this I would love it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! It was very dried up and flaked everywhere, not to mention it got in my eyes and my daughter&#x27;s! We aren&#x27;t rookies, either. I usually don&#x27;t do reviews, but I had to warn other women. It&#x27;s probably best to buy the expensive stuff! I don&#x27;t care how much you get or how cute the containers are...sorry to say that you&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
    <li> Only if your not careful and get the flakes in your eye. You definitely need to watch You Tube on how to apply if you have never used this type product. I had no issues with my order and a very good price for the 2 sets. Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This really does work. It makes my eyelashes way bigger I only put on 2 coats. Its good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love Alpha fiber mascara is a great product.  Easy to apply and last all day.  Comes right off with a makeup wipe or a baby wipe.  Makes my lashes look fuller and longer.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but although no irritation?  If not &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; well, fibers could definitely be irritating.</li>
    <li> Came super fast! Love it!</li>
    <li> Update: The company partially responded to my request for English translation of my Chinese Box, but the most important information which I requested 3 times was an English translation of the ingredients.  They sent me application instructions. I wrote back, thank you but I want to know the ingredients........ no response, 2 weeks later.  I am not putting this near my eyes if they can&#x27;t tell me the ingredients.  There could be any number of known carcinogens in there.  Younique is expensive worth it in my opinion.  I ordered 2 sets, both are in the trash never used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First problem, it says &amp;#34;English Version&amp;#34;, took a long time to arrive and the box is covered with writing, some with exclamation points but all in Chinese.  I sent a request to seller for English translation of ingredients before I put it on my eyelashes since China is know for Lead in toys, jewelry etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd it was a set of 2 and when I opened one box, one of the 2 tubes appears to be melted and bent, by chemical or heat.... I don&#x27;t know because the exterior is bent and the surface of the tube is also bubbled up, like if you poured a chemical on the outside, AND it was also open : O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this will probably go in the trash.  I saw someone compared it to the 2 tube mascara set from Younique.  (sp)  the only comparison is the 2 tubes, but Younique is organic or all natural.  I have no idea what is in this so I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price. Not very much in the tubes</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing it&#x27;s the best dupe of younique mascara that I&#x27;ve found yet!(:</li>
    <li> Great for the price I love them</li>
    <li> Flakey fiber. Dry and rolled up into balls you have to pull apart. Was not user friendly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It gave really good results. It makes my lashes very long and it&#x27;s non clumping. The lashes don&#x27;t feel stiff either. For extra volume I like to put a normal mascara on first and then follow with the gel/fiber process.</li>
    <li> It does give you beautiful feathery long lashes, but after awhile all of the fibers flake off and kept getting in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just use the gel, not the fiber.</li>
    <li> My sister had younique and loves it.  After reading the reviews I thought I would give this product a try because it is a much cheaper price.  It does make my lashes longer but the fibers seem to not want to stay on the wand or my lashes.  Every time I apply a tiny fiber falls into my eye irritating my eyes the rest of the day.  I have tried closing my eyes or even wiping off as much of the fibers as I can but they still fall in my eyes.  I do like the way it looks but not worth my eyes being irritated all day.</li>
    <li> This was horrible, not what I expected. It did absolutely nothing for my lashes. It flaked all in my eyes. Very disappointed in the product and I order the duo for my daughter and I and she hated it.</li>
    <li> LOVE it!! OMG it works magic! i NEVER heard of this product until a friend showed it to me. DEFINITELY worth the money. I have like NO eyelashes and it totally made mine look long and lush. GOTTA try this!!</li>
    <li> Shipping on time. Great product!</li>
    <li> the case in the photo isnt included.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! I have tried this and Younique fiber mascara. This one, you get 4 tubes (which is double what you get with younique) at a third of the price! Will be buying again. Easy to wash off and I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Product came on time. Package and content were as promised. Product, however, did not exactly deliver the results that I&#x27;d hoped for. It lengthened my lashes a little bit, but the fibers were choppy and kept getting in my eye. It also felt like I needed a lash comb to brush out the fibers that looked scattered. Overall, the product was okay but I&#x27;m probably going to look into a better quality product.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a good product. Goopy, thick, nasty, stuck together, looking eyelashes, is about the best it will do.  I made two tries and got the same results.  If you like spider legs for eyelashes, this will do it. Horrible. and left my eyes itchy and red for days after I used it. I will stick with my Loreal, it does a much better job.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t make much difference compared to regular mascara, plus it irritates my eyes when it flakes off (which it does, all day long). disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> These are awesome mascaras/gels and fibers... They work just as well as other brands for less money!</li>
    <li> Great bang for the buck!  Recommend watching youtube video&#x27;s on application.  Takes a few times before you master it... but not hard, really.  Just take your time - apply the fibers right after you put the gel on or it won&#x27;t stick (oh, reading the directions helps a lot).</li>
    <li> Works okay at best. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Unique brand. Worth the extra money to get a better product.</li>
    <li> Directions come only in Chinese--not helpful.  Also, every blink of the eye is like someone is blowing a gentle puff of baby powder in your eye.  The fibers fall in my eyes all day long.  One thing that helped was to put regular mascara on over the top of everything to seal it in a little better.  I can&#x27;t wear this stuff.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. I&#x27;m on my second order of it. I&#x27;ll never get a different brand of mascara. When you apply it fibers can fall onto your face... just brush them off with a power brush after you&#x27;ve applied the 3 layers.</li>
    <li> Love this. Gives you movie star lashes effortlessly...I will order over and over.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but I bought this and only got one set I thought it was 2 idk what happen :( very upset about this :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my Younique mascara was running low and I couldn&#x27;t bare the thought of spending $30 for another set of Younique mascara that needs replacing after 3 months (give or take, depending how often you use mascara). I received these 2 sets of Love Alpha mascara and can say it truly does the work to lengthen lashes BUT it does not make the lashes fuller like the Younique mascara. Hence why I rated 4 stars instead of 5. Really it deserves 4.5 stars. Love Alpha mascara is still a wonderful mascara especially for its price!! I recommend Love Alpha for beautiful lashes and budget conscience ladies.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product on EBay before and was extremely happy with the results, so when I found it here on Amazon with 2 Sets, I jumped at the chance to get it.  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in the results.  When I got them, they were sealed and fine, but they were DRY.  They have obviously been setting around awhile.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this again, from here and I recommend anyone who wants to try this, to find it on ebay!</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a try hoping that it would be like younique. No its not. I am glad that it was cheap. The fibers are really big and fall to your face all day. No matter how much gel you put on. I love the packaging but that is it.</li>
    <li> love this  really works great price</li>
    <li> works great. extends lashes beautifully</li>
    <li> Shipping great, easy to order. I just did not like the product. It was very thin and nothing like the other fiber lashes. With this I could barley tell I had mascara on much less an increase in length or thickness.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a last year. It took awhe to come here. But overall I love the product because it does make my lashes look fuller and longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product however, after a few hours it bothers my eyes and makes them itchy. I do have very sensitive eyes though. Especially during the winter. I would buy again of summer months.</li>
    <li> Very timely delivery and great product.</li>
    <li> Got the first tubes a while ago and loved it so I ordered more when it ran out. The second tubes were nothing like the first set. The mascara portion worked but when it came to applying the fibers, I could not get any out. Nothing would stay on the wand when pulling it out of the tube. I really liked this product and did the 2 for 1 deal. Never again. Just buy the more expensive and reliable younique 3D lashes from now on.</li>
    <li> The first two times I used this mascara after it arrived I was impressed, but on the third day when I was applying it and  went to put on the fibers the wand seemed bare, and when I stuck the wand back into the tube to try and grasp more fibers it kept coming out with nothing. Frustrated and bummed. Thought I was getting a good bang for my buck.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product. Your better off buying the real brand. It took over a month for me to receive. The gel works great but for the fiber lashes theirs  Literally hardly any fibers .... You are able to she the brush with the fibers mind you if you use the original brand theirs so many fibers you aren&#x27;t able to see the brush for weeks!! U get what you paid for.....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara!!! It is the best and very economic!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping. Very pleased with product. Instructions not in English but Google how to properly use it!</li>
    <li> This stuff made my eye lashes really heavy.  :(</li>
    <li> I was super excited to receive these because I&#x27;m allergic to regular mascara, however, the fibers never stuck. I had little &amp;#34;feathers&amp;#34; everywhere and in my eyes! The cost was great, fast shipping, and the mascara came off easily.</li>
    <li> Only the product name is in English. The remainder of the package insert- the directions, ingredients, etc.- is written in Chinese. This might be a fine product but I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to use it. If I can&#x27;t find an instructional video online I&#x27;ll probably just return it. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it is supposed to, give you the false eyelash look. Down side is the fibers get into your eyes if you are not careful and go all over your face so you have to use a face brush to get them off. It also made my eyes itch terribly, I typically do not have sensitive eyes or any issues with products but whatever was in this made my eyes itch like crazy.</li>
    <li> Does the job somewhat but the fiber can bother and irritate the eye.</li>
    <li> They should call this Alpha Loves Lashes &lt;br /&gt;Love this product. I have nonexistent eye lashes and wanted something more suitable for everyday office wear and leave my falsies to events or date nights.  Ordered January 11, 2015 and received February 3, 2015. Felt like it took a long long time so that is why this product was given 4 instead of 5 stars. Price is really good. Ease of use and (I suggest watching some videos on application as the instructions are not in English) I applied in this order My favorite Mascara, then Alpha Love gel, fiber, gel, fiber, gel. I did not experience any clumping or fibers falling off on my face.  Today is the full work day test to see if smearing, smudging or falling fibers happen.  This product does not take long to apply about two – three minutes. The products is also easy to remove makeup remover and regular face wash.  I am a happy buyer  and recommend this. I think I am going to order for my daughter as well and keep the extra tube for me _</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;ve found that other mascaras act better as the transplanting gel.  I had some issues with spider-looking lashes, as the transplanting gel dries faster than I can work.  I began using Maybelline Lash Stiletto as the transplanting gel along with the natural fibers, and I&#x27;ve been getting the effect I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I think that the transplanting gel makes a great &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look mascara that has nice hold (lashes don&#x27;t fall during the day) and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> Followed directions this product made an amazing difference &amp; the price is great too - especially when your daughter steals the 2nd set as soon as she saw my lashes</li>
    <li> For some reason when i used this mascara for the first time my eye lids started to feel itchy and my eyes felt a weird burning sensation, it works but make sure you don&#x27;t touch your eye lids as you apply it.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposSed to do. Only thing is the fibers seem to get in my eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I don&#x27;t know why people are spending so much on the other brand.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> bought these for my teen granddaughter, she loves it!!</li>
    <li> This product was well worth the price. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Order actually came about 2 weeks earlier than said!!  Love the product!</li>
    <li> No need to pay the big bucks, this works great!  I have found through trial and error there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve on using these types of lashes.  I put a very thin coat of a non-clumping mascara on first and let that dry completely.  First coat I get both tubes lined up with the caps undone and in the same hand, with the gel I focus on the base to mid lashes, and then lightly coat  with the fibers, let that set up, then re-coat with the gel going to the ends of the lashes, and light coat at the tips, sealing again with the gel, two coats is usually sufficient, why waste it?  Also for those who had issues with fibers coming off on the cheeks, that usually means they weren&#x27;t sealed or too much was used, better to do in light layers.</li>
    <li> I really love this product..will purchase again..</li>
    <li> More difficult to apply than I like.</li>
    <li> I always get complements! I love this stuff!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I love these. Easy to use and a huge difference with just 2 to 3 coats. There is some fiber fall out but I use my soft powder brush and lightly brush them off my face. They easily wipe away. After a couple months of daily uses I do notice the gel failing and coming off easier (first few uses I can apply them and they stay put for up to 4 days until I wash them off) but the fiber transfers to the gel brush and it gets messy. But for the price, amount you get out of these tubes, plus the black gel alone gives you noticeably bigger lashes, its worth buying. I&#x27;m hooked and love this so much I always buy the double pack. Just take your Time the first time. I haven&#x27;t had a bad experience. I Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Don&#x27;t watse your money buying the expinsive stuff that does the same job! This is worth your money!</li>
    <li> extremely happy with this!</li>
    <li> very easily can irritate your eyes besides that their ok just not what i thought</li>
    <li> Very combarible to Younique, and a fraction of the cost! I received this the same week as some Younique 3d mascara I ordered. They are very similar in ending results! The only cons/difference I noticed was the gel wasn&#x27;t quite as good on this one I ordered on amazon, and the fibers were a bit messier/took more practice. This is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I usually would do my eyes first, use a brush to dust away any excess fibers, then apply my foundation.  If I put  one of each brand on each eye you couldn&#x27;t tell the difference, and for that reason I would buy this product again. The value is worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this set for me and my sister to both try out (comes with two sets). We are super happy with the results. The mascara gives us big glamorous lashes without paying a ridiculous price. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for an everyday look but it definitely dresses up the eyes when you want to add a little oomph.  I would reccomend.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was going to help my lashes look longer however when I applied the mascara it damage my lashes. In removing the mascara some of my eyelashes fell off. It was a bad experience. DO NOT BUY the result is not what they advertise.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with fiber lash, I am still getting the hang of it so that&#x27;s why 4 stars, it does make a difference and I am happy with the purchase but I&#x27;m not convinced it does anything more than my normal mascara yet. If I put on a few extra coats of my regular mascara it turns out about the same. Maybe just because I don&#x27;t have perfect lashes anyway. The video tutorial I saw was with someone that already had awesome lashes so who knows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Younique and I like this better. Similar quality (only this stuff doesn&#x27;t flake into my eyes!) at a much better price!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the past and absolutely loved it. This time around I was very dissatisfied. The transplanting gel is fine. I have an issue with the fibers though. The tubes are skimpy and were empy after 2-3 uses. I feel a bit cheated!</li>
    <li> The lashes looked longer, but didn&#x27;t help them look fuller, like Younique 3D Fiberlashes do. But the amount of fibers all over my face ALL day long, no matter how many times I &#x27;swept&#x27; them off, and reapplied the transplanting gel, blow dried the lashes....were UNBEARABLE. They got in my eyes really bad too, repeatedly. Definitely worth it to pay more for the Younique, but I had to try the cheaper version for myself to see. ;) I will definitely not be using it again.</li>
    <li> Expired by 4 months, but works amazing!</li>
    <li> The fiber falls into my eyes and gives me irritated eyes all day.</li>
    <li> I had Younique before this, and decided to try. Not worth the price savings, ended up tossing and buying old mascara again. Waste of money. Quantity &amp;#60; quality.</li>
    <li> I have been using a much more expensive product and this works exactly the same and is so much cheaper!  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Came away earlier than expected cute casing 😍😍 now gonna try it out</li>
    <li> It not worth it nothing in it used it twice</li>
    <li> Love...Love...Love this product!  It is just as good as the higher priced verisons.</li>
    <li> Three stars only because I ordered 2 sets &amp; only received 1 set. Disappointed!! I have been using this product for 2 years &amp; love the mascara/fibers.</li>
    <li> I love this product- only thing is that I ran out of fibers pretty quickly, but I still have the other set. The mascara (gel) works great with my lashes- with out  or without the fibers. AMAZING deal with the two sets. It arrived WAY earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for fibers* if you notice you&#x27;re running out, put tube in warm water for 15 min and it will loosen fibers from the sides. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> love the the mascara , but it would have been nice if the instructions came in English.  I had look a youtube video tutorial.</li>
    <li> It definitely makes your lashes look more full but not sure if I think they look longer. I took a picture with regular Maybelline mascara and then a picture my first time using the natural fibers mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and will continue using it, but I need more practice so the fiber pieces don&#x27;t get in my eyes next time.</li>
    <li> hey, I am in love with this. does not gave me irritation, didn&#x27;t  fleck off, and it did last me all day long, no more huge fake eye lashes</li>
    <li> I just got my package. I was so excited to try it since I got tired of my regular clumpy mascaras. It made my short thin Asian lashes looked fuller and holy length! It is definitely worth a try. You won&#x27;t need to wear falsies again.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just don&#x27;t get fibers in your eye. Learned that the hard way. Good product. Use some of your own mascara to add a little darkness</li>
    <li> Has anyone&#x27;s came in damaged?</li>
    <li> The fibers seem to fall off of my lashes throughout the day ...</li>
    <li> Three out of 4 are dry.  Difficult to apply.  The product seems to be old.  Due ot the lack of fluid...the product doesnot stick - adhere to my lashes..I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok It was not supposed to be here until next week so that was a plus. It&#x27;s coming from China so does take a minute. I was so excited to try this, watched videos and I was ready to have a long beautiful luscious eyelashes. First off you pay a great Price and you get two sets of this product. So anyways get the product run into my bathroom and after hearing it takes a couple times to get used to this is my photo of my first time and with only two applications. I AM VERY PLEASED!! I have my regular mascara on one eye and this on the other. :) Since I just got it, if my opinion changes in next week or so I&#x27;ll update, if not, then I&#x27;m still happy and loving large with my luscious eyelashes!!  UPDATE: 3/7/2015 Ok so I&#x27;ve now used this for a few weeks and still love it! I think the easiest way to describe this product is; picture you want to tar and feather someone! Lol I know. Anyways you put the tar on first and then toss the feathers. If you don&#x27;t get tar on every part then the feathers won&#x27;t stick, right? Lol same concept here! The gel is the tar. Put it on and then apply your fibers which are the feathers. Now do it again! Keep layering to fill out! Wahlah! Hope this analogy helps! :) The first pic is only one layer. The other pic I did the one eye twice and reg mascara on other eye. I look tired because I had flu but was too excited to try it!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the younique!</li>
    <li> I wish they included instructions in English. It might make things a little easier.</li>
    <li> Takes patience to apply, careful not to get fibers in the eye, results as expected</li>
    <li> Didnt come out as I expected it to. Also i thought the case would come with it but instead came with an extra set of fibers and gel.</li>
    <li> Crappy product, even if it is cheap. I sent this back. I have great lashes, but wanted to find something to add tons of volume and length too so they would look like falsies. This product isn&#x27;t it. The people who like it must have zero lashes to think it does anything beyond making a smeary mess.</li>
    <li> I ordered my set on May 18 it said it wouldn&#x27;t be here until June 11th but came today on June 1st! This product is amazing I love it and it&#x27;s just like the expensive ones you can buy for 40 dollars but it&#x27;s an inexpensive product that is just amazing!!! Lol did I say it was amazing, if your second guessing this product I wouldn&#x27;t it&#x27;s only 6 dollars and you get two,normal drug store mascara is 6 dollars for one. Buy This Product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had in a while and it&#x27;s cheap. It takes a while to ship but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you what a difference this set had made in my eyelashes. My fiance has told me that he noticed my lashes were so much longer than before. I noticed how much thicker they looked. I love this and will DEFINITELY continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great BUT my footless of fibers did not last long at all. I have plenty of the gel left with no fibers. :(</li>
    <li> Ive used better but not bad for the price</li>
    <li> You have to practice to put this on because the fibers gets everywhere! I got a bunch of it in my eye the first time I tried it. I looked like an idiot blinking a bunch of times But really awesome.</li>
    <li> Works just as great as younique brand!</li>
    <li> Adds great lengths but the fibers fall out and get in your eyes..very irritating. but it&#x27;s worth trying for yourself....  to eachs own!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well this product works. My eyelashes aren&#x27;t the longest, and a lot of the time when I curl them after some time they just go flat.. .at first it was a little hard getting use to using the gel and the fibers (I&#x27;d take the fibers off when applying more gel) but after a couple times I&#x27;d like to think I perfected the process. Only thing I dislike it that its too light colored but all you need to do it apply a layer of regular mascar to darken the lashes up. Plus the price for what you get is pretty freakin&#x27; great!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to get the fibers to&lt;br /&gt;Stick like I want them too. But I&#x27;ve been using the gel by itself and I really like that. It doesn&#x27;t clump at all like regular mascaras do. So even tho I don&#x27;t use the fibers it was definitely worth the buy since I got 2 sets!!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. Both of the tubes of the fiber lashes is very dry and are hard to apply. Black colored specks fall on your face messing up the rest of your makeup. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is amazing idk why its so cheap.I saw a dramatic difference in my lashes.I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is great! Easy and really lengthens and thickens lashes. I actually use a coat of mascara under the gel to get a thicker base</li>
    <li> Very comparable to expensive one</li>
    <li> Just received product today and it came with no english instructions and everything is in Chinese...im very iffy about using.and all 4 tubes where NOT plastic sealed..?</li>
    <li> Does not work at all!! Horri</li>
    <li> I bought this item from another site but just want to pass on this stuff is as good as if not better than younque.  I have even left it on over several nights, (I take all the rest of my makeup off nightly) and when I wake up I might add  just a regular coat of my mascara over my lashes and my lashes look fantastic. I have had no fibers fall on face and I love the look,</li>
    <li> I  was very  disappointed with  this order. ..the advertisement stated buy one set get one set free..so I purchased  two sets which  means I should  have received 4 sets but thus  far I have only  received  one set and I paid  for 4...very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have Younique lash mascara- this works just as well &amp; a fraction of the price- THX!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the products. Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> 2 for 1 price.. these are great. I used to wear fake lashes until these. Two coats of the gel then apply the fibers and i am fabulous. The tubes are super cute as well. Shipping was about 2weeks .</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great look, doesn&#x27;t flake on my face/under the eyes.... would buy again but I&#x27;m lazy and will stick to regular stuff unless its a special occasion.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara now!! The natural fiber tube is a little light on product but you do get 2 tubes.</li>
    <li> They got here fast , but tbh I just don&#x27;t care for them ... Regret spending my money on this ...&lt;br /&gt;Stick in to false lashes</li>
    <li> This is seriously an amzing product! Once you really learn how to use the fibers you will completely fall in love with it. I&#x27;ve ordered this product 3 times already and have my friends and family hooked! I highly recommend it because you truly cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> The actual mascara is horrible, but the fibers are great! I use my own mascara and then add fibers.</li>
    <li> Love the gel..can not get use to the fiber. I use the gel and add other mascara still has the same affect. Wish I could purchase the gel ad a set.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work so well for me. Fibers dropped on my face through out the day.</li>
    <li> This product does not work!  Flakes horribly and burns my eyes.  By the time I left my house I looked like I had black eyes from the product flaking off and falling on my face.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> Do not order this! Thankfully amazon is a great com</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money !! The fiber parts fall out and get in your eye and gets all over your face</li>
    <li> Not as good as I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
    <li> Love it but one tube of fibers was almost empty hardly any fibers????  The 2 gels and other bottle of fibers is just fine. It works great but I&#x27;m disappointed because one set was a gift and the bottle didn&#x27;t have any fibers in it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My stylist at the spa thought I had on professional false eyelashes!!!</li>
    <li> JUST TRYING TO EXPERIMENT WITH MAKE UP BUT THIS DOES MAKE YOUR LASHES THICKER AND LIKE YOU HAVE SOME</li>
    <li> Cheap product. Seemed dried out and flaky. This product also really irritated my eyes. Went in the garbage soon after I got it.  :-(</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed for that extra pop in my eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> The fibers are okay but the gel is terrible. It smells awful and is very sticky. I absolutely hate it. I have thrown away the gel and am using the fibers between two coats of mascara instead. The fibers work pretty well to give my lashes a fuller look, and they don&#x27;t fall out and onto my face as long as I set them with a coat of mascara after application. Overall, the fibers: good, the gel: horrendous.</li>
    <li> just have to make sure that you apply top cost very good or you will end up with fibers in your eye</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised.  All instructions are in Asian. Nothing in English. Product flakes off and falls in eyes and on face. waste of money.</li>
    <li> The only Mascara I use!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Gives a good length to the lashes.  My only problem is that sometimes the fibers get in my eyes during application. Not as good a look as false lashes but still good.</li>
    <li> ordinarily use cover girl lashblast in orange tube, I&#x27;m not really seeing the difference between the length of my lashes. .the price is about the same though, so no big loss</li>
    <li> I Love The Transplanting Gel. Not So Much The Fiber Lashes. The Natural Fiber Lashes Are Irritating If They Get Into You Eye. It Actually Burns.</li>
    <li> Just received my product after 6 weeks. Tried it out and I got to say, my momma was right. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve tried younique and this stuff is no way in the world the same. Disappointed.....</li>
    <li> This mascara worked great......the first time i used it. When I applied it the next day it seems as if the mascara fairy went into my makeup in the middle of the night and robbed me. The fiber tube seemed completely empty. I shook, threw, smacked etc. To no avail. And the gel was pretty dried up despite the cap being securely closed. So if you&#x27;re ok with spending $8 for one day of great lashes...this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. First of you get a lot of mascara for the price. Normally my mascara I use its like 7 dollars at Walmart &amp; does now give me the same affect as this. My lashes are naturally long but straight. With this it lengthens my lashes plus gives the a great curl. I always get compliments on my lashes but with this its just overwhelming. I could make them longer with more applications but I don&#x27;t think I want them joining my eyebrows lol. I was considering false lashes because I just love the look but with this I don&#x27;t need it. Plus way cheaper then younique. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for gorgeous long, full &amp; curled lashes ! Update: I still love this product even more than before. I use it every single day &amp; it just give me so much confidence about myself</li>
    <li> God forbid one of the fibers get in your eye ; very uncomfortable :( ...</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t receive all my merchandize. Only received the fiber lashes.</li>
    <li> Goobs a bit and then I find the fibers on my face hours later.</li>
    <li> Love the product but it took 5 weeks and 2 days to get it!</li>
    <li> My wife love&#x27;s it ... was easy to apply. and she had me order her some more... happy wife happy husband</li>
    <li> It sats english verison but the mascara boxes are in chinese and the gel mascara theres was nothing in it the mascara itself looked pretty good tho very disappointed. .</li>
    <li> This is what i got, Flamingo brand??? ...not recommendable :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> i just love my mascara! it works very well</li>
    <li> Because of the ingredients in this mascara I ended up with a sty on my eye .</li>
    <li> Lovelovelove-and even more love after all that love! The price was FREAKIN AMAZING and I was so excited that I even paid for expedited shipping. I had the expensive fiber lash stuff, and I thought it was great, but a friend told me about this and OMG! For that price, it&#x27;s silly not to try it! If you love glamorous lashes and have a budget, these are PERFECT!</li>
    <li> No instructions... And made my eye red for days!</li>
    <li> Died out pretty fast! But fiber lashes are great to mix in with other mascaras</li>
    <li> hands down the best ladies and must buy go get it works wonders :-) :-* love love love it</li>
    <li> you get lush lashes by just applying i have spent hundreds of dollars on eyelash extensions and this is better because you can build your lashes to as full and thick as you want and it washes off at the end of the day! the only downfall is sometimes the fibers will fall into your eye and irritate but i usually apply a second coat of the gel after i apply the fibers to help with that problem.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be an ok replacement for a younique purchase. No way! There are literally fibers all over my face every time I try to wear this mascara. Looks like little black felt pieces are all over my cheeks! Terrible purchase.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome!!! It makes a HUGE difference, my husband thinks I&#x27;m wearing falsies all the time. It is affordable and works great! I completely recommend it, I&#x27;m in love with it</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Fibers&amp;#34; tube does not have near enough fibers! It will only last 4-5 uses before there&#x27;s no more!! Fibers fall off into my eyes all day long!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,1st time buyer,but the results are amazing, will definitely be  making  another  purchase</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two months now, and while it will give you spectacular, long lashes, it does have one big drawback. The fibers flake off a little bit every time you bat your eyes. I have tried putting another coat of gel on top of the fibers to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; them and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help enough to prevent flaking. The look is great, but I need for them to stick.</li>
    <li> I L O V E this mascara it&#x27;s really good and last long I will be buying more it makes my lashes appear thicker and fuller I would recommend it</li>
    <li> bought 3, only received 2 1/2</li>
    <li> Awsome absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works wonders, even the &#x27;transplant gel&#x27; works as the Best Easiest to use mascara I have ever used:) 100% satisfaction here. Only wish that it had more fibers in the tube. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and it seems low already. May not be though!!</li>
    <li> I really like this!  Easy to remove. I will  continue to recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> I hated this! It is very difficult to get the desired look with out using an additional mascara, a lash comb, and an eyelash curler. Not to mention that it irritated my eyes. It also had a not pleasing smell.</li>
    <li> I normally use Too Faced Better Than False Lashes, and decided to take a risk and buy this. I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID. The fibers are black and look more real. The product works wonderful. Plus, I pay $35 at Sephora for TFBTFL, and even with expedited delivery, this product is cheaper and you get two of each. I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about this, stating it was sticky and took a long time to dry... But it&#x27;s like that with any fiber lash product. Just bear with it and let it dry. It&#x27;s worth it. As for the fibers irritating the eyes? Haven&#x27;t had it happen once. Definitely going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Unlike some other reviews I received English version as described and I posted pictures of the directions in English in case anyone would like them or if you purchase this and do not receive directions in English :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. Works well, does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;2. Directions I received were in English.&lt;br /&gt;3. Fabulous price for 1 mascara, but for 2 sets, it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.  Seller I purchased from sent tubes that expired in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;2.  One gel brush was bent and somewhat deformed, the other was just somewhat deformed - see pics&lt;br /&gt;3.  I can&#x27;t tell what year this was made or if it has already expired by the time I received it - see pic&lt;br /&gt;4.  Doesn&#x27;t contain ingredient list. I thought that was required for all cosmetics..?&lt;br /&gt;5.  I could not find anything on Yahoo or Google with regard to &amp;#34;Hygiene licenses&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;GD-FDA&amp;#34;, or production licenses or the &amp;#34;production license&amp;#34; number written on the packaging; so it&#x27;s difficult to know how clean this product is, how safe it is or if it&#x27;s quality is regulated/monitored in any way... :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long these tubes last will gauge if I purchase this again, but honestly for the price, so far it seems like it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;_______________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: SDDmall&lt;br /&gt;Price: $5.97 (fully refunded because product was long expired)&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: SDDmall&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 16 days after order date.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Mascara sets individually enclosed in plastic baggies, both sets shipped in bubblewrap-lined envelope.</li>
    <li> Takes practice though</li>
    <li> Yuck. Fibers don&#x27;t stick , get in your eyes. Disgusting . you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The fibers dry in the tube very quickly so unless you&#x27;re going to use it within a month or so, skip.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I need to get more!!</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t what i was excepting it hardly had any fiber in the tube really hard to get it out, but once you had enough it worked. i honestly don&#x27;t see myself ordering it again. on a good note i did receive it when i was told it would get here.</li>
    <li> Love it. Been using it for months. You don&#x27;t get the case though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It did take forever to arrive but that was okay. When I got it I tried it immediately. It was extremely easy to apply and did a fantastic job of lengthening without clumping. Anyone that states otherwise probably just doesn&#x27;t apply mascara much or is using too much. I love that I get 2 sets too so I have time before I order again.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> works pretty good...not as good as i though</li>
    <li> Maybe I got some old mascara that had been sitting in the warehouse because when I opened it the mascara was dried out.</li>
    <li> These lashes are fun!  Definitely something to practice doing but overall not too difficult. Good price and arrived in only 2.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product might just work but who knows when the instructioms are foreign? I found a similar product and used the instructions for this product. low quality leave little bits of lashes in your eyes n burns.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using fiber lashes and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed. I still have to get the hang of applying it but I do love em 😊 I will definitely be buying again</li>
    <li> I am a believer.  I thought about spending the $30 for the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name Younique version but thought for the price and getting two sets I would try this first.  It is incredible and I am not going to spend more for less for something that works well for me.  I am very pleased and hope they continue to keep this for a reasonable price as I will keep buying it.  The key to this is not to &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; either of the wands.  Pushing extra air in the tubes will shorten the life span.  I took a sharpie marker and wrote a 1 on the top cap of the mascara and a 2 on the other.  This way I can hold both in one hand while I use it and not waste product by delaying and trying to figure out which one is next, etc..</li>
    <li> Love this seller!!  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Great item for price.. comparable to more expensive brands</li>
    <li> It flakes off but I keep using it because my lashes look so good. Works just the same as the expensive ones</li>
    <li> Worth the money two sets for the price of one tube of your regular stuff. Doesn&#x27;t give a whole lot of length, but enough. Will be buying more! View pictures, 1st picture is with alpha love mascara on one eye with my original mascara one the other eye. 2nd photo is with both eyes done with alpha love mascara</li>
    <li> The fibers literally looked like a dry brush and when I went to put it on my eyelashes the hair like fibers clumped together and fell in my eye. Literally couldn&#x27;t get the fibers out of my eye for so long causing a bunch of irritation. Tried once and never again.</li>
    <li> Workes great thw first two times i used it. By the third or fourth time i went to use this the fiber tube was empty. Now im using just the transplanting gel and my own mascara, still works okay without the fibers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try the new fiber mascara. So I was so happy to get it for a GREAT deal! I LOVE LOVE it. Will most definitely order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d looked into fiber mascaras before purchasing this, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to shell out $29 for a tube of mascara. This has mixed reviews, but for the price I figured it would be okay even if it was junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have said, there are no English instructions, so if you&#x27;re not sure how to apply it, just watch some videos on YouTube. It&#x27;s easy enough. Most videos said to apply a layer of your own mascara. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I&#x27;ve always done it anyway, so I honestly can&#x27;t say what would happen if you don&#x27;t. Then gel, then fibers, and always end with a layer of gel, no matter how many layers you do. It seals in the fibers so they don&#x27;t flake. I forgot once, and though the flaking wasn&#x27;t horrible, it did happen. But it&#x27;s never happened otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with two sets, and lasts quite a long time. I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day, but maybe 4-5 times a week, and it&#x27;s lasted me about 2 months per set (4 months total). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the effects aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic as I&#x27;d hoped. Better than just regular mascara, definitely, but not quite as dramatic as false eyelashes. Most times you&#x27;ll have to wear more than one layer to achieve anything that looks like more than just regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m attaching a photo so you can see what I mean. First photo is no mascara, second is a single layer of the fibers, and third is 3 layers.</li>
    <li> It was horrible! I applied it but all the fibers fell on my face or worse of all in my eyes. Both my eyes were irritaded for days. Had to wash them out several times. Don&#x27;t buy. This product is cheap.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NOT WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS AGAIN!!! YES THE MASCARA IS LIQUID AS MASCARA IS BUT THE OTHER APPLICATION YOU PUT ON IS LIKE A Q-TIP COTTON MATERIAL!! NOTHING MOIST OR EVEN NEAR BEING ABLE TO BE APPLIED TO YOUR LASHES! LIKE HELLO WHY WAS I SOLD A Q-TIP/COTTON STICK FOR???? NOT WORTH THE BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for...cheap product, cheap results :(</li>
    <li> I wear contact lenses and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with any other mascara. After wearing this product my contacts burned and became red and irritated for days afterwards. This product is very messy and I was afraid I had received an open package after I had an eye infection immediately after using the product. Luckily this was not a bacteria infection, only irritation according to my optometrist, still scary!</li>
    <li> The mascara was so hard to apply really stringy and sticky wouldn&#x27;t even apply on my lashes. The fibers went in my eyes even after being really careful on taking off some of the fibers with the tube.  I really dislike this product i wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I really like the extension that it gives. Not quite false lash length but more then regular mascara. With rain and sweat some of the fibers do fall off, however there was no streaking down the face, or raccoon eyes. And I still had the same look just had to dust the fibers off my face.</li>
    <li> def my favvvvooriiittteee</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used ! Definitely getting more!</li>
    <li> the fibers get everywhere including all over face and inside eyes. it was cheap in price and is also cheap in quality</li>
    <li> It works for me, however, once in a while a lil piece of fiber will fall out and it&#x27;s a lil a annoying because the are so small and you know it&#x27;s there somewhere around your eye ball, but you can&#x27;t really see it... besides that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I saw my friend wearing it. There&#x27;s a definite learning curve to applying this stuf, and more times than not, I get the fibers in my eyes, which irritate me for the rest of the day. I feel like I can get just as good a look with my normal mascara, Maybelline&#x27;s Collosal Volume Express. I&#x27;ve resigned to only wearing it on special occasions, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> If I could post this without giving any stars I would. I&#x27;m not giving any stars bc I&#x27;ve been waiting over two months to even get the product! I will not be ordering again!</li>
    <li> The product description says you get 2 sets (4 tubes). I only received 1 set (2 tubes) of the product, and emailed the seller about my second set. The mascara itself is of decent quality, but the fibers do have a little fall out. Its not amazing, but it&#x27;s not terrible. I&#x27;d definitely rather spend the $9 on this again, than spend $32 on the actual name brand of this product. The difference in price makes up for the little bit of fallout, that you can easily just periodically brush away.</li>
    <li> i seriously love love this mascara!!!!!!!! i reordered it as soon as i tried it!!!! please try it!!!! its a great price!!! i normally hate my lashes but now i love them</li>
    <li> This does make my lashes look longer, but the fibers kept falling off into my eyes for the first 30 min of wearing it. It almost caused me to wreck while driving. So be careful and make sure you put them at least an hour before driving!</li>
    <li> The mascara was dry didn&#x27;t even work very upset bc I had purchased these before and loved them but this time the bottle was dried out</li>
    <li> Love this just as good as Younique only difference is you need one or two coats more. For the low price and extra tube it&#x27;s worth the extra coats.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Just as good as Younique. Half the price for twice as much product! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> While it did kind of give me longer lashes, the fibers made me doubt it was even still good... &amp; a bunch of the fibers fell into my eyes as I tried to carefully apply the mascara &amp; they started to burn like hellfire</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used on my eyelashes and such a great price too! Totally worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I applied as directed. It adds length but not fullness. It did not come with an English pamphlet and tubes were not plastic sealed.</li>
    <li> As someone who is usually wearing false lashes, I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this. I&#x27;ve used the Younique product before and while I liked it, it was hard to get off, smeared all over the places, just a general pain in the butt. But this product isn&#x27;t costly, easy to put on, easy to remove, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;As usual, start with fresh, clean lashes and you&#x27;re all set. I do 2 coats of gel and fibers before I do 1 or 2 coats of mascara (I use a Rimmel ScandalEyes in Extreme Black) and they look fantastic. Enough so that I&#x27;ve had compliments on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy that this was a 2 pack as I now use this every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ll submit a photo when I upload them from my phone.)</li>
    <li> The gel tube is very hairy i applied it and some of its fur or whatever you wanna call it went in my eye, total mess. I only use the the first application not the second one since it doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> Works great. Love this!</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this item in order to receive free shipping on an item I needed.  I have purchased the Younique 3D fiber mascara in the past and loved the results so I took my chance, even with the bad reviews from other buyers.  I do not have a bad thing to say about this product.  It goes on exactly the same as the name brand and it does not flake off during the day like other users have mentioned.  I think they are having application difficulties.  If you have used the Younique product in the past which came with instructions, the same instructions apply to this product.  Some mentioned an odor, yes there is a slight odor to the liquid but nothing extreme at all.  I only noticed it because it was mentioned in other reviews.  I would say that this product exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t really give me the effect I was looking for like other 3D mascaras it went dry in a 2-3 months. I wouldn&#x27;t, buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just as good as others that have a way higher price tag. Shipping does take a bit but totally worth the wait</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Younique 3d fibers. I really liked it but it&#x27;s way to expensive. So I bought this in December. It works EVEN BETTER than Younique and lasts longer too! Here I am re-ordering it again. I&#x27;m not out yet, but I don&#x27;t want to be without it. Amazing product. Amazing price.</li>
    <li> Love this and the price</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!! I have never used Younique, but I am glad that I use Alpha Love. It works extremely well! You can see a big difference in the length and volume of my lashes and it looks completely natural. As a person with LOTS of allergies, I can honestly say that the product does not irritate my eyes in anyway. However I would use it sparingly if you are a beginner so that your eyes get used to wearing the product.</li>
    <li> It did not work. My lashes did not look any longer. The fibers got into my eyes and really irritated them. I would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> So I literally just got the product few minutes ago (I got it 16 days earlier than expected so that&#x27;s a plus 😊) and this product is amazing my eyelashes look so long I tried it in one eye only to see the difference from this 3d fiber lash and the regular mascara I use and the difference is huge I took a picture of it but my camera is not that good  (I hope you can see the difference). I put 3D Fiber Lash Mascara on the left and Scandal Eyes from RIMMEL on the right. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep on buying this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> It was horrible both tubed was dried up</li>
    <li> This is a poor product.  The mascara is so thin it doesn&#x27;t want to stay on your lashes.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderful full long lashes! Only lasted for at 7 applications! 😬</li>
    <li> Works so great! New fav!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic when it came to these from the other reviews but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with mine and I was extremely expressed with my results after just one coat. My instructions came in English as well and came before the ETA. Uploaded a comparison pic of one coat vs regular mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this! Cheap and comes with TWO! Works great and last forever!</li>
    <li> Five stars because the product really works and the price here is unbeatable for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;But this mascara is not for me--I was kinda totally creeped out by the hair in the tube concept. If you want a dramatic look, and you&#x27;re not disturbed by the feeling of applying tarantula-skin to your eyelashes, then this is definitely for you.</li>
    <li> It does make ur lashes look longer but by the end of the day u have black specks under your eyes.</li>
    <li> The instructions were not in english and the product is extremely messy. I ended up with more in my eyes than on my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing a review even before I&#x27;ve used the product, &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; I even use it at all. I ordered it and it arrived in May 2015. The package insert says&lt;br /&gt;JFLAI2008&lt;br /&gt;2014/12/25&lt;br /&gt;I assume that means it was produced in 2008, and it expired last year, months before I got it.</li>
    <li> Very similar to the &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34; brand. So for $7 for 2 sets I think it&#x27;s worth it instead of $30 for the younique.</li>
    <li> Love it I can&#x27;t believe the difference!!! So much fuller and beautiful!!! You can see the difference right eye is the love alpha  left eye is ulta false lash look mascara!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Price is so affordable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy&lt;br /&gt;WORKS&lt;br /&gt;You get two tubes of each product so four total&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird&lt;br /&gt;Can get in your eyes and it burns so you have to be super careful and slow when applying&lt;br /&gt;Gets little fibers on your face but if you take a make up brush you can just brush it off</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend 30 bucks when this is just the same</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only worn it a few times and have gotten so many compliments</li>
    <li> love the mascara but mine only came with two tubes?? and no English instructions</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these mascaras for about two years now and I&#x27;m so happy the price went down! I&#x27;ll admit if you don&#x27;t know how to apply these they can look a little lumpy and spider leggy but practice makes perfect! My lashes are ALWAYS on point with this mascara and I show it to everyone I know! They make my lashes look fuller and longer. The mascara comes off easily with water so you don&#x27;t have to worry about scrubbing your lashes for the product to come off. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product my eyelashes look lush and long. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I recommend you apply the gel first to the top lashes on one eye followed immediately by the fibers for the perfect look.  Then follow with the gel on the bottom lashes but don&#x27;t re-insert the fiber wand into it&#x27;s tube. You really have enough fibers left on the brush after applying it to your top lashes that you don&#x27;t need more.  This will prevent you from applying too much fiber.  The company delivered the product very quickly for being overseas. If you like eye make up then you will have no problem applying this product. I have a spoolie brush on hand in case I get too much fiber on my lashes I can brush them off.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love how my lashes look but the mascara doesnt seem to have a lot of product in it and so i have to dig in to grab more product to apply on my lashes, I still will buy more because my lashes are too small so I need them..ALSO apply fibers carefully. They burn really bad if it goes inside:(</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had and the cheapest!  My lashes look false but natural!</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara!! Now it does take a little patience when you first start using it because you want to apply the &amp;#34;transplant&amp;#34; which is really just like regular mascara application to me, but to quickly apply the fibers so that they adhere properly. Don&#x27;t be in a hurry, and don&#x27;t try to put too much at once, otherwise it will come out clumpy. Once you get the hang (after maybe two complete applications) you will be quite impressed and pleased, and it washes off very easily. I plan to always keep this on hand. Bye Maybelline and Loreal!!</li>
    <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
    <li> arrived promptly. Mechandise just as expected</li>
    <li> Two stars because this took almost a month to arrive... because it comes direct from China. Also note that because it comes direct from China it is not subject to the same FDA regulations as cosmetic products sold in the US. Had I known this before, I would not have purchased. The repeated dog food and baby formula recalls of Chinese made products over the last ten years are enough to make me cautious about putting this anywhere near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Easy to use and actually works better than more expensive brands!</li>
    <li> I have naturally long and curled eyelashes so most mascaras I use work great. This is my first time trying Fiber lashes and I have to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVE Alpha Love Fiber Mascara. They add triple the length and volume of any regular mascara. I recently considered trying false lashes, but after using this fiber mascara I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use falsies or go back to regular mascara. Usually you can find regular, &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; mascara from $7 - $12 so the price you&#x27;re pay for these two sets of fiber lashes -- you won&#x27;t find anywhere else. I highly recommend this product and will be reordering when I&#x27;m all out!</li>
    <li> This mascara is absolutely amazing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Unlike other reviewers, I had no issue with getting the fibers in my eyes. Easy to apply, stays on all day, and looks amazing. My lashes actually touched my eyebrows!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: Go to Youtube and watch some videos on how to apply fiber lash mascara. This helped me tremendously!</li>
    <li> Came quickly doesn&#x27;t work on my short lashes.</li>
    <li> Interesting concept. Transplant formula was dry texture. Had to use another mascara to make the fibers stick.</li>
    <li> First tube of fibers was almost empty..</li>
    <li> FOR THOSE WITH LONG LASHES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed and was incredibly disappointed. My normal, drug store mascara was better. However, I tried one of the tips that suggested I apply my normal mascara then this. That was a game changer!! My lashes look AMAZING. I apply about 2-3 coats AFTER my normal mascara and I seal it with one more coat of regular mascara.</li>
    <li> They work!! I love these. Your lashes won&#x27;t be as exaggerated as most of these say but they will definitely  be longer!</li>
    <li> This came after a very long waiting period, I assume because it&#x27;s from China? There were no instructions in English. Both boxes that these arrived and it looked exactly the same. The price is great compared to most of the United States products. I do however wonder, because it came from a foreign country, if ingredients might b this came after a very long waiting period, I assume because it&#x27;s from China? There were no instructions in English. Both boxes that these arrived and it looked exactly the same. The price is great compared to most of the United States products. I do however wonder, because it came from a foreign country be an issue. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It&#x27;s not as great as the more expensive versions, but it&#x27;s good enough for work!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, but the fiber falls into my eyes every time I apply.  Don&#x27;t see much of a difference than regular mascara either.</li>
    <li> This mascara was not what I expected. I have used younique&#x27;s 3d fiber previously and this was not even close in my opinion. I will not buy this again nor would I recommend it to anyone else. It flaked terribly and was very skimpy when it came to product. I tried everything to make it better. I will spend more money and get a better quality brand. Very disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes your eyelashes look. So long and pretty</li>
    <li> I order this to compare it to Younique. It is the same concept and goes on just as easy. The difference is it will flake off onto your face after a while.  I also didn&#x27;t realize I was ordering from abroud. The company is supposedly based in California but when I got product everything, including instructions were in an Asian language.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered it burns my eyes it won&#x27;t let me post a picture but it all on Chinese weighting</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve already got long eyelashes, but I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in length, no mater how many coats I did. It did make them appear fuller at least, but getting the little fibers in my eyes is annoying on the occasions it happens. It&#x27;s not bad, just not as great as I hoped. But hey, fOr the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Least liked eye lash fibers product I&#x27;ve purchased. Fiber are clumpy and don&#x27;t even apply correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now!!!!! I am completely obsessed and have all the girls at my work ordering it !! Way better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and it&#x27;s absolutely great. My lashes are instantly twice their length.  It&#x27;s the same/works as well as the $25 Younique product. If you hate false lashes like me, then you&#x27;ll love this. Like other  reviewers mentioned, you have to put on a base coat of regular mascara and seal with regular mascara after you&#x27;ve applied this product to prevent fallout.</li>
    <li> It only causes irritation if it the fibers get in your eye, other than that its a great product.</li>
    <li> Price is GREAT! The product is easy to use. It&#x27;s not as bold as other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, but this one fits the wallet better ;)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump or make my eyelashes look unnatural like I feared. It said t wouldn&#x27;t arrive until June, but it arrived in 2 days!</li>
    <li> This product was okay, however I expected more dramatic results.  I do have long eyelashes and was expecting this to work well.  the fiber part of the application is dry fibers, I think if they were in liquid it may work better.  This wasn&#x27;t expensive so I am not mad or anything, I just wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Just as great as the expensive ones.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly !!! Even better than the 30$ one from younique.</li>
    <li> I love it no more false eyelashes for me!!!</li>
    <li> YouTube tutorials recommend adding in you regular mascara before and after application of the gel and fibers, do it. I loved the results. Be careful when brushing bottom lashes because the fibers burn your eyes a bit.</li>
    <li> Better than Younique&#x27;s 3d mascara. Much cheaper! Buying more for presents!</li>
    <li> This really irritates my eyes. When I wear it I spend most of the day worried about getting it off my eyelashes. Kinda bummed about that. Not bad though. Just doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
    <li> Good mascara works as described</li>
    <li> The product as not for me. The fibers did not stay put.</li>
    <li> The fibers run out after about 2 or 3 times being used but other then that it does make ur lashes look fuller</li>
    <li> Love this, just as good as the brand name.</li>
    <li> I love this product first and foremost. It works great! There were several issues though...&lt;br /&gt;1. Shipping does take some time because the mascara is from China.&lt;br /&gt;2. I only received two tubes even though the description says four. I didn&#x27;t want to open the envelope it came in because you could tell there were only two. My husband told me to not be silly, that $8 for mascara was still a good deal and I waited almost three weeks for it to get here. So I opened it and used it without complaining to the company or amazon. I normally would have, but he told me not to.&lt;br /&gt;3. I wear makeup maybe 3 days a week and the fiber tube only lasted a month. I don&#x27;t use a heavy application because I only need one coat. While I love the product I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last long enough. Twelve applications doesn&#x27;t seem like enough when you have to wait that long for shipping and only receive half the order. Maybe its just me being picky...&lt;br /&gt;All in all I do like how sexy my eyes look and make me feel when I use this so I did order it again. But if I still only get 2 tubes, I will opt to spend more for the better known brands. I don&#x27;t like waiting so long to get something (especially when I pay for a prime membership on here) or feeling jipped by only getting half my promised stuff. I ordered it 2 weeks ago so we will see when this one gets here! Hoping very much there are four in the shipping envelope!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bum bottle of fibers, but when I pull my brush out of the tube, there&#x27;s really nothing there.  The transplanting gel is fine, and works like a basic mascara on its own.  I&#x27;m just disappointed in the fiber portion of the set.  You can&#x27;t really tell the difference between this multi-step process and two coats of my favorite lengthening mascara.  Not worth the wait on shipping from China, which took several weeks.</li>
    <li> I LOVR THIS PRODUCT.. I WILL FROM NOW ON ONLY USE THIS. IT MAKES MY LASHED SO LONG WITH 2 APPLICATIONS FOR DRAMA EYES. OR I APPLICATION FOR LONG SOFT LASHES...</li>
    <li> These do not work. I threw them in the trash. Will never buy again. When trying to apply fibers it got all over my face.</li>
    <li> After a few hours I have to check for little flakes, but not bad</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Will reorder!!</li>
    <li> So I got this legit two days ago but this is my regular masscara by Maybelline 💁🔥yall hype way to much but yet again I also have really long eyelashes anyway.. Can&#x27;t wait to see how this will look :o</li>
    <li> I absolutely love everything about this mascara! Its so easy to apply and I have not had any problems with it. It also got here in less than a week. It lengthens my eyelashes more than I expected and I love it! Super cheap and it also comes with two sets! I love it!</li>
    <li> I like it so far but my lashes don&#x27;t stay up they weigh down sometimes. It could just be how I&#x27;m applying it. In all good product</li>
    <li> This is a great value! I compared it to Younique&#x27;s 3D Lash Mascara and the Love Alpha is a great replacement.</li>
    <li> I threw it away after trying to use it 2-3 times.  The little fibers get all over your face and into your eyes.  Your eyelashes don&#x27;t look any different besides the fact that your eyes are red from the fibers scratching them all day.  I would spend the extra money and get the Unique kind, it works much better.  This stuff is crap.</li>
    <li> I ordered the set of two of the mascaras, one for my mother and one for myself. The shipping took about a week which was so great! I love this mascara so much and it works great! I would totally buy it again!</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it said it would do. And it was so easy to remove!!! I don&#x27;t wear much make up because by the end of the day, it &amp;#34;bleeds&amp;#34;!! This make up stays perfect even in the hottest weather while I was perspiring!! Love it and will definitely order again!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like wearing fake lashes without all the work. I love these and for the price amazing.</li>
    <li> itchy eyes can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> My tunes were bent up, 2 of them was broken open and dried out.  It looks like the tube is wrapped in foil with cheetah print on it. It was supposed to come with 2 sets,  2 gels and to mascaras. all I got was the gels. The brush is falling apart on all of them and the 2 that actually had anything inside of it was half way empty and clumpy.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price.  But after a few hours the fiber pieces fall into my eyes and are very irritating.  Now you can achieve big lashes with this but I&amp;#34;m not sure that the irritated eyes part is worth it.  Also the particles will fall down underneath the eye too.</li>
    <li> Mine came completely dried out. There ar won instructions. There&#x27;s no plastic seal.</li>
    <li> Fibers fall into the eyes cause&#x27;s irritation.. Overall I like it..</li>
    <li> I have only tried it three times, but it seems it may be flaking into my eyes throughout the day, as they feel very irritated.</li>
    <li> Takes time to apply but looks fabulous on. Does not flake off as other products do.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for super long lashes!</li>
    <li> Too flakey, unnatural</li>
    <li> First off, I only received 2 tubes when I was suppose to get and paid for 4 and second, it&#x27;s like there are no fibers in the smaller tube.  Also, directions are in another language (Chinese perhaps).  Thankfully, I have used another product like this and know how to use it. Very displeased with this product and will pay the extra money for the fiber lash mascarra I currently use.  Will not recommend my friends to use or try this.</li>
    <li> Oh mah Gawd!!! This stuff makes it look like I have eyelashes. I shaved all mine off, and now I can have them back again. Lashy Lashy lash lash!!</li>
    <li> I liked this at first, but it&#x27;s hard to put on, the fibers get in my eyes, and it flakes off.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!! It ships fast and is exactly what I was looking for !!!</li>
    <li> Bought some for my mom and myself. It takes some time to apply and learn how to use it,so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying it out the first time on the night of a big event. I wish it was available in brown for a more natural look for the pigment-bereft :)</li>
    <li> I have used younique mascara and this does not compare. I was trying to save money but this does not really do anything to make my lashes longer or fuller like I had hoped for. It is very stringy so it slings out on your face even when I gently use it. Not happy.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever!</li>
    <li> Dried out fast as hell</li>
    <li> Mascara works good! The fiber stuff was just weird.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! I was skeptical at first to buy it, since it&#x27;s such a low price. Honestly though, this is the best thing ever made.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just as good as the yo younique product but WAY cheaper.  And it doesn&#x27;t flake everywhere and get in your eyes</li>
    <li> This is great mascara. I used it every day until it ran out then I switched to Falsies by Maybeline...they are completely different and I  missed having the longer lashes that this one gives.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. HOWEVER, at the end of the work day it starts to flake, but that is after 8+ hours of wear.  Here&#x27;s the thing:  when it does start to flake it burns your eyes.  I cannot wear this product every day, which is what I was hoping for, but I do wear it on date night or for special occasions.  If this mascara did not burn my eyes it really would be fantastic product, an 8 hour wear time is really quite good. I was really hoping this would become a replacement for Younique, but I can&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Love this masscaria thank you</li>
    <li> Amazing product my lashes are like a million times longer! Amazing price!!!!!!! Buy it! Shipping was faster than expected too.</li>
    <li> not as effective as I had hoped.  messy, flakey, needs frequent application</li>
    <li> This really lengthened and volumized my lashes. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara and it does what it says it does. On top of that you cant beat the pRice! I will definitely re-purchase. This product is worth trying, and all the reviews were correct! Love Love Love this Mascara!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and the first time I loved it so I reordered. Well this time there was no micro fibers in each tube and one of the longer tubes was missing there brissel things, so I&#x27;m looking for a different brand next time</li>
    <li> Great Product . Got It Early and I&#x27;m Excited About That . It Actually Works Works Very Well When You Get Used To it</li>
    <li> it does not stay on like some other brand that I have came across and the fiber sheds</li>
    <li> Product works well just be sure not to get into eye.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be better its like putting cotton balls on your eye lashes  I would prefer to just use regular mascara</li>
    <li> Ok, so I originally fell in love with the Younique 3D fiber mascara. I got suckered into paying the $30 for 1 set (2 tubes) I absolutely loved it so much as I can not stand false lashes of any kind, but refused to pay the price again when I ran out. After some I did some research on Amazon (and thank god I did) I found these by Alpha with a great rating. It was love at first sight. 4 tubes, 11.99, and prime. Tried it as soon as it was delivered and hallelujah let the Angels sing! It&#x27;s the most amazing thing ever for a fraction of the cost of younique! The results are amazing, but you have to be pro-fiber mascara. If you are used to falsies this may not be the product for you regardless of brand. And for the people saying Younique is better well... Just shut up. Lol You probably sell it and don&#x27;t even realize the company is designed to make money off of you. It&#x27;s the same thing, a wholesale product from China that repackaged (probably private label manufacturing) with a different marketing platform. The formula itself when applied is identical to Younique, period. As for the cheaper feeling tubes and not getting a case... Well I don&#x27;t know anyone who actually uses a mascara case to begin with and who&#x27;s going to need a new case anyway with each new set?</li>
    <li> Great. Use this everyday</li>
    <li> Hoped this product was a less expensive alternative to other 3D Fiber Lashes. They do not work! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the love alpha fiber mascara and received a product labeled flamingo. I reluctantly tried it. It just gave me spider lashes. I&#x27;m also iffy on how to remove it so that I don&#x27;t get fibers in my eye. UPDATE: As I removed it, I got multiple fibers in my eye, had to flush it with water, and it made my eye red. I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could. Save your money. Youll get a knock off and an irritated eye.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my eyes seem bigger and my lashes are considerably longer after applying the mascara! Great product, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 sets of this mascara to share with my family and friends. Fantastic product :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected but there is a little difference</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and won&#x27;t be using anything else! My eyelashes look as if I have applied false ones. Love alpha is wonderfully priced. I will be ordering this for now on! Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> Recieved yesterday wasnf supposed to until next month. I love the volume it gives my lashes. It hasn&#x27;t even been half way thru the day &amp; fibers are falling into my eyes. I couldnt even drive. But it does its job just dislike the fall out.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best mascaras that I have ever purchased. The formula let&#x27;s you make your lashes as dramatic as you want them to be and stays on all day. I look forward to ordering more products from this seller.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very messy. Not easy to put on. If you take your time and apply multiple coats, it is beautiful. Don&#x27;t wear it if you will be sweating. You will have raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product to provide an honest review.</li>
    <li> These are good for making lashes longer but you don&#x27;t really need the transplanting gel I just use one of my favorite mascaras. Hard candy fiberized lash primer works just as good for 5 bucks</li>
    <li> This stuff flakes really bad but it makes your lashes huge! I just don&#x27;t wanna have to check under my eye every 3 minutes for flakes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I swear by it and have been telling all of my friends the secret to my natural looking full lashes. Look up youtube tutorials and practice, practice, practice and soon you will have the technique down and you will never go back to just regular mascara. I get compliments on my lashes almost every day.</li>
    <li> The fiber lashes work but at the expense of my skin.  I had a very bad allergic reaction to this mascara. My eyelids got very itchy after washing it off.  I used it several times over the course of 3 weeks and now I am opting for &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
    <li> It didnt thicken much or add much volume.&lt;br /&gt;I had apply so many layers that my eyes felt heavy. :(&lt;br /&gt;It did darken though!</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for but okay</li>
    <li> Ok, There are so many &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; mascaras, but this one is NOT good at all. I purchased pink one and it worked so great so I assumed the bottles with the leopard print would be the same and I purchased 3. DO NOT BUY this kind!!!! Skip it and purchase pink instead!</li>
    <li> Absolutely incredible! Works like a charm! Eyelashes go from looking plan ordinary to phenomenally extraordinary! Definitely buying again!</li>
    <li> Not what I hoped for. Wore off so fast To!</li>
    <li> I do not find that the fibers end up on your face as I have read from some. My only complaint was that the first tube of fibers seemed to last about 2 weeks. Honestly, the gel is just a great mascara on its own, so I just used that for awhile. Very nice, easy removal with water. Nice stuff.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best beauty bangs for the buck!!!  I have purchased other more pricey brands such as Younique, and these lashes are hands down as good as, if not better, and you get 2 sets for the price!!!  I would buy these again and I would recommend them.  The fiber lashes stay in place and don&#x27;t fall off like other brands.  As a bonus, if you just want to use the gel mascara it works wonders just by itself.</li>
    <li> So economical it is easy to give it a try.  I paid less than $10 for 2 tubes each of the mascara gel and the fiber tube.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Threw it away...the smell was bad and the results were average. Didnt bother with a return...foreign.</li>
    <li> Be careful, the second layer gets into eyes if humid or hot temp</li>
    <li> Looked great, but product lasted half amount as similar mascaras.</li>
    <li> Welp to everyone saying the fibers get everywhere: you should put a small vanity mirror on your counter and bend over and apply fibers over said mirror. That way, when the fibers fall, it won&#x27;t be on your face or in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;m not a huge fan. The mascara that they send to apply the fibers with isn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s kinda goopy and gets everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful. I&#x27;ve used products like this before and it usually come with a clear mascara to apply it. Also I feel that I don&#x27;t get much volume or length with this product and that was supposed to be the sole purpose.&lt;br /&gt;But they did send two. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll need the second set.</li>
    <li> I love this product It made my eyelashes look super long but natural! Better than putting on fake lashes, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to get these &amp; they&#x27;re really not that different from regular mascara but I will say it does give you a very natural look &amp; it&#x27;s very lightweight compared to normal mascara. It doesn&#x27;t even really feel like I have any on. But you can see the difference.</li>
    <li> Fibers get all over your face!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and even when the &amp;#34;transplanting gel&amp;#34; (I think it is just mascara) dries out and becomes unusable, you will still have plenty of fibers still to use that can be applied over plain mascara.  If you want volume, apply from root to tip LIGHTLY and gently use clean/dry lash brush to &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; them out so they aren&#x27;t a clumpy mess.  If you want length, just apply at the tips. You can keep building layers to get the look you want.  Sometimes, will have some fiber flake off late in the afternoon...I try to apply a pre-emptive light coat of mascara mid day to prevent this.  Removes very easily with soap and water.  This item can provide a very dramatic look or mildly enhance a natural look depending on application technique. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to apply at first but once you get the hang of it, it looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I had my doubts but w/ 2 sets for under 8 bucks why not? To my wonderful surprise I have lucious eyelashes, and i can do it as thick as i want and still do not have spider lashes(clumpy)  and also came a week before expected.</li>
    <li> Complete crap don&#x27;t waste your money!!!! Two tubes where empty the other two where just globs of tar.....</li>
    <li> Why spend triple the amt of money on Younique Lash fibers?? When you can buy this exact one (basically a generic brand) that is a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara! Adds so much length to my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered (4) sets and all but one set was empty or dried inside. Not sure that this product has a long shelf period. I like the way it looks &amp; lasts while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;If it dries up in 3-4 weeks, I will not be buying this product.</li>
    <li> Terrible, clumpy product. Could not use at all!</li>
    <li> I have sooo tried to love fake lashes; I&#x27;ve tried many, and Heaven help me, I just hate &#x27;em. No matter the cost or the brand, I could always feel the adhesive on my eyelids. Eeew. I gave up....until I saw this Amazon listing. NOT fake, gluey &amp;#34;eyelashes&amp;#34;, but....make mine better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hah! I ordered this product as a sort of, &amp;#34;Really?&amp;#34; thing; I must admit, curiosity got the best if me. I read all of the reviews prior to ordering, and again, &amp;#34;Really?&amp;#34;, but the price was right for me to put it to the test myself. I figured, if nothing else, I&#x27;d have a good giggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived weeks ahead of schedule; very nice. Of course, as soon as it arrived I HAD to check it out, even though I was already wearing mascara. HOLY. CATS. Even on top of my daily mascara, this crazy stuff lengthened my lashes to the point that they were bending back from touching my glasses! I found that awesome as well as hilarious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, having not told anyone of my purchase, I removed my glasses and asked Honey, &amp;#34;Do I look okay?&amp;#34; He had no idea what I was looking for, yet his response was, &amp;#34;Your eyelashes look amazing! They look really great!&amp;#34; What a boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s WEIRD. You get a tube of what appears to be normal black mascara, and a tube of what looks like what your cat left on your duvet. First apply the &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34;, then apply the &amp;#34;kitty sheddings&amp;#34;. VOILA! SUPER. LONG. LASHES. I was even able to apply my regular mascara on top of my new Kitty Lashes with minimal shedding. This stuff is absolutely freakishly awesome, and why it&#x27;s taken so long for anyone to figure it out is beyond me. (I don&#x27;t know, maybe they have but I just wasn&#x27;t listening)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you may be able to garner from my review, YESSSS, I am SUPER HAPPY about this purchase! My recommendation is, if you&#x27;re unsure about giving this a try, take the (cheap!) leap and DO IT. I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;^..^&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Ordered April 16th arrived in the mail last week, so delivery was much quicker than expected. It works like all the other 3D mascara.</li>
    <li> I have naturally long lashes, but regular mascara smudges off on the top of my eye lid by my eyebrows as the day goes on.  The oil on my skin breaks down regular mascara and it come off on my lid.  Needless to say, I look crazy.  This mascara is a gel and does not come off.  I only use the fibers if I&#x27;m going out and want to have a little fun with some serious lashes.  I really like this stuff and this is a great deal.  They sell one of these sets at my salon for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it less then 5 stars is because it has a little bit of a funky smell and if I leave it on for bed, my eyes get irritated.  I still recommend it!</li>
    <li> This mascara was amazing!  The reason why I gave it three stars is because the second tube of mascara was totally empty!</li>
    <li> Enjoy this product but dont feel that it really lengthens. Mainly, makes it a little longer but mostly thicker.</li>
    <li> Awesome.... And they look spectacular.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant by the price,  but gave it a shot anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised, and really enjoy this product. If used as directed, you don&#x27;t get the fluff coming off onto your face. It dose take a little practice..,&lt;br /&gt;In the photo, my left  eye is one application. and right eye, is just my normal everyday mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I did apply three applications later, it turned out absolutely amazing and fun!!</li>
    <li> Anyone who is looking to buy this set of mascaras! beware this is a scam! i paid for some lame crap. 2 of the tubes were dried and they dint work. also these are cheap crap mascaras! Do not buy. !! if i could give it zero stars i would.</li>
    <li> I never received my order. Which makes me a little mad. I ordered the matching eye liner and received it just fine and loved it. I was hoping to add this mascara to my daily collection.</li>
    <li> I love this  makes my eyelashes full thick and long thank you great buy</li>
    <li> Flakes fall off into your eyes and irritate them. Very eye irritating product (a few of my friends have tried is as well since I ordered a double pack and they agreed that it is far too irritating to the eyes to actually wear) The mascara part is okay, but you&#x27;re better off going to target and getting your usual mascara.</li>
    <li> Works great and does just as good as the 60 dollar kind!</li>
    <li> The product was not the same as the picture.  It was all in a different language so was unsure how to apply.  I also like being able to read packaging on new products.  Honestly will probably never use this product or order anymore of it.  I tried it once and it caused my eyes to get really itchy.  By the end of the night I had makeup all over my face.</li>
    <li> The fibers shed like crazy. And it took like two months to get here. Save your $13. Not even worth that.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect example of cheap items not having good quality. I would rather pay $20 for a good fiber lash than pay $5-7 for this. When I ordered this, I thought that you couldn&#x27;t go wrong with making a crappy fiber lash mascara. I opened the packaging and the tubing looked very cute, but when i opened the tubes to try them out, the mascara itself had come out like a wand of tar. There was no ring around the inside of the tube to filter how much mascara came out on the brush. Then, I tried using the fiber and trying by best to use the gooey mess. The fibers would not stick to any part of my lashes. They just fall off onto your face and don&#x27;t end up working. Please, do not buy this product. You will be just as disappointed as I was. Spend the extra $10 for the good stuff.</li>
    <li> When I received my order, I got 2 of the same tubes so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it at all. And I contacted Love Alpha twice to tell them about it, they failed to show concern or send me the right set. Very unsatisfied with the services and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Saw an ad on facebook and ordered it instantly, however this was the cheaper brand. I thought I would give it a try and love it!! Makes my eye lashes look defined and curled. Mine stick straight out but it curls them and makes them look so good. My mom said they look fake yet not cheesey. I&#x27;m obsessed amd just bought me and my mom more!! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Perfect Quality . I Loved It</li>
    <li> Needs waaayyy more fibers in the fiber tube!!! The fibers on the brush are the only fibers in the entire tube! I&#x27;m being nice by giving 2 stars. The actual product is pretty.</li>
    <li> AWFUL. The mascara is like water. The fiber lashes fall into my eyes and my eyes get all irritated and red. Plus it took FOREVER just to arrive. Just don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!! It&#x27;s like false lashes in a tube! #GLAM</li>
    <li> Got it earlier than expected but I love it</li>
    <li> Great price for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this mascara and gel set.  I was so  disappointed when I went to use it, the tubes were dried out.  I contacted the seller and they said I had to pay to return these items to them, if I was returning them, because I just didnt want them and they were good, (which they are NOT good) that would be different, this is a defective product and the return shipping should be paid by the seller. We live and learn.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Enjoy so much. Just as good as those expensive brands I was using. Wear it every day.</li>
    <li> The expiration date was already passed when i received the product. Made my eyes itch.</li>
    <li> No complaints for this item I got it way earlier than expected👍&lt;br /&gt;As well as helped really lengthen my lashes I&#x27;m Asian so I don&#x27;t really have much to work with so I really loved this item because it helped my lashes look more fuller as well as lengthen 😄</li>
    <li> Neat stuff contac wearers be careful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this five stars because not only did it come early, but it also did what it said. I kind of expected a little more length and volume, but it still does an amazing job. I have had it on for hours and my eyelashes still look great. :) At this point I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I do not see a difference</li>
    <li> Okay ladies I was SUPER skeptical about this purchase in the first place (half good reviews half not so good). As far as I&#x27;m concerned this stuff is magic in a bottle! I love it! Mine came in after 3 days (graduation was at the end of the week and I wanted to try this stuff out). It worked amazingly! No fiber fell into my eyes and I got ALOT of compliments. These are def worth it!! Plus you can get like 6 of them for the price of 1 high end 3D fiber mascara!!&lt;br /&gt;Below is a picture of the results. The left one is after 1 application where the right eye is JUST mascara! HUGE difference!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend. Mascara is super light so the fibers do not brush on correctly. The fibers ran out after using the tube about 6 times.. It took over a month for me to receive this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product.  Love how my eyelashes look! However, the shipping takes so long or gets lost.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how long my lashes appeared after using the gel and fiber combo - the product really does work. The only downside is that the fibers flake off and attach to your face so you have to periodically check for strays! If that problem were fixed this would be a fabulous 5-star product. I will continue to use on occasion but would use all the time if it didn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> It makes your eye lashes look fuzzy</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving these a 5 star review is because the fibers run out extremely fast. The first few applications are great, but after that I felt that all of the fibers were gone! I LOVE the gel. When you go to wash your face, it doesn&#x27;t run like normal mascara, it kind of just peels off, and is mess free! I really do love these. Plus, I noticed they&#x27;re waterproof, as long as you don&#x27;t rub your eyes.</li>
    <li> Wow dose this give my some lashes fast and easy just go slow on the fibers that way you don&#x27;t over do it. I have even taken a nap and no fallout I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Mascara is the only make up I wear, I have super long lashes and I wanted to try this out. if you use this product just by itself you will not get very good results. you must layer on mascara before and after you use the transplanting gel and the fiber lashes! doing that definitely did make a difference with my eyelashes</li>
    <li> I love. They really work. Takes about 6 coats of each, but it&#x27;s worth the process.</li>
    <li> After 3 days, the fiber extensions tube was completely dry.  I am OCD about closing the tubes so I am pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t because I left it open. I have not opened the second set yet.</li>
    <li> I thought for the price, it was worth a shot.  I was happy to find it worked almost as well as the $40 set that I borrowed from my friend (but couldn&#x27;t justify paying).  This is going to give your lashes great length and volume.  I would say start on the conservative side when adding the fibers.  you can add more with another layer of gel and fibers until you achieve your desired result.  For me, one layer of a medium coat gives me va-va-voom lashes but my mom uses two lighter coats.  One thick coat just made hers look clumpy.</li>
    <li> this product is for me and any one trying to stop wearing fake lshes</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price I can afford to replace it twice as often! This makes my lashes look much thicker.</li>
    <li> I love my set. Works as well as Younique (I have both). I would like to know if this product is tested on animals...</li>
    <li> i couldn&#x27;t mange to use it . it gives clumpy lashes which some people love but i don&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> I think that with more practice i&#x27;d like it more. I had (rarely) some loose fibers that kept coming off, but thats prob because of lack of experience applying. Did lengthen lashes some, but will probably be better with more practice.</li>
    <li> this is better then the expinsive one.. it has more fibers !!and whats best is CHEAP!! 👌👍</li>
    <li> Eh its okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the expensive stuff. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I have very thin lashes so this makes a HUGE difference! never using mascara again. just this will do!</li>
    <li> It looks amazing on your eyes! However, It does leave some fibers behind, underneath your eyes. And it willl sometimes get in your eyes. It is great to take selfies with. You get what you pay for! I will definitely be buying this again. It is amazing for the price. Just be sure to check your makeup through out the day to wipe away any left over fibers!!</li>
    <li> Very excellent product! It arrived a month ahead of the scheduled time. The product was well packaged. I put it on as directed and could immediately see the difference. It added volume to my lashes and the fibre didn&#x27;t fall as much. If you are bad at using false eyelashes like I am, then this is the best answer to your lash-yearning! Lol</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my eyelashes look beautiful and full</li>
    <li> like fiber but prefer a Sephora mascara</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Application was very easy, made my lashes look thicker and longer. I will definitely by this product again. The only negative thing is that it takes about 1month to receive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait! :-)</li>
    <li> Good stuff but you must use it the correct way. Shake the fiber bottle daily and keep the gel tube sealed tightly.</li>
    <li> I swear this got to be the most amazing product in the world. the reason I say this is because, I don&#x27;t have that many lashes. I have small lashes and when I wear this product my lashes look huge! My friends even say I look like a doll with this product. I love it! I really do. The only thing I hate is that I have to wait a month to get it. That&#x27;s why I prefer ordering like 4 of them because I ran of them so fast. The other best thing is that it&#x27;s not hard to remove it when I fall asleep. I really enjoy this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve only worn it a couple of times, but the little fibers end up all around my eyes.  Maybe I missed reading something in the directions.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I was surprised at how easy it is to use, there&#x27;s no irritation at all when product gets in my eyes &amp; comes off so easily! I&#x27;m planning on purchasing more very soon... Thank you so much for this great product!! :)</li>
    <li> The fiber product is pretty good and does somewhat enhance my lashes; however the mascara does practically nothing .  Also it is already almost dried out.  I have tried other lash enhancers that were as good or better and not so messy.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Pretty worthless.  No difference, always flaking.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> I will not be buying this product again. Fibers continue falling throughout the day (maybe if i had time to apply gel every 5 minutes...) My eyes were irritated all day. Not worth it. You do get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Love! Great dupe for the higher priced fiber mascaras like Younique for a fraction of the price. Shipped quicker than expected and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and I immediately washed my face and applied the mascara as directed.  Wow, I was blown away.  My lashes grew before my eyes.  This stuff lengthened with just one application.  My lashes look gorgeous.  I&#x27;m a believer and I truly love this stuff.  This was my first time using fiber lashes and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. It looks 100% natural &amp; mine shipped within 2 days. Highly recommend using this.</li>
    <li> Three coats of this gave me less length than one coat of my drugstore mascara. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Flakes and gets in my eyes constantly.</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time with false lashes like I do, then these are for you!  They are EXCELLENT!  I have recommended them to everyone I know!  I have even purchased for gifts!  I highly recommend at least trying them and if you follow the directions you are only to put the fibers on the ends of your lashes so there is no reason anyone should get them in your eyes.  The gel holds them in place all day and mine never flake off, sometimes I use two or three coats if I want them to be really amazing!  GO FOR IT, you can not beat the price either even if you just want to try them!  :) :) :) LOVE MY LASHES!  They are the best and look like lash extensions which are also great but a pain in the butt to remove!</li>
    <li> Horrible purchase!  Received two EMPTY tubes! Never purchasing again!!!!</li>
    <li> Worthless. Don&#x27;t even try.</li>
    <li> I did a whole review video of this you can find on youtube if you search for itsjoshie sixx I do enjoy this and it is pretty neat and love the packaging. To see how it looks and all you can check out my video under try this:Love Alpha 3D lash mascara on my youtube channel if you want the full scoop on this. Just thought I&#x27;d give opinions. Take it or leave it it&#x27;s there if you wish to proceed xD</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this product on a previous occasion, and I now feel even more convinced of its quality and results.  On top of that, the price makes purchasing any other volumizing/lengthening mascaras a waste of money.  Easy to use and easy to remove at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve been using mascara for fifty years, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Works a little but mostly very cheap. Pay up and get a better product.</li>
    <li> Great buy well worth the money I paid, wasent expensive at all  better and cheaper then alot of the mascaras you buy over the counter,  plus you get two sets for the price of one.</li>
    <li> Came in faster then wat I thought. Also has 2 sets which I also ain&#x27;t know this was a deal really works Luv it.</li>
    <li> The order came early, it works fantastic, and this is my second order of it (: I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this to create a fake dark beard for a Halloween costume, and it worked great. Not sure how it would turn out used as a conventional make-up product though.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s all i can say.</li>
    <li> absolutely beautiful results !!  much more natural than false lashes and stay all day. !!  one application my lashes were 3 x longer fuller. very beautiful way to accent your eyes no matter what color !!!!  very glamorous !!!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! I see why you get 2 sets, because you are lucky to get more than one application! I thought it was pretty good the first time I used it, then the second, it didn&#x27;t seem to go on as well, then the third time was pretty much zilch.  I am going to pay a little more, and get a better, longer lasting one! But.. delivery, considering it was coming from China, was pretty quick! :)  However, had I known it was coming from China, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it in the first place. I&#x27;d rather give my business to my own country.  Update:  I actually was able to get ONE EYE done this morning before the crapped out. I don&#x27;t mean one USE, but one EYE! Seriously! I did my left eye, then put the gel on my right eye, then the fibers, but guess what? NO FIBERS CAME OUT no matter how many times I put the brush in, and moved it up and down,  around, and up and down again! NO fibers! What a joke!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipping took long. But for price you can&#x27;t beat the wait. Amazon should say if products don&#x27;t come from USA..  but good product fir price.</li>
    <li> You have always seemed ti send great stuff. The cell phone face civers were no good. Did not stick at all. Threww away. Otherwise all other itens you do great.  Thats why I seem to always go back to your websites.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> the fibers irritate my eyes, but if applied carefully, it looks amazing on. really makes eyelashes pop.</li>
    <li> I had some reservations but decided to give it a try...I love this mascara! So easy to use and crazy long lashes! Such a deal...ordering more!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used!! I love it and am so impressed with it! Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> Love this, really makes my lashes appear longer for an affordable price.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to finally get them, but I&#x27;m happy with them.  You have to be careful that the fiber tip isn&#x27;t too loaded or it will get in your eyes.  I gently blow on it before applying.  It takes about 5 times longer to do than regular mascara, but the end result is worth it.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I just received my product yesterday, though it too a couples weeks to get to me it was well worth the wait! I already have semi long lashes as it is but no matter how many mascaras I tried I couldnt really get the results I wanted to flaunt them! This stuff is great! Got a couple of my friends in on it too!!</li>
    <li> i noticed my eyes bothered me after putting on the mascara</li>
    <li> i have been buying this product for sometime now but this last time i ordered....the tubes were smaller and the mascara wasnt the same. no matter what i do, i  ant get my lashes the same as  before.  i will be returning this as soon as i can figure lut how.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY eyelashes are naturally kinda long but when I tell you, I put this on and I get compliments all day. I only wear it maybe twice a week (not a huge make up person) but I love it. Its easy to remove (no more dark circles under my eyes removing mascara) and gives the desired look. No complaints whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Me AND my sister bought these after all the great reviews and positive feedback we read on this product. When we received the product we were so excited to try them out. But to our disappointment, this did literally nothing. We&#x27;ve watched so many demo &amp; tutorials on this Love Alpha mascara and we feel like we&#x27;re doing everything right but it just doesn&#x27;t add any type of length. It just gives our eyelashes a bit of color and weighs them down a bit. Not what we we&#x27;re expecting. So sad because we had high expectations for this mascara :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have eye lashes but this makes me have them!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It works wonderfully, my eyelashes look better than ever! If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, the fibers will sometimes fall into your eyes and it&#x27;s kind of irritating. After awhile you get used to applying it and you don&#x27;t have that issue any more.&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, when I received the product, one of the tubes of natural fibers didn&#x27;t have anything. However, I contacted the seller, and they said they would send me a new tube. The customer service was fast and I am satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. I didn&#x27;t like the fibers and it did look natural</li>
    <li> I love it! The only negative is that the fibers flake a little throughout the day. It definitely makes my eyelashes much longer and thicker. I&#x27;m not sure I can ever use regular mascara ever again! The price was much cheaper than other brands, but works just as well!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price when this product works the same as a product selling for 10 times the price-$30.00.&lt;br /&gt;This lengthening mascara works beautifully.  I&#x27;ve used the more expensive product and can find no difference.  I bought extra for family members and they love it as much as the expensive product which they&#x27;ve been using.  Lashes are very long.  The fibers stick to the lashes perfectly.  Just follow the directions and you can make your lashes twice as long as your natural lash.  Stays put all day and is easy to remove.  I just happen to use coconut oil to remove my makeup.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT EXPECTED.  Will not order this again.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff ...way better than Younique!!</li>
    <li> I already have very long and lush lashes so this product definitely makes it look like I have amazing quality falsies on! I am very pleased it came in a double pack, I will gift the other set to my best friend who doesn&#x27;t have the longest lashes in the world. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes me look like I have long healthy lashes. Easy to use. Perfect if you don&#x27;t do false lashes.</li>
    <li> I did not like it . it was not up to my expectations and I would not recommend it to anyone . I should have gone with the unique, it was more costly but probably worth the money.</li>
    <li> very good inexpensive alternative. bought it for my mom who loved it more than younique!</li>
    <li> i was looking for a really good mascara that didn&#x27;t flake etc.  i didn&#x27;t want to wear false eyelashes because they can damage your lashes once you stop wearing them. i had heard about fiber mascara but all the ones i reseached were really pricy, then i happened to be searching the site and found this brand. since i had not used the product before i wanted try it out first before i became a good customer.  I really like this product and i get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes everywhere i go.  i will definitely order this product again.  it is very easy to remove and does not damage my own lashes. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $30 to try Younique. It is a good replacement product to &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; with and decide if fiber mascara is for you. I have decided it&#x27;s good for special occasions but not for general use. I attached a photo with 1 coat. I usually do at least 3 for that &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; type of look.</li>
    <li> I have been using latisse and have had slow to little results. I used this product yesterday and instantly, my lashes looked fuller and longer. The downside is a few fibers will get in your eye and may fill a little uncomfortable. When using this product you have to be realistic, you will not have the same results as you would with wearing false lashes.</li>
    <li> the mascara tubes are dried out already</li>
    <li> Works for me. Takes a little practice not to end up with a globby mess, but I&#x27;m getting there</li>
    <li> It takes time and patience to really get the technique of putting on this mascara and fiber. This brings more volume to your lashes rather than length. So far i would suggest putting on the mascara first because i get little fiber pieces all over my cheeks. this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Product was terrible to clumpy to apply</li>
    <li> I finally have thicker fuller eyelashes again. This stuff is awesome. It is the best deal out there. Just as good as the more expensive brand. Very easy to apply. Highly recommend it those who want fuller longer lashes without the expense.</li>
    <li> The tubes that I recieved barely had any fiber lashes in them the mascara I get for the dollar store works much better than this</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. *sigh&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not for me. I wear contacts and the little fuzzies that stick to your lashes always get in my eyes and burn like mad, forcing me to take my contacts out and rinse them. I can&#x27;t see well enough to put on makeup without having my contacts in so I guess I won&#x27;t be using this. When I could get some in it looked pretty, but stung my eyes.</li>
    <li> Much better and easier to apply than  false eyelashes.  If you want the look of false eyelashes without having to spend the time and energy it takes to apply false eyelashes (not to mention if you want to get away from the messy and sometimes irritating glue you have to use to affix false lashes) then this is for you.  My first experience with fiber lashes was with the Younique brand.  I liked that brand, but it was exorbitantly expensive.  I thought I&#x27;d give the less expensive brand a try.  It is every bit as good.  However, you have to take a little more time when applying the Love Alpha.  I found that I needed to apply the product two or three times to get the dramatic effect for which I was looking - - that of long long lashes.  I notices that there isn&#x27;t as heavy a concentration of fibers on Love&#x27;s wands (thus the reason you need to apply several times).  That could be a good thing though.  With the Younique brand it seems like you get too much fiber which causes your lashes to look clumpy and gross.  The Younique directions even tell  you that you might need to brush your lashes with a lash brush to remove clumps.  All in all I like the Love Alpha brand.  I actually purchased more because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> My lashes look perfect and when i usr my Maybelline Million Lashes mascara applicator for the transplantinggel, i get beautiful volume and no clumps! It works awesome! Really it does, but the fiber tube runs out so quickly! The price is great though cause it comes with 2 sets, so when the first tube of fibers ran out I just started using the second tube. I&#x27;m still on the first tube of &amp;#34;transplanting gel.</li>
    <li> Very tricky mascara, this was my first time trying fiber mascara, and i must say i am pretty impressed. The packaging is adorable, you must add the fibers fast before the gel dries, I find it easier to hold both tubes in my hand unscrewed add the gel and quickly put the fibers over them.....do not get too carried away and do 100 layers (like i did the first time) or you will end up looking like you have spiders crawling out of your eyes LOL...also washes off easily in shower i actually find i have less black rings around my eyes when getting out of the shower opposed to regular mascara. Does irritate the eyes a little bit, but it is tolerable</li>
    <li> Just like I thought I would get. Cute bottle and a great price</li>
    <li> these make my lashes look so much bigger!</li>
    <li> Got here quick and it is AMAZING I def recommend this to any girl out there no matter your lashes.</li>
    <li> This product caused some eye irritation for me. My eyes got really itchy upon applying the extender. One of my eyes ended up getting really red and somewhat swollen. I may have just had a bad reaction to it. I ended up purchasing Two Faced Eyelash Extender Mascara from Sephora and I love it.</li>
    <li> People literally ask me, &amp;#34;Are those your REAL eyelashes?&amp;#34; and I gladly tell them &amp;#34;YES!!!&amp;#34; Love this to DEATH! GREAT BUY!!</li>
    <li> GREAT stuff. Takes some practice so don&#x27;t try it when getting ready to roll out. Spwnd some time with it!</li>
    <li> Much better than I expected. Application is simple, it stays on, and looks like natural eye lashes.  I was very hesitant about purchasing this after reading a few negative reviews about clumping and fibers all over the face. In my opinion, if anyone has bad results with this, it would probably be because that person stinks at applying mascara. My lashes look amazing with this stuff and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Fibers are kind of lose and come out in clumps sometimes, but I would buy again, to save money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, can&#x27;t really tell i have it on though.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes are puny when they are make up free and I was seriously considering shelling out for eyelash extensions.  But I wasn&#x27;t really digging the idea of (a) the expense, (b) the time commitment, and (c) the maintenance.  I stumbled across this product (I&#x27;d never actually heard of fiber mascara before) and decided for a little less than $6 it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it out.  I&#x27;ve also been playing around with false eyelashes but sometimes they&#x27;re just too much to deal with/make my eyes feel weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with ordering anything from China, it&#x27;s really hit or miss on how long it will take to arrive.  This product arrived pretty quickly (a little more than 2 weeks but still a full 10 days before the beginning estimated date of arrival).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read through some reviews and took the advice of looking up some videos on how to apply it.  It&#x27;s easy but doesn&#x27;t hurt to watch a video or two just to make sure you&#x27;re doing it correctly the first time around.  You should do one eye at a time - apply the gel (longer tube), then the fibers - from about mid-lash - not right by the lash line (helps to keep fibers from getting in your eye), then more gel - and repeat as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to practice so I have only done one layer but my lashes looked a lot longer/so much better.  I actually thought the gel alone was a good mascara.  In fact, I applied ONLY the gel on my bottom lashes and it worked nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you have pathetic lashes (short and sparse like me), dropping the few dollars on this product (and you get two sets - which can&#x27;t be beat) will be worth your while.  It does take a little practice and I got a bit of fiber in the first eye I worked on, but nothing too bad (I have pets so I&#x27;m used to fuzz in my eye all too frequently).  I&#x27;d say from my (so far limited) experience that one coat is still a bit better than your average mascara - but again this is still less expensive than even most mascaras you&#x27;d buy at a drug store.  Additional coats will knock drug store mascaras out of the competition.</li>
    <li> Irritates the eyes some but I really like how it looks.. Beauty doesnt come free of problems</li>
    <li> I like the product but did not recieve the carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;The decripition of the product was accurate.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove making the damage to my lashes very minimal. Great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference between regular mascara and this one. The fiber fall out really easy and we&#x27;re all in my eye and on my face.</li>
    <li> TOO MESSY OMG... THE FIBERS FALL EVERYWHERE EXCEPT YOUR LASHES...WASTE OF MY MONEY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a similar product, but couldn&#x27;t justify the price. This product is incredible since I wasn&#x27;t blessed with beautiful eyelashes, and false lashes bother me. I will definitely reorder this.</li>
    <li> This product does work but it smells funny and to get the look you want you are looking at least putting three or four coats.</li>
    <li> I LOVE mascara. I love long, thick lashes. I&#x27;ve been known to buy every new mascara out there. I will apply and apply and apply for a good 5 minutes per eye to try and &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; them up. I hate false lashes, extensions are way too expensive and time consuming appointments. I got this stuff thinking it was &amp;#34;worth a shot&amp;#34; since it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive. I have to say, &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;! It took me just a minute per eye to acheive better than any results I&#x27;ve ever got with regular mascara. It was SO easy. And no mascara left behind on my eyelid either which is a nice bonus! I will be buying a LOT more of this stuff and spreading the news!</li>
    <li> not the same quality  that Ive ordered before. This one doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> this will be my second set of 2 that I&#x27;m buying! I will never use a different kind of mascara! 😊😊😊</li>
    <li> Needs a nice case to put them in your purse</li>
    <li> really great but i do have to wipe below my bottom lashes after but just two coats and my lashes look amazing</li>
    <li> Flaked off hurt my eyes</li>
    <li> Excellent timing. The product is perfect and very inexpensive</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and followed the suggested method of a single coat of regular mascara, then apply gel transplant from the middle to ends of lashes followed by the fiber mascara from mid-lash to ends.  I experimented with layering and I found that the product layered nicely and enhanced my natural lashes.  Appearance-wise, there was a noticeable change in both length and thickness of lashes.  I would recommend this fiber mascara to friends, and I will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever. I have used drugstore and high end mascaras and this is by far the best. It makes eyelashes super long and thick, and better yet it comes off with just WATER. There is a little fall out from the fibers but I just sweep them off with a powder brush. I recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work but I went for it because it was so cheap. Well I&#x27;m notorious for pulling at my eye lashes so my lashes are extremely short. Now it actually looks like I have naturally long lashes ☺️</li>
    <li> This is nearly the same as the Younque line but a whole lot cheaper. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Contact lens wearer&#x27;s be careful not to get these fibers in your eyes because it can cause infection, ulcers of the eye, and ruin your lenses. I initially love this product but I had to change my rating.</li>
    <li> i finally recd this today after about 2 months or so...but it was clearly indicated it would take a long time. then it showed it was delivered on may 29 however that was to somewhere in new jersey (i live in tennessee)&lt;br /&gt;i notified the seller &amp; got a refund quickly. then lo &amp; behold it came today almost another month later. anyway... this product is pretty great. i use younique 3D so am making that comparison. one thing tho--these directions didn&#x27;t say to put on your own mascara first (like you do with younique)...idk why because that makes a drastic difference. doing it without a mascara layer first gets ho hum results. on top of mascara it&#x27;s very good...comparable to younique. maybe not quite as much lash thickness/volume but very long. perhaps a bit less clumpy &amp; easier to look natural?? but have only put it on once. keep in mind ALL of these 2 step fiber mascaras can be tricky to use &amp; take a little practice for some people maybe. i found them very easy to use but i am an xperienced (lol) &amp;#34;make up user&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;i will use this &amp; found it fabulous for the price esp for daily use. for major occasions nothing beats 2 carefully applied layers of younique-- ;)&lt;br /&gt;oh...nothing about this product has bothered my eyes @ all. be careful tho with all fiber mascaras not to let fibers drop into eye during application.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product since I heard of younique fiber 3d lash but their price was entirely too steep... I will be ordering both mine and my moms from here and sending all my friends!!!</li>
    <li> As soon as I applied it I could not believe the difference.....This does work I recommend the ladies to buy it.....thanks for such a great beauty product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miriam Rodriguez&lt;br /&gt;Lawton, OK</li>
    <li> came way eariler than expected. 4 tubes in all. Everythings in spanish. But to know how to do it properly you need to look up 3D mascarra on youtube. Basically you just put on one coat of reagular mascarra that doesent come with the set, the apply the transplanting gel witch is the longer one the right after that you apply the fibers which is the shorter one. After that you wait about 2 to 3 minutes yo put on the transplanting gel again. My eyelashes deffiently look longer and fuller. I recomend. Much chepper than the orginal kind but work just as well.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase. I viewed people&#x27;s photos in the review and that was my motivation to purchase it. But once I received it and tried it, I wasn&#x27;t pleased. Which is shocking bc I&#x27;m an actual pretty reasonable person. The mascara was literally messy, always getting in my eye. Take my advice and don&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> I had hopes for this and was let down. At first lashes look fuzzy then after that there is no real difference between the look of just regular mascara BUT constant fibers under the eyes. Not cool.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  Does become itchy during the day but I don&#x27;t know a 3D mascara that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and never have to re-apply, evan after a workout.</li>
    <li> Perfect, extends your lashes... Not many fibers in tube tho after couple of uses.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but when then i received my product and used it, I was quit amazed, its no diffrent than yonique. Would definitely recommend to my friends. :)</li>
    <li> Works very well!! Took a while be delivered but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Works, it&#x27;s rather neat. But its to early for me to give it a 5 stars, while I am still learning how to use it.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes even when I was trying to apply the first time (my only time I just received it). I had contacts in and I flaked off a peace into my eye; it didn&#x27;t burn or hurt I just picked it out.. It did take a long time to get, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I recieved mine yesterday, tried it last night and i really didnt see a difference in my lashes. I didnt get fibers all over my face or any eye irritation but, the mascara did wear off within a couple hours and then i noticed the fibers all under my eyes after it had wore off. Not saying this is a complete waste but I will try it again today.</li>
    <li> Neat. I have a before and after but my app doesn&#x27;t have a pic upload feature :/</li>
    <li> I absolutely like this product you can really see the fibers doing there job!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> There is NOTHING and i mean  completely empty both fiber tubes. What a joke and waist of money , I thought I&#x27;d buy cause reviews were decent but this is just garbage and took almost two months to see.  If I could give no stars I would.  These people are ascam don&#x27;t buy !!</li>
    <li> Hated this!  Didn&#x27;t work for me and ended up with fibers in my eyes every time!  👎🏻</li>
    <li> A cool concept but it works just as good as any regular mascara honestly I don&#x27;t see that much of a difference, there&#x27;s a little bit of a difference, they do look longer but there&#x27;s too many steps and you can just buy a good to mascara and have one step and you&#x27;re good to go but I would buy this again or I would recommend someone else to buy it just to try it because it&#x27;s fun just make sure you do the long one first then the short one and then the long one again and you can do it as many times as you want just keep that stuff in process and make sure you end with the transplanting jail which is the long tube because that&#x27;s what seals the fibers In</li>
    <li> Looked clumpy and shed all over the place.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this stuff! I was a little worried because of previous reviews stating that it flaked off, but I am impressed! First off, putting it on was easy, I did it half asleep this morning, took MAYBE 2 minutes. Second off, AMAZing difference, I just did one coat and it is perfect, thick and long lashes but does not look fake and nasty. No clumping, but I would keep a eyelash brush around just in case to touch up a little. ALSO, this stuff has been on my lashes all day at work (total of 10 hours now) and none of it has flaked or shed, it is still prefect on my eyelashes. I&#x27;m impressed and FEEL so pretty today. Also, can&#x27;t beat the price! Same price if not cheaper than mascara from the drug store and WAY better. I&#x27;ve tried Younique and liked it but it was too expensive, this is way cheaper and in my opinion, an even better product then the more expensive similar fiber lashes sold by Younique.</li>
    <li> I got this to see if it would add some length to my eyelashes and while I did notice slight more length, it came with a price. It was clumpy and flaky. The small fibers (which look like tiny hairs) came off. I kept wiping them off under my eyes throughout the day. Product just isn’t for me.</li>
    <li> I have light-colored, short lashes so I&#x27;m always looking for the next great thing in mascara.  I would be more than happy to apply gel and fibers repeatedly if I saw measurable results.  I might see a bit of lengthening/thickening from the product, but not enough to warrant carrying around two tubes of product and going through multiple applications.  Unfortunately, for me the results just aren&#x27;t there.  I&#x27;m on to the next new thing...</li>
    <li> I love these. So great for the price! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist. I feel this product lives up to its claims, but isn&#x27;t the best. Occasionally fibers get your eyes comment will fall on your cheeks. Overall though, this is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> If they made a brown color, I would be happier!  But just great!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Takes practice, but makes my red eyelashes look fabulous!</li>
    <li> causes some eye irritation, very strong smell. ended up having to remove it completely within 15 minutes...my eyes just would not stop burning.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this product just because it seemed too cheap to be true! But I actually love it, works for me and I am about to  order some more! My sister buys from Younique website which is a lot more expensive but in my opinion this product works as well and the price is better!</li>
    <li> I recived one set of love alpha mascara one set of flamingo mascara.  The love alpha set works great but the flamingo brand dose not work good at ALL. The picture and description advises that you will get two sets of love alpha mascara, I was deceived...and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This really was a crappy mascara. It also made my eyelashes very hard. Didn&#x27;t​ use again, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Receive the mascara fast in the mail. Thank you so much. Product is good. Says what it does. Makes ur lashes longer...however it can get a little messy. Overall I like the product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> If done exactly right is an amazing result. Takes a little practice. Did have some fuzz fall in my eye at first but after getting the hang of application wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> Worked like I thought it would. No instructions but I just looked it up on youtube. Great Price. Got one for me and my best friend.</li>
    <li> Lashes look beautiful but it takes a lot of time to put this product on .</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing the gel/fiber mascara and I absolutely love it! I have short, blonde eyelashes and wanted my eyelashes to stand out more than just using regular mascara. I tried it and wow....my eyelashes are full and long, very voluminous. The process is simple (gel first, then fiber, gel again...repeat until desired look). I will definitely be buying more. Plus, it removes so easy. I had no excess fibers on my face or in my eyes (if you are a normal wearer of mascara, you will probably not have any problems b/c we know how to apply). If you are looking for a cheap yet durable gel/fiber mascara, this is it!</li>
    <li> Its best to practice to get the hang of it. I love the way it look after lots of practice. Gives me great length very noticeable if done properly. I combed out my lashes then applied in a sway motion from roots out to give my lash the dramatic volume look. It&#x27;s best to start from bottom lash then top in my opinion. Try not to pump mascra so much it will dry out quickly. Hopes this helps!!!☺</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> The fibers in the smaller mascara irritated my eyes in a way that was uncomfortable. The taller mascara tube was very effective though. I love the product otherwise.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the more expensive 3D fibers</li>
    <li> This was the worst mascara ever!! Bought it for my girlfriend,  she threw it away.</li>
    <li> I like it, but you do have to apply more than once. But I have never tried anything like this before and it did actually make me look like I have long eyelashes, mine are thin from ageing. But the more I use it I will get better at applying it and it does last all day with no clumping or flaking.</li>
    <li> As what you see.  I&#x27;m a Chinese really short eye lashes.  This product did great job!!  Just need to be careful when u apply the fiber.  It&#x27;s easy to get into your eye.  Still love it ! At the end of the day  it still gives my eyes a clean looking</li>
    <li> my first time to use fiber mascara... but it work s well for me... look natural</li>
    <li> Great deal for four products I would deathly recommend this to somebody and it&#x27;s perfect for  eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Time to time the transplanting gel gets a little clumpy on my lashes and the fiber tube doesn&#x27;t have much in them. Definitely does not work as well as Younique fiber lash but for the cost its amazing! I do recommend</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to make your eyelashes super pretty/nice looking, add more than one coat, do a coat of the gel/fiber, let it try for 30seconds or so, then another coat, I do about 2 or 3 coats and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I looked up lots of videos/reviews on this and found out that&#x27;s the best way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this stuff too!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I dont see how much of a difference the $30  stuff can do bc for this price im sold! Plus you get two sets who can beat that?!</li>
    <li> It was a little finicky at first to use, realized I REALLY needed to gel first coat. The fibers do get &amp;#34;flaky&amp;#34; but that is easily corrected.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Easy to apply but will use it when I am able to spend a longer time doing my make-up. It was easy to remove using make-up remover wipes</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The black things come on my face all the time. The only thing that works is the applying gel.</li>
    <li> got in great time! i used it once so far and it work, my lashes were much longer and thicker. my neg was i kept getting little black fuzzies in my eye. but i think once i use it more and figure the best way to appy, it wont be such a problem. got 2 sets for great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the moodstruck &amp; really liked it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the $40+ for it; so I bought this brand &amp; it works well. You can definitely tell a difference in regular mascara &amp; the fiber lashes!  &amp; its great for long wear as well</li>
    <li> The only problem I had with this mascara is the fibers get in your eyes. I wear contacts and when I took the contacts out they had the fibers from the mascara all over them.</li>
    <li> Some people have complained of irritations. I have never had a problem. I apply the mascara once a day to extend my lashes. Application became easier after 2 uses. You begin to get an idea of how to improve the look. I apply the gel as if it were mascara. I fully cover my eyelashes. Then I apply the fiber. I DO NOT go over several times as this will cause the fiber to bulk up and eventually fall onto the face/cheeks. Again this takes practice. As the end of the day a simple wash or wet washcloth will remove the entire product. I have had occasions when I fall asleep with the product. No irritation or redeye. I love my longer lashes. FYI if you were prescription glasses or shades, the tips of the fibers will rub off and fall on the lens and face. Only the tips. So I make sure to check throughout the day to see if I have fallen fibers.</li>
    <li> I get the feeling this makes a bigger difference on shorter eye lashes since I tried them on my pretty decent lashes and basically got the same effect as any drugstore mascara. It is build able if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing but I don&#x27;t really have that kind of patience. Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that&#x27;s soft, long wearing, ;lengthening and easily removable, this is your product, honey.</li>
    <li> IT CLUMPED ON ME, WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT WEREN&#x27;T FOR THAT....MAYBE USE A CONDITIONER BEFORE USE...</li>
    <li> I love this! Great price for a pretty awesome product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of lash enhancers and this is the best. Beautiful case - cool packaging. Really great results that don&#x27;t look &#x27;spidery&#x27;. Thinking about retailing this at the spa.</li>
    <li> The worst product, feels like someone kicked a wad of sand in my eyes. I wear lash extensions, and I thought this would be a great solution in between visits to the lash salon ... or better yet, a way to save money and use this product instead. I&#x27;m excellent at applying mascara, but this product is horrible. Pieces of fiber in my eyes, on my face and eyelids. Even as I write this review and after a lengthy clean up ... there are still fibers in my eyes. The photo shows what was on my face, and in and around my eyes. Also, I watched several YouTube videos demonstrating the correct application. I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not what it seems. Bad brushes and little product. I can hardly tell im wearing it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Makes your eyelashes really big. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m suprosed actually worked</li>
    <li> Keeping in mind that this sort of product takes a bit of practice to get used to, I do love it.  I am still trying to get the hang of applying without it looking too clumpy, but I think I will improve over time.  The first time I tried it out I had fibers falling all over the place, in my eye even.  But the next time I was just more careful and made sure to seal it all in with the gel after the last application.  I have been doing about three coats, along with a thin coat of regular mascara to cover the base of my lashes (I&#x27;m blonde).  I love the tubes, they are very expensive looking and leopard print is my thing.</li>
    <li> I would have to say this product work!</li>
    <li> Love it! my new daily mascara!!</li>
    <li> These are comparable to the more expensive name brand ones but aren&#x27;t AS good. But for the price these are a good alternative. They do take a really long time to get though.</li>
    <li> This mascara set is the bomb. I love the way it opens my face and brightens my eyes</li>
    <li> Love it. I am very allergic to  a lot of makeup,this product has been great ..</li>
    <li> The one fiber tube was empty. The second one I used a total of 3 times and now its empty. The two gel tubes were ok. I would not recommend ordering from here.</li>
    <li> Well I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of my mascara, and it came before the expected delivery date. So I was really happy! I put it on and took an old cleaned up mascara applicator to help separate my eyelashes. My lashes looked great!  Then within an hour or two my eyes started burning and feeling very dry and irritated. I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff but it feels like battery acid!!  I&#x27;m so disappointed I&#x27;m just gonna throw it out as I don&#x27;t even want to try to use it again. Way too much burning and irritation. Also my instructions came in Chinese..</li>
    <li> My friend got another type of the fiber lash and it seemed to work for her. I bought the Love Alpha because it was $15 cheaper and it had TWO sets. I&#x27;m very peculiar about what I do with my lashes and I can&#x27;t express how much I love this stuff. Although, I still curl them and put a quick swipe of the mascara I use and then I do the gel and fibers. But I love them! They fill out so much better than just mascara alone. I will be buying these again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself and as a gift for my friend! We absolutely loved it! The price is amazing, considering you get two sets which is four tubes! It really extends the eyelashes!</li>
    <li> Wore it several times. No problems . Top it off with waterproof mascara. no problems with contacts. Definitely makes eyelashes thicker and a little longer. I usually do 2 coats, focusing on tips.</li>
    <li> Slight irritation but worth the results.</li>
    <li> This was a really great low-cost alternative to the expensive brand name fiber products. It&#x27;s also great because it comes with 2 sets, and the packaging is pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Does darken, thicken and extend lashes&lt;br /&gt;Way cheaper than the $30+ products elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t shed all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I had to vigorously shake/tap the fiber bottle to get them onto the brush. Perhaps it had settled during shipping?&lt;br /&gt;It does irritate my eyes. I had Lasik about four years ago, so my eyes may be extra sensitive. A lot of users with contacts have complained, and I know this would have hurt when I wore contacts.&lt;br /&gt;Slow shipping (about 3 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product. I usually put on my regular mascara, then do 1-3 coats of the gel/fiber once it&#x27;s dry. I even wear it over fake eyelashes and eyelash extensions. It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage them, and it works just as well to thicken/lengthen.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money on this by the time you get it its completly dyed you</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  I used to get the extensions, but with this I will never have to do that again.  What a major cost savings!</li>
    <li> I mean sT definitely will be purchasing more of this item. I love love love it.</li>
    <li> The items got home on time and they look great but two of the tubes we&#x27;re empty the brushes  we&#x27;re falling apart but the other two work just fine, I have long lashes but they are very light this mascara makes them look even longer and very dark just how I like them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super easy and works great!&lt;br /&gt;And cheaper than the drug store mascara I have been using for years. I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really work wonders for me. Plastic mascara applicators never seem to coat my lashes so applying the gel was a little rough. When I did achieve a fuller, longer eyelash look I couldn&#x27;t prevent the fibers from getting all over my eyelid. I even went on YouTube and tried to pick up some tips on how to make this mascara work for me...unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> This is a messy mascara and cant seem to get all those fibers out of my eyeballs!</li>
    <li> Its a great product if you want longer eyelashes, except for the part that you might end up getting fibers into your eyeballs. It takes practice just make sure you lace fibers along the ends of your eyelash not in the bottom or you&#x27;ll end up with them inside your eyes. Well other than that this product did make my eyelashes pop out since my natural ones are so tiny.</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara at all. It takes a long time to apply enough to even notice and it does not extend my lashes much at all. I have purchased better gel and fiber mascaras from the drug store.</li>
    <li> I received my package very quickly.  The  mascara and the fibers go on easily.  I have yet to have a problem with the fibers shedding.  Will definitely</li>
    <li> The packaging is so freakin cute! Love the cheetah prints on the tube. It gives great length to my lashes and it does make them look fuller, too. One thing I didn&#x27;t like about the product was that I did experience some fall outs from the fibers. I was kinda expecting that but still it was annoying and got in my eyes/contacts. Overall, I do enjoy the products and really like the results it gave me.</li>
    <li> Hands down, best mascara ever. Buy it, try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It really does give you a flawless look by giving you longer lashes. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I wish it was water prove!</li>
    <li> Despite following the directions, the fibers flake off into your eye and they are so small it is difficult to locate and remove them. The same thing happens with removal, while easy, the flakes can get into your eye no matter how careful you are. I returned the product and have resumed using my tried and true mascara.</li>
    <li> This product claims to be equal to the younique products but it is not. When I received my order, it was dried up. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look longer at all and the fibers get in my eyes and it&#x27;s just so uncomfortable. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using these lashes for over six months and I am still in love with them! This is a great &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; pack (since it doesn&#x27;t come with the nice case), but you don&#x27;t need a new case every time.  Please be sure you understand how to apply these lashes.  They work EXACTLY like the other brand that&#x27;s been going around on Facebook (all those parties you keep getting invited to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply:&lt;br /&gt;put on a coat of your favorite non-clumping mascara on your lashes (cheap is fine)&lt;br /&gt;apply the gel to one eye (its important to work on one eye at a time so that it doesnt dry before applying the fibers)&lt;br /&gt;apply the fibers and focus on the tips, brushing through the gel&lt;br /&gt;apply the gel again to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the fibers in&lt;br /&gt;REPEAT on other eye!&lt;br /&gt;If you really want amazing lashes you can apply to each eye again.  This mascara is buildable!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Can&#x27;t tell a difference from expensive brands. A must buy!!</li>
    <li> It does seem to flake under your eye or on your cheek occasionally</li>
    <li> I normally use this product on a daily basis and have purchased this most recently from a new seller this time.  For some reason, this particular fiber tube has a wider opening and does not remove buildup of fibers on the wand/stick/  It causes globs of fibers that ultimately falls into your eyes and all over your face. This is not normal, in my experience from different sellers.  Strange that its LOOKS LIKE the same product, however Im questioning different manufacturers?</li>
    <li> It does make lashes appear longer/fuller...however, my experience was that the tiny fibers flaked onto my face (below lower lashes) &amp; also some into my eyes :(</li>
    <li> The fibers barely stick but not bad, still get lots of length, just have to apply a lot of fibers</li>
    <li> Nice to have two sets for the price of one! It emphasizes my lash right away even for one coating. I just thought that it gets dry quickly after the gel, so you kinda have to apply the fibers right away. Other than that got no complaints, I&#x27;m satisfied. Thanks for faster delivery...unlike other items I ordered before I ordered this, until now I didn&#x27;t get it yet!</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome! Anyone who gave a bad review just didnt use it properly! I was definitely skeptical at first but this was worth the buy. I&#x27;m glad I went with this instead of wasting money on the name brand fiber lash mascara. This is the only mascara I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara, I highly recommend it. This doesn&#x27;t leave the black raccoon eyes and doesn&#x27;t damage your lashes. Great product so far.</li>
    <li> This made my lashes look slightly thicker/fuller - but not remarkably so. What I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that ALL DAY long I felt I had fuzzy things in my eyes and it was so irritating!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great deal. Worked wonders for my short straight eyelashes. I put two layers of each on and looks great. No spidery looking lashes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for me and my daughter. We absolutely love it! This is a really good deal too. I looked up the price of some of the more popular brands, and this is a much better deal for sure  Directions are simple and in English, no clumping or flaking, and it arrived quickly. I was very content with this product.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I ever had! I don&#x27;t have much eyelashes from having thyroid. So this stuff is the miracle I needed.</li>
    <li> Horrible! My mascara came in, I was excited to open when I did my mascara was dried out! Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I buy Younique 3D Fiber Lashes all the time!  These are BETTER in my opinion!  I don&#x27;t get the lashes all over me and they actually stay all day and over night without falling out into my eye.  LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! Works just as good as the $40 fiber lashes for a fraction of the price! Will be getting more when I run out!</li>
    <li> doesnt work and the fiber gets in your eye. not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first fiber mascara that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works great!  One piece of advice... seal the fibers in with the gel after applying the fiber.  I didn&#x27;t do this the first time I used it and ended up with little fibers under my eyes.  Not a good look.</li>
    <li> So disappointed that I&#x27;m not given the option to post user images since I took some for this review. I applied this on one eye &amp; then applied my current mascara on the other (L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Miss Manga). The only significant differences you can see between the two is that the &amp;#34;Love Alpha&amp;#34; mascara looks clumpy &amp; spidery, while my lashes actually appear longer with my original mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get 2 tubes. Step 1 is to apply the gel from tube 1 onto your lashes.  Step 2 is applying the felt fibers onto your lashes which I guess is supposed to create &amp;#34;volume &amp; length&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t see either. Just clump &amp; fallen fibers all around my eye area. I even used my lash separator to help tame the tarantula sprouting from eye, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I could post these photos. I wanted this be awesome. It wasn&#x27;t : /</li>
    <li> I loved it and it works great!!! I have also tried  younique and for the price I will stick to this one!</li>
    <li> Really works lashes look a lot thicker</li>
    <li> This mascara is very clumpy and messy! I didn&#x27;t notice any change in length, rather just stiff short clumpy lashes. The little fibers are extremely messy and get all over and burn like crazy if they get in your eye. I tried really hard to like this, but honestly it was too messy for me I looked like I had hairy cheeks when I put it on! Such a let down!</li>
    <li> Not as good as younique</li>
    <li> Took over one month to receive this . And that&#x27;s probably because I wrote an angry letter. I paid $9 so i guess i get what i paid for, it made my eye lashes look longer after 2 coats and theres barley any fibers on the brush. Not what i expected personally so ill just go ahead and buy the original, but hopefully this info is useful for you ,ill provide a picture also.</li>
    <li> i just got mine today, I only got one set, I was expecting two of each mascara. and I didn&#x27;t im very disappointed, I waited so long because one of the sets was going to be a gift for a friend and that&#x27;s not going to happen now. what happened? 😟</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mainly giving 2 stars since I ordered the 4 tube set and only received 2.  This is similar to Younique but not the same.  The transplanting gel is thin, make sure you scrape the end of the wand in the tube to remove the excess or it will drip on your face.  You can&#x27;t beat the value on this, it&#x27;s better than paying $30 for younique even if I do have to do a couple coats to get the look I want.</li>
    <li> Definitely adds volume to your lashes, however the fibers get into my eyes and cause them to be extremely irritated.</li>
    <li> The product us good, I&#x27;m missing one set of tubes. Still haven&#x27;t received it.</li>
    <li> I was a bit scared to get this but I was really surprised how easy this was! It really did make my eye lashes so much bigger! Im happy I didnt spend the money to by the expensive bottles and I went with this!</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this again. I already have long lashes don&#x27;t need bits of the mascara falling on my skin through out the day.</li>
    <li> I love it just weird with the fibers it&#x27;s like putting wool on your eyes lol. But it makes my lashes pop</li>
    <li> I really like this I have never used the designer brand but this one works great for me</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Stays on a long time, and works as well as the expensive new brand sold by individuals...at 1/3 of the price.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 love Alpha 3D mascaras....two separate times. One was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; and the other was awful! Let me describe both:&lt;br /&gt;1. with the &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; one -- it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; but it wasn&#x27;t Younique (if that is what you are looking for)...for one, the gel wand is not as good as the Younique one. Not as much gel gets on the wand.  or maybe there is a different formulation...not sure.  But it was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. For those that have never tried younique&#x27;s version, you might like this, though...but just know you will like Younique better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. For the &amp;#34;awful&amp;#34; one: the fibers were all dried up. Half the fiber wand was empty when I took it out of the tube each time. I don&#x27;t know what was up with it. Seemed dry though. Lack of quality control, I guess. The #1 above and this one were pretty different. So buyer beware. This comes from China so who knows how long it hangs around on the boat before getting here. ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to say that there was fallout with the Love Alpha brand. I never experienced that with Younique one.</li>
    <li> After reading all about 3D fiber lash I decided to try the cheaper route (this) first. I LOVE IT! You really need to develop your own technique to apply it but once you get the knack..you will never go back to regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I have really short lashes that dont always want to hold a curl...so what I do is use my eyelash curler first...then quickly apply a ONE  coat of maybelline waterproof black...let it dry. The apply the hell...push &amp; wiggle the brush into your lashes so u coat them well. The take the fiber brush and dont paint them up and down like u do the gell.... kind of press it against your lashes...do as many layers as u want. 2 Is good for me. Sometimes I use a tooth pick to separate my lashes as I go. And usually end with maybelline.  PERFECT!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what they advertise, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried! I will say that sometimes the fibers get in your eye- it doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if your eyes are sensitive. Otherwise this is an amazing product- 10/10 will buy again</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the mascara.I followed the instructions given on the YouTube videos and it came out perfect my first time. I only used one coat . I didn&#x27;t get raccoon eyes nor did I get flakes in my eyes. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Watched an online video on proper technique to apply and have not had any problems with the application.  It&#x27;s definitely everything as described.  I bought this as a trial prior to dropping a bunch of money on temporary eyelashes from a salon.  I think after reading the risks of the other &amp; the cost I see no reason to go any further with my testing since this product works great. You have the option of just how long &amp; full you want your lashes to be for a major fraction of the cost and to clean off is as simple as a warm washcloth placed on lashes and then gently wiped as to not pull any of your lashes out. Definitely makes a difference in the appearance of your eyes after growing up with beautiful lashes only for them to become scarce with age.</li>
    <li> I had to do a lot of coats and the fibers came of on my face later.</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the $40 stuff!</li>
    <li> Liked the product wish it had more fibers in tube to last longer</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to compare this to a $30 product.  I got the same results.  The only reason not a 5 star is it does make a little mess, no big deal use a Q tip to wipe away the excess-  I have shared this with several co workers all have ordered</li>
    <li> Overall the product works great, the fibers on the other hand are only good for a handful of times then it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Would not order this again&lt;br /&gt;Totally generic</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings on this one. LOVE the effects of the fiber lash mascara! WOW! Really lengthens and makes lashes look much fuller, amazing! I read a lot of other reviews about clumping but I didn&#x27;t have this problem. HATED the fibers falling into my eyes. So irritating, itchy and almost painful. This lasted all day while I had the mascara on and for the 2 days following when I wasn&#x27;t wearing it. I may have an allergy to it though. I thought I had been really careful applying but some still managed to get into my eyes. I loved the effects so much that I&#x27;m going to bite the bullet and try younique, hopefully that will have the same effects without the irritation.</li>
    <li> So I normally use Younique&#x27;s 3D mascara which is pricey so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It goes on well and washes off easily. The problem with this is that there are only enough fibers in the tube for a couple of applications...the fibers also seem to fall off my lashes easier. I&#x27;m not that impressed with this mascara.</li>
    <li> Awesome.product. This mascara is easy to.apply and it.makes your lashes long and fuller. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Younique brand before and loved it. Just didn&#x27;t love the $30 price tag. This is a great substitute. While I don&#x27;t think I get quite as much length out of these fibers as I did with Younique, they still work wonders on my short lashes &amp; helps my eyes pop so much more than regular mascara. Won&#x27;t be spending the money on Younique again, for the price this is the way to go :)</li>
    <li> The microfiber a go everywhere or don&#x27;t come out of the tube. Just pay for the more expensive and get the real younique 3D fiber lashes.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to regular masacara! I had high expectations and this came through! I absolutely love this product. So glad I didn&#x27;t spend $30 on younique! Here&#x27;s a before and after!</li>
    <li> I purchased as an alternative to the Younique fiberlash mascara. It works well. I wear contact lenses, so the fuzzy pieces that are in fiber mascaras are always a concern for me since they wind up caught underneath my lens and gunk up in the corner of my eye. Luckily, I have not had that problem with this mascara. Only downside is that it takes a long time to arrive!</li>
    <li> Ordered 4 sets of tubes.  The fiber tubes in each one only lasted three usages each.  Rip off. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Works great. Happy with product and with the price.</li>
    <li> works just as good as the expensive version</li>
    <li> This sells for an AMAZING price, less than 6 bucks, which includes shipping from China! So be prepared to wait about a month. The advice in how to apply from amazon comments AND youtube videos are essential for success. It really is amazing how much thicker and longer your lashes look. However, you DO end up with little tiny fibers under your eyes, so you&#x27;ll need to check your mirror through the day. But I haven&#x27;t been putting a layer of transplanting gel over the top after I&#x27;m done applying the fibers. So maybe it&#x27;s a case of &amp;#34;if all else fails, read the directions.&amp;#34; Also I do have sensitive skin and generally wear hypoallergenic mascaras, so this stuff does make my eyes burn during the day. What we will do for vanity. So I&#x27;m going to try out the Physician&#x27;s Formula similar product and see if it works better for me. But you can&#x27;t beat this price. I will also compare how long this lasts, vs. the Physica&#x27;s Formula, and come back to update this review. Might also try the Younique brand. I only put 4 stars due to the eye burn. I&#x27;ve been putting a layer of my hypoallergenic mascara on first, and then adding the Love Alpha product over that, btw.</li>
    <li> Like with most of these fiber lash products, the fibers are hard to get out of the tube and onto your lashes.  Too much work!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I finally have my 20 year old eye lashes back and could not be happier!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, i will definitely buy this mascara again.</li>
    <li> Amazing fiber lashes for an even more amazing price!  I already have thick, long eyelashes so I wasn&#x27;t sure these would really make a difference...I was wrong!  They look incredible and very natural...LOVE</li>
    <li> After reading several negative reviews, I was a little hesitant about ordering love alpha natural fibre mascara. However, I am satisfied with the product! My directions were in English, not Chinese like many reviews stated. Also, some reviews complained that the product smelled horrible and was very messy. Neither of these are true! The mascara is so simple to apply and I have not had one issue with it falling all over my face as I apply. It&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Such a horrible product. The fibers get everywhere especially in my eyes. I was crying by the end of the day! Stupid..</li>
    <li> Mascara took about a month to receive,  I had forgotten about it lol. It works okay... it isn&#x27;t the best I have found but okay for the price.  If you let the fibers dry to the mascara and then really make sure to separate then they look okay. I feel like the fibers fall off during the day and irritate my eyes. Also, I would do your eyes before your base.  The little fibers stick to your face when  applying. They fall off the wand.</li>
    <li> arrived and put on and it made my eyes feel scratched , plus i thought this item was from the UK however it is from CHINA and i am returning.  Then i started getting emails in my email inbox from China, what the f@ck.  Pay more to get the real stuff not this fake a@$ sh*t.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Better than Younique 3D.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this! I read all the reviews and I was confident that it would be a great product. I was wrong when the fibers dried out after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> OMG. I don&#x27;t know where to start. I have always used regular mascara, so I can&#x27;t compare to other fiber lash mascaras. With the crazy expensive yonique brand being talked about often, I searched on amazon to see what was available. This attracted me with the animal print tubes (I&#x27;m obsessed). You can&#x27;t beat the price. And it works amazingly. The first time was a little hard, the fibers got in my eye (ouch), whether from inexperience or being a new full tube I&#x27;m not sure. I haven&#x27;t had a problem since. I HATE removing mascara, it&#x27;s a racoony mess. This literally rubs off without leaving  a trace. Shipping was faster than estimated. I&#x27;m never going back, I love this.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical but tried it and I love it. Flag I didn&#x27;t pay $35 for others &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; ones. This works just as great and best thing is removing it without masCara gunk all over you&#x27;re eyes!</li>
    <li> I liked it but my eyes were dying!</li>
    <li> I have used the Unique Fiber Eyelash kit before and the Love Alpha kit made my eyelashes longer then the Unique set!  Really works...looks thick and long.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product works so amazing !!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time buying it !&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this to everyone that wants long and full lashes without wearing fake ones !</li>
    <li> Both tubes of fiber were either dried up or empty. The bristles were missing and smashed, absolutley worthless!! The mascara flaked off my lashes just after a couple hours of wear. I am a contact wearer so it was very painful and aggravating to deal with. This will be the last time I order anything from directly from china. Since this is not my first problem when ordering from china. Nothing worse then waiting over a month just to be disappointed when you finally get it.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing, wish I could of gave it zero stars</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!!!! Holy smokes! I have bought a $30 set from sephora and it was no where near making my eyelashes look like this one does! Love love love!! I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara! Idk why people pay outrageous prices when this kind works just the same. Easy take off with a little warm water and lotion too. I suggest puting the gel on one eye then the fiber immediately after; more fibers seem to stick on the sooner you put them on after the gel.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this product.  I wear contacts and the black fibers fall into my eyes which is very uncomfortable.  Even if I apply plenty of the sealing gel, the tube fibers still wear off onto my lid or cheek as the day progresses.</li>
    <li> All of my friends have been blasting me with their lash parties lately, but my eyes are very sensitive to mascara. Even pricey ones! I was also afraid that with being in my late 40s I would look a little ridiculous. So I decided to try these first. I researched on Amazon &amp; read several reviews before I finally narrowing it down to this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE LOVE LOVE them! I have not had 1 single allergic reaction, I&#x27;m getting the same exact results my friends are paying for their $30++ brands! They are easy to apply &amp; they wash off very easy. They have not damaged my natural lashes at all. I&#x27;ve not had any issue with the fibers getting into my eyes as some people have had. I will definitely be ordering again! It was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this stuff really works! I used to use the Younique version, but I would cringe a little inside each time I had to place an order because after the price, plus shipping, it was a little pricey. I still would buy it though because I believe eyelashes really are important to bring out a person&#x27;s eyes. I started looking for a cheaper alternative and came across this. I was a little skeptical at first because of the price, but I thought it was worth a try and if it didn&#x27;t work then I wouldn&#x27;t be out much money. After comparing the two, I like this better than the Younique version. This one does take more coats to apply and get thicker looking lashes because I believe the gel is a little thinner than the Younique but because it&#x27;s thinner, the fibers don&#x27;t get as clumpy and it is easier to remove. I believe any negative reviews here are from Younique sellers because this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Worthless. The fibers get in your eyes and all over your face. Plus you can hardly even notice a difference once it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!! I can see the difference!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my lashes very full, long and beautiful, will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, but it never seems to last very long before it starts to get sticky. Good things it&#x27;s a good price so I can buy it quite often!</li>
    <li> This is worth the money.  I liked it base coat is a little thinner than some other brands I have tried ,but the end result was good. Just have to apply a little more mascara.  The fibers are great....</li>
    <li> First off I must say I am impressed by the sellers communication and follow through. My package was received within 2 weeks however, I only received 1 set. I emailed the seller to let them know I only received one set and they asked if I wanted a refund or them to send out the second set and I loved it so much I asked to have the second set. I received it with it wrapped and in another beautiful leopard case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the product. YES it makes a HUGE difference with my mascara game. I have thin and sparse eyelashes from having extensions that ripped out my real lashes. love that it does stay on. unless you have tried fiber lash mascara prior, you will have to practice and see what technique works best for you. I have found that when I apply the fibers to the tip to not try to add a great amount but gradual amounts so it doesn&#x27;t look clumpy but rather full. ALWAYS seal with the transplant gel. I use my favorite reg. mascara afterwards and viola, I have &amp;#34;falsies&amp;#34; for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles will last you a very long time. I have had one set last me a month and a half. I will continue to order this stuff. Also, head to youtube if you haven&#x27;t applied fiber lashes before.</li>
    <li> Great product at a amazing price! Really lengthens, curls and thickens lashes, gives a very professional appearance.&lt;br /&gt;#GetThatBeatLook</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I read tons of reviews before purchasing it, I saw a lot of good things, but also some complaints that it&#x27;s fussy, and time consuming. Personally - I put on a coat of my normal mascara, then one coat transplanting gel, one coat fiber, one more coat transplanting gel and I&#x27;m done. Takes maybe 1 minute longer than my normal routine. I have fairly long lashes to begin with and this just gives them some extra oomph. Makes them look like falsies. Does not look too clumpy or spidery. Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> A little clumpy till you figure out how to apply it, but my lashes have never looked longer!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! Made my lashes look like false ones, super long!!! Would recommend it to everyone, great price also can&#x27;t be beaten!!!</li>
    <li> Just recieved mines in the mail haven&#x27;t tried other brands so honestly can&#x27;t compare. Defiently would not reccomend for anyone who wears contacts. The fibers fall and completely got into my eyes. Really dont see a difference than when I curl my eyelashes and use my regular mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! It&#x27;s so easy to take off and even easier to remove!</li>
    <li> Pretty good staying power, though there&#x27;s a tendency to clump. Wore it 10+ hours, and only smeared a little because my skin is very oily and the weather here is very hot and humid. Good price, good value, would recommend!</li>
    <li> This mascara is AWEFUL! DOESN&#x27;T WORK N U GET THE FIBERS IN YOUR EYES! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Omg its really work!!!</li>
    <li> I hated this. Didn&#x27;t make my lashes Amy longer and flaked s into my eye.</li>
    <li> Get the REAL 3D Fiber Lashes from a Younique Presenter!  They&#x27;re amazing!  www.youniqueproducts.com/sarahkabbe</li>
    <li> Love love love this mascara, came early, works great, will order again.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I was very doubtful and suspicious when I purchased this product but since it was very inexpensive, I wasn&#x27;t too worried. I am totally amazed at how long and full my lashes look and how easy it is to use this product! I never leave product review comments but I felt it was necessary this time since I was so amazed at how awesome this is.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Slow shipping</li>
    <li> I think maybe I didn&#x27;t apply this quite right the first time around but my lashes weren&#x27;t as long as I had hoped. My regular mascara probably would have gotten me the same length and volume. Plus, the stupid fibers got all over my eyelid. Ay yi yi! Not really worth the hassle and extra time to your beauty routine unless it&#x27;s for a special occasion.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the name brand stuff they want you to pay 30.00 a tube for. I love this stuff!  Beautiful long dark lashes with no smudging. And at this price I plan to keep myself in stock...always!</li>
    <li> Works good better then just plain mascara overall good</li>
    <li> Fibers get into ur eyes and burns all day</li>
    <li> I love the way my lashes look now</li>
    <li> Great product! Cheaper than you unique don&#x27;t waste your money buy this! Me and my sister love it, I shared 2 tubes with her &amp; she&#x27;s amazed!</li>
    <li> Did great for my lashes. I have long lashes naturally, so I only need one coat on. Only problem I have is the first initial flakes, but doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> Sometimes when the fibers fall off, they get in my eyes (or specks of them) and it&#x27;s irritating. The fibers and the gel do help to make my lashes longer, and the material doesn&#x27;t smudge like some non-waterproof mascaras do, so that&#x27;s a nice thing. Lash Architect by Loreal which has since been discontinued, has been the main mascara to make my lashes the best looking. Nothing else since, so I keep searching....until then this mascara will continue to be used.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic buy! I have always had rather short, light and straight lashes. I tried the Younique product a few months ago, and was blown away! But it is pricey - 30 bucks, plus a hefty shipping fee (I am spoiled with free shipping here on Amazon). So I thought I would try this product since it was so inexpensive. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But it turned out to be VERY good! I feel the Younique product is a bit better, but for a fraction of the price, this is a fantastic alternative. My lashes look great and hold a curl all day long. And less than 15 bucks for TWO SETS? SOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Adds volume but the fibers shed all over your face throughout the day. Not worth it, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Horrible purchase.  The black &#x27;fibers&#x27; get all over the place including your face and in your eyes.  I looked gothic by the time I was done.  I&#x27;d return them if I could.  I don&#x27;t recommend this brand</li>
    <li> Be careful. The fibers can cause some irritation to the eyes. Cute leopard print but I don&#x27;t like the metallic/matte material it is made from. When the two tubes touch or rub against eachother it reminds me of scratching a chalkboard.</li>
    <li> So hard to figure out how to work and when I did, it looked like I had nothing on, will not purchase again! Waste of money :(</li>
    <li> This came faster then I was expecting, i ordered on the 5th of Jan and it came in to day &#x3D;) super happy with this product.  Will order again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I only gave this 2 stars for the little money I spent for it. I decided to try this product based off other people really liking it. Well it works very nicely I will say that which adds in to my 2 stars. However, I ended up breaking out in hives on my face and my eyes itched and got all puffy from the fibers. So I will no longer be using it and won&#x27;t be trying any others either. My niece(s) will be getting this and I&#x27;ll be just sticking to the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> They work well. Gave them 4 starts because the fibers fall off the wand, and were on my cheek and sink! I normally buy the Younique ones, but these are worth it for the money!</li>
    <li> So great for the price! I was nervous that it would be extremely hard to get off and it could not have been easier, it came right off with a baby wipe (I&#x27;m sure you could use a makeup remover wipe too.) It does take some practice to master them not being clumpy but with a little practice they&#x27;ll look AMAZING</li>
    <li> Really cool and innovative mascara!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again because just one, isn&#x27;t enough to me!! Arrived on time. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I wear contacts and the flakiness of the fibers really irritated my eyes. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in volume or lengthwhen I applied the gel and fibers. I won&#x27;t order this product again, wish I could return it!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for false lashes that look real, then this product is for you. The product comes with four tubes (two mascara&#x27;s and two fiber tubes). Which is a deal. It was a little tricky getting use to applying one coat and then another coat of the fiber. But you will get the hang of it. When I first wore it, the fibers would fall and collect under my eye, but I&#x27;ve since then learned a little clear mascara for a finishing touch and you are good to go. This product is just as good as the others out there and is half the price. I&#x27;ve added this little gem to my makeup box. I would highly recommend this product if you want those falsies that everyone craves.</li>
    <li> This product is comparable to younique mascara for half the price. I curl my lashes and put regular mascara first. I then put a layer of fibers (the smaller tube in case the instructions you get are in Chinese) followed by a coat of the sealing gel (large tube). They&#x27;re online videos that suggest blow drying them in between applications to curl your lashes more, get excess fibers off your faces, and dry gel sealant quicker. I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t that. I usually move onto applying another beauty product and then go back and use a lash metal stick (smaller in width than a Bobby pin but thicker than a needle) to separate any lashes that look a little clumpy. I then apply more fibers and gel.  I have NEVER had fibers on my face at all. It lasts ALL day and comes off with a cleansing cloth easily. I wear contacts and was worried about it falling in my eye and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all! I love it and just bought more...I can easily wear this without eyeliner on the top lid or applying shadow right above my eyelashes (my old techniques for making my eyelashes look thicker) . I&#x27;ve turned 42 and notice all kinds of things &amp;#34;changing&amp;#34; and having thin lashes made me look tired. I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and have not seen any problems with lashes (which I was worried about since they&#x27;re thinning) but I also never slept with this on and wear regular old mascara first on eyelashes (I think of it a clear coat before color which you do to keep nail from looking stained afterwards).</li>
    <li> These are great for the price!  Works as well as the expensive ones!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! And you get 2 sets...I have seen the same product go for $30 for one set and it does the exact same thing! This is my 2nd order!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I put on 1 coat of regular mascara, then use the gel and fibers. It looks amazing and you can see a huge difference. It lasts all&lt;br /&gt;Day with no flaking- I even wore it to a wedding and tears weren&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> works perfectly!!! my new favorite &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have recommended to all my family and friends. I know people who are selling and buying younique brand for 30$ while this product does the same technique for loads cheaper. I am in love with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Very good if you follow a video tutorial. So worth it too.</li>
    <li> Love them makes my eyes pop</li>
    <li> It is advertised as 2 sets equaling 4tubes but I only got one set. Not sure what happened here. Also my directions came in a different language so I&#x27;m not even sure Im using this product correctly.</li>
    <li> Although it took a very a long time to receive them they were GREAT!!! I have tried numerous brands and these are by far the best. The gel is so nice. Now if your like tarantula like eyelashes this isn&#x27;t the stuff you want!! well unless you want to layer it and clump it up! These are sooo natural looking it lengthens and thickens eyelashes soooo nicely! I loved it so much I had to give a set away to one of my coworkers...needless to say she too loved it!!</li>
    <li> I have had absolutely no problem putting it on what so ever! And I have never used microfiber gel mascara so I was pretty impressed how simple it was! I have 100% happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Works great..best mascara I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Two sets for $15? I was hesitant because I tried the Younique brand first and loved it. These are just as good (if not better!) I always swipe an extra coat of mascara on after I apply the fiber lashes to keep them in place. Great product, will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes red and itchy</li>
    <li> This mascara is trash.. I can&#x27;t even get my money back complete lost!</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s great and an awesome price!</li>
    <li> It works as described.</li>
    <li> I think this mascara is awesome for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive (namebrand) one, but I am overall very happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time to get used to applying it. And I tried a few different ways (with regular mascara first) to get the best look.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best effect is without regular mascara applied first. I like it just as it is.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the fibers getting into my eyes at all when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stick to regular mascara again (unless staying home) :)</li>
    <li> Not a great thing... Takes a long time and a bit of the skill to do good job with this mascara...</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive eye, don&#x27;t even bother.&lt;br /&gt;It is dangerous to have such small fibers falling into your eye and causes a lot of painful irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had to use it once to know ill never use it again. The Adhesive gel it kinda sticky, making your eyelashes clump together. Then the fiber lashes are supposed to attack using a wand applicator, which just dashes bits of fiber across your lashes and lower lid. The loose fibers fall into your eyes when you blink and don&#x27;t come out easier. It was painful and irritating.</li>
    <li> I have told several friends about this product, I love it</li>
    <li> I had no problems using the product.  It really made a difference in my lashes.</li>
    <li> The fiber tube was defective. I thought it was just the one tube but after opening both of the tubes - found out they were both defective! Both of the fiber tube brushes were difficult to pull out and none of the fibers were on the brushes!</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Have heavy upper lids &amp; mascara always left black on lid. This product is great makes lashes full everyone notices and no mascara on upper lids! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like it I rated it 4 stars because it does it&#x27;s job, the only thing I don&#x27;t really like is how it looks on my lashes, up close it looks like I have insect legs as my eyelashes lol, but I don&#x27;t really mind I try to fix it the best I can with mascara. You can choose to put mascara on or not I did because I like the dark eyelash look. They look pretty natural if you try to fix with mascara, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use for an everyday look just because it&#x27;s pretty time consuming, it takes about 5 mins out of your time when, your as picky as me lol, but when you love sleeping and have school those 5 minutes are critical 😂 Anyway, maybe I applied it wrong, I&#x27;m not sure. Ill probably get better after a few more times. Otherwise yes this does it&#x27;s job and I think I&#x27;ll order again (: the pictures show before and after with 3 coats of fiber lashes and 2 coats of mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I thought I bought Love Alpha and i received a chinese Flamingo product. Both tubes in both boxes are dry or empty. I thought i was doing it wrong but NOTHING comes out of those tubes... What a scam</li>
    <li> Omg this is just wonderful! I bought this thinking that I was wasting my money.  But, to my surprise this really worked! I will def order again!</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS BEFORE USING IT ON YOURSELF!!! With that being said, yes the directions are in a different language as to why I told you to go to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is by far the best mascara I have ever tried that has succeeded at giving me long, full, lushes lashes. I have tiny eye lashes and I wanted that pop. This is it ! People talk about &amp;#34;flaky fibers&amp;#34; yes you may get that from time to time. Make sure you apply the transplanting gel to CLEAN lashes - root to tip. Then quickly (before the gel dries) apply the fibers from the middle to end of lashes. (Try holding both gel and fibers in same hand to quickly change between the two tubes) Now to get the fibers to stay put and not fall off REAPPLY the transplanting gel. This will lock in those fibers. Repeat gel then fibers then gel as many times as you wish to get that long full lash look :)</li>
    <li> I used to have long full beautiful lashes. I developed a nervous habit of pulling them so needless to say they&#x27;re sparse and not as long as they used to be. This stuff really makes you look like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes! I applied multiple coats and made sure I applied the fibers as quickly as possible and had no shedding throughout the day. Great product for a great price! I will definitely purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I bought this couple months ago,  and is really good for the price worth the money,  good quality.</li>
    <li> If the description said this product came from China I would have never ordered it. Don&#x27;t support China.</li>
    <li> I would give this four stars but I only received two tubes. When I got my amazon package, the box was fine but the package that the tubes were in was broken and I only got two of them. That&#x27;s ridiculous when I paid for four tubes. Very unhappy with this, but the product is good and does what it says. I&#x27;d like half my money back because I only got half of what I paid for, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product from a different supplier and love it, when I recieved this item the fiber tubes weren&#x27;t closed, the threads on the tubes were stripped, the brushes were mangled and when I used it, flakes everywhere.  Save your money and order through someone you trust and know where they get their product.</li>
    <li> Wow. I am blown away by this product. I have a few notes for people considering buying it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There is a definite learning curve. The first time I applied the product, it didn&#x27;t look much different than my normal mascara. The second time (today) it looked amazing!! So much longer and fuller than normal. I learned a few things from my first application and was less hesitant when applying and it turned out great. I can only assume it will continue to improve as I get more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply 1 coat of regular mascara 1st. Concentrate on the base of your lashes to make them black and full near your skin. When you apply the gel and fibers, stay away from the base of your lashes. If you go too far down, you will get fibers in your eyes. Not only is this uncomfortable, it can&#x27;t be good for your eyes. Focus the gel and fibers on the middle and ends of your lashes to add length. Don&#x27;t be afraid to comb over and over through them to make sure your lashes don&#x27;t look clumpy or like spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t worry about making a bit of a mess. Loose fibers on your skin can be brushed off and gel can be removed with a q-tip, much like traditional mascara. I applied my regular makeup first, made a huge mess all around my eyes with gel and fibers (but my lashes looked pretty) then removed all the mess without ruining the rest of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give 4 stars is that in the picture, it comes with a case, and I only received 4 tubes, no case. I really don&#x27;t need a case, I just think they should remove the picture with a case if it isn&#x27;t included.</li>
    <li> love! perfect product if you just aren&#x27;t sure about the 3d fiber yet and not comfortable spending 30+ on a item you dont even know you will like! Would defiantly buy again</li>
    <li> Ok, I was skeptical ESPECIALLY when the offer was 2 sets for less than $9.00. But I bought it ( I was going to order a similar product I saw advertised on TV for much more). And it did make my short, sparse lashes fuller! I applied one coat, then the sealer. Waited a few minutes, then applied a second coat/sealer. The instructions aren&#x27;t in English, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to buy eye makeup remover to take off the mascara-but I tried a baby wipe and that seemed to work ( and to be sure, I used a little store brand baby wash applied to a baby wipe to remove the rest)&lt;br /&gt;The package is pretty too. Very good deal!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product before and I really liked it, although it didn&#x27;t come in the carrying case from this Seller, the product was the same and offered the same effect! My lashes are noticeably darker and longer when I wear it. I like it better than regular mascara. I even ordered one for my daughter because of the great price!</li>
    <li> AWESOME  mascara even better price!  It&#x27;s not hard to apply.  WORKS GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I tried Youique first and it was good but this stuff is the same but way cheaper!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It works great! I just wish it lasted longer</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to purchase but I&#x27;m glad I took the leap of faith. The product drastically enhances your lashes. Definitely makes them appear longer. It is not as time consuming as some reviews make it seem. It can get a bit bulky if you don&#x27;t put it on carefully. I biggest complaint is it makes my lashes so long that my lashes touch the top of my eye lids and the wet mascara blends into my eye shadow. Haha. This product works!</li>
    <li> Yes,I like my&amp;#34; love alpha&amp;#34; product..i would definitely order it again when I,m out .Great affordable price !</li>
    <li> This mascara is better than expected.  Now I have to order more, because my daughter wants it and so does my 74 year old mother.  My lashes have never looked so long.  My daughter said its a miricle because I have really short lashes.  Unbelievable!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an interesting product.  I don&#x27;t use that often as the fibers get in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Loved the way my eyes looked but ran out of the fibers after the second use!</li>
    <li> This product was dried out when I received it. Not sure where it shipped from but it obviously sat in a warehouse for years! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> YES YES YES!!! Forget the overpriced $29 Younique stuff, this is the exact same product.... except you get twice the amount of tubes, and save nearly $25. If you think buying the Younique stuff is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;... jokes on you, my friend.</li>
    <li> Loooooove this product!  And for the price!! Buy one get one free is amaxing. I kept one set and gave the other to my mom. She loves also. Im a pro at these now and everyone loves my lashes :)</li>
    <li> This product is everything I expected! It does have some fibers that get into eyes, but all of the products I have tried like this have, they didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all however, and I am a contact wearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is quick and easy and it did extend my lashes quite a bit making them bolder than with mascara alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the mascara and fibers 3 times to the top and once to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have problems with them flaking off at all, in fact once I put on the last coat of mascara they lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing off was a synch, I did get some fibers in my eyes, but after blinking they are out.. I have very tough eyes. The washing off was way easier than other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product, but I only give it 4 stars because it probably wouldn&#x27;t work well for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Received my package today and could not wait to get home and try it out. The packaging plastic the tubes come in was ripped slightly but all of the tube are sealed separate so that was a plus. My transplanting gel was not dried out at all. I can notice a change in length and thickness in my lashes and if you curl your lashes before application, you get amazing results. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and I will be giving a set to my mother to try out. Can&#x27;t wait to order some more. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> It DID make my lashes longer, but the fibers fell off all over my eyes and face throughout the day. Nothing like small black flecks all over your face to create the perfect look :(</li>
    <li> I was pretty surprised with this product.  I really like how easy it is to use.  However, what I found really weird was that the item description states that there should be 4 tubes, but I only received two tubes.  When it was packaged, it looked like the items may have fallen out of its package since the bottom looked like it ripped open.  However, upon inspection of the box, I still couldn&#x27;t find the missing tubes.  It is unfortunate since I really ended up liking the product.</li>
    <li> Love this. Took a few tries to figure out how to best apply it but I love it! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My eyelashes really do get crazy long with this!! With two applications, I could see results. I was messing around one time and my eyelashes grew around 1.5 cm? I used approximately 9 coats. I hope that gives an idea of the use. I do have to express that the natural fiber does get on your face during usage but a simple brush over your face should solve that easy. I love this product so much, I think I&#x27;m already out of the natural fiber but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because I over used it or if the product doesn&#x27;t come with a lot. Even if it&#x27;s the latter issue, I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s totally worth the price! FYI: It&#x27;s a LOONNNG shipping time but I still recommend getting the product. Just plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Younique but haven&#x27;t used it yet! Will post a comparison when I get the chance!</li>
    <li> it came before the expected delivery date, and it was east to apply. Directions do come in another language but youtube is your friend if you need help applying. Just like any other fiber mascara be careful of the fall out!  I was satisfied with this product and you get 2 sets as well!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really happy with this product. Whenever I put it on, the little fiber pieces fall into my eyes and irritates my eyes. Also, by the end of the day majority of it is wiped off or has fallen into my eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice at first but the fiber always came out little by little ...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t over do it or it looks bad. But I enjoyed this and it&#x27;s nice for beginners like me</li>
    <li> TOTALLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED THE LITTLE FIBERS FALL ALL OVER MY FACE WHILE APPLING IT AND IF IT FALLS INTO MY EYE BURNS LIKE HELL. WILL STICK TO MY REGULAR MASCARA.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara out of curiosity and to compare it to my younique fiber mascara. I love my Younique mascara but had a hard time dealing with the expensive cost.  So i experimented with the 2 fiber lash mascaras, placing my $30 younique on one eye and my $5 Love Alpha and the other eye. I noticed younique did fill in my lashes a tiny bit more than alpha but not enough for anyone else to notice. My family and friends could not tell the difference.  I also will note that it took 1 extra coat for Alpha to give me the same results as Younique. These are small cons that don&#x27;t affect my overall review that for the price difference I will definitely repurchase Love Alpha. It was an overall great purchase.</li>
    <li> The gel part I lik. The fiber part makes more of a mess after 2 or 3 times of application</li>
    <li> The directions seem easy enough, however when you actually apply it, the fibers do not stay in place and you have fibers all over your cheeks and in your eyes. I tried a dozen times and every time it came out the same. Needless to say I went back to wearing false lashes.</li>
    <li> still trying to learn how to use/apply</li>
    <li> Makes lashes look amazing and full!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;So heartbreaking! My eyelashes look wonderful but! ☝ my eyes burn when I&#x27;m taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve never had this problem so I know it&#x27;s not my makeup remover or me).</li>
    <li> I have tried Younique 3d fiber lashes and these are almost exactly the same. And you get two sets for $14. I hate putting fake lashes on (more because I lack the skill to) and this makes my eye lashes go on for miles. amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> Just as good as younique but way better price</li>
    <li> Excellent Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> Never heard of 3D fiber lashes ...seen a post about &amp;#34;younique&amp;#34;...I thought WOW that&#x27;s pricey, did some searching came across these and thought why not??...got it tried it........LOVE IT!!!!!...had no problem with it flaking ..felt soft and not stiff ...came off very nice ..so I guess I cant compare it to younique never tried it ....but I say for price difference this is AWESOME and I get twice as much!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s awesome for the price. I was afraid it was going to be a long and difficult application but it was so quick and easy! I don&#x27;t think I will go back to regular mascara. It came with 2 sets! It really makes my lashes look super long and full!</li>
    <li> Im allergic to adhesive glue, so fake lashes are a no go for me. I love this product !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the clumpy eyelash look and this is what you will get with this mascara. It did give me length but also gave me spider lashes.</li>
    <li> Just like the more expensive brand!!! I&#x27;ve had the younique fiber lashes...this is precisely the same thing. People complaining about the fibers falling off are not applying them while the gel coat is still wet. It&#x27;s not a 10 minute process. Throw on the gel, once through with the lash comb if you wish and then put on the fibers. Works perfect! I wear contacts and have put this on the last 2 days with ZERO irritation or fibers in my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have to say, as an avid eye lash wearing I was skeptical. After watching youtube videos, seeing posts on instagram AND my sister in law suggesting this product to me - I finally gave it a whirl and ordered this. (she swore by it! and her eye lashes looked fantastic!) Another bonus was the whole get two sets for the price of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got my package less than a week later and eagerly tried the new fiber 3D lashes I was hearing so much raving about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down - great product and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-any person can use this item, no skills are required and practice is not needed, unlike when I do strip or individual lashes - there was a lot of practice required. (literally if you can apply mascara - that&#x27;s all you need)&lt;br /&gt;- its not heavy, you literally don&#x27;t feel anything heavier than mascara, which I have on with the product, so technically I feel nothing from this product directly.&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I was nervous about getting the small fuzzy fibers in my eyes, well my fear came true! Some of the fibers went into my eye, before I sealed it (I was blinking!) and it didn&#x27;t hurt, in fact a real lash hurts way more!&lt;br /&gt;- the outcome is not so dramatic it looks fake, it looks like I have thick, voluminous and long heatlhy eye lashes and I love it! (FYI, I do three layers. gel-fiber-gel, gel-fiber-gel, gel-fiber-gel)&lt;br /&gt;- lastly - removal. It really is as simple as warm water and soap. I am always gentle with my eye lashes, but the product literally came off, as if it were diluted from water. I did have minor &#x27;gunk&#x27; left on my eyelashes when I got out of the shower, but this was easily removed with my make up remover wipes and eyelash comb WITHOUT any loss of my real lashes!!! For someone who wears extensions or strips etc you know how often that happens and how important it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had 6 stars to give! Great buy, and really its much cheaper than some of its competitors. I will be a long time returning customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not that impressed with this.  Mostly because the fibers flake off easily and get into my eye.  I would NOT recommend for contact lens wearers.  The product does provide length but not volume.  I&#x27;ll stick with Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and just as good as Younique. If black fibers are falling on your face during the day, you are not using enough transplanting gel. I am so excited to have found this.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied I love the results of the mascara it was very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The item came as described shipping was way faster than I expected and the seller an excellent communication with me.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you why I gave this product a 5 star rating. First of all it&#x27;s double the product for a good price. Who doesn&#x27;t love that? You do get four tubes in total, two gel ones and two fiber ones. Now, let me explain my situation... I have short, thin eye lashes. I have tried lots of mascara products who promise that 80-90% increase with two weeks of usage. PLEASE! What false advertisement. I was always that helpless customer who believed in those fancy commercials and fancy ads. Well, eventually, I gave up on those regular retail mascaras, Covergirl, Maybelline, Rimmel London, and moved towards fancier brands. By fancier, I mean Lancome. I&#x27;ve always loved their products and decided to purchase their mascara next. With that hefty price tag, 30-35 dollars a tube, I thought &amp;#34;hmmm this will surely work&amp;#34;. Boy, was I wrong with that too. I had to apply about three coats of the stuff to even make my eyelashes curl. The brush itself dried out within a month of use. I was disappointed in this expensive product. I gave up on Lancome after spending quite the money on different mascara types. So what options did I have left? A light-bulb turned on and Amazon popped in my head. I did the basic &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; search and found lot&#x27;s of options. After about an hour of searching, I came across this product. I decided to give it a try based off of the wonderful reviews. It arrived on time and I was excited to try it on. Woah! and I mean Woah! What an improvement. With the first coat I saw extended curled lashes, and with the fibers as the second coat, ladies, I finally had girly eyelashes. Curled, thick, extended eyelashes. I honestly, couldn&#x27;t believe it. It takes some getting used to, as the fibers tend to fall and get in your eyes, but it&#x27;s all worth it. I work full time, in front of a computer so the light stresses my make up, but I can say, when I get home at the end of the night... my eye lashes look as fly as ever!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I like the fiber lashes maybe after I use them a few more times</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars and here&#x27;s why: 1) very inexpensive 2) product enhanced my small minute lashes dramatically! 3) easy to use!!&lt;br /&gt;The key is to apply using a small mirror and leaning your head down when applying fibers. I also used 1 coat of mascara before using the gel and fibers. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> People say this is better than the Younique 3D mascara.....it&#x27;s not! It&#x27;s like the tubes are empty. In this case you get what you pay for. I love the Younique product and will continue to pay the thirty bucks for it. This stuff sucked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very curious about these fiber mascara products many people are using. I purchased these after reading reviews and for the price I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose! I wish they came boxed, but I received two sets of the transplanting gel and natural fibers. The packaging is really cute ! When I first used this I was really unhappy with my end result.. I tried it again the next day after reading some tips and I was impressed! My lashes definitely were longer and thicker and I got a few compliments on them :) the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is the fibers tend to fall a little through out the day on your face.. the only down side! I&#x27;m going to keep playing with these, maybe do more transplanting gel after the fibers ... all in all pleased with these especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with this !!! content://media/external/file/3955</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to. I get the same results of those other overpriced products that will charge  you an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> This mascara takes extra time to apply correctly, which was the biggest downfall for me. So for everyday wear it isn&#x27;t practical. I liked how it looks, once I figured out how to put it on. Takes some practice! Like the product, but not in love.</li>
    <li> I love this. Like where have you been all my life and I&#x27;m mad that I just found you &amp;#34;love this&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Works great and pretty easy to apply, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Dries out kind of  fast but because of the cost being so cheap I don&#x27;t mind!</li>
    <li> OMG! I believe this not gonna work, but yessss!! It works! The smells sucks, but the product its good. My lashes looks really long and beautiful. No more fake lashes for me ;)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product. .my lashes are amazing. .they are short but not with this product added. .</li>
    <li> This is just as good as false eyelashes...and does not irritate my sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> dont waste your money on this. go buy younique 3d mascara instead</li>
    <li> Life changing! Just have to be careful not to get those little fibers in your eye....takes  practice.</li>
    <li> I received only 3 tubes...</li>
    <li> Love love this mascara already ordered more</li>
    <li> I love it does my lashes wonders!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this mascara. I will continue to purchase it, I have made it part of my daily routine of makeup, even on my non makeup days I use this mascara.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are amazing.  They make my lashes look a lot fuller and longer.  My friend got the younique for almost $40.  This one didn&#x27;t come with the case, but the case is too bulky for me to put in a travel makeup bag, so I don&#x27;t care if I have the case or not.&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple of different mascaras in the past that had the fiber in the mascara, and they were pretty good, but they dried up super quickly.  I am glad someone finally thought to do this, but keep them in separate tubes, so they don&#x27;t dry out and clump up.&lt;br /&gt;I really hate putting falsies on, so I will probably be ordering these for quite some time.  Make sure you put a decent amount of the gel on, so it sets and the fibers don&#x27;t fly everywhere.  I experienced more fallout from the younique one than this one.  Very pleased - normally when I cheap out on something it works against me, glad this time it worked out!</li>
    <li> It did make my lashes look way longer, but it takes a little bit to get use to how to apply it. I put that it causes irritation only because if you don&#x27;t know how to apply it correctly the fibers can get into your eyes and cause them to water. But after the first couple of times I looked up a video on youtube and followed those instruction and it has been awesome ever since. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to regular mascara after trying this. My lashes look as good if not better then my friends who buy the expensive Younique mascara, so I&#x27;m very happy to have a good quality product at a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> not a fan of this bran I have had better quality store brand fiber lash</li>
    <li> I would buy again, but the product in the smaller wand applicator has the tendency to flake off onto your face during the day.  I had some in my eye too...but it really does lengthen and thicken your lashes.</li>
    <li> fiber lashes are awesome. it&#x27;s easy to use and it definitely works. Apply the gel first and the fiber second. apply it as many times as you need.it&#x27;s just that easy.</li>
    <li> As a prior Younique 3D fiber lash user I fell in LOVE with Youniques 3D lash mascara but lets be honest it is pricey so I thought I would give a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; version a try and I am completely disappointed with the effectiveness of Love alphas fiber mascara. The gel gave my eyes a burning sensation when I got it near my eye when applying to lashes and the fibers are pretty much non existent. I read other good reviews and I can&#x27;t believe I listened to them and purchased this. I will stick with Younique, because in the end it is all about quality NOT quantity!!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I&#x27;ll never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about using a &#x27;knock off&amp;#34; for younique because of quality purposes (you get what you pay for) blah blah blah. I am EXTREMELY pleased with the product, does exactly what younique 3d does for a third of the cost and you get a double set for a friend.  Also just an FYI order from Daphne Beauty in the US will ship fast and free 2 day shipping (i got mine in one day). I wear makeup religiously and it lasts all day my husband laughs because i couldn&#x27;t stop blinking dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: inexpensive, works, nice bristles, cute packaging, 2 for 1.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: runs a lil, didn&#x27;t come with case like the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps i cant stop fluttering my lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my lashes look amazing. Will definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> For starters, I&#x27;m a professionally trained make-up artist.  Even though I&#x27;m now in the car biz (Can we say chuck-Ching?) I feel I still owe my fellow Amazon shoppers a pro&#x27;s experience with this products.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m another customer shopping for a less expensive version of Younique&#x27;s Moonstruck.  (FYI - Cinema Secrets carries a fiber mascara they sell for $60!)  Most of the previous reviews were positive, so I bought it.  I was thrilled to find this product for the price but after a few uses, it is obviously a lesser quality on a few points.  First, I noticed it immediately shedding fiber even after I used the sealing coat of gel.  One reviewer said we would need to use a bit more gel which didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.  What is more irritating is the melting onto the bottom of my eyes like a cheap mascara.  I do have oily skin and am extra careful to keep my under eyes from looking like a raccoon.  So much so that I don&#x27;t even wear mascara on my lower lashes!  The Moonstruck stays fresh for a long time like a good quality mascara.  I have some elf clear mascara that I need to use over this product to keep it clean.  I think the most irritating negative with this product is with the fiber tube.  If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would think it was a brand new disposable mascara brush!  The neck is so tight that when I pull it out, there is only fiber on the tip of the wand.  Fiber is coming out but it takes about 5 dips to get a decent amount and then the gel starts to dry.  Hence the fibers on your face not sticking to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;  In all fairness, this could be a fluke with this particular tube, so I gave it two stars.  I also am able to make it work so it&#x27;s not a total loss.  I&#x27;m hoping the second kit will provide better results because I think it&#x27;s a fantastic product and I would love to be a repeat customer for this price.  We will see...</li>
    <li> The setting gel doesn&#x27;t really hold the fibers in and they get in your eyes. It&#x27;s quite itchy and irritates your eyes quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Bunch of crap. Fibers do not come off the wand very good at all. Gel tube is basically dry. Rip off. Rip Off</li>
    <li> Love love this product shipped fast</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about the mascara but I continue to use the fiber with my staple cover girl lash blast</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a co-worker.  I watched her put it on her very short lashes and saw such an improvement in the length &amp; thickness.  I don&#x27;t really have an issue with length, but mine are blonde &amp; sparse.  So I wanted to give it a try.  Yes, I do like it!  It doesn&#x27;t smear like the usual mascara and the more you layer it, the thicker/longer the lashes will appear. It stays on better than waterproof mascara too. So when my allergy eyes are itchy &amp; watery this doesn&#x27;t wind up under them.  I would have given it 5 stars but the fibers do flake just a little, especially a new tube as there is excess.  I just use a powder brush and lightly brush away the excess fibers from around my eyes. You have to be careful if wearing contacts not to get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Easy to use and great results. I recommend this product to anyone looking for long, luscious lashes!</li>
    <li> This was terrible. Not only did it leave my eyes red and sore but it did not provide the promised length and was terribly dried out in the tube.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Better than expected. Easy to use no fuss. Many compliments on great lashes!</li>
    <li> This works amazingly! My eyelashes get longer with this way better than any mascara I&#x27;ve tried. The fibers can sometimes irritate your eyes though.</li>
    <li> Received a total of 4 tubes but two of them were completely  empty.. A little  disappointed  as I was ready to see ifit really  worked.. sent bk for full refund</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the party brand. For best results, apply as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Apply a thin coat of your regular mascara (powder too if you tend to have runny mascara during the day). Be sure to separate your lashes as you normally do. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;Do only one eye at a time. Apply adhesive (this smells like glue, chemical like, and although I have had no problems, I am very careful about not letting the tip have a glob on it that could get into my eye. I also use my normal mascara to thicken up the base of my lashes, and use this more for the middle and ends.)&lt;br /&gt;Apply lashes.  Then apply adhesive again (seal in the coat of the lashes.)&lt;br /&gt;Do the other eye...check them out...decide if you need/want another coat. Repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do the lower lashes, but I find them too babydoll looking (falsies), which doesn&#x27;t work for the workday.&lt;br /&gt;You can also play.  For example, I am attentive about the outer tops/bottom lashes, and I tend to do a second or third coat just on them to make them fan out...but only the last 1/5 of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, practice. Each time you will get better...oh, and keep a brush from an old mascara, clean well, and use to help separate/clean up when you accidentally get a big clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 4 different versions of this by different manufacturers and will be giving the same post/review to all because in my opinion they all do the same job well...HOWEVER...I gave this one 5-stars versus the others 4 because it is the least chemically smelling to me (or at least the smell dissipated the fastest, and I&#x27;ve like the results from day 1). Really it just takes a little patience and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I work out most evenings and sweat well and my eyes are still fine. I do use a makeup pad remover like Almay to remove gently at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was running low on another brand and this one was (2) sets for a lower price. I am really pleased with this brand. The gel is a bit more glue/string like than I would like but now that I have used it a few time I got the hang out it, it really isn&#x27;t an issue. I am a contact lense wearer and I have not had an issue with this brand irritating my eyes. To apply it, I use the following steps and it works out well for me.&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply (1) coat of a regular cheapy mascara&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the transplanting gel on top of that&lt;br /&gt;3. While the gel is still wet apply the transplanting fibers.&lt;br /&gt;4. Let the fibers and the gel dry for about a minute and then apply another coat of the transplanting gel on top of that.&lt;br /&gt;5. If you don&#x27;t feel your lashes are as full or long as you would like, apply another coat of the fibers, let dry for a minute and then add another coat of transplanting gel.&lt;br /&gt;6. Repeat on the other eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the above steps really help keep the fiber fall out to a minimum. The other trick I have is, keep your eye slightly closed when applying the fibers. If you have your eyes wide open, you will probably get some fibers in your eye. The mascara lasts all day and I don&#x27;t have to touch up. It&#x27;s easily removed with an eye make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product and I have a new go to brand for fiber mascaras.</li>
    <li> Hmm first time using one of these, I already have long eyelashes. It works good, not great. Sometimes the fibers get stuck inside my eyes, so it bothers, but once it has been settle my lashes look awesome. :) Also, cant top the price for two. I gave one to my friend.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. Complete waste of money. Does not work at all. I&#x27;m going back to younique.  I would give this no stars if it let me</li>
    <li> I have used Younique forever then I found this product the ingredients are the same the only difference I would say is the transplant Gel is not as black .. But that&#x27;s okay I just use my reg mascara and that&#x27;s what Younique wants you to do any way  2 sets for $15 compared to $37 for 1 set with S &amp; H   I Love this all my friends who used Younique are using this now :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am on my 3rd set and will always have some on hand. I&#x27;ve given it to my daughter, niece, mom and sister and they like it as well. It does only last for about 3 months before starting to seize up-dry up a bit, but at this price, that is comparable to drug store mascaras and still seems like a good deal.  the key to application is to look down into a mirror, not straight ahead so you will have less fiber fall out. I wear contact lenses and have never had any problems with the fibers in that regard, but I do have allergies and when my allergies act up, the fibers can be a bit irritating to my eyes. You also MUST end the application with a final coat of the gel transplanting mascara or the fibers will not be sealed to the lash. For extra security I prefer to add a coat of waterproof mascara on top of that as well...it really seals down the fibers onto the lash and they don&#x27;t migrate or fallout whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I get better results using my drugstore mascara than this such a waste.</li>
    <li> I loved it , I have really small eye lashes and with this 3d mascara my eye lashes look long and full</li>
    <li> very great product! fibers only get in your eyes if not being used properly but as for that its perfect. It also came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I personally have tried the Younique 3D Fiber lash and have had some fun with it, but it is Pricey. My step daughter is 17 and wears her eye makeup very cute, so I thought Id buy this to give her as a gift. My purchase included 2 sets, so I decided to give this brand a try before I gave it to her. Personally, I think it works almost just as good as the other fiber lash mascara. The only thing I noticed was the Fiber Lashes didnt seem to come out as thick as the other brand which called for more applications. Could have been the tube I tried as well. Regardless, this was a great deal and does better than regular mascara or fake eye lashes any day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I jhave suffered for years with plucked out lashes. Now I have long beautiful, full lashes and I have stopped plucking them. Joy!</li>
    <li> Great for lengthening and volume, however the fibers fall in your eyes and can be very irritating.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed.  Not what I expected at all. My regular old fashion mascara is much better.</li>
    <li> Love this. . Great deal. . Works as it states. . Delivered on time. .love it.. can&#x27;t see my self using regular mascara.. and awesome deal.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!! Her eye lashes literally double in size. The price is great and it comes off easily with make up remover. (It&#x27;s NOT waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t run either, just disappears.)</li>
    <li> Started wearing this mascara in November and I absolutely love it! My eyelashes look fuller and longer. Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> New to the fiber lashes so of course I have a small complaint. The fibers keep falling into my eyes and I can only assume I am doing something wrong. I say buy it!</li>
    <li> This will be fine for someone that already has long lashes. Not even close to the quality of younique 3d lashes</li>
    <li> I brought this product for some friends of mines and they loved it. It was a good product at a good price. Neither one of them have a lot of eyelashes but when they applied the gel and fiber, their eye really stood out.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to be the original formulation.  My lashes weren&#x27;t as thick with this item as previous Love Alpha brand purchased at a boutique.</li>
    <li> love wearing this mascara... everytime I wear the gel &amp; fiber Mascara my daughter thinks that I have on fake eyelashes!!!! A must have for those of us who dont have the time to run to a shop for fake eyelashes everytime we got out.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Younique,  and then I tried this. I honestly like this better. Easier to remove. And it&#x27;s just as good or even better than Younique. I will keep coming back for this. And the price is almost too good, so I expected it to be bat crap. But it was awesome. I recommend to all the ladies I know. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Its okay, not the best mascara i have ever used. But the price is good for two sets</li>
    <li> In love my lashes look so good and I don&#x27;t worry about my natural lashes getting damaged</li>
    <li> Better than the expensive stuff</li>
    <li> This is not the right name of the item, its a weird cheap brand from china named Flamingo.. So dissapointed of the product. WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I was Disappointed, the mascar was dried out. I put it on my lashes it would fall off on to my face</li>
    <li> just got this yesterday and used it this morning with no practice session.  I am IN LOVE!  I have the most luxurious lashes this morning.  No mess, no fibers falling off like some other reviews said.  When I bought it after reading some of the reviews I thought what the hell .. its only $15.  Ive wasted more than that on products I&#x27;ve purchased in store.  I am so happy with this mascara.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> This mascara is AMAZING! It really does look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, but in a good way, not a trashy way. I have been through nearly every type of drug store mascara, and while I cab get by with covergirl, this will be my new go to mascara for sure. I did have some issues with the fibers falling on my cheeks throughout the day so the next time I wore it, I did an extra coat if the gel to lock it in. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends and family! Plus you get two sets of this, so when you think about it, it costs roughly the same as a drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> Was really excited to recieve it. And it came in the mail earlier than I expected. It really does ir job...makes your lashes look likw your wearing a falsie. The only thing is, the fibers from the lashes keep on falling/dusting off which makes my eyes itchy and red. Other than that, I think it&#x27;s a good product. Maybe I should learn to apply it the right way next time.</li>
    <li> Not as great as I was expecting. I thought I would get more length with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried 3dascara before but this stuff is great. Goes on wonderfully and stays on. 👏👏👏</li>
    <li> workd as expected. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other brands of this type of mascara but for the price I thought this one worked great. I gave the second set to my daugther and she liked it too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t extend my lashes as long as I thought it would. But good product overall.</li>
    <li> I have really short + thin eyelashes and this product actually worked! Made my eyelashes look longer and fuller. . . Bye bye fake eyelashes lol</li>
    <li> Disappointed in product clumps and got some in my eye which very much irritated it.</li>
    <li> This product is great especially when used with a eyelash curler first</li>
    <li> Just amazing but I&#x27;d you don&#x27;t like to spent more time on your lashes this wont be for you because you will not get good result of one coat or two</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t too bad, it does make my lashes look fuller. The reason for 2 stars is that there are hardly any fibers and the packages aren&#x27;t consistent. They are also expired and were delivered expired. They all expired on 12&#x60;31&#x60;2014, but were delivered in 2015. They&#x27;re still usable, but I&#x27;m assuming that is the reason for the low price along with the low quality on the fibers. It&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper than the Younique brand I&#x27;ve seen a lot of, but having tried both, the Younique brand is much better. It has way more fibers and made my eyelashes longer and thicker than this brand. But this brand was so cheap, I couldn&#x27;t resist and I now now why it is so cheap. The quality is poor and they are expired!! Good luck if you order it. I may try it again and hope for the best or more on to a different cheaper brand of fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and immediately put it on! It&#x27;s wonderful and easy to use!! Definitely buying more and giving as gifts!</li>
    <li> I only received one tube. Which was pretty much useless with out the transplantation gel. Horrible do not buy from here.</li>
    <li> Not great!  I didn&#x27;t notice my lashes looking as lush as Younique:-(</li>
    <li> Have Eyelash Extensions?&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t, this product is worth the try. Ive been using a different brand that is basically the same darn thing as this product. Works just like any of the other 3D FIBER MASCARA&#x27;S.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me try it for yourself. Its awesome stuff. Plus i have extentions and this product is safe to use on them.</li>
    <li> Writing this based on mine and my mom&#x27;s experience. We got these because we have thin lashes and hoped this could help.&lt;br /&gt;The price is okay, but it took forever to get here. Then when I first used it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I had to take ten or more minutes on my lashes alone to get desired results. My mom had the same issue. She didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference. The fibers are kind of a pain. You have to be super careful to not blink and get it in your eye or drop some because they smear. I think getting some nice mascara gets me the same results that this thing does. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it. However, the price isn&#x27;t too bad for it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best thing since sliced bread... I only wear mascara no other makeup and it&#x27;s nice to finally have found THE ONE.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something similar to Younique Fiber Lash, this is it. The 3D Fiber Lash gives my lashes more volume, but if you&#x27;re just looking for length without the steep price tag, this is it! For added volume, I just add a coat of my regular mascara at the end. This also kind of &amp;#34;locks it in.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and am still happy with it.</li>
    <li> I own the other as well as this knock off and It works the same! I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The product took forever to arrive, to the point I forgot I ordered it. It is not simple to apply, and you have to repeat the 2 steps (for me it was at least 2x&#x27;s on each eye) to get the desired look. There is the danger of the fibers falling into your eye, as well as the hassle of them falling onto your already made up face, and having to possibly clean up and redo that.  I also didn&#x27;t expect the fibers to be a dry-ish product, but now understand how they work. While I think I got my $$ worth since I received 2 of each for a total of 4 tubes, I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment.  It turned out to be a gooey, clumpy mess.  Not happy at all</li>
    <li> Love it after you get the hang of it</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with my package, the mascara was thick and applied smoothly. The fiber brush was very sparse in application. Just wish the fiber brush was full, so the mascara would make your lashes look fuller. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love how it gives me the same volume and full look as the unique for a lot less money.. Would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Way cheaper than the other brands, took a while to get but what a difference!!! Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Works well for the first few applications. I used it a total of 5 times maybe if that and the fiber lash tube seems to be empty! Not worth it for the amount of time I had to wait to receive this.</li>
    <li> This don&#x27;t work I have been using it for 1 month and I don&#x27;t see a diffrent not a bit ....</li>
    <li> Does NOT work good like Younique 3d fiber lashes! Although it is very similar, it&#x27;s definitely not the quality of Younique (and no, I&#x27;m not a representative of Younique) just someone who tried their mascara &amp; was looking for a cheaper priced product that worked the same. Anyway, like I said the products are similar, but the Love Alpha transplanting gel has a strange smell to it and is much thinner than Youniques. The fibers seemed to be the same, but the brushes on both the transplanting get and the fibers are very different from Youniques, which doesn&#x27;t help with the application, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This mascara did work, but it irritated my eyes and the fibers run out quickly.  If you&#x27;re not used to putting mascara on daily then it might be a more difficult product for you to use.</li>
    <li> It was good. Its definitely a product you have to build up. Make sure you&#x27;ve got like 20/30 minutes to do your eyes or else you probably won&#x27;t get the effect your looking for. It&#x27;s a great mascara as far as darkening, and separating. But the fibers are a bit of a headache to work with. And i am a professional makeup artist.  Either way you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s definitely not bad.</li>
    <li> Great value! Great lashes!</li>
    <li> I love it, but the only thing I have a problem with is the fallout from the fiber lashes. So I kind of had to toy around with it a couple of times to stop that, and after applying the fiber lash a second time around I put on one coat of the transplanting gel then I applied a coat of my favorite lengthening mascara. Then I used my blow dryer on the lowest setting and let it sort of dry my lashes.</li>
    <li> I bought Younique&#x27;s 3 D fiber lash (and love the effect), but this was soo much cheaper that I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  When I first used this product, I really liked it.  However, it dried out in less than a week.  It&#x27;s not worth the bargain.</li>
    <li> This mascara was horrible :( straight out of the sealed package that transplant gel was dry and flaky. The fibers could not even stick to the gel. I am looking for the return policy currently.</li>
    <li> I see people here complaining about the flaking. Of course it is going to flake a bit. It is a dry fiber product; the wet gel is what gives it cohesion to the lashes, but there is still a bit of flaking. Not a big deal. Just take a fluffy makeup brush and sweep it off. I much prefer that to wet mascara that glops onto your cheeks and then smears when you try to wipe it off. I wear contact lenses some of the time, and so far, this product has not irritated them. The lengthening is good.  Clumping still happens, necessitating using a lash comb, but do it while the lashes are still a bit wet from the gel. Removal is easy with either soap and water or eye-makeup remover. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay product. Still, my quest for the perfect mascara continues, and with the plethora of new ones coming out all the time (L&#x27;Oreal must now have HUNDREDS of them), I will have fun with the search.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes look fuller and longer however yonique brand allows you to put on numerous coats and build this only allows one coat good alternative if you don&#x27;t wanna spend a lot for mascara good buy overall</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! Works almost as good as Younique for sure!</li>
    <li> I gave this a one star because the second set I opened only had 3applications of lashes.  I was very very disappointed after how long the first tube lasted (approx 2 months).  Its a great product when you actually get what you paid for and the product comes as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy another kind of mascara again.</li>
    <li> Great! Came in about 3 weeks and I love them so much😍</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the price. I understand I had to wait a while because of the original product location.  But man, was it worth the wait, and unlike the $35 Younique I don&#x27;t have to apply my mascara under it.  I didn&#x27;t have problems with falling fibers or clumping like some complaints I read, but I believe its all about application.  Just like all mascaras you have to kind of feather it out and then seal in the fibers with more transplanting gel.  You can clearly see a difference and all it takes is soap, water and a wipe to remove.  It also doesn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;raccoony&amp;#34; effect at the end of the day like my regular mascara, and you can definitely see a difference in the length and thickness. I got 4 tubes total, two of which I gave to a friend of mine who loves it!  Will definitely buy again before this set runs out as I use it everyday now!</li>
    <li> I really love them made my eyelashes look longer than they use to be☺️</li>
    <li> It was definitely more product than I expected and was very pleasantly surprised by that and the packaging. After that nothing else was pleasant about this very irritating product. I am normally a contact wearer, but there is no way that I will be able to use this product while wearing contacts as the fibers easily fall off and get into your eye. The fibers are literally like cotton balls or little raggedy pieces of fiber and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes except that they look like I have a bunch of little hair balls attached to my lashes. I did one day experiment and kept reapplying after allowing them to dry, I did this about five times and I did see a bit more fullness, but it was a MESS! I will never purchase this product again and I don&#x27;t suggest anyone else do.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as the YoUnique $30+ mascara! I&#x27;ll order this again!</li>
    <li> The brush on the mascara is good but there was barely any gel or fibers inside the tubes. I was very disappointed. They were cheap but not worth it</li>
    <li> I decided after my mascara that I have used for 10+ years was discontinued, I would give this stuff a shot.  Am I pleased!  I have very fine, pale lashes that are not the longest in the world, and need something to make them stand out.  This Love Alpha works well and fits the bill.  It goes on nice and even, the &amp;#34;extensions&amp;#34; go on well and do not flake or fall off.  My big test will be a long shift at work, see how it handles a sixteen hour day.  I looked and found a US seller of this product, and received them in approximately seven days.  The cost for two sets of this product was $8.55 with free shipping.  Well worth it.  And if there&#x27;s a learning curve with the product, I nailed it first try.  Gel first, two coats, then fibers, two coats.  Let dry.  Repeat if you think you want more.</li>
    <li> It should be used if you don&#x27;t already have long lashes... If you have long lashes you won&#x27;t see a difference but if you have thin short lashes it will make the world of differences</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not any gel coming out at all and very little fiber too!</li>
    <li> THE FIBER BRUSH IS EXTREMELY CHEAP WITH SEVERAL BRISTLES MISSING.  NOT A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT THAN APPLYING BABY POWDER WITH A BRUSH.  i WON&#x27;T BE BUYING THIS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I was weary of this product because it was alot cheaper than the other 3D lash products. After trying ONLY THIS PRODUCT (I have not tried the popular brand-name), I would have to say I am satisfied with this purchase. The Love Alpha does make my lashes look fuller and longer. I never had a problem with clumping, but I did read the directions carefully and applied it as directed.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve noticed was that the fibers do fall off throughout the day, so I have to constantly wipe underneath my eyes so I don&#x27;t look funny when talking face to face with other people.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I&#x27;m developing an allergy to the transplanting gel so I&#x27;m unable to wear it for long periods of time. But, it does work well and I&#x27;m happy to wear it for nights out--just not everyday to the office.</li>
    <li> No English instructions, just Chinese.</li>
    <li> Sucks this is not worth it at all but regular mascara it&#x27;s better</li>
    <li> I have never tried any other brand of fiber lashes, so I cannot compare them to anyone elses - but side by side with just mascara and this product does make your lashes longer and thicker!</li>
    <li> Arrived when said but the tubes of fibers seemed to be empty... The brushes had little to no fibers on them not sure why... Ok mascara Pry won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite mascara!  I have been wanting to try the Younique version of this product however I did not want to spend $35 to see if I liked it.  Based on the positive reviews here on Amazon I decided to give this one a try.  I am so glad I did!  I get twice as much product for half the price of the expensive brand and have amazing results.  The two part system does take a little longer than regular mascara but the results are definitely worth it and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier than applying false lashes.  If you&#x27;ve been wanting to try to the expensive stuff but are hesitant about the price tag, check out Love Alpha.&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/ydVItWfKSEI</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected. Poor quality. And makes my eyes burn.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Have ordered from this seller 3 times, works great!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, not as quality as younique but it is a good substitute for penny pinchers. Look up the younique how to put on video and apply with the teqniques. Don&#x27;t complain about the fibers all over your eyes, you&#x27;re not Doing It right! I reccomend a coat of real mascara before hand and use the gel 2x in the end and I also put it on the insides of the lashes so no shedding happens.</li>
    <li> I loved this product the first couple of times, however it has been downhill every order since then. The last 2 tubes of fibers have been trashed. Each were so dried I could barely pull the brush out of the tube. Then when I did get them out they were dried out with nothing on the brush. It&#x27;s as if when I reorder this product they send the oldest and most dried out inferior product they have. Also, the shipping time is ridiculously long and inconsistent. I&#x27;ll not order this again, it&#x27;s now a waste of money and creates frustration.</li>
    <li> Really love this.  Makes my lashes so long,!!!K. Will but again</li>
    <li> FINALLY, I recieved it in the mail yesterday. I gave the 2nd set to my mom. The instructions are in a foreign language, but from watching YT, I already knew how to apply this. This is very first time trying a fiber mascara, so I was excited to use it!    How I applied it:  Coated lashes with Maybelline Great Lash Clear mascara  Applied transplanting gel while lashes were still wet  Carefully applied the fibers - while squinting a bit - on back and front of lashes.. Worked from outer corners to the middle  Carefully sealed it with the gel VERY lightly    My opinion:  The fibers are quite thin compared to the expensive fiber lashes, so I had to apply more than enough. When sealing with the gel, I had to change up my technique bc the gel brush would almost sweep away the fibers.. Reason why I added more than enough.    The gel has a weird familiar scent that almost irritates my eyes for a few short minutes. It doesn&#x27;t irritate like it hurts, but almost like it&#x27;s taking moisture away from my eyes.    My lashes looked BEAUTIFUL with only the gel on! I&#x27;m never going back to regular mascara! My lashes never looked THIS good with my other mascara on. My lashes are naturally long and curly, so you saw my length very easily!    I wore this all day while I was inside the house - I didn&#x27;t want to wait to go out to wear it. My lashes basically look like babydoll lashes! Goreg! Anyway..    I didn&#x27;t get any fibers falling into my lashes. Only fibers I had on my face was when I was applying it and it was on my lid and a few small ones on my bottom lid. Nothing really bad or too noticeable.    I only applied the gel to my bottom lashes because I don&#x27;t care to have fibers on them. I read others who did apply fibers to their bottom lashes and they had flakes on their cheeks afterwards.    I took a shower and washed my lashes off with make-up remover soap and it came off very easily!    I kept playing around with it. I combined the clear mascara, fibers, and gel on top. Clear mascara,maybelline mascara, fibers, then gel. I took these combinations off by wiping away with a make-up wipe, which came off easily! Just be sure to keep your eyes closed until you have NO sign of fibers left over, to avoid them getting in your eyes.    I reapplied my final set and I plan on wearing this over night to see how long it last. And I&#x27;m a wild sleeper! So, I&#x27;ll update in the morning!        Update:    I wore this overnight and a little bit came off my lashes, but it wasn&#x27;t messy. Just in small flakes.    I&#x27;ve worn this while at work and I haven&#x27;t had flakes on my cheeks, or any where else on my face. Also, I wear contacts. I&#x27;ve had some fuzzies fall into my eyes during application, but it wasn&#x27;t irritating. I was able to get them off my eyeball with a dab of a clean finger.    The gel is a little goopy. The more you use it, you&#x27;ll get dried gel along the rim. Nothing bad. Easy to clean off.    All in all, I like it and I&#x27;m keeping it! 😉</li>
    <li> works well.  It does make make lashes look a bit fuller and longer..&lt;br /&gt;washes off easily.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this - a friend used it and recommended it. I found that while it lengthened my lashes - almost double - it didn&#x27;t do more than what other higher end mascaras will do. I also thought the transplanting gel smells funky and the fibers start to flake off and around mid-day my eyes were irritated. I would rather spend a few dollars more for a better product.</li>
    <li> Its not that this product didn&#x27;t deliver. This is the first fiber lash set i have tried, and for the price it did give me long thick lashes.  It came with the 4 tubes, pretty design.  Super cheap in price which is why i decided to give it a try, the shipping did take almost  a full two weeks, coming from china to new york.  The big problem i had with this product is the fibers seemed to only have about maybe 3 applications per tube, if that.  Your first time using it the wand is full of the fibers then after that it was a struggle to have it pick up anymore in the bottle. I personally would like to know is this the case for all fiber lash products?  The transplanting gel was thick and black, i used it ontop of my regular mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone just cause it seemed to be really wet which is probably good for adhering the fiber.  For me i will not repurchase, it would be worth trying a more expensive product hoping to get more uses out of it.</li>
    <li> Chinese product, not as pictured.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and it really makes your lashes look fuller</li>
    <li> i love it, it just hurts when the fibers get in your eyes but it did it with the 30$ bottle of this. they both work the same 😋</li>
    <li> I love this.  I get so many compliments on my lashes.  Not clumpy, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t run, but washes off easily with make up wipes.  I have usee the first set of tubes for over 3 weeks already.  Everything about this product out performs the much more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I liked it I don&#x27;t wear them all the time but when I do I get compliments! Take your time don&#x27;t rush...</li>
    <li> Fiber tube seemed dried up and the transplanting gel was very goopy not to mention there were no english instructions the box was in Chinese. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara of all time! I have ordered it over and over again. It makes my eyelashes huge and beautiful. Everyone is envious and asks me to order them some.</li>
    <li> love this!!! order it all the time</li>
    <li> I love this and I need to buy more</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I did a compairison by doing one eye with my regular mascara and one eye with two coats of the fiber mascara.  It is such a huge difference!  It makes your lashes look super thick at the base and lengthens them to the extreme.  It doesnt come with really detailed instuctions, so I would recommend a youtube video...  I have found that starting with a coat of your normal mascara helps a lot.  The fibers can get clumpy if you arent careful, so I use a final coat of the gel to get stray fibers and seperate my lashes.  I also love that it somes with two sets.  Great value for the money.  Once I move into the second set I&#x27;ll order more!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve been using unique 3d fiber lash for a while now.. and I get the same results from this!! And it&#x27;s less than half the price! This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as other products.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well- I think my fiber tubes are empty though, because nothing comes out on the brush when I use it.</li>
    <li> love it! I was skeptical after watching online reviews and tutorials... but this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Ehh... It honestly only works well if I put regular mascara on first, then the gel and fiber mascara. Maybe it&#x27;s just my lash type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a good tip is to put on a layer of regular mascara on after the gel and fiber, so the fibers won&#x27;t come off into your eye!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence too about this mascara, but am happy to report that I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Work on one lash area at a time&lt;br /&gt;Apply gel&lt;br /&gt;While gel is wet apply fibers&lt;br /&gt;Reapply gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that I don&#x27;t have to use mascara first as this is plenty of lashes for me. Comes off quick and easy even with a baby wipe, however does not smudge, (most mascara I try do smudge on me. as my skin can get oily through the day). You really do get 2 complete sets. WOW! Was gonna try the more expensive competition, no need.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It makes my natural lashes look 3 times as thick and long. I use two to three applications at one time to increase the length of my lashes. There is a little bit of fall out, but no more than any other mascara would give you. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that loves to have their natural lashes looking long and thicker.</li>
    <li> The fibers fall over your face.</li>
    <li> works really good, I just don&#x27;t like how the fibers sometimes fall on your face</li>
    <li> First, I would like to say the only reason I put 4 stars is because it took 2 months to receive this product. But it was worth the wait, considering the price. My lashes are much longer and stay so soft throughout the day. I was also excited that the formula does not leave any residue under my eyes after being worn all day, and was very easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I now have the most AMAZING lashes without the pricey price tag!  You can&#x27;t beat the value, it&#x27;s a steal!!! And my eyes look like a million bucks!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! My eye lashes are pretty long, but this really made them pop! This is just as good as younique 3D fiber lash mascara, and considering the price difference - I&#x27;d say much better! I have bought several of these for gifts for friends and family - everyone LOVES it! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I was a younique customer for awhile but wanted something that worked the same by wasn&#x27;t as pricey. This was my ticket. It works almost identically to the younique brand and costs a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Even though I only received 3 of the 4 tubes I love this product. I wrote Amazon and they gave me my money back but I will probably buy again</li>
    <li> Wish it came with directions written in English. Will take some time to figure out best way to apply.... Using two tubes at once is not as easy as one would think.  The instructions it came with have (A) (B) (C) (D) , does anyone know what (C) &amp; (D) are??? Re-applying maybe????</li>
    <li> Makes me look like I have lashes!!!! No fibers all over my face as others have stated. This my second batch.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical but I bought it anyway. Because it&#x27;s shipping from China it took a while to get here. As I waited for it to arrive, I watched videos on how to apply it so I wasn&#x27;t wasting any or doing it wrong...there is a leaflet that came with mine with the same instructions as the videos I had watched, so watch them or not the instructions are super simple: apply the transplanting gel and before it dries apply the natural fibers, then seal that with another coat of the transplanting gel. This can be repeated a couple of more times, but I would suggest applying the sealing coat of transplanting gel when you&#x27;re done applying the fibers: transplanting gel, fibers, transplanting gel, fibers, transplanting gel, fibers, then transplanting gel to seal it all off one eye at a time. I wish I had taken a photo because it really DOES work, as I have gotten older my eyelashes have gotten shorter and when I applied this to my left lashes and only mascara on the right and it did look like I had false lashes on the left side!</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE ONLY FIBER MASCARAS THAT I ORDER! I LOVE THESE!!! GREAT BUY.</li>
    <li> Disappointed fibers fall off through out the day leaving a mess on your face</li>
    <li> Love this product and it shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Work great and was at a great price. Easy to use and the brushes are of a good quality so application is that much more easier. It doesn&#x27;t smear after application like others and looks great!</li>
    <li> This is a good deal and the packaging is super cute. It does make my lashes look thicker but not necessarily longer. It takes time do apply since there&#x27;s 2 steps and I did it 3-4 times to get as close as I thought I could without it looking like a bunch of mascara on my lashes. I&#x27;ve had same if not better results with over the counter mascara with fillers. There instructions were in another language so I YouTubed a how to. I use this primary to go out, not every day.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  Just read the advice given by previous consumers, take your time, and finish with you own mascara the results are great!!!  Will for sure be reordering!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly to extend the length of the lashes.  Simply, the more careful repetitive you apply, the longer the lashes. It doesn&#x27;t work much with the volume (I may need to master the technique).&lt;br /&gt;I have to commend their excellent customer service.  Something wrong went with my shipment and they immediately responded and sent me a replacement set.&lt;br /&gt;I love the experience.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like other products.  Easy to apply and makes big lashes.</li>
    <li> I am Asian and have issues w/ my mascara smudging under my eye as the day goes on.  My prior mascaras (from cover girl to Lancome and Estee Lauder) left me wiping under my eye every 30 mins to remove dark smudges from building up.  The transplanting gel is amazing at preventing this from occurring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used to wear fake eyelashes for an evening look. After 2 months of owning these babies, I have thrown out all my fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a day to day look, I apply my mascara (currently using cover girl) and 2 coats of transplanting gel.  That alone dramatically increased the length of my lashes.  Made them go from mini lashes to curl worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a super dramatic look, I use the transplanting gel with the fibers.  You have to be careful when applying the fibers.  They can clump and it was tricky to apply the first few times.  I recommend a trial run if you plan to use this for a special event.  After a handful of applications, I was able to master the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware, the instructions do come in Chinese.  Directions:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Apply mascara.  Allow mascara to fully dry (10-15 seconds per eye)&lt;br /&gt;(2) Apply transplanting gel.  Do not allow to dry.  The trick is to do one eye at a time.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Apply fibers&lt;br /&gt;repeat step 2 and 3 until you reach desired result.  I believe the manufacturer recommends 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all heavy mascaras, you will need to wash off w/ an eye make up remover.  It will not wash off easily with a facewash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was cute and it arrived as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing again.  In fact, they are on my amazon wish list for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
    <li> The gel was dry on three sets so far.</li>
    <li> did not like this product...seemed old...like maybe it had been sitting in a warehouse or something. won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with the product. It took FOREVER to get it though.</li>
    <li> I really like this product . it came earlier than it was suppose to . the gel was not dry &amp; the fibers didn&#x27;t get into my eye . you have to how to use it in order for it to work . I can&#x27;t lie . it might be a 50 chance you get the good product or the bad\dry one .</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this stuff, I really did. Unfortunately, I did not. It does not build well at all. The fibers fall into the eyes. There is some kind of stringy stuff in the base/topcoat that I kept finding in my eyes. The price really does reflect the quality. Save some money elsewhere, this is not the place to skimp!</li>
    <li> this is a great product!! i have tried other more expensive fiber and gel combinations (younique) and this is exactly the same and washes off easier !!</li>
    <li> It was shipped from China so it took forever to arrive. They were a little dried out when I opened the tube, but I put some eye drops in it and that made it work better. It made my eyelashes longer but the results weren&#x27;t  good looking enough to go through the long application process everyday. The fibers often flaked off during the day and irritated my eyes. I probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This mascara lasted me only a week or so before it dried out. The fiber lashes don&#x27;t really stick to the gel mascara and makes it hard to leave you with extended lashes like other fiber lash mascaras do. Price isn&#x27;t bad if you just want a regular mascara.</li>
    <li> FOR THOSE OF YOU COMPLAINING, ONE OF THE BOTTLES IS SUPPOSED TO BE DRY!!! It&#x27;s called FIBER mascara... There transplanting gel (WET) and fibers (DRY). If you don&#x27;t get how to use them you&#x27;re suppose to apply the wet gel first then the DRY fibers and and then add on the wet gel again to secure fibers...And if you still don&#x27;t get it there&#x27;s also YouTube videos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes the only con about this is that it&#x27;s not love alpha, they&#x27;ve recently switched it to the cheaper kind (flamingo)</li>
    <li> I truly could not believe the results, lashes were tripled in length with the first stroke! Just be aware it took almost a month to receive.</li>
    <li> Fiber was like lint. Did not like this product</li>
    <li> Just ok. bought two of these., one for a gift and one for myself.  The concept is great although as you brush the fibers are falling off the brush onto my top.....needs perfection. Positive note, love the case!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.. Works exactly as described and washes off as easily as normal mascara. My lashes have never looked longer and no damage to my natural lashes.</li>
    <li> It took a few weeks to arrive from China and The product itself works great. It does what it says it does. However, there was only enough fibers in the tubes for more than 5 or 6 applications. I had to pull out the strainer cap to get the rest out. For the price I guess that&#x27;s acceptable or if you were only planning to wear it on a special occasion, but for daily wear I will keep looking and will most likely have to pay more.</li>
    <li> Product came sealed in plastic, came on time, works very well. Still need to work with it but like it so far. This product is labeled as &amp;#34;English version.&amp;#34; The only English on it is on the mascara tubes. You can find the instructions on here.</li>
    <li> It does make your eye lashes fuller and longer however the fibers land in my eyes every use...</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara!!! My favorite! Just one coat make such a huge difference!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. Watched a video to watch how to correctly apply. Will definitely be ordering more. Lashes look like false thy are so long and thick. I am mid 50s which I would have found this years ago.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy that after two days of use the fibers were gone in one tube. It worked ok but didn&#x27;t last long!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that works great, easy to apply, and looks good.  I had no problems with the clumping as others have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;delivery is from China, allow 4 to 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The two tubes of &#x27;fibers&#x27; do not last.  I only used ONE coat each time.  It&#x27;s all I needed and I have sparse lashes.  I got three uses out of one bottle and 2 out of the other.  There is plenty of GEL, but not fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good product, but you get what you pay for.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting on several layers and having this product last more than one use.  I even scraped the bottom out and it was empty and dry.  There just aren&#x27;t enough fibers.  That was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked what I had of it but would not order it again due to the fiber bottles only lasting a very, very short time.</li>
    <li> Works ok, runs out very very quickly.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to try this after all the bad comments about younique but I  watched utube videos and decided to try this product because it was so much cheaper than younique and if I didn&#x27;t like it I wasn&#x27;t out that much money.  So when I got it I tried it, the first time I used it I LOVED it! It was so easy and not messy at all.  I think watching the videos helped so I recommend doing that first.  I will order this product forever!!! wish I had taken a before and after, I will try to remember next time.</li>
    <li> The product came from China. The instructions were in Chinese. It did not come with the box. I was expecting a product from England not from China. After all I have read about lead in products from China, I don&#x27;t think it is safe for me to use this mascara.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff at a great price. I have never tried fiber lashes before, but a friend of mine started selling Younique and I just had such a hard time considering the $29 for the product. I decided to order this instead. The product works great. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and apply one coat of regular mascara, one coat of gel, one coat of fiber (mostly on tips), and follow with a final coat of gel to seal. I think the results are awesome and will continue to use. I have no eye irritation and no \\&quot;falling fiber\\&quot; issues. As per how long the tubes last, that is to be determined. I&#x27;ll follow up at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow Up: It&#x27;s now been a month and from using 5 days a week for a month, I&#x27;m getting ready to order more. Depending on how many layers you are using, I got 2 1/2 to 3 weeks out of one set. I do one full lash application and a second on just the tips. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy, even if it is on a monthly basis, it&#x27;s super budget friendly and I love it still!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it gives you beautiful lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, I always get compliments on how long my eyelashes look.  I still have not used a full tube yet, so glad I bought a pack of 4. I will not be buying mascara for a long time :)</li>
    <li> Fiber lashes run out fairly quickly, but still use the other part like regular mascara sometimes!</li>
    <li> product caused irritation and fiber easily gets in eyes.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> A really great mascara especially if you have skimpy lashes and don&#x27;t want to always have to wear fake lashes.</li>
    <li> Love this product, would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Not as good as Younique..</li>
    <li> Awesome and affordable!</li>
    <li> It turns out that I am highly allergic to this product. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitivities to anything, so if you do, I would avoid this products. I did love the concept and the fullness it gave my lashes, but can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
    <li> After the first bit of fibers on the brush, they&#x27;re all gone!!😡 only used this product 5 times. Not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever. But buy extra takes several months to recieve.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome! !!!</li>
    <li> It worked great the 2 uses I was able to get from the dried up tubes.</li>
    <li> I find myself using first step alone more often than not, as the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; component tends to get all over my face, leaving a bit of a mess&lt;br /&gt;However, that step alone does lengthen and intensify the look of my light colored lashes. I do feel comfortable with the final outcome&lt;br /&gt;The price was reasonable for a twin set - I gave the other duo to my daughter</li>
    <li> First off, they send two sets but one of the fiber tubes has nothing in it so now I have a tube of transplanting gel I will not use. Secondly my other mascara works a lot better with one coat. (This takes many to look good) positive side is that it is fairly easy to remove.</li>
    <li> My wife really Loves It!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good mascara, I&#x27;m thinking my fibers are going to run out soon though which stinks because I have only used this product once. It certainly makes my lashes longer and they stay &amp;#34;perky&amp;#34; all day long, I got several comments on how nice they looked throughout the day, they lasted through my workout in the gym. They do not come in the boxes, so don&#x27;t expect that. They&#x27;re a little smaller than the average mascara tube but still a good size, certainly not a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size or anything along those lines. The fibers keep in mind are very messy before you cover them in the transplanting gel, I spent about 5 minutes fishing them out of my eye this morning. It was also my first time trying this product so maybe I just need more practice. Do not order if you&#x27;re out of mascara and are expecting a quick delivery, mine took almost a month to get to me. The transplanting gel smells odd while in the bottle, but you cannot smell it once you apply it to your lashes. If you&#x27;re comparing and contrasting the Younique brand vs this Love Alpha I would suggest Love Alpha, it&#x27;s does the same job and you get 4 tubes total. Overall it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve recommended this to every girl I know. I have the shortest eyelashes ever, but they are long, full and gorgeous with these fiber lashes!</li>
    <li> works great! love it!</li>
    <li> Tried these because i use the other kind that were way expensive... this one is waaaaaaay better!  I will be buying more thats for sure!!  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth the wait.  I used it 5 times and now there isn&#x27;t really sny fibers coming out of either set.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item is terrible. First of all it took so long to get her. 2ndly Comei felt l basically I left like I was putting lint of my lashes. Will never buy again nor do I recommend anuone from buying. In fact I will pay someone to get this product out of my sight. Plus, the directions are in Spanish!</li>
    <li> Not that great but I give it 2 stars. It&#x27;s clumpy, messy and the fibers don&#x27;t stick on well just fall in my eyes</li>
    <li> I love it!! Requires a bit of practice but really made a change</li>
    <li> I thought this was only okay as far as results go.  The result was not dramatic enough for all the work involved.  Oh, and use an oil based eye make-up remover.  It does not come off easily.</li>
    <li> My lashes naturally go different directions. I&#x27;m so glad I found this.Straightens up my lashes and makes them POP. They are super thick and dark. People think they&#x27;re fake :)  Product is easy to apply just be careful to not get anything in your eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this bc i seen it compared to unique products.  .  I was very disappointed its NOTHING like the usual unique products i use at all. I will not purchase this product again the fibers were clump and did NOT adhere to the lashes at all and it actually made my real lashes fall out :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, it&#x27;s hard to apply and you end up with red eyes. It has a bad smell to it as well. I just don&#x27;t think this mascara works at all. Save your money.</li>
    <li> she&#x27;s fiber lashes are as good as any brand out there in the price cannot be beat.  it does take awhile to get them but it is less time than the website says!  will order from again.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Took some time to get here but that&#x27;s understandable. Product wise, no negative comments!! Wonderful all around!</li>
    <li> It was alright, Fibers kept falling in my eyes</li>
    <li> The fibers are messy and hard to get onto the eyelash to extend them. During the day bits of fibers would fall on my face or get in my eye. I threw the fibers away and kept using the mascara but I don&#x27;t like it either. I haven&#x27;t opened the second set and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! It is exactly how it is described, &amp; I received it a day earlier than expected! Makes my eyelashes look awesome! This is comparable to the younique 3D mascara (which is twice as much, for one set). Great price, as you get 2 sets :) I will be buying this again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT (: first 3d mascara experience, great for beginners.. not difficult at all and comes fast ! 2 sets for 14.99? AMAZING. Worth the buy for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this, never will go back to the old stuff agein, the best part is it dose not smear when washing off.</li>
    <li> OK.  I had my doubts but this product is wonderful.  I have very short lashes.  This product brings them out wonderfully.  What&#x27;s really nice is how easily it washes off-way better than traditional mascara.  For contact lens wearers, I suggest practicing application first to get used to any loose fibers before wearing contact lenses, but I found that the fibers don&#x27;t bother my eyes or my lenses at all.  This was well worth the price and I have gotten compliments so this beats a $150 Latisse medical treatment anyday in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been a younque customer for a while so I am comparing this product to Younique&#x27;s 3D fiber lash mascara.  The tube of fibers is the same.  There is no difference that I can tell in the two brands of fibers.  The gel on the other hand is what&#x27;s different.  The Love Alpha gel is ok, but doesn&#x27;t cover as good as younique gel.  BUT the Love Alpha is definitely better than any regular mascara I&#x27;ve tried and for the price, it is definitely worth it!  I add an extra coat of the gel and get the same results as the younique.  I will buy this again because it&#x27;s the better deal for the money.</li>
    <li> I used to sell several different brands of department store cosmetics, so I know good mascara- and I have very sensitive eyes to chemicals- almost ALL brands of mascara make my eyes water as if I&#x27;m peeling onions.  That being said, I like this mascara- I did not have an allergic reaction to it. It was definitely a little weird at first, with the two steps- be aware not to stick wand &#x27;A&#x27; into tube &#x27;B&#x27; or things go a little haywire. My eyelashes are becoming scant as I age, and these definitely make me feel like I have my more youthful lashes back. Applied carefully, they don&#x27;t look fake, but it&#x27;s easy to overdo it. Also- I cried at a wedding and they stayed perfect. :D I will buy these again! I didn&#x27;t give the full five stars because the tubes should be different colors- I painted the smaller one with red nail polish so I don&#x27;t mix them up again.</li>
    <li> Shipped out quickly and the product is fantastic! Will be ordering again in the future!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Just as it says! !</li>
    <li> I have only had this mascara for a week but I&#x27;ve used it everyday since I got it.  My natural lashes are so short, they are almost non-existent.  I enjoy wearing false lashes but only for special occasions, dealing with the glue is to much for everyday.  This 3D fiber-lash is BOMB.  I put on a layer of the transferring gel, which worked almost as well as my regular mascara then added the fibers and my lashes looked noticeably thicker and longer.  I think i have to play around with this a little more to get the dramatic length seen in some photos but I did get some length and plenty of fullness.  I know some people who are selling another brand of this for $30 a pop. They are selling it like avon. I&#x27;m so happy I found this on amazon for 1/4 of the price. I got two sets for half the price of one set.  I will definitely be re-ordering this.</li>
    <li> Makes lashes longer v</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard at first to get use to the two step process but I like the look after.</li>
    <li> I received my order yesterday, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out, and it is amazingly good product, my eyes are very large and this made the pop so beautifully.  I will be order this product again. Victoria</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the expensive Younique product.  However, the multiple steps required in applying this product can be tedious.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations based on what I&#x27;ve seen on youtube, but decided to try it anyway. It gave a lot of length but i ended up with what looked like five clumpy spider lashes. it looked like i didn&#x27;t  know how to apply mascara and used ten coats, not attractive even after using a lash comb and heated eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an mascara freak! And these are amazing! It&#x27;s my first time trying gel/fiber mascara and I&#x27;m super impressed. So you get the 4 tubes (2 transplanting gels tubes and 2 natural fiber tubes). I did not have any fall out from the fibers, just make sure you wipe off excess in the tube before applying. It does make you make up routine a little more complex. You have to use 2 tubes and you have to switch back and forth for each coat you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my normal mascara routine, the thickness is undeniably there. In terms of thickness, they could compare to a natural set of falsies. For length, it is a learning curve on how to get the longest possible. I found wiping the fibers through the whole lash the first time and then focusing on the tips for each additional coat worked the best without clunking up your lashes. Your lashes do feel a bit heavier if you are able to get them super long/thick. That felt a little weird at first, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly. Will defintely be reordering. Definitely a fun and cheap way to experience fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> This gel mascara is runny and stringy with the fibers that have been added to the mascara.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I hate it it flakes all over the place I read the reviews and it does say it flakes but I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad don&#x27;t order this it sucks</li>
    <li> The gel part is great, it lengthens without clumping.  However, the fiber 2nd half is strange.  It&#x27;s clumpy and it falls apart, covers my eyes and cheeks with little black fibers when I try to use it..  I end up using the gel first and then some other mascara on top to get the full, fake lash look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered before but this batch hardly had anything. I&#x27;m not happy. Only used about 3x &amp; it ran out. The picture I attached is the 2nd set. You can see how little fibers are in tube. I couldn&#x27;t get more to coat the brush.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Super easy to use and my lashes look way longer. Even my bf noticed :) I will never go back to reg mascara again!</li>
    <li> you have to put like 5 billion layers on but it&#x27;s a huge improvement &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake like I thought it would</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works</li>
    <li> This product is great! Added more steps to my routine but that is fine! Already recommended to friends and family! I wish it did come with the case though, if I travel it&#x27;s harder to keep together. Really happy with my purchase though!</li>
    <li> Amazing mascara especially for the price and the fact that it comes with two sets! The first time trying it out was a little bit of a challenge but once I practiced everyday I became a pro for applying this on my lashes and they look amazing. This mascara is also insanely easy to remove with warm water or even makeup remover wipes. It doesn&#x27;t smudge create the &amp;#34;spider-web&amp;#34; effect whatsoever. Definitely buy if you&#x27;re looking for some new mascara to buy!</li>
    <li> I love this product😄 only downfall is the fiber gets in my eyes a Lil. And another tip that might work for others I use these then my regular mascara on top seems to make my lashes longer. Definitely will be ordering more❤</li>
    <li> for the price it really does work like younque just needs alot of coats, will post pics</li>
    <li> This is the best ever!!</li>
    <li> After receiving Younique fiber mascara for Christmas I fell in love with the big lashes that fiber mascara provided. However, I did not like the price tag on something that seemed to run out so quickly (i used it approximately 20 times, single layer of fibers, and yes i was gifted the mascara by a REAL Younique rep) I ordered LoveAlpha because it wascheaper AND you get double, plus they use the same typeof ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using LA for 3 days now and i can say thatmy lashes actually seem MUCH longer than when I used Younique, they wash off a MILLION Times easier than Younique. I&#x27;m also very confident that the scathing reviews were left by Younique reps. I will add a side by side comparison photo down the road :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical before trying these. False lashes really irritate my eyes and extensions are too expensive. These definitely add serious length and density to your lashes, and have a similar effect. Plus they last for a few days. Will be using this for now on.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after the reviews and my gifted $29.00 value fiber lash ran out. Sorry I&#x27;ll spend $29.00 on my foundation products but not on mascara. This product has so many great reviews plus the price was really reasonable. Boy was I impressed! I got the 2 for 2 pack. Unfortunately one of the fibers tubes was missing. I tried to contact the company to see if someone could just send me the missing tube, cause I for sure was not sending this awesome product back. But, I could only get a hold of Amazon. Who promptly told me to return the product and they would refund. Pardon my French but I said Hell No. Anyways this product is worth the time, effort and inconvenience of a missing tube. My husband who never notices anything asked me if I had fake lashes on. This product also washes off easily but doesn&#x27;t run during daily wear. Warm water and soap removes, poof! Also I got some in my clothes accidently and the product came out of my shirt with simple orange cleaner. Get this product in your make up arsenal.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! You will love the look of your lashes for the first 2 days before your fibers are completely gone! I gave one as a gift and the same thing happened!</li>
    <li> I only received 1 set. 2 tubes, love the mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Just have to make sure you separate the lashes so it doesn&#x27;t look clumpy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
    <li> Omg! My lashes r so long and lovely when i put this duo on my lashes cant believe how good it is and the price was so good thanks for another 5 star purchase Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Loved these. They are very cheeky but I love them They fit as expected..</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected, it does work. Though throughout the day the fibers get all over the place</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would be good for extending my lashes. I tested it by using my favorite mascara on one eye and Love Alpha on the other.  I used my 2 usual coats of my favorite mascara but this one took 4-5 to get the same results as the one I already use. I spent more than 10 minutes applying Love Alpha on one eye. The gel is very thin and the fibers do not stick to it properly. I read reviews before purchasing and thought it would be a good choice but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> I order this and it was terrible before I even got to Church it was flaking all in my eyes and on my face.  I had contacts in and it was very irritating. Shipment arrived Ina timely manner.  But I would never recommend this.  I have  use different brands that are more costly but I never have had this experience.  Like they say you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> The tubes were empty.  There was absolutely no product in any of the tubes. Obviously a scam.</li>
    <li> Very messy. Too much work.</li>
    <li> just a normal mascara to me to be completely honest. They don&#x27;t come with what you see on the right. there are 2 sets though. follow me on twitter @tuffslani if you want to.. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this way better than I thought it would be. I&#x27;ve purchased the more expensive ones, like Cherry Blooms and Younique and let me tell you, I was amazed at well this one held up. Its so good I reordered twice. Yes, expect this come be delivered in approx. a month, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I looked at many youtube videos.. Works probably for long eyelashes but mine were looking straight..</li>
    <li> came w/ 2 sets; 4 tubes in total.. works AMAZING! Anyone who says anything negative about this product is the &amp;#34;competition&amp;#34; im completely happy and will be ordering in the future!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Younique, and thought I&#x27;d try this for a more economical mascara.  Like lots of other customers said, the fibers are all gone after less than 6 uses.  Lots of transplanting gel, but no fibers.  Very disappointing.  But the mascara/fibers to a great job in the beginning.  That&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t decide how many stars to give.  It compares very favorably to Younique, but when the fibers are gone you are done.</li>
    <li> I got these on sale, originally only got 1 set, went back to reg mascara and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference so I ordered these again. My advice is to put on a thin coat of reg mascara and then layer the Love alpha over that. Also, I don&#x27;t put the fibers at the base of my eyelashes, I keep it to the middle and ends. Put on 2-3 coats and my lashes look amazing.</li>
    <li> Fake eyelashes in a bottle!😍</li>
    <li> Really amazing product! However, I don&#x27;t know if it is as good as the Younique one because I&#x27;ve never tried it. I cannot compare but I can let you know that this product does what it says it is going to do. It gave me a ton more length on my lashes! I have very short lashes and I hate fake lashes because they always end up looking unintentionally porny. I was actually skeptical on this product at first! But as I layered on more of it I noticed that it was looking better and better. This definitely works and is decently priced for what it is. Also if you&#x27;re going to buy Younique products, I suggest you buy from someone who is selling as Younique is a business kind of like Mary Kay. Anyway, this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of fiber mascara, Too Faced, Benefit etc. so see below for the pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fibers are black, most are white which never made much sense to me anyway. Since these are black they blend into your lashes and mascara much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Price you really can&#x27;t beat, compared to the other brands I typically buy it&#x27;s a great a value.&lt;br /&gt;4 tubes and the fiber tube is much larger than it&#x27;s competitors which makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Fibers tend to shed very badly, I never had that issue with other brands. They end up all over my cheek area, nose, clothes etc when putting them on. They will also fall in your eye and I have to play Nancy Drew to get them out.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; mascara is more like glue, you can hardly tell you have it on at all, which makes me need to use another mascara after to really seal it and show up.&lt;br /&gt;The gel dries really fast so use your finest ninja skills to slap on the fibers quickly or you will need another coat or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great value, I don&#x27;t like the shedding fibers or the fact I still need another tube of mascara to finish my look. Which leaves me on the fence with the purchase. So far I&#x27;ve used the product for two weeks I&#x27;m getting used to how it works which took a little time. Longer I use it the easier it is to work with, just takes some patience up front.</li>
    <li> In comparison to another brands this product is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. The fiber does not glide as well, and often the gel will remove the fiber defeating the purpose of the fiber in the first place. fiber come out on brush a bit clunky causing a lot to fall even tho its applied before gel dries, it does not seem to grasp as well. For the price I think the product is great IF you have the patience to &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; your lashes. I will buy it again, but its will only be a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I just received this item a few days ago and I absolutely love it! Compared to my usual mascara this gives my lashes much more volume without getting clumpy. I found that using two coats worked the best and I only applied the fibers from the middle to the tip of my lashes and I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the fibers getting in my eyes. I probably would have had to applied at least 4 or 5 coats of my other mascara very carefully to get the same results. This stuff is definitely worth trying!</li>
    <li> Sweet baby Jesus, this is the good stuff.  I was *this close* to buying the 3D Fiber Lashes by another...eh...unique...brand. I am so happy I didn&#x27;t spend $29 on that. I got two (TWO!) sets here, for half the price of one set of that other brand. As soon as the postman delivered the box, I tore the packaging open and immediately tried it on. Bam...Kardashian lashes. They are so long. It&#x27;s neat to see the little furry fibers magically turn into red-carpet lashes. And they lasted all day, the fibers didn&#x27;t get into my eyes, and they didn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes like my other mascaras. I&#x27;m a mascara and falsie junkie, but now I wonder what I&#x27;m going to do with all the other mascaras I have now. I feel so sad for them. I have not been this excited about a beauty product in a long time.</li>
    <li> This was horrible! The fibers got  into my eyes through out the day and irritated them and now they are red and I am not able to wear contacts! Didn&#x27;t even make my eyelashes long. Regular mascara did the job better!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing !! I even got my neighbor hooked! way better than spending 25 to 35 dollars for the other younique mascara!!</li>
    <li> My new favorite! Does not smear, and comes off without remover! I will never be able to use normal mascara again!</li>
    <li> this item is great for a single application! However to do the second or third leaves a featherey look that flakes all over your face through-out the day! By the way, One application doesn&#x27;t extend lashes. So, it is a good mascara only!</li>
    <li> This is the best fiber mascara I have ever used.  I normally prep by using a lash brush or comb and comb my lashes before I put my mascara. I then curl if I want a very dramatic effect.  I use the gel, then fibers, then gel if I am going to work. If I am going out, I do this routine twice or thrice. The effect is shocking.  My lashes look so thick and long they are uncanny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product but I only 3 tubes instead of 4 please correct this</li>
    <li> AWESOME Possum!  My new favorite mascara!  I am a contact wearer and had no problem applying this.  I did not get any fibers in my eyes and did 4 coats.  Yay, I finally look like I have eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of ordering a set for myself and a set for my daughter who lives in another state.  I was so disappointed because NOT only do they NOT come in the case that is shown here.....it&#x27;s terrible...the fibers flake all over your face a get in your eyes.  I stopped buying the Younique 3D mascara for the same reason, but when I read the reviews on here for this particular brand; to much disappoinment I thought I would try it.  Sad that it seems that so many sellers must be the ones writing their own reviews.</li>
    <li> I am a big lover of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; popular brand that is sold at home based parties, so when I saw the price of this I had to try it.  Unfortunately it just doesnt compare and has really fallen short.  I would say if you are on a tight budget and this is what you can afford at the time, it will do a lesser but ok job.  But given the choice I would chose the other brand for sure.</li>
    <li> I like the transplanting gel but the fibers don&#x27;t really do anything</li>
    <li> Wow wow, wow! I have rather naturally long lashes, but mascaras were not doing much, I wanted to try the fiber lash craze, since I&#x27;ve heard so much about it but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money in case it didn&#x27;t work out.... well, I can tell you this product is WONDERFUL! I do anywhere between 2 to 3 coats and my lashes look fake..... the product is very easy to apply and to wash off at the end of the day. I willccontinue to order..... I spend just about the same for regular mascara that doesn&#x27;t do much for my lashes...... no need to ever purchase regular mascara ever again.. BUY this, you will NOT regret it!!</li>
    <li> The fibers irritate my eyes so bad I can&#x27;t wear it, however, I am a contact wearer.  My friend is using the 2nd tube and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This natural mascara is exactly like younique mascara that they charge $29 for one.  I highly recommend this instead.  I have sensitivity to mascaras, but I&#x27;ve been fine with this one and it is okay with my contacts also.  With the low price I can replace it more often like you are supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes your eyelashes extra long and does not clump. I definitely would recommend this product. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product sheds the fibers all over my face. I don&#x27;t know if my bottle was just too dry or what. Once I clean off the fibers from my face it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had better luck with the Loreal double extend mascara. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this. It just doesn&#x27;t make your lashes appear that much longer, but it takes more time to apply.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t even come</li>
    <li> Works well in making my lashed fuller, however the fibers do fall off and I often have to wipe them off my cheeks and eyes. I only use it for special occasions for this reason</li>
    <li> Unbelievable product!  Looks so natural not like fake lashes. Product does not clump or flake off. Great with contacts.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and the price point. It takes practice, but I&#x27;m just doing a small application of the fiber/mascara combo until I am better with the application process. If you try too much too soon you may look like a spider web. The mascara overall has a much  greater impact on my eyes than anything in a similar price range. As a matter of fact you get two sets! My lashes are short and thin so I am pleased to look like I have longer somewhat full lashes.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I love it! The fibers tend to get in your eyes a little but I solved that by simply closing one eye at a time when I apply.</li>
    <li> Very VERY disappointed! The mascara was dry. Not at all like it promised to be.</li>
    <li> mine only came with ONE set</li>
    <li> It took a while for me to receive my order but after getting it I was very pleased. There was no instructions to tell you how to apply it but a friend that had purchased it told me the best way.</li>
    <li> This works very well, I love this product! The only issue is sometimes no matter what I do the little fibers seem to get in my eyes and drives me crazy all day, besides that works very very well. I did not expect it to work so well considering the price! Defiantly worth it, will buy many more .</li>
    <li> I was nervous trying this as it was not made in the United States, but it went on perfectly and stayed on all day, it looks very similar to when I have on fake eyelashes.  It did not clump and looked very smooth and natural.  It was very easy to apply and comes off very simply with makeup remover. There was no eye irritation. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected I got all 4 😊 yay</li>
    <li> I love these mascaras! My eyes look fabulous!!!! I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that looks this good.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever tried!!!  It&#x27;s not that hard to do people!! It comes with a tube of &amp;#34;mascara glue&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, you just put that on first, then you brush on the fibers..I have not a problem with them falling or getting in my eyes..others I have tried do this but not this product, then you apply the mascara glue, then the fibers,etc until you get the look you want..on my last application I apply the fibers only to the tips of my lashes, put on the mascara glue..let it dry, then I apply my own NYX mascara and OMG!!!!!!!!  Everyone asks what I use!!! It&#x27;s really an amazing product!</li>
    <li> By day 3 there were zero fibers left. You get what you pay for. I really wanted to give this a great review since I was tired of spending a fortune on mascara.</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;m gonna order more soon!!</li>
    <li> Found out i was allergic. Caused my eyes to swell. I didn&#x27;t really see much difference in length</li>
    <li> Here is the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, to a point. You&#x27;ll have little uneven spikes of new &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; here and there. There is nothing natural-looking about it, even with just one coat it really looks like you put on 3 heavy coats of gooey mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most annoying problem with Love Alpha: These fibers will drop onto your upper cheeks and eye area all day long, and make you look like a 5 year old who played with her mom&#x27;s make-up. The result is a sloppy and unkempt look, with tons of black smudges, no matter how much time you put into your beauty routine. I can only imagine what it is like for contact lens wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this product might be a fun novelty item for young girls who like to pile it on, but I am in my early 30&#x27;s and there is no way I would wear the Love Alpha look to work. But it was fun to try.</li>
    <li> They have changed the liquid mascara to a different texture, doesn&#x27;t work like it used to.</li>
    <li> Love love love, will be ordering more</li>
    <li> The price is cheap and it works just as good as the more expensive versions.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does not flake Like other extension fibers mascara. Eyelashes look fuller and longer with one coating.</li>
    <li> great product! great service</li>
    <li> The transplanting gel and brush is not the EXACT same as yonique but it provides the same exact results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you use the end of the mascara brush, it allows you to achieve longer lashes without so much clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great purchase, especially with the price point so low</li>
    <li> Really Awesome!!! Its the exact same thing as Younique, The videos on youtube are misleading that the younique reps put up, they dont even put any product on the wands when they use them. You get two sets for under 10 dollars....and one set of the other brand for 30......buy this....same thing, be smart.</li>
    <li> I was a huge Younique fan! I thought I would give this a try...(much more cost efficient) I was not expecting much because of the price! I was pleasantly surprised! LOVE it even more than Younique! Less clumping by far! I will order again</li>
    <li> I like this product for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I received the product</li>
    <li> Did not like this,looks cakey!</li>
    <li> Omgg my lashes look amazing. I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it worked excellent! !!!!</li>
    <li> Freaking amazing! It took forever to come but it was well worth the wait best eyelash fibers of any I have used. The mascara is very gelish almost like wet paint. It doesn&#x27;t include any instructions so make sure you do gel, fiber, gel, fiber and one more coat of gel to seal it so you won&#x27;t have stray hairs all over your face.</li>
    <li> I bright two at the same time. A time relief, works well, looks natural, pretty, easy to manage and use. They added that extra pop to my already popping natural eye shape.</li>
    <li> Love love love this...it took a month for this to arrive but well worth the wait, i ordered more after trying this mascara its great....</li>
    <li> My lashes looked so long!</li>
    <li> My new favorite,  the gel is great I haven&#x27;t found a fiber lash I like more then this product</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this product! Amazing!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. NEVER USING ANOTHER MASCARA.&lt;br /&gt;You can remove any fibers under your eye with a tissue or cloth. I love this product and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you get 2 SETS and spend only $7! That&#x27;s less than mascara from Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 2 separate times now and love it just as much as I did the first time I used it. I had previously tried the younique 3D fibre lash set, and I must say, it is EXTREMELY satisfying to have the same effect at a tiny percentage of the price. This stuff is amazing and I will continue to make it a part of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> The mascara was just Ok The fibers irritated my eyes. I used it twice to see if it was just me or something else. I just did not like the fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> Great product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The fibers fall off and into my eyes and smear on my face! I won&#x27;t ever use it again. Go for Younique.</li>
    <li> First time trying it, &amp; I love it.</li>
    <li> So far I think it&#x27;s great. All these 1 star review complain about either the prolonged ship time, I have patience, so I don&#x27;t care, got mine in two weeks. Worth the wait time for the price difference with younique. The other thing they complain about is loose fibers, and well I think it was just kind of common sense to apply the transplanting gel quickly and follow up with the fibers right after, if the transplanting gel is dry the fibers will not adhere and thus be all over your face. Do one eye at a time!!!! Also, follow up with another coat of transplanting gel and they should stay put, I haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
    <li> I received this product approximately 3 months after I ordered it. The first thing that dissapointed me was the fact that it had no case. The second thing was the fibers and fiber brush. There are barely any fibers in the tube and the brush is awful. The only decent thing about it is that the transplanting gel lengthens lashes a bit but no better than store bought mascara. I suggest if anyone wants 3D fiber lashes to purchase Younique&#x27;s 3D Moodstruck fiber lashes. A little pricey, but wow, totally worth it :)</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t order again. The fibers tubes were empty.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I bought it and gave one set to my friend. My lashes look longer and thicker and perfect. Not fake looking at all. I will be buying more when I run out. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with this lash enhancement product. Only downside was it took almost a month to arrive.</li>
    <li> Wow!! At first I kept hearing how amazing fiber mascara was but didn&#x27;t want to invest a ton of money if I hated it, I&#x27;m SUPER picky when it comes to my eyelashes and mascara. This mascara was easy to use and made my lashes long and fluffy with just one coat. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is removing it, you should definitely use a eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> The mascara/gel is not clumpy, and it&#x27;s already black so no need for other mascara. The fibers can clump if put on too thick, but just a light coating worked perfectly for me. I used two layers of the gel and fibers and got the length I was looking for. I tried to put on a third layer just to see what would happen, but the fibers get too heavy and start to sag, so I will stick with 2 layers. Overall really nice and they&#x27;ve been on all day with nothing falling in my eyes! Four stars because the photo is misleading and it looks like they are sending a case, but it&#x27;s just the tubes...</li>
    <li> This works pretty well but it definitely works better if you start with a regular mascara and then follow the steps. Just be careful with the fibers because if they get in your eyes they do burn. Just adhere them to the end of your lashes and you should be good. I thought these were definitely with the price.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied with the fiber part!</li>
    <li> Did great extending the lashes. But the microfibers would come lose and get into my daughter&#x27;s eyes.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Not at all like 3D mascara. Should&#x27;ve known for 11.99. Live and learn I suppose</li>
    <li> Seems good so far. Took about a month to ship</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Lashes are so long</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I like it but need to practice more. The fibers get into my eyes and can be very bothersome</li>
    <li> My lashes look beautiful ....</li>
    <li> Now I can do my eye lashes just like I like them and in less time than what it would always take me to do them. I love this product, Didn&#x27;t lie it does just what it said it would do and looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had a horrible first experience with the fibers getting in my eyes and scratching and burning. I was miserable until I could get home to take it off. Thankfully a friend pointed out that I needed to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; them with another coat of the first tube after I used the fibers. She was right! Apparently I just don&#x27;t read instructions well. Now that I&#x27;m using this the right way I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> The fibers would fall in my eyes and cause eye irritation.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be better than the original mascara. it was simple.</li>
    <li> The Best look ever this is a very easy way to get that false lash look if you double apply the longer they get it is amazingly easy and no mess. Just  as easy as putting on regular mascara I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT ps my daughter loved it&#x27;s amazing effects she ended up with my 2nd free bottles. A two for one amazing sale item best price for this great stuff!!! Will be an advid buyer keep selling this because I want it!!! No foul smell it was better than any other I had tried!!!</li>
    <li> Not a good product very little gel  and very little fibers not worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this Love Alpha 3D Fiber Mascara! Makes my lashes thicker. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this to give it try and to my surprise I like it better than the younique fiber lash mascara, doesn&#x27;t leave my eyelashes looking all spidery</li>
    <li> This has been my new &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; piece of makeup since I ordered my first set.  Make sure to put a light coat of cheap waterproof mascara on first, then apply gel, fiber, then set with gel again.  I also do the entire process one lid at a time (rather than mascara on every lid, gel on every lid, etc.)  While this does take a few weeks to arrive it always comes sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> This product would be a zero rating if they had one. There&#x27;s only enough fibers for ONE application! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I was introduced to the other, more main brand of this product over last summer but couldn&#x27;t really afford it. When I stumbled across this product I was thrilled. It usually lasts all day and only takes a few minutes longer than my old mascara to apply. Sometimes the fiber can shed a little but that doesn&#x27;t happen too often. Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Dangerous ingredients. Try the real Fiberlash mascara instead. You get what you pay for. Youniqueproducts.com/evelin</li>
    <li> I like this, but as someone else mentioned it does fall into your eyes.  Doesn&#x27;t really thicken and I did at least 5 coats. It also took a month before I received it.</li>
    <li> Maybe a little longer and thicker lashes when using this but nothing to brag about and if the little fuzzies flake off into your eyeball when applying or throughout the day like mine did you are going to have a bad time.</li>
    <li> Clumpy was not happy with the product. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> First time I ordered it I must have gotten a bad batch.  It was very runny. IDecided to try it again I&#x27;ve ordered it twice since then and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product.  The company has great customer service. The price is a lot less than the name brands. Works as good.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast.  But it&#x27;s just a terrible product.</li>
    <li> works pretty well. takes a while to get used to though</li>
    <li> I love it! I was going to buy the other product but wanted to try this first and im happy i did!</li>
    <li> I think this mascara is good, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the clumpy mascara.  I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get it not to clump up. When I put the 2nd tube on, the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; part, the little black fibers  get everywhere under my eyes, in my eyes. It was just ok. Not super lengthy like I had expected.  I personally feel like I get better results just from my own Mabeline mascara.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I don&#x27;t think I will buy anything else! I kept one set for myself and one set for my mother, she is hooked on it too! I have been using my one set for 2 months almost daily, and I still have plenty to go. It does feel like the fibers get in my eyes sometimes, but the sensation goes away shortly.</li>
    <li> Came in on time and I loveeeeee it!!! My lashes are so long it&#x27;s not even funny. It does exactly what it says it does!! Like I&#x27;m in love and will never go back to my other mascara! Will be buying in the future. ❤️</li>
    <li> I purchased the younique brand of this a few weeks ago for myself. My sister and grandmother wanted to try some out so I order this for them. Needless to say this works better than my more expensive younquie brand and in considering ordering this for myself and trashing the younique.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had ordered this, but in a knock off version. When she raved about it, I decided to go ahead &amp; search for it. What I got wasn&#x27;t a knock off... &amp; I got 4 whole tubes!! I received my package in ONE DAY. Super satisfied!! I wish I could post photos of my experience. My lashes are superb with this product. Will absolutely order again!! I highly recommend to anyone who is iffy about trying it. Just stop reading my review right now, &amp; order!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the brand name fiber mascaras of the same kind. It&#x27;s a bit hard to understand how to use it so I had to look it up online, but it works perfectly. The only thing negative is that sometimes the fibers fall off onto your face/eyes but it&#x27;s such a great value and works well. Also lasts surprisingly well in water.</li>
    <li> TOO FLAKY LEVES STUFF ALL AROUND MY EYES</li>
    <li> Not as great as I thought it would be. It&#x27;s okay, but I swapped to a more expensive kind of mascara instead</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Don&#x27;t wAste money on younique.</li>
    <li> I love mascara and wanted to try this after all the positve reviews ive seen. The shipping took awhile seeing that it shipped from china kinda explained alot but was defenitly worth the wait. I do see a difference from my normal mascara. The fibers do fall off if you dont put enough gel on. Overall im happy with the purchase     Okay i bought this a second time because i loved it. I recieved 2 sets of mascara one is fine but the other is has a dent on the top. I also recieved a different mascara all together. My previous mascara from the same company came in 2 boxes with alot of chinese wrighting on the boxes. This time i recieved the mascara in clear packages with wrighting i could understand directions and all.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  It works so good and it is so worth 7$💜💜💜💜💜</li>
    <li> I love it I was amazed it was like my lashes  were growing</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Make sure you do a little at a time. To avoid fibers in the eyes. Cleaning off is easy. Good luck</li>
    <li> Pros: this product doesn&#x27;t make my lashes clumpy and does make my lashes a lot longer without making them too spidery Cons: this product smells SOOOO BAD. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the one I got but the transplanting gel (not really the fibers) smells terrible. But since I just hated to throw it away, I tried it anyway. It definitely wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought it was going to be. Also, the shipping took FOREVER. It was also almost a week late. It came over a month after I ordered it and who even has time for that. Should you get it? I wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m going to be honest, this product is very sketchy who knows what they put in this stuff (this is coming from someones who never buys high end makeup and doesn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a little sketchy because I love cheep). You can buy much better mascara for the same price or cheeper.</li>
    <li> The fibers fell off into my eyes and hurt quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I love the results, however it does cause a little irritation due to the fibers. All in all its an OK product it didn&#x27;t do much more then what my favorite mascara miss manga can do. And due to the irritation from the fibers I probably will not &#x27;re purchase. Plus the time it takes to actually get the product was to long. I understand it comes from China so that&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. However it is worth the 6.00 for 2 sets. If the actual younique brand is the same so glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it. I would have been very upset.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product however, after paying an extra $10 for 2 day delivery,it took a few more days but other than that i would recommend this product,i have tried the same thing in a different  ($40) brand and this is exactly the same!</li>
    <li> This mascara is a very great product, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat that. I recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;re looking to pay a little less for fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara.  It builds long full lashes.  I am a natural medium blonde with thin lashes.  I love how this makes my lashes look thick and long.  I would say this works just about as good as false lashes with much less effort.  You can make them look even more dramatic for a nighttime look by building up an extra coat or two.  They wash off easily with no raccoon eye effect.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Perfect price! The length of my lashes longer and fuller! My sister and I are both happy because we each got two sets.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but if you order this, expect to receive only 3 tubes.  I am sadly not the only person who received just 3 tubes in the mail.  It is a good price, but there&#x27;s probably a reason.  The packaging for them is crappy and was sliced open at the top and bottom, making it easy for the tubes to fall out.  I picked up the package and they all slid out the bottom.  I am actually quite shocked that I got 3 considering the condition of the packaging.  If you go in expecting 2 or maybe 3 tubes, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed when you are missing a tube.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Kinda clumpy your first few times but once you get the hang of it it looks great!!</li>
    <li> this product works great!</li>
    <li> Holy  lashes!!! This product is pretty amazing. I was kind of skeptical of te 3d fiber lashes mascaras I&#x27;ve been hearing about. It&#x27;s almost too good to be true. I was intrigued by the moodstruck 3d mascara all over Instagram but not willing to spend $30 on a mascara I was skeptical of. After using this the first time there is no need to spend that much money. This one does it all. I put it on one eye compared have something to compare it to and the results spoke for themselves! I rushed to write this review. I applied 2 coats and im addicted. I did a 3rd application to see how long I could push the boundaries and omg it&#x27;s incredible. 3d fiber lashes are god sent!</li>
    <li> It took a little practice to figure out how to use this product, but now that I&#x27;ve figured what works best for me (the transfer mascara is stinky so I use my own mascara) I swear by it!&lt;br /&gt;More affordable than the popular Younique and the same results!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I&#x27;ve never layered it on for dramatic night time use, but it is PREFECT for daytime wear!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> When I used, even after 3 coats I did not get the result I expected. Will try a different, more expensive brand next time. I will say it is a good price for 4 tubes though.! I used one set and gave the other to a family member to try!</li>
    <li> Incredibly fast shipping - received the next day when using my Prime. This product is as good as Younique (yes, I have used theirs as well). Save yourself some money and buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it! I took a pic with regular mascara on one eye and this on the other - the difference is amazing. Half of my office has bought this product because of me.</li>
    <li> The price is good for the amount you get, but they dry out quickly. As far as effect goes, this mascara gives me same result as using a primer  from urban decay and their perversion mascara (my current go to). I didn&#x27;t dislike it but wasn&#x27;t impressed either.</li>
    <li> This purchase was based on the great reviews.  However, once applied (according to directions), I find my eyelashes clumping together, Once dried, it readily flakes off. I definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lengthing mascaras before. This product is the cheapest I&#x27;ve tried, very easy to apply, and washes off easier than my regular mascara.  I&#x27;m a natural blonde and have blonde eyelashes and this mascara really makes my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> not as GREAT as i was hoping but it def. helps and looks okay. but for what i paid and got....cant complain :)</li>
    <li> I seriously love how these products leave my eyelashes. As with any other product applied to the eyes, be careful not to let it get in your eyes. I will say though, I have sensitive eyes, but neither product irritates my eyes so far. I love it</li>
    <li> At first I HATED THESE!!!! However, there is an amazing technique. For me! I brush a even thin layer of my own mascara. Let it dry, then apply the gel. It does get a little messy, but you will get the hang of it. I ditched the fiber tube, it got in my eyes and felt like dust. But I LOVE the product now. It stays on all day and comes off in the shower. I&#x27;ll purchase again :)</li>
    <li> It did take awhile to get here, but it was well worth it and money well spent. My lashes look soooooo much longer and fuller. And the fibers don&#x27;t fall off or irritate my eyes which was a big concern since I wear contacts. I will be ordering again 👌👌👌👍👍</li>
    <li> This actually really does work and makes your lashes pretty long. The set back is the fibers get all over your face and into your eyes so if your like me and do your mascara after you put on your base you will have to re do it after getting all the fibers off your face. I now have learned and do my mascara very first thing and put makeup remover on a cotton ball to remove it all off before I do my base.  All and all great product for the price and I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> The product itself is a great product it all works amazingly and lengthens you eyelashes making them look like false ones, i even got asked if mine were falsies.&lt;br /&gt;  However the only down side is that there aren&#x27;t that many fibers in the fiber tube, literally whats on the brush is what you get, youd think the size difference in the two tubes were to make them last the same amount of time as eachother but they don&#x27;t, which is a huge shame for me.&lt;br /&gt;  Also when the fibers go in your eyes, which happens no matter how good you are at putting make up on, it is so irritating and can last up to an hour, for me anyway. They also go on your above eyelid which if you have eye shadow on already can ruin your look completely.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara.  I was skeptical at first and even kind of afraid to use it but now it&#x27;s a love story.  I loved false eye lashes since they gave my non existent lashes a beautiful look but this is every bit as good as my false eye lashes and much more comfortable.  Also so much cheaper than most national brand mascara (Lancôme, etc).  Easy to use and easy to remove. Will shout it from the roof tops!  No regrets at all!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my eyes irritated..I tried it twice to make sure and both times my eyes were itching, red and swollen for 2 days after wearing this product.  I would not recommend it if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Cheap made in China!!</li>
    <li> Does not dry out fast, i have had mine for much longer than other mascaras &amp; its holding on! You MUST put it on when the gel is wet. Builds easily...too easily. I LOVE SPIDER LASHES! so this is the mascara for me.</li>
    <li> Shipping took over a month buy love the product</li>
    <li> I love this product! Especially since it&#x27;s so inexpensive! Fast shipping and a great price, can&#x27;t beat that! I will never use a different mascara again!</li>
    <li> It did take me a few days to get the hang of this, but once I did, I really really like it.</li>
    <li> glad to get these....I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I hear it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> one tube of mascara was completely dry, and two tubes of fibers were empty.&lt;br /&gt;i would not buy this again. i try to save money with this but actually i throw away $15 in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great mascara! Not only does it make your lashes thicker and longer but it also helps your lashes hold a curl! My lashes are naturally long and bone strait, I curl them with an eye lash curler. With some mascaras my lashes will fall and not hold a curl because the mascara is so heavy. Not with this mascara jell, it holds my lashes in the perfect curl! Love this stuff! The only problem or inconvenience is how long it takes to get it.... but I think it&#x27;s totally worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> Orderd 2 sets only received 1. It is a good product. But want my other set.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item unaware it was shipping from China, that was my first mistake. Two months later it finally arrived. I tried the product and the results are pitiful. No volume, limited length, no where near the effect I get from Younique. I should have known you can&#x27;t get a quality product at that price. Also one tube has barely perceptible fibers on the brush and the other one is so caked with fibers they fall all over the place, so obviously no quality control. I also experience a mild burning sensation when I use it. Chalk this one up to experience. :( Totally not worth it!</li>
    <li> Purchasing again... and again and again!</li>
    <li> great set!  I used the otherone for a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a sealed prime box but the plastic was open. The product was made in PRC also known as Peoples Republic of China. It&#x27;s economy makes my eye lashe lengthy and thick. 4 tubes for 12 usd is not bad at all.  Takes time to apply and achieve result. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have owned my own salon for 18 years. I&#x27;ve tried so many of these mascaras for the past year and a half. This was by far the best one. The gel mascara is perfect HOWEVER there are not enough fibers in fiber tube. I was totally shocked. Each fiber tube only lasted a week. I don&#x27;t understand. How much can these fibers actually  cost there are barely any in the tube? I am actually using another tube of fibers from a different company that I purchased a year ago. Thank God I didn&#x27;t throw it away. So as much as I love this product I will not be purchasing it or recommending it to my clients. Very disappointed. So my search is still on.</li>
    <li> I Wear it everyday. I like how I can control the length I want. I wear more modest at the office, and on the weekends I can spice it up. Looks more natural than other options. I do have to put on 2 coats at least to notice a difference for everyday use. 3 coats for more glam.&lt;br /&gt;***** Helpful tips: Clean eyelashes to start with.  When you put the Micro fiber on, do not start at base. This will cause the fibers to get in your eyes. Go half way or just tips. I usually do just tips. I wear contacts also and only applying half of the eyelash helps out a lot. Also, I finish up with my regular mascara. This by itself just looks like I have longer lashes with no mascara. Its time consuming at first but after a week, You will get quicker. Also I do one eye at a time. Seems to do better when wet between coats.</li>
    <li> They got here on time but they look gross to try on</li>
    <li> the fibers were gone after about 4 days/applications :(</li>
    <li> I love the gel consistency of the mascara. I find when using the 2nd bottle to add extra oomph, it works well, but my eyes are itchy.</li>
    <li> I love it, And am so glad I did not have to pay those high prices to get to see how it is. But I really do love it and it does work. Will definitely be buying it every time I get low on mascara. Because it is well worth it. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Price was great. Did take a month to receive in the mail. Sometimes a few small fibers bother my eyes at first but I&#x27;ve gotten my careful with applying it. Very happy</li>
    <li> It measures up fairly well to the more expensive one I tried. Although the fibers are a bit more clumpy and there aren&#x27;t many in the tube. I would buy it again, given the difference in price.</li>
    <li> Same quality as yo unique brand! Super affordable!</li>
    <li> Was expecting better. Just looks like regular mascara.</li>
    <li> LoveAlpha transplanting gel and fiber mascara is great for its price.  I have short, straight and stubborn eyelashes and LoveAlpha actually gives them life.  I am a bit disappointed that I have to use 3 coats of the gel and fibers to achieve the look that I want however, the fact that I have two sets for such an incredibly cheap price makes up for it.  Shipping was super fast and arrived a day early!</li>
    <li> I like it, but doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much product in the tubes</li>
    <li> Worked awesome....for the 1st two days. Then on the 3rd day, realized that the tube containing the fibers was empty already. Would not recommend it. But I guess with this, you really do get wht you pay for. There isnt a negative star or a no star option, so have to rate it at 1 star, even though it doesnt even deserve that.</li>
    <li> is it easy to apply?  it does take more time than the typical mascara, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great for every day wear.  But on the weekends or when I go out it is fun.  Gives a more dramatic look.  The color was black, which is great.  the gel and the fibers are both black.  I have tried the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; version and I like this one just as much.  I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and this was fine.  Maybe a little more eye &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; than usual, but nothing bad.</li>
    <li> Little fibers fall into eyes, but for the price worked nicely.</li>
    <li> Literally a waste of money maybe enough for two uses on top of that it didn&#x27;t do the job my four I received was damn near empty</li>
    <li> Good but takes a while to learn how to get it not to clump</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product because of all the great reviews. I was very dissapointed with quality. Although shipping was fast but product was not so great.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but dislike to fibers.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying with your eyes closed. I even lightly brush my lashes to remove the&lt;br /&gt;extra fibers from flying into my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and really nice product.</li>
    <li> A little hard to remove but love it!</li>
    <li> Worked ok, not that great. And ran out of fibers in about 4 days</li>
    <li> This product was shocking to me. A fibre mascara at that price? Are you kidding me? I love it. Makes my eyelashes look twice and thick.</li>
    <li> the fibers ran out really fast.  I have found a different kind and the fibers last longer.</li>
    <li> By far the best thing since sliced bread ! Seriously I can not do my makeup with out this .</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Easy to apply,  doesn&#x27;t smear and easily washes off.</li>
    <li> once you figure how to put the mascara on without getting fibers in your eye, you can go from a 3 to a strong 8. I did this mascara on one eye, and younique on the other, this product coated individual lashes for a falsies look, where younique was clumpy. I agree on the 300% added volume and length. I have ordered the set of two 3 times. I let everyone use it. like everyone. and one set lasted me about 3 months. also came way earlier than expected. I love this product</li>
    <li> Love this product.  So much more natural than strip lashes.</li>
    <li> I love love this mascara. It&#x27;s amazing. It makes my lashes so long. The only downside is it took over a month to get but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
    <li> I get the same results as a popular lash transplant product for a fraction of the cost! I love it!</li>
