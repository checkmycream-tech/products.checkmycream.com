      <li>not even sure it  was washing my face...</li>
      <li>That said, it foams up nicely, rinses cleanly, and has the tiniest bit of exfoliant.</li>
      <li>Overall, very good cleanser with some scrub.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful clean and fresh smell, and the moisturizers and exfoliation granules are encapsulated so that they &#x27;burst&#x27; when used and leave your skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
      <li>There is no discernible scent, which is important to me.  </li>
      <li>It is a fantastic product my skin feels fresh and very clean</li>

      <li>I was poking around, read the reviews on this cleanser and was excited to try it for the &amp;#34;tightening effect&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I bought it originally because my tried and true cleanser of years is no longer available.  </li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this cleanser any more highly!</li>

      <li>I am 57 years old and this product really helps my face look clearer &amp; more refreshed.</li>

      <li>thank you very much</li>
      <li>Thank you very much from Mary</li>
      <li>it keeps my face clear and smooth</li>
      <li>Steam works to open pores and works better.</li>
      <li>I guess this is my new tried and true.  </li>
      <li>There are so very few beads for exfoliation, so I still use my homemade scrub of sugar, honey, olive oil, lemon juice twice a week which does a much better job of making my skin glow and feel oh so smooth.</li>
      <li>and i really like it.</li>
      <li>do not feel like much - I guess I was expecting a rougher or grain like feel.  </li>
      <li>and I am very picky about products.  </li>
      <li>I felt it was perhaps too gentle to work.  </li>
      <li>It really cleanse my skin</li>
      <li>I purchased this cleanser and the first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face was.  </li>
      <li>I constantly receive compliments on how clear and smooth my skin is.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a decent facewash.  </li>
      <li>This has a very soft and gentle feel to it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend using with spinning faci brush.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this based on the 5 star reviews (no negative reviews at the time), and have been using it for over a month.</li>
      <li>My usual brand is AuraVie, which I love.</li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t have as many little particles in it as I expected, but cleans my face alright</li>
      <li>I am 62 years old.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser, never makes my face feel tight or dry.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet and only a few fine lines under my eyes (expression lines), but I always do my research</li>
      <li>Not too light and definitely not too heavy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent way more on something that does way less!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and the smell is a little off putting.</li>

<li> It assisted in healing my painful acne breakouts &amp; it&#x27;s been very gentle on my skin.</li>
<li> beside the weird smell, it works well the retinol-x regimen...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Mskes face break out.  Will use on rest of body that is not sensitve.</li>
    <li> i love this it keeps my face clear and smooth</li>
    <li> The bottle states &amp;#34;Surgical Alternative,&amp;#34; which could not be more untrue.  That said, it foams up nicely, rinses cleanly, and has the tiniest bit of exfoliant. There is no discernible scent, which is important to me.  I bought it originally because my tried and true cleanser of years is no longer available.  I have purchased three (3) times since my original by.  I guess this is my new tried and true.  I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.... a little dry in spots during the winter...I use this year around.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  It really cleanse my skin and i  follow it with Retinol cream.  I truly recommend tthis product.</li>
    <li> I use it with apricot face scrub,  together ( $ 3 )  in shower- not sink. Doubly effective !  Steam works to open pores and works better. Work it in and leave on 5 minutes or so. Inexpensive AND it works compared to some costly stuff out there. Ebay and Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply also has it. You can feel the difference after 1 use / scrub.  Using both together has gotten rid of scars I had from hitting a windshield in 1995. No wrinkles either. Eliminates the occasional zit I get during PMS week.</li>
    <li> Used for a while... Like it, feels great, seems to suit my skin and have the posted clarifing effects.. &amp;#34;Anti Ageing&amp;#34;??? Not too sure about this though!&lt;br /&gt;Tingles pleasantly as you wash..</li>
    <li> It is a fantastic product my skin feels fresh and very clean and I can see improvement in my skin Thank you very much from Mary</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I will never use anything else. It really shrinks pores and makes my face feel great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the 5 star reviews (no negative reviews at the time), and have been using it for over a month. Honestly I don&#x27;t think it lives up to the claim on the tube &amp;#34;surgical alternative&amp;#34;.  There are so very few beads for exfoliation, so I still use my homemade scrub of sugar, honey, olive oil, lemon juice twice a week which does a much better job of making my skin glow and feel oh so smooth. My face doesn&#x27;t really feel refreshed and clean after using this and there is no &amp;#34;improved texture or radiance&amp;#34;. (My skin felt more refreshed when I used Noxema).  On the plus side, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this product to get foaming and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but to me it just doesn&#x27;t do enough to warrant another purchase especially when the price went from $9 to $13!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST cleanser I have ever used. It cleans, exfoliates, moisturizes and clears up dark spots and blemishes. It has a wonderful clean and fresh smell, and the moisturizers and exfoliation granules are encapsulated so that they &#x27;burst&#x27; when used and leave your skin squeaky clean and soft. I cannot recommend this cleanser any more highly!</li>
    <li> I thought this face wash would be what I was looking for, something that would exfoliate as it washed. Nope not even sure it  was washing my face...</li>
    <li> My usual brand is AuraVie, which I love. I was poking around, read the reviews on this cleanser and was excited to try it for the &amp;#34;tightening effect&amp;#34;. I used it for about 3 weeks and threw it away. The glow I had before was gone and my face did not look as good. I&#x27;m sticking with AuraVie.</li>
    <li> Love it !! i ve been using this product for almost a year now and i really like it. It is a winner</li>
    <li> Been using this wash with my facial brush for years. It assisted in healing my painful acne breakouts &amp; it&#x27;s been very gentle on my skin. Highly recommend using with spinning faci brush. I use one made by &amp;#34;toilet tree&amp;#34; brand &amp; I&#x27;ll never go without it.</li>
    <li> beside the weird smell, it works well the retinol-x regimen...</li>
    <li> Tried it and loved it. I only use it once a week because my skin is very delicate but it works.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using it glad I tried it will probably try it again thank you very much</li>
    <li> Seemed to clear up my face (I just finished the entire tube) but it took a little time.  The &amp;#34;scrubbing beads&amp;#34;  do not feel like much - I guess I was expecting a rougher or grain like feel.  This has a very soft and gentle feel to it.  I felt it was perhaps too gentle to work.  But I think it did.  My face is clearer (I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s).  I do not like the Sodium Laureth Sulfate in it however and that&#x27;s why I will probably not purchase again.  I did not realize this until I was about half finished with the tube.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made a tremendous difference or anything but it&#x27;s a decent facewash.  I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I am 57 years old and this product really helps my face look clearer &amp; more refreshed. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just meh. Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference and the smell is a little off putting.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, never makes my face feel tight or dry. I am 59.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product from &#x27;Marshalls&#x27; for $5.99. I&#x27;m 3 days into using this product, no noticeable changes yet. will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and makes my face feel wonderful! I love the price too! So between those two I don&#x27;t really see how you can go wrong! I&#x27;ve spent way more on something that does way less!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t have as many little particles in it as I expected, but cleans my face alright</li>
    <li> The Retinol-X Anit-Aging Gel Cleanser is wonderful.  It deep cleans my skin yet is it gentel.  My skin is smoother, brighter and definetely tighter.  I would definetely recommend this cleanser to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Used it before...it works for me .</li>
    <li> Excellent deep cleaning cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes me skin feel very soft and only takes a few days of continuous use to work.</li>
    <li> It is very gentle on my skin but cleans it well. My skin got smoother. I definetely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff works like a charm!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of cleansers and they all seemed to dry out my face.  I purchased this cleanser and the first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my face was.  This is an excellent cleanser and it also helped to firm my face in areas that needed it (chin line).  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet and only a few fine lines under my eyes (expression lines), but I always do my research and I am very picky about products.  I get asked if I am in my twenties all the time and at my age, it&#x27;s awesome.  I use it twice a day and love it.  I highly recommend this cleanser.  Take it from someone who has tried just about everything.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a very effective product.  Started using the product a year ago.  I constantly receive compliments on how clear and smooth my skin is.  I am 62 years old.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture of the soap. Overall, very good cleanser with some scrub. Not too light and definitely not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love this, cannot live without it</li>
    <li> Really  good  product.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, but make sure you have decent moisturizer creams to follow up.  Retinol can make your face feel too tight, depending on what you are used to.</li>
