      <li>The commercial makes it look like it&#x27;s this beautiful color ( just as it appears in the case) when you put it on your eyes,what you get is a smeared, uneven mess.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this color its amazing and the pigmentation is incredible.  I will be ordering more colors. Lasts all day and looks great.  A Must have !!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to celebrate men&#x27;s health month.  I got so many compliments. Truly a beautiful color. A good remover is needed to take it off, Remember it is called color tattoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this color and a gold one as well. I was super excited. It didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectation. It seems to crease after awhile and it&#x27;s not as intense as I was hoping. I did create an amazing look but it took me awhile to perfect with this shadow.</li>
    <li> Love it great seller very impressed color matches picture perfect so I got more then what I expected great thanks</li>
    <li> the color is awesome, stays put like it is supposed to and i have received lots of compliments when i wear it!</li>
    <li> Really love these shadows alone but even more with glittery shadow over the top, holds it in place,  Went camping and wore it to bed two nights in a row and even on the third day my shadow still looked as good as when I applied it.</li>
    <li> So...am I the only one that uses this to color sections of my hair? I&#x27;m an African American woman with coarse hair and I&#x27;m not ready to color my hair again. On certain days when I want to add a little bit of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; I apply this to a few strands and I get compliments. The blue in my hair looks great and of course it washes out easy. I learned this trick from the Curly Nikki website. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and cant&#x27; speak on its intended purpose but I&#x27;m sure it makes an amazing eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> VIBRANT COLOR.  LONG WEARING.</li>
    <li> I am a darker complicit black woman and this color looks absolutely beautiful on me. Everytime  I wear it i get complements. It applies easily and stays on all day. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I love the whole line of L&#x27;Oreal color tattoo. Stays all day long and color is just like the picture.</li>
    <li> Lovely bright color. I love these cream eyeshadows as they do not gravitate to creases and age lines. I think that I have purchased almost every color available. I pray that Maybelline never discontinues this line as I gravitate to these over much more expensive brands in my collection.</li>
    <li> Stays on for a long, long time</li>
    <li> Beautiful but not the same blue like the picture above.</li>
    <li> The commercial makes it look like it&#x27;s this beautiful color ( just as it appears in the case) when you put it on your eyes,what you get is a smeared, uneven mess. Glad I only bought one!!!</li>
