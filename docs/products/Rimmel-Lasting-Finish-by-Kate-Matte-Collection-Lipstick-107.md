      <li>It is worth the price!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many nice compliments since I started wearing it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t glow, something that makes me love it even more</li>
      <li>Worn together on the lips (one color on top, one color on bottom)</li>
      <li>My most favorite lipstick ever.</li>
      <li>Love,  love, love this color.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to blot my lipstick more than most people because I prefer more of a stained look.</li>
      <li>Lovely colour and smell.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>This lipstick looked lovely on Kate...</li>
      <li>I was so glad that Amazon had it.  </li>
      <li>This is without a doubt the best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried for such an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The color is wonderful, especially for fall.</li>
      <li>Instead, I fell in love and ended up buying two more tubes.</li>
      <li>Beautiful red lipstick very smooth applying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice lipstick, the product is true to its name, and if I hadn&#x27;t already found my perfect shade of bright red, I&#x27;d definitely try the one from this line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and shipping was fast ❤</li>
      <li>On me this color is very wearable, slightly more so than Heaux, which I really love.</li>
      <li>My favorite fall lipstick right now</li>
      <li>I actually think the finish looks really nice as is, and I love that I don&#x27;t need a lip pencil for #107.</li>
      <li>It came in a beautiful little box.</li>
      <li>gorgeous color, a bit dry, but applied over lip balm</li>
      <li>I FINALLY found a lipstick I LOVE!</li>
      <li>I recommend to all women who want to show off their pretty lips!</li>
      <li>perfect shade of dark red.</li>
      <li>It looks great on women of color (I&#x27;m African American).  </li>
      <li>I love #107 and would definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>The only difference is the texture - MAC has a much better feel.</li>
      <li>You can tell they really worked to make this lipstick work!</li>
      <li>the pretty tube is just a plus.</li>
      <li>have fallen in love with Kate lipstick and this specific shade.</li>
      <li>The finish is smooth and matte, and the color is a nice deep shade of red</li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but someone who wants a very matte lipstick, might want to dab a pressed powder over it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very wear and go lipstick.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous red color with a slightly pink undertone!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out like a lot of other matte lipsticks and the color is so rich and full.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with fair skin and cool undertones, so when I had to purchase this color for my dance team, I thought I&#x27;d look ridiculous in it.</li>
      <li>my favorite red lipstick to date, especially since its not high-end.</li>
      <li>It really does last a long time and doesn&#x27;t need much touching up.</li>
      <li>It can be a very classy look.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I&#x27;ve been longing to find a Pretty red Lipstick  for my Chocolate complexion.</li>
      <li>So, it tugs on the lips a little bit, and it needs a lip pencil to keep it from bleeding into the fine lines.</li>
      <li>Kate&#x27;s #107 goes on like a soft, velvet matte, which glides on the lips with no tugging.</li>
      <li>After trying it on at home and comparing it to my other lipsticks, I went back to the store and bought every tube they had available.</li>
      <li>but it doesnt dry your lips, its very moist.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s dark but not too much that wouldn&#x27;t allow you to use it all the time!</li>
      <li>not so dark it looks black but not so light its cherry.</li>
      <li>Stay color very well and dark red.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Or... I sometimes wear it with a leather jacket to look edgy and cool.</li>

<li> Or... I sometimes wear it with a leather jacket to look edgy and cool.</li>
<li> I have extremely pale skin, and on my lips, the colors are very close.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t look black or purple, like it does in the photo; it&#x27;s very distinctively a dark red.</li>
<li> It stays put with or without lip liner and doesn&#x27;t smear all over my face or teeth, and the finish does last a long time!</li>
<li> it lasts for a long time and it moisture your lips too.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear something this dark every day, but I like it enough to keep it around for when I want to make a statement.</li>
<li> The color is definitely deep red with a very slight pink undertone.</li>
<li> Lips are never dry nor do my lips ever feel heavy.</li>
<li> I like the texture specially, not so much the color.</li>
<li> My girl likes the product but complained that it made her lips dry even after she apply chap stick prior to her lips...</li>
<li> but I guess I should have expected that!  </li>
<li> have tried other product</li>
<li> A dark burgendy without being too vampy.</li>
<li> Kate is slightly pinker.</li>
<li> odd texture when you apply it</li>
<li> Heaux is slightly darker.</li>
<li> and I am truly obsessed with this color in particular.  </li>
<li> , it never feels tight either.</li>
<li> After a few seconds, it settles into a matte, but it still has a faint sheen.</li>
<li> This lipstick was very hard for me to find and</li>
<li> As long as I don&#x27;t hate the scent, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br</li>
<li> The color is buildable, so you can make it as dramatic as you want.</li>

    <li> Omg! Beautiful red lipstick very smooth applying. A perfect matte finish! Finely a red color that fits my complection. This lipstick was very hard for me to find and plus it was delivered quickly!😍</li>
    <li> I FINALLY found a lipstick I LOVE! This lipstick goes on, stays on, and comes of PERFECT. The color is wonderful, especially for fall. I will be buying this brand again! It came in a beautiful little box. You can tell they really worked to make this lipstick work! It is worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> Love,  love, love this color.  A dark burgendy without being too vampy. Great fall color</li>
    <li> My girl likes the product but complained that it made her lips dry even after she apply chap stick prior to her lips...so keeps this in mind before you want to make a purchase, but then again it just might be my girl&#x27;s lips...who knows...LOL!</li>
    <li> My most favorite lipstick ever. Found my perfect color. Lips are never dry nor do my lips ever feel heavy. Condition it arrived in was perfect btw, thank you.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy Rimmel again.  This lipstick looked lovely on Kate...but I guess I should have expected that!  It looks nothing on like it does in the ads.  The color is very bright in reality, more like MAC&#x27;s Ruby Woo, which I already own.  The only difference is the texture - MAC has a much better feel.</li>
    <li> I like the texture specially, not so much the color. It&#x27;s just not the color I&#x27;m used to, but all in all it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> gorgeous color, a bit dry, but applied over lip balm it looks amazing. my favorite red lipstick to date, especially since its not high-end.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lipstick it is absolutely beautiful, the color is just so nice! It smells lovely and the formula is great</li>
    <li> I bought this color because I read online that #107 is a dupe for Heaux by MAC. I have extremely pale skin, and on my lips, the colors are very close. I swatched both lipsticks side by side and they are both beautiful berry tone reds. Kate is slightly pinker. Heaux is slightly darker. Worn together on the lips (one color on top, one color on bottom) no one will notice unless you tell them. Both lipsticks are matte, but Heaux&#x27;s retro matte finish makes it a drier lipstick. So, it tugs on the lips a little bit, and it needs a lip pencil to keep it from bleeding into the fine lines. Kate&#x27;s #107 goes on like a soft, velvet matte, which glides on the lips with no tugging. After a few seconds, it settles into a matte, but it still has a faint sheen. That doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, but someone who wants a very matte lipstick, might want to dab a pressed powder over it. I actually think the finish looks really nice as is, and I love that I don&#x27;t need a lip pencil for #107. It&#x27;s a very wear and go lipstick. Also, the watermelon-like scent is pleasant. On me this color is very wearable, slightly more so than Heaux, which I really love. Overall, #107 is an awesome lipstick for a great price. After trying it on at home and comparing it to my other lipsticks, I went back to the store and bought every tube they had available. I love #107 and would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous red color with a slightly pink undertone! The color is buildable, so you can make it as dramatic as you want. Love the matte finish!</li>
    <li> Just received this Lipstick in the mail. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because I&#x27;ve been longing to find a Pretty red Lipstick  for my Chocolate complexion. I&#x27;m very pleased and shipping was fast ❤</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried for such an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;I have fallen in love with Kate lipstick and this specific shade.

    <li> My favorite fall lipstick right now, it&#x27;s AMAZING</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick and all I can say it is amazing, the color looks awesome. it lasts for a long time and it moisture your lips too. Moreover, The shipping company was so informative and keep me posted about my order location.</li>
    <li> This is perfect. Perfect color and perfect texture. It doesn&#x27;t glow, something that makes me love it even more and it&#x27;s dark but not too much that wouldn&#x27;t allow you to use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with fair skin and cool undertones, so when I had to purchase this color for my dance team, I thought I&#x27;d look ridiculous in it.

It doesn&#x27;t look black or purple, like it does in the photo; it&#x27;s very distinctively a dark red. The scent is sort of fruity? I&#x27;m ambivalent about scent in lipsticks, to be honest. As long as I don&#x27;t hate the scent, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to blot my lipstick more than most people because I prefer more of a stained look. Once I&#x27;ve blotted, it becomes just that: a deep, matte stain. It stays put with or without lip liner and doesn&#x27;t smear all over my face or teeth, and the finish does last a long time! I wouldn&#x27;t wear something this dark every day, but I like it enough to keep it around for when I want to make a statement. It can be a very classy look. Or... I sometimes wear it with a leather jacket to look edgy and cool. It&#x27;s a nice change of character. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this line any time soon. It&#x27;s a nice lipstick, the product is true to its name, and if I hadn&#x27;t already found my perfect shade of bright red, I&#x27;d definitely try the one from this line.</li>
    <li> perfect shade of dark red. not so dark it looks black but not so light its cherry. its a matte but it doesnt dry your lips, its very moist. it has a great fruity scent, like watermelon or something. odd texture when you apply it but it does go away once its on, it never feels tight either. the pretty tube is just a plus.</li>
    <li> I took this from my daughter and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I was so glad that Amazon had it.  It looks great on women of color (I&#x27;m African American).  The matte finish is awesome, go and get it!!!!!</li>
    <li> It has a beautiful fruity smell, it is highly pigmented and has a great color and texture! Product also came in a timely manner... I would recommend it for women of all complexions.</li>
    <li> Lovely colour and smell. Glides on beautifully</li>
    <li> Stay color very well and dark red.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Great color but the texture is a bit annoying to wear</li>
    <li> Its a beautiful shade and it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other product but I like all of Kate Moss&#x27;s shades.</li>
    <li> I have two lipsticks from this line and I am truly obsessed with this color in particular.  It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t dry out like a lot of other matte lipsticks and the color is so rich and full.  The color is definitely deep red with a very slight pink undertone. Very nice.</li>
