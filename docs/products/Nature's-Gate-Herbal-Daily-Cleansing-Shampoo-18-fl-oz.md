      <li>i have been using this for over 30 years and love the shampoo forever!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>NATURE&#x27;S GATE IS ALWAYS AMAZING</li>
      <li>This lathers nicely and makes hair shiny.</li>
      <li>If your looking for suds this is not the shampoo for you, but that&#x27;s the kind it is, no sulfate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect natural conditioner.</li>
      <li>Basically, I think the product smells lovely, kind of like incense, which made me want to purchase it.</li>
      <li>Without the sulfates, organic type shampoos do need more to get the job done</li>
      <li>i think its no big deal ...since this is a great value shampoo!!...</li>
      <li>i am always wondering if there is something better....</li>
      <li>I love the scent.  </li>
      <li>It controls static</li>
      <li>and many many times my nr 1 problem with shampoo is ...that i have problems to get all of it out of my hair...</li>
      <li>This has to be the most gently-odored shampoo ever made - it isn&#x27;t at all perfume-y.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you like Aveda products and their super-herbal scent you&#x27;ll love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It does pretty good to get my hair clean.</li>
      <li>Cleans well, but the fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
      <li>Very herbal and earthy, but still pleasant and is not too feminine or powerful.</li>
      <li>That it smells great cannot be emphasized enough, like high-quality incense.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s sulfate free that it isn&#x27;t drying.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good price, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve used and loved other Nature&#x27;s Gate products (the [[ASIN:B000ACB09I C for Yourself facial serum]] is wonderful!)</li>
      <li>But ti felt like WAY to much to clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I heard using organic, natural herbal shampoo is good for your scalp/hair.  </li>
      <li>It is not made with fillers that leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells good and is gentle, but it contains a fair amount of jojoba oil, which made my fine hair feel greasy and slightly limp after three washes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true unless you use a conditioner, as I do.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s vegan/cruelty free, and I liked it because it was cheap &amp; simple</li>
      <li>i hope you love it just as much as i do...</li>
      <li>It is pleasant, but a little overwhelming</li>
      <li>Scent is unlike anything else experienced before with other shampoos.</li>
      <li>Super dissapointed I payed for this.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s paraben-free, natural, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
      <li>So really, I just want my hair clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and lathers beautifully.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now, ever since we moved to a place with soft water, and I can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
      <li>After making my own &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; for 3 years (Baking soda and vinegar route) and struggling with long hair that was breaking sure to not enough conditioning from the BS&amp;V method, I tried weekly hair masks with coconut oil to no avail.</li>
      <li>I am really satisfied with my purchase of Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleaning Shampoo.</li>
      <li>bought this partially based on the reviews that say it smells nice, but to me it smells like flea treatment.</li>
      <li>My whole family loves the scent!  </li>
      <li>I actually had to double-check the label after I used it to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally bought a pet product.</li>
      <li>Much luck !  </li>
      <li>Glad you can order it though Amazon because local store here does not carry it anymore.</li>
      <li>fragrance was a little strong at first, but now I love it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels a little cleaner and smoother than with the other stuff, and as I&#x27;ve noted before, it smells incredible!</li>
      <li>I wash only every other day, and it did a great job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair recently and noticed that the clumps of hair in my bath tub has been less since using this product, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many shampoos; some natural, some not, some expensive, some cheap...</li>
      <li>The name of the shampoo tells much.</li>
      <li>much...</li>
      <li>It cleans really well</li>
      <li>Sadly, I find that I have to alternate it with other shampoos to get the best results long-term (which is the case for all shampoos), but I&#x27;d use it every day if I could, just to be able to smell it!</li>
      <li>and i really have to say you NEED  the conditioner with it ...</li>
      <li>I researched all the organic/sulfate free shampoos sold at my local store and chose this brand/</li>
      <li>Gentle organic shampoo.</li>
      <li>a whole lot</li>
      <li>Cleans your hair and doesn&#x27;t do anything very fancy.</li>
      <li>So I wanted a basic, more natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like a factory.</li>
      <li>Very nice shampoo, I did&#x27;t give 5 stars only because of little bit stronger</li>
      <li>I really think it performs better than other shampoos that cost three times as much.</li>
      <li>hear the other formulations are better, so I won&#x27;t give up on this company.</li>
      <li>it foams perfectly....way better than other shampoos...</li>
      <li>only drawback was the amount of shampoo I needed to clean my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is long, straight, fine and not very thick</li>
      <li>I am a shampoo fanatic, and I love natural products, so I was excited to give this a try.</li>
      <li>Yes, I loved the BS&amp;V method and how basic it was, but my long hair (used to be short) was not having it.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now, and my hair is still not acting quite right.  </li>
      <li>I know I&#x27;m very sensitive....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need conditioner when I use this, and my hairstylist was stunned when I said I usually never use any.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re still young</li>
      <li>i never said anything because  of my busy schedule...</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft yet manageable.  </li>
      <li>I feel this shampoo is probably more suited to people with thick and/or curly</li>
      <li>: my hair&#x27;s a rebel and shampoo gimmicks like Volumizing or Balsam &amp; Protean don&#x27;t phase it, it just keeps being fine, thick, brown, and a little fly-away if I don&#x27;t use a light styling butter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It is not made with fillers that leaves your hair feeling clean. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> NATURE&#x27;S GATE IS ALWAYS AMAZING THE BRAND HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN. Except for this one shampoo. I&#x27;m sorry but this smells disgusting. Super dissapointed I payed for this. This is a wonderful brand, but this particular scent is awful.</li>
    <li> This has to be the most gently-odored shampoo ever made - it isn&#x27;t at all perfume-y.  Sadly, I find that I have to alternate it with other shampoos to get the best results long-term (which is the case for all shampoos), but I&#x27;d use it every day if I could, just to be able to smell it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now, ever since we moved to a place with soft water, and I can&#x27;t say enough good about it. Every shampoo I tried since we moved here but Nature&#x27;s Gate left my hair flat and greasy. My hair -- and this from a person whose hair is fly-away baby-fine, in other words impossible -- actually looks nice these days. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many shampoos; some natural, some not, some expensive, some cheap...and this is the only one I can use every day without having it build up on my hair or overdry it.  I love the scent.  My whole family loves the scent!  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner when I use this, and my hairstylist was stunned when I said I usually never use any.  I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s sulfate free that it isn&#x27;t drying.  I did buy the conditioner for my daughters, because with their long hair they will suffer from tangles, and I can recommend that product as well.  They&#x27;re still young so they wash their hair in the bath rather than the shower, and this conditioner won&#x27;t leave a disgusting residue in the tub like others will.  I really think it performs better than other shampoos that cost three times as much. I&#x27;m a little surprised by the negative reviews here.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoos available today. Glad you can order it though Amazon because local store here does not carry it anymore. It is fantastic shampoo!! Scent is unlike anything else experienced before with other shampoos. Cleans your hair well.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and is gentle, but it contains a fair amount of jojoba oil, which made my fine hair feel greasy and slightly limp after three washes.  I feel this shampoo is probably more suited to people with thick and/or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d known it contained oil before I bought it.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, I did&#x27;t give 5 stars only because of little bit stronger then I like smell.  It is pleasant, but a little overwhelming when you use it, it fades after use.</li>
    <li> I am a shampoo fanatic, and I love natural products, so I was excited to give this a try. I really wanted to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does have a wonderful texture. It&#x27;s thick and lathers beautifully. It cleans well, but maybe a little too well for my thick, wavy hair. My hair was so tangled after I used this shampoo that I couldn&#x27;t comb through it even after conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this partially based on the reviews that say it smells nice, but to me it smells like flea treatment. I actually had to double-check the label after I used it to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally bought a pet product. The fragrance lingered after my hair dried and even through my next wash with a different shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear the other formulations are better, so I won&#x27;t give up on this company. However, I&#x27;ve used and loved other Nature&#x27;s Gate products (the [[ASIN:B000ACB09I C for Yourself facial serum]] is wonderful!), so I think this one just didn&#x27;t suit me. On the bright side, I bet this would make a wonderful pet shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with my purchase of Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleaning Shampoo. This product is very good during the winter months. It controls static so your hair does not stick out all over the place. Smells great too!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my husbands choice for shampoo.  He uses this and only this.&lt;br /&gt;The size container allowed him to take it on trips.  He reminds me when it is time to order more.&lt;br /&gt;The service is great.</li>
    <li> Gentle organic shampoo. Highly recommended. Someone may dislike its smell but I find it acceptable. Will try other products of Natures Gate.</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives me within minutes after washing my hair, scalp itching.  I bought it because of good ratings. It might work for other people just not for me.  I know I&#x27;m very sensitive.... Much luck !  It might work for you.</li>
    <li> After making my own &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; for 3 years (Baking soda and vinegar route) and struggling with long hair that was breaking sure to not enough conditioning from the BS&amp;V method, I tried weekly hair masks with coconut oil to no avail. Yes, I loved the BS&amp;V method and how basic it was, but my long hair (used to be short) was not having it. I researched all the organic/sulfate free shampoos sold at my local store and chose this brand/scent.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance was a little strong at first, but now I love it. Very herbal and earthy, but still pleasant and is not too feminine or powerful. (I have a very strong distaste for nasty perfumes).&lt;br /&gt;It cleaned my hair and left it soft, shiny and clean. I wash only every other day, and it did a great job. (i have thin, wavy hair and semi oily skin.)&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback was the amount of shampoo I needed to clean my hair. Without the sulfates, organic type shampoos do need more to get the job done (the sulfates cause the foam which spreads the cleaning agents) But ti felt like WAY to much to clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried one day using a bit less, and sections of my hair were still oily after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still not sure how it will react long term with my skin, (very finicky sensitive skin prone to breakouts, rashes and hives), but so far no problems.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, but the fragrance is a bit strong for me. It does a good job cleaning without drying out your hair.</li>
    <li> I asked for nature gate regular and that&#x27;s what is shown in the product description  But I got the tea tree shampoo which was leaked when I opened it</li>
    <li> If you like Aveda products and their super-herbal scent you&#x27;ll love this shampoo. It cleans really well and I always follow up with the conditioner that goes with it. I love that it&#x27;s paraben-free, natural, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This lathers nicely and makes hair shiny. Need conditioner with it though.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is as other reviewers have stated: it REALLY has a lot of fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Too much...so sadly will not be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If they could figure out how to reduce that I would buy again.</li>
    <li> i bought this with the conditioner!!!  and i really have to say you NEED  the conditioner with it ...i think its no big deal ...since this is a great value shampoo!!...you always should buy the conditioner too..says my sister ...a hairstylist ...to get the best results on your hair...  a tip: comb your hair with the conditoner in the hair...you need less conditoner and the conditoner gets evenly all over your hair....just in your hair...not on your sculp...  i also do after washing ....spray into the wet hair jojoba oil,castol oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil....if you want hair growth use oils with a lot of vitamin E ...  since i do that i never ever....this will sound sooo weird to you...but i had to cut my hair every month ..because of dry brocken ends...since i do that....i didnt do it in 3 months and my sister normally tells me when i have to cut my hair badly ...but she has not said a thing....so i hope that will work for you as well!!!  my hair is 60 cm long (25inces) so i need a lot of product.....BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE...it foams perfectly....way better than other shampoos...my sculp is perfectly hydrated...i got to the place where i only wash my hair..ONCE A WEEK!!!  and many many times my nr 1 problem with shampoo is ...that i have problems to get all of it out of my hair... i have a lot and when my hair is dry and i have shampoo left i have sticky hair....i hate hate that feeling....so i never had it with this one!!!!!!  so it is worth to try!!!!!!   i tryed since this one 3 other shampoos...you know ...i am always wondering if there is something better....but price/product/ecofriendly/organic/proformance wise this is my nr 1!!!  it took me 6 months to use it up....with other shampoos i use some in a Month!!!   i hope you love it just as much as i do...</li>
    <li> The name of the shampoo tells much. It has a great herbal fragrance which even us manly men will  enjoy! I don&#x27;t shampoo daily, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it performs daily. I shampoo every other day and that&#x27;s enough even for my fairly long, thick, wavy-curly hair. I exercise daily, so after a day without it my hair needs a cleaning! Other reviews advised that this shampoo is not for thick hair. It&#x27;s true unless you use a conditioner, as I do. After applying the conditioner, my hair is pretty tame and compliant. This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner together after reading reviews online. Basically, I think the product smells lovely, kind of like incense, which made me want to purchase it. My hair is long, straight, fine and not very thick and I&#x27;m going to have to say that after using it, my hair was not manageable...at all.  It was tangly to a ridiculous level.  I used it for a few days, hoping maybe my hair had to adjust, but I ended up giving it away to a friend who uses it.  It was strange also, because after going back to another shampoo, I could still smell Nature&#x27;s Gate underneath it.  It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now, and my hair is still not acting quite right.  I considered that maybe this particular shampoo doesn&#x27;t react well to my city water, or to coconut oil, which I sometimes use in my hair, but those are the only reasons I can think of as to why it bombed so badly.  I do not ever use styling products so it couldn&#x27;t be related to that.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a two because I think it smells so great.</li>
    <li> Now I can clean my hair without worrying about putting a whole bunch of unnatural crap in it! Thank goodness!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a project, but I ended up not needing it, so I gave it to a friend who uses Nature&#x27;s Gate.  She loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> If your looking for suds this is not the shampoo for you, but that&#x27;s the kind it is, no sulfate. It does pretty good to get my hair clean.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this wonderful shampoo.  My hair is so soft yet manageable.  The conditioner is great, too.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for over 30 years and love the shampoo forever!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does feel herbal. I like it a lot. Though, like other herbal shampoos, it does make the hair little dry.</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair and doesn&#x27;t do anything very fancy. It lathers a bit less than regular shampoo, but I think that&#x27;s just because it doesn&#x27;t have all those weird chemicals in it. It&#x27;s a good price, I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect natural conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I heard using organic, natural herbal shampoo is good for your scalp/hair.  I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair recently and noticed that the clumps of hair in my bath tub has been less since using this product, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  I also like the price point - not too pricey for the amount you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> Wrong Scent&lt;br /&gt;container was leaking&lt;br /&gt;just mad i never said anything because  of my busy schedule...&lt;br /&gt;thank a whole lot</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful! It cleans thoroughly, head and body, it has a great smell, and it leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> That it smells great cannot be emphasized enough, like high-quality incense. The scent lasts for days yet it&#x27;s not over-powering. Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about two years I used Whole Foods 365 brand plain ol&#x27; shampoo. It&#x27;s vegan/cruelty free, and I liked it because it was cheap &amp; simple: my hair&#x27;s a rebel and shampoo gimmicks like Volumizing or Balsam &amp; Protean don&#x27;t phase it, it just keeps being fine, thick, brown, and a little fly-away if I don&#x27;t use a light styling butter. So really, I just want my hair clean. The 365 stuff worked but smells kinda chemically and I worry about all the chemicals washing into our water shed. So I wanted a basic, more natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t smell like a factory. After some searching and sniffing, I found this gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! My hair feels a little cleaner and smoother than with the other stuff, and as I&#x27;ve noted before, it smells incredible! I love it! My honey loves it! My checkbook loves it! Everybody&#x27;s happy! Exclamation points! Woo!</li>
