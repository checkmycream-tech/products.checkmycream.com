<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He has tried many waxes but never liked them because of the smell. He really liked this brand. It is very hard at first but he just puts it in his pocket or in a cup of hot water and it softens up perfectly. This wax holds all day even after hes been outside working. So far he loves it!!</li>
    <li> I found this difficult to apply and doesn&#x27;t give a very strong hold.  wax must be very warm to be usable and if you&#x27;re fingers are any bit cold the wax will cool too quickly to be able to apply properly.  doesn&#x27;t smell all that great either.  Some people will like it if they live in hot climates and don&#x27;t have to warm the tin and their hands up for 5 minutes under hot water and they want a mediocre hold but not what I&#x27;m looking for.  Pedal Pusher Fancies offers a wax that smells much much much better and gives the same hold without needing to be at such a high temperature to be pliable.</li>
    <li> This wax is legit! The packaging and labeling is simple and great looking. I carry the can around in my pocket throughout the day to warm the wax. Applying it easy and the stuff smells amazing. This is the secondary wax and CanYouHandleBar has a primary that I use as well. The secondary is super strong and holds a solid curl all day. Whether you&#x27;re an experienced handle bar pro or just trying it out this wax is fantastic!</li>
    <li> My dad loves his mustache wax! He kept commenting on the pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He really likes it.  His mustache looks great!</li>
    <li> It makes me feel super dapper.</li>
    <li> You could fight ten grizzly bears, while skydiving, in the middle of a hurricane, and your stache won&#x27;t move an inch with Secondary Wax. I know from experience. I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out for three months so far, and even though I&#x27;ve trimmed it a few times, I&#x27;ve not touched my mustache once. In that time I bought a few different brands of mustache waxes to see which ones I prefer, and I&#x27;ve stopped at Can You Handlebar. Not only does it maintain a worry free, all-day hold, this stuff smells fantastic! Given how hard the wax is, it took a couple tries to the technique down (y&#x27;know heating up the wax in the tin, dispersing it, and shaping my &#x27;stache). My mustache has never looked better! Since using Secondary, not a day has gone by where I&#x27;ve had to worry if my &#x27;stache has become disheveled. In fact it maintains such an iron fisted grip that if my mustache were Russia, Secondary Wax would be Stalin. Can You Handlebar has tamed this wild beast above my lip so well, that as long as this magnificent beard rests upon my mug, they&#x27;ll have me as a life long customer.</li>
    <li> Buy it! Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Tried out about a dozen different moustache waxes when I grew a handlebar. This one is my favorite. It held things together and had staying power - even under the heat of stage lights.</li>
    <li> This is the strongest wax I have used to date. Stiffer than Firehouse.&lt;br /&gt;My beard and mustache have long gone gray, and the hairs are now more wiry and tend to want to go off in directions of their own. This wax is guaranteed to keep them under control. I use the CanYouHandlebar Primary in the base of my mustache, because it&#x27;s plenty sufficient, and easier to work in. I use the Secondary on the tips, where I have the most trouble, and then, no trouble. I&#x27;ve joked with my wife that I think I could suspend a Jeep from my mustache after using this.&lt;br /&gt;This wax does have an amber color to it, which will tint your mustache if it is white or very grey. Not a problem as long as you get it worked all the way through. The Primary is exactly the same tint, so using the combination works fine.</li>
    <li> When my long-trusted brand of wax was no longer available, I started the search for a new wax that would hold all day long, no matter what. This wax, CanYouHandlebar Secondary, is one of the more successful candidates. I find it to be very, very stiff; perhaps even a little too stiff. It was somewhat difficult to work with, even after warming the wax in my hand for several minutes before use. The difficulty of application aside, this wax is amazing. It&#x27;s held all day through the bitterest winter wind, the hottest kitchens, and everything else I&#x27;ve encountered. Even on the most challenging of days this stuff holds so well that I rarely need to regroom my stache. If you&#x27;ve tried everything, and nothing else has worked, and if YouCanHandlebar, maybe this is the wax for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would probably just get the CanYouHandlebar standard if I was to do it again.</li>
    <li> Being unsatisfied with every other moustache wax that I have tried so far, I decided to give CanYouHandlebar a chance.  It arrived lightning fast. I was initially impressed with its hard consistency. It required a little more heat than I was used to applying to soften it up. Once you get it on your moustache, I recommend giving it a shot with the hairdryer once it is on your moustache. A quick comb through and twist and you have a perfect handlebar.&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts. I went to the gym and worked out like a maniac, sweated, wiped my face with a towel ect..... I DID NOT NEED TO REAPPLY!!! I kept twisting and the handlebars kept staying.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to the consistency it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve been wanting for a long time to let my mustache grow out but I&#x27;ve never been able to get past the point where it starts to interfere with my eatin&#x27; hole. Wax is the trick. I got both this secondary wax (aggressive hold) and a tin of primary wax (a bit softer) and now I&#x27;m about a month past where I would have had to trim the beast without the wax. Applying it takes some learning but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out and worth it once you do. And it smells like honey :)</li>
    <li> The Original Mustache Wax by Can You Handlebar is a great facial hair conditioner. It is not greasy at all so you won&#x27;t be walking around with a beard or mustache that looks like you drenched it is crisco oil. This is a solid oil that you can warm up by placing a small amount on your hand and rubbing your hands together to liquefy it. It goes on very smooth, work it into the facial hair with your hands and then comb. It will condition your facial hair as well as help keeping the shape intact and controlled for a very groomed look. This is also unscented so it won&#x27;t overpower any cologne or aftershave that you may be using.</li>
    <li> got this for free or discounted........&lt;br /&gt;Husband said he liked this product, and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great product! I got it for my dad and he absolutely loves it. It is a small product and a bit pricey but if you like quality, this is it. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Ok so I had great expectation in this wax but I have to say that I found it so hard to use that it just wasn&#x27;t worth it. It is very hard and it takes a great deal of heat to melt it to make it usable. Once you get it into your mustache it is quit hard to comb it in and since it hardens so fast it is like combing concrete and it is hard to not have gobs stuck everywhere. The real thing that does it in though is the smell. I hate it. It just smell dirty to me. I just cant bear smelling it all day. This is all my opinion and it seems that some people liked it. I am going to move along to something else.</li>
    <li> Im gonna make it simple for u , DONT NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . Hard as rock thats mean u gonna lose ur money and u not gonna be able to use it i already trow it away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing my handlebar mustache.  I thought &amp;#34;Secondary Wax&amp;#34; would have a stronger hold.  It does a good job, except for when I want tight curls.  It has a light pleasant honey smell, which goes away after drying.  Overall, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is the one I&#x27;ve been looking for! I have been using Fireman&#x60;s and Stach Bomb, too hard and too soft. Can You HandleBar Secondary is just right. On cold mornings  (I live in Wisconsin) I soften it with a hair dryer. The wax smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my gray mustache brown.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used their Primary wax for the past 2 months with great satisfaction. I tried the secondary wax for the past week, and am even more impressed. This stuff has some wicked hold.  If I were a punk rocker, I&#x27;d want to use this to hold up my needed liberty spikes. Instead, I will happily continue to use this for superior hold on my tips, using the primary wax on the upper lip part of the &#x27;stache to keep things tame and in place. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
    <li> Living in Phoenix AZ it gets HOT. I ride a bicycle and motorcycle so air conditioning during travel is not an option. This product, in conjunction with the Prinary wax holds. It holds through the ride, it holds through swimming in the pool. It holds through the shower after the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product initially smells strongly of honey (it&#x27;s beeswax) but that quickly fades within 2 minutes and leaves nothing behind.  Make sure you have a guitar pick or mustache comb handy to remove the wax from the tin for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going for all day hold, want curled tips, or live in a warm climate this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I which they were some instructions on how to best apply it.. it is quite solid, so not sure how to best work with it. I try using a dryer and seems to work. Once applied it definitely holds pretty strong.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the product but the wax came melted allover the tin. I managed to open the tin once, now I can&#x27;t even open it anymore. A real shame.</li>
    <li> Perfect hold all day. Not once did my curls begin drooping or looking awful. No matter what wax I use for my daily, I&#x27;ll be using this to hold the curls from now on.</li>
    <li> Good wax! I have used a lot of others. This is now my go to wax. Hands down, awesome.</li>
    <li> Best mustache wax ever !!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of getting used to working with it, but in all it does hold. Unfortunately I have a rather thick mustache so the tips don&#x27;t stay tightly formed all day, but it does help hold the style and even stays put overnight.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do. It seems to be a little difficult to use at first even after heating but it does last all day. No strong smells and it looks natural when it is thinned out and drys. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. Best stiff hold I&#x27;ve experienced. But...using it takes some time. I am used to a wax in an applicator stick that is easier/convenient to use, but doesn&#x27;t have the hold that this wax does, so its a trade off. If you have the time/patience to soften the wax; apply it; comb it in, etc, then its a great product.</li>
    <li> This Secondary Moustache Wax came in a small tin and is pretty solid inside the tin. We now know to make using it easier that it needs to be warmed up before using either by placing it in your pocket or running hot tap water over the tin while closed. I wish it had come with these instructions with the product rather than me having to read online to figure it out. I received this item for free for my husband to try and review and so these opinions are 100% his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first we weren’t quite sure what the difference was between the primary and secondary waxes so I got online and did more research. So from what I can tell the primary is used when you need a mild hold and the secondary is used when you need a stronger hold. My husband said he doesn’t notice a huge difference between using the two, but he’s not trying to keep a handle bar or anything large and unruly in place. He uses them to keep his beard and mustache neat and tidy when he wants to look nice. Once the tin is a heated up a bit he scoops a small bit out using his fingernail. He rolls it around in his fingertips a bit more to soften it even more then he rubs it into the areas he wants to have stay in place. Since this one is supposed to be stronger with more hold he uses this one more when he’s dressed up for special occasions. He likes that it isn’t a heavily scented product, just a natural look and smell to it. It holds his beard and mustache hairs in place without them feeling stiff and gross feeling. His hairs feel soft and healthy when he uses this product and not waxy and spikey like you would think.</li>
    <li> This wax is quite solid so I put the tin in some boiled water for a few minutes to soften it.. When that didn&#x27;t work, I put it in a pot &amp; let it boil. That managed to work, but as soon as the wax touched my fingers, it clumped up into a hard unusable mass. That&#x27;s a shame because it smells wonderful, like honey. But other than using for aromatherapy, there&#x27;s not much that can be done with it. I received this complimentary in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. The wax has little to no scent, and needs to be warmed up a little in order to use.  The recipient has found that by scooping a small amount out with the back of a comb it will warm quickly between your fingers.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this wax for my husband as a gift. It has become his favorite. Initially, he had trouble opening the containers, but after a few tries, he got it. Tip...don&#x27;t heat it up too much! My husband did, and it caused him to have trouble opening the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The wax itself is great. If you use this along with the primary mustache wax, it&#x27;s so helpful to keep your ends together. It also smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Solid ! unworkable. Does not distribute throughout hair. Difficult to shape with this wax. Wax is noticeable in mustache.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! My fiancé used to use the Clubman kind you find in a retail store and used to apply every hour and it still wouldn&#x27;t hold well... This stuff he applies once in the morning and that is all he needs for the whole day! He has even fallen asleep woke up the next morning and his stache is still on point!! We found the best way to heat it up is before he gets in the shower he takes the wax dish off of my smelly wax melter and sets the CanYouHandlebar with the cap off on top of the hot part and let&#x27;s it warm up so it&#x27;s ready to use once he gets out of the shower! Love it, definitely recommend it and will be purchasing from this company when he needs more!</li>
    <li> a little hard to get warmed up but works well when it does.</li>
    <li> Great hold, but the scent is nasty</li>
    <li> My husband has a thick lovely mustache, but it can get unruly at times. I saw this secondary mustache wax discounted during a promotion and recognized the brand, which I had read a lot of positive reviews for. I bought it, and he absolutely loves it. He said it has no waxy or greasy residue, loves that it has no scent, and it really tames his mustache, even on days when he wakes up and it looks like his mustache had a wilder party night than he did. The extra strength hold ensured his mustache looked great all day without him having to reapply. We&#x27;re definitely going to continue to purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my dad to make a set with the oils and brush and so far he loves it, not much of a scent to this one which is great because it doesn&#x27;t clash with the oil.</li>
    <li> Superb, stiff moustache wax, Holds the end curls of my handlebar nicely. I&#x27;d definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> ** received for review and inspection purposes **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a beard guy, but my gramps is. I sent him the whole set and he likes it (he&#x27;s very hard to please). Use sparingly though. He said the first application, he used too much and it was kind of gooky and super shiny.</li>
    <li> I find it hard to melt</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping the pesky stache hairs off my lips and out my nose, and great customer service as well. Got personal email w9ndering how I liked the wax and been corosponding back n forth since. Company seems to genuinely want to aim n please.</li>
    <li> I have tried four different products so far since sporting the handlebar.  This one is my favorite.  No need to warm it.  Easy to use.  Very nice hold. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a great wax. Its one of the best I&#x27;ve used: it holds through the high humidity and heat of summer in Texas.</li>
    <li> It has mega hold... yes, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a price...well, beyond just the dollar price.  This stuff is rock solid in the tin, and requires some mining and work to make it malleable enough to get into the hairs.  But, dudes, once its in there, it&#x27;s going to keep those wicked curls going.  Or just keeping those wiry &amp;#34;here-I-am!&amp;#34; hairs in line that otherwise have get carefully weeded out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave the tin open during a hot shower, afterwards it seems to be enough to make the initial work far easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Discounted product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> I panned the Primary wax because it didn&#x27;t hold at all. The company&#x27;s owner refunded my money w/o my asking for it and he is to be commended for this. It convinced me to try the next level Secondary wax and it is 100% better! It might even be too stiff, but I can deal with that. This is the real deal, good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great solid wax.  It takes a bit to warm it up for ease of use, but it&#x27;s worth it.  It lasts all day (most days).</li>
    <li> This is the worst wax I have ever used. I followed the instructions by placing the tin-filled wax container in warm and then hot water to make it pliable. Nothing! It was still hard as when I first examined it. Then I tried to roll some wax between my fingers to use my body heat to make it usable. Nothing! It was hard as a brick and crumbled into tiny pieces. I will throw it away.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, on time with no issues.  What more could a guy want?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to get wax for my mustache. This wax is the best!</li>
    <li> great wax, keeps my handlebar moustache in place for hours</li>
    <li> Great hold for the handlebar mustache I have.  I have tried others and either they were like glue and did not look natural or I had to reapply it several time a day.  With Can You Handlebar I apply only two or three times the entire day (usually because of eating and drinking) and it makes the stache hold nicely and look natural.  My highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> One of the best holds I&#x27;ve experienced in my 4 years of using mustache waxes. I like to experiment and try different waxes but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go without this in my collection.</li>
    <li> I have ventured into the world of moustache wax several times before and I have always felt let down.  Not so this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is hard to work with at first, at least until you get the hang of it, but once you do it&#x27;s incredible.  Also, I honestly thing this 1 oz can will last forever.  I&#x27;ve barely made a dent and it&#x27;s been a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No weird smell, no taste of wax on your lips, just excellent hold and a pleasant natural smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough to all the moustachioed gentlemen out there.</li>
    <li> best. hardcore hold no doubt</li>
    <li> Wax lives up to expectations. Great product. Tried several other products and none hold like this wax. Definitely would recommend as this is go to product for hold and style.</li>
    <li> Way stronger than I anticipated. I have to use a hair dryer to loosen it up, but when I do... Man! It&#x27;s amazing. I had used a number of other mustache waxes, but this is the one for doing any curls or tricks.</li>
    <li> Product works wonderfully. A tad hard to work with, but that is to be expected for the excellent level of hold it provides. This is my first full beard and I&#x27;m finding that my facial hair is very unruly. This stuff did the trick and now I can answer the question, Yes, I can definitely HandleBar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product is excellent, what was the icing on the cake was the email from Doug with tips on use that I got after receiving the product. A form email I am sure, but still a nice touch. It&#x27;s that level of service that turns me from a casual customer to a very loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  At first I was concerned with the solidity of this product, but soon realized I could warm it up a bit to get it to work. Definitely worth purchasing this product to style your moustache exactly the way you want!</li>
    <li> My husband was  impressed with this product  consistency. It gets soft when you touch it and goes in easy once you get it on your moustache. made his mustache stay put after he brushed it. He didn&#x27;t reapply during the day and still looked awesome after a day working in the field. I go it at a great deal to offer my honest opinion and this is based on my sole experience with it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! Better hold than I thought it was going to be. Glad to buy a product from the great state of Michigan!</li>
    <li> I have been using Stache Bomb for quite some time now but I was looking for a little extra hold. I purchased Can You Handle Bar Secondary, this product is worthless. It&#x27;s to hard and flaky to properly use. I have tried warming it up with little results. It is the consistency of bees wax.</li>
    <li> You definitely need to heat it up some how, I used a blow dryer for a few seconds and that did the trick.  The hold is phenomenal.  I would&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend this product.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Ok, for those complaining about this product&#x27;s lack of malleability; Use a blow dryer to warm the wax for a few seconds. Then scoop some out with your fingers. (A man worthy of a true handle bar &#x27;stache should be able to tolerate this slight amount of heat on his hands...)  Then apply the wax into the whiskers while using the blow dryer on the moustache to further melt the wax and work it in.  Then remove the heat source and continue to curl the handlebars for a few seconds... and you&#x27;re done!!!  To put it into context, I am a dark complected male with extremely coarse and wiry whiskers.  If this is your hair type then this product is for you!  I&#x27;ve tried others which have failed to hold strong all day.  The ultimate proving point of the secondary wax was after a long work out, all day of playing with my kids, followed by yard work etc. and the handlebars were still holding strong!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other amazing quality for this product is the subtle natural beeswax scent.  It is pleasant and not overwhelming which is great.  After a short while I don&#x27;t even notice a scent which I love due to my extremely sensitive sense of smell and allergies.  I highly recommend this to anyone with some seriously wiry whiskers that need taming.  Just remember that you will definitely need a heat source when applying it!  I will be ordering again!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever, and I have yet to try another of the multitude of mustache waxes, but based on others&#x27; feedback, I gave this Secondary Mustache Wax a try. I&#x27;m happy to say I picked a winner – properly applied, this wax will hold your ’stache right where you want it all day long. It takes up very little pocket space and smells great (but then, I love the smell of beeswax). My daily routine in a nutshell: with a clean, dry ’stache, I scoop a flat, wide strip of wax out of the tin with my Kent comb, keeping it on the handle, then blow dry that little splotch on high heat until it becomes semi-transparent. That makes it super easy to apply, starting from the center of my mustache out toward the tips, giving the ends a thorough coating/curling. You&#x27;ll see some beads of wax at first, but with your blow dryer on low air, plus high heat, give your ’stache a pass with the dryer, then a light combing, then a pass, then a comb, until the wax is gone (and before you&#x27;ve combed too much away – you&#x27;ll figure out the proper balance quickly). It sounds complicated, but it takes under a minute, leaves no visible wax behind, and keeps your curls in top form for hours.</li>
    <li> I usually try to get a a solid weeks worth of testing a product before I write a review about it, but in this case I&#x27;m going to go ahead a do this one a little early. For anyone who has already ordered and received this product or those who are considering it the first thing you&#x27;ll notice is how hard it is when you first open the lid. Don&#x27;t worry this is normal for most waxes. The harder it is, the longer the hold. There are a few ways you can soften it up. You can put some on the underside of the lid and run the topside under hot water, you can keep it in your pocket until it softens up, or what I do is treat it as older shoe polish and run a lighter over it for a second or two. This product goes in and styles fairly easy as long as you know what your doing. Wait two long and it&#x27;ll start to harden back up which isn&#x27;t a big deal seeing as how it&#x27;s fairly pliable. You can use your own body heat from the fingers to soften back up a bit. As far as the hold goes it&#x27;s pretty durable. It&#x27;s definitely not an all day thing, but it&#x27;ll last longer than you probably need it for. The body heat from your face will cause it to gradually soften and loose hold, but this is also determined by other variables such as how much strenuous activities your doing, the temperature and humidity around you, or by just how much you keep playing with it (the more you do, the less it&#x27;ll keep its hold). Now I have extremely wiry and stiff hair that never seems to want to stay put, but after using a new product line for my beard it&#x27;s become much more manageable so I can&#x27;t really say whether or not this particular wax is fully responsible but it does do a decent job at keeping everything in place. I put it in around 4:30 and it&#x27;ll last until 17:00 or so with a touch-up or two in between. Most others I&#x27;ve tried have only lasted around the halfway mark the worst of which lasted only 2-3 hours. Overall this product is definitely at the top of the list of products I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend it highly to anyone who wants a nice hold that lasts. To those who are looking to style in a handlebar I would only recommend it if your a little more experienced in already doing so. Trying to play with it too much to get it looking just the way you want it can cause you to unecessarily break or even pull out hairs so practice a bit with weaker more pliable products such as a pomade to get the feel for it before you try and tackle a harder wax like this.</li>
    <li> use this daily.  if you are trying to get that stash OUT there, wax it up and stop eating it.&lt;br /&gt;great product.  strong hold.  i use a lighter to heat up and work into the stash.&lt;br /&gt;comb it out and shape as desired</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m on my latest stab at a major beard, and I always seem to start growing them during the hottest months. My mustache is going through a particularly awkward phase of growth, and this wax really helps keep it in place, out of the way. I look neater and I can actually eat and drink again without collecting a big mess. If you&#x27;re going to get this, do yourself a favor and get a good mustache comb.</li>
    <li> Super firm hold....you must add heat to work with this.</li>
    <li> I tried almost a dozen different brands of waxes trying to find one that had a good hold without having such a strong scent I couldn&#x27;t stand having it under my nose. Eventually I gave up and just started making my own.  I found CanYouHandleBar Secondary at a beard and Mustache competition over a ago after I had it recommended by one of the winners in the styled mustache category.  I gave it a try the next time I put my stache up and immediately quit making my own.  I don&#x27;t use Secondary for every day use but it&#x27;s my first choice for competitions or weddings where I don&#x27;t want to worry about if my twirls and curls are falling.  It takes a bit more work to get it pliable and applied than many other waxes, however, it&#x27;s worth the effort because once you&#x27;ve got it in and you&#x27;re style is set, it&#x27;s not moving until you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;Sticking the tin in hot water while you shower works fairly well for softening it up, but when it&#x27;s cold enough to have the furnace running I have been just sitting it on the furnace vent and find that works just as well for me and doesn&#x27;t leave my pocket wet when I stick it in there to take with me.</li>
    <li> Bought as part of a gift. The receiver was impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> The is about the hardest wax I have found.  DEFINITELY need to have a solution for heating it.  But it is really solid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an on and off mustache wearer. When I need a strong hold, this is the stuff. I&#x27;ve used a lot of other brands but this is my favorite for two reasons. The first is it holds without looking paste-y or artificial. The second is that I know what&#x27;s in it. It&#x27;s like the Chekov&#x27;s gun of mustache wax- there are no unnecessary ingredients but it has everything it needs. Frankly, it does what it says it does and that&#x27;s what I look for in a product and in a brand. The only thing is it isn&#x27;t the cheapest. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Extra hold, great fragrance, best Moustache wax I have used. Must be warmed before use, a hair dryer works great if you are in a hurry. I use a cup warmer to soften wax since I am an early riser and have plenty of time at morning.</li>
    <li> Would buy again, good product, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I have a very curly, wiry mustache.  I have tried regular mustache wax, Firehouse Wacky Tacky, and a few glues.  This wax is the best, hands down and bar none.  It holds stronger and lasts longer than Wacky Tacky (which is still an excellent product), something that I didn&#x27;t think was possible.  It has a clean beeswax scent, and I would recommend melting it with a hairdryer.  If you have an untamable mustache, this will solve your problem.  I will be a customer for life, and I would give a kidney (maybe even mine!) for the recipie.</li>
    <li> He can&#x27;t leave the house without it. My husband is now known as the mustache man to many because this stuff is great! Has excellent hold and dries completely. Totally neutral smell doesn&#x27;t bother him during all day wear.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this wax.  He was using hairspray before this.  He says it holds firm all day and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Takes too long to heat for use.</li>
    <li> My husband used this and loves it..this is the first time using a product like this..we are very satisfied</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out now for about 6 months . I use it every day on my mustache to keep it firm and controlled . I keep about 4 tins in reserve as I never want to run out of this stuff. Customer for life. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My husband is obsessed with these Can you handle bar products. I got him an assorted basket of their products for a gift and ever since then he has been hooked. They come in easy to carry containers that you can just slide in your pocket if your running late and you don&#x27;t have time to apply right then. He always has a tin in his pocket. My husband has a beard and moustache and has tried the beard oil, various dry oils and now this. Just like with all the other products he absolutely loved it. I&#x27;ve never seen my husband so into taking care of his facial hair until he tried Can you handle bar.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;CanYouHandleBar&amp;#34; secondary mustache wax is great my husband uses it day and night now since it came in and it has made his mustache much easier to manage and on the plus side for me when he kisses me i no longer get mustache scratches this product has made a huge difference besides it helping to control his mustache its has also made his mustache hair soft and believe me thata awesome so happy to have the CanYouHandleBar secondary mustache wax its a truly great product and has made its way into our daily routine morning and night thanks so much i would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs more control of their mustache and also it works for making the mustache hairs softer so thumbs up this is a truly awesome producy</li>
    <li> My brother in law has a great handlebar moustache. Most are very waxy and do not leave good results. This product worked great. There was not flaking. It was easy to wash out. Worked great!</li>
    <li> When I first got this and tried it I thought it was ridiculous and a waste of my money. Rubbed it between my fingers and it remained a ball of wax. Melted it with a hairdryer then tried to apply but it turned back hard as soon as I touched it... Then I softened the wax w my fingers and rubbed it into the tips of my stache while still a wax ball. Smoothed it out with my fingers. Combed it through, twisted the tips and bam! Magic! My stache has never been better looking. Now my stache looks like the stickers and tshirts but natural. It holds perfectly all day, and I work outside in various elements. If it hits something, one twist and it&#x27;s back to perfect.  I have tried it all from glue to light wax and this is F&#x27;n Awesome. Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> Great hold.  I followed the company&#x27;s instructions and let it set in hot water (in the tin) while I was in the shower and after I shaved.  This wax goes on even and holds all day.  No greasy bound together look.  Very natural.  Excellent value.  I gave this company a shot because they are from Michigan, and working to help recover the economy here.  Glad I did!  I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different waxes over the past couple of years, and this one is by far the best.  I don&#x27;t find it any more difficult to apply than any others - whether I melt it completely or use the &amp;#34;between the fingers&amp;#34; method.  The hold is what&#x27;s different.  Lasts all day, easily.  Also, I don&#x27;t detect any scent at all, so it&#x27;s ideal to scent to your own liking - as I intend to do.</li>
    <li> Works really well to keep my mustache looking good and under control.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the reviews! This wax is hard as a rock. Takes ages to smooth in to the hair. There are much better choices out there.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Really gives a nice curl and lasts</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my CanYouHandleBar Moustache Wax! I received it in a very timely manner and it was true to the products size and description. It came in a very nice metal container which fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and makes it easy to carry around in your pocket. It opens very easily, yet when you close it its a nice tight fit to keep the freshness. It has a natural smell and contains all natural ingredients (which I love!) The wax works wonderfully and with the amount provided will last me for a very long time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable and high quality mustache wax, I love mine! I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion/review.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and does it right. One little dap and my husbands mustache was in tip top shape. He highly recommends this product &amp;#34;received this item for testing and review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent. ..a little goes a long way. Holds all day. Best wax I have used.</li>
    <li> Secondary Mustache Wax is made from high-quality natural ingredients which work to shape and condition the mustache. To use they wax simple rub a bit together between your fingers to soften it up, then massage it into your &#x27;stache. When applying, remember that a little bit goes a long way. After working it in, comb your mustache and shape the ends as desired. Volia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondary Mustache Wax comes in a handsome tin and would make the perfect gift for the mustached man in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Since I wrote the review on the CanYouHandleBar Primary mustache wax I have used this product, the Secondary version.&lt;br /&gt;Much stronger hold for keeping your mustache in place the way you shape it.  It works great and is easy to apply if you follow the instructions.  I will be buying more of this outstanding wax.  I use it daily.  Very highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is it.....the last product I will need to tame my lip hairs....a product truly worthy of greater men than me. If there is any one product i can recommend to any man worth his salt in facial hair...it is this one! I have tried many different waxes and balms and alike...but this one rings true...one application and I am set for the entire day....no reapplication no fuss no muss....this is it men....the smell is quite soft and natural...no pungent odor hanging under your nose for the day...just the sweet satisfaction that your Whisky tickler is going to stay in place...I cannot say enough good things about this! go out and buy it now!</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality Mustache Wax I have ever used.  Smooth application, stiff adherence, holds incredibly well, and lasts long.  What makes this different than the others besides quality is that it dries and cleans off well and is neither sticky or gooey.  I also have tried their beard oils and am I highly impressed with this product line.  They are a bit more pricey than the others, but the value is hands-down the best.  This is one of those products that make the adage, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; true.  Awesome buy!</li>
    <li> As stated above for the Primary Wax; this is best used for the ends of your stache in combination with the Primary.  It is very stiff and needs to be warmed up before use but the results are worth it.  I&#x27;m finding that I use the Primary/Secondary in a 2 to 1 ratio.  Your situation might be different.  Very high quality stuff that will enhance the look of your stache and worth every cent. Speedy service and good people who make a great product.</li>
    <li> Product Name: Secondary Moustache Wax&lt;br /&gt;Short Description:  This is a mustache wax used to shape a mustache in to different shapes including the handlebar style.&lt;br /&gt;Visual Appearance  ★★&lt;br /&gt;Intended Purpose  ★★★&lt;br /&gt;Cost  ★★&lt;br /&gt;Quality  ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &amp; Cons&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;★ With a little work this helps shape the mustache into the desired style.&lt;br /&gt;★No major smell, even though it does have a little waxy smell to it but I didn&#x27;t mind, gives me something to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This wax just did not work for my hair, I have very thick mustache hair and it was very hard to shape it but it was possible to do. The reason I gave it three stars was because in addition to the difficulty after a little while later with normal body heat or from being in the florida weather  the was would melt and then it would just look like a bunch of tan looking wax on my mustache similar to gel on hair when it dries up or you sleep with it overnight. I think that it might still work for others but it didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts and Personal Opinion: I would like to say I still gave it 3 stars because the company fully stands behind its product. If this is something that you&#x27;re looking for give it a try, you might have a better experience otherwise they&#x27;re always there to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Rody Aroche</li>
    <li> My moustache does what ever it wants. Not with this in. I use the Secondary as a primary as well. This wax will keep my handlebars in even if i push 90 mph on my motorcycle. It looks a little flakey in my dark hair. But, that might be my fault. Good product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible for me, and I really did try to give it a fair shake (for $15, of course I would). I tried heating this stuff up 6 ways to Sunday and it was a nightmare to get in my mustache. The only thing that worked was a blow dryer on high for like 2 minutes. If you don&#x27;t move at the speed of light it will solidify and be essentially useless, plus it&#x27;s very difficult to get off your fingers. I managed to pull out about a dozen hairs in the process of a few attempts - not cool. I am shocked this had any good reviews. Highly disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good though!</li>
    <li> This wax works very well, however it is difficult to start using. I bought this off amazon for my boyfriend and had to go to the website to find directions and tips.&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest using a guitar pick to scoop a small amount out as it is very hard and does not soften as others might.</li>
    <li> A decent moustache wax.  Low odor after application.  Fair to medium holding ability (always depends on hair&#x27;s flexibility and length).  Holding time is about  2 hours.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have very difficult and unruly &#x27;stache hair, and this has been the only product I have used that seems strong enough to control it, while still maintaining flexibility and pliability.</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; mustache wax I&#x27;ve used.  HUGE difference from trying to use other stuff like the tube you can get at drugs stores of mustache wax or pomade and things like that.  Very hard wax, just have to get it worked up and soft and it goes through nicely.  Strong hold, usually workout while it&#x27;s in for almost 2 hours and stays in pretty well.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this almost every day and he loves it. Since we live in hot hot California, it&#x27;s hard to find a good wax that doesn&#x27;t melt out within an hour or so. This wax has the perfect hold, lasting almost all day! I was wary because other reviews said it was very hard, however he just keeps it in his pocket regularly and it turns to the perfect consistency.</li>
    <li> Works like it said it would, holds good. No smell. Only thing is that it is a little hard to get out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my mustache and for about six months, and so I&#x27;ve been in need of a good, strong hold to properly handlebar it, or at the least to keep it out of my mouth. I&#x27;ve tried a few, and found some good waxes, but nothing that would last all day and keep my mustache properly curled on the ends. I&#x27;d heard good things about Firehouse Wax Wacky Tacky and was eager to try it, but when it came time to purchase more wax, Amazon was a bit of a disappointment. The only seller I could find was selling it for something like $24/tin. That definitely wasn&#x27;t happening, so I did a bit more looking and found this stuff, a brand I&#x27;ve never heard of. They have a couple products, Primary wax with less hold, and Secondary (this product) which promised a stronger hold. At $12/tin, it wasn&#x27;t cheap, but it was far from the worst I&#x27;ve seen. I decided to give it a go. If I can find Firehouse for a reasonable price later, I&#x27;ll give them a shot. But for now, this is my go-to, if I need good, strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is definitely strong, almost too strong. Don&#x27;t attempt to apply it without warming it under how water for a few minutes, first. You&#x27;ll rip hairs out of your mustache trying to smooth it in; I know, I&#x27;ve done it. Some waxes you can skate by and skip this step; this is not one of those. Once it warms up, though, it spreads relatively easily. And once it cools again, the hold is titanic. If applied generously, you&#x27;ll end up with a rock-hard &#x27;stache. It holds up to changing temperatures and humidity quite well. I work in a grocery store, and I&#x27;m in and out of refrigerated and humidity-controlled rooms day in and day out, and I&#x27;ve never had it fail me. At most, it requires a quick touch-up after a full shift. Less product gives less hold, which increases flexibility somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t need something super strong, then don&#x27;t buy this wax, it really is impressive.</li>
    <li> This just might be the best wax on Amazon currently. I tried the fisticuffs brand and, while it smelled great, it did not have the hold that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This stuff, however, is right on. It holds my stache all day long. Good job on this guys!</li>
    <li> Great product, extremely strong and handles well even in windy conditions.  Great wax imo, don&#x27;t even hesitant or think twice, GO BUY IT!  Curls great and holds super strong.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. Super good hold that gives me a great handlebar with sharp points when I want it, but versatile enough that a smaller, warmed amount can smooth and shape my stache when I&#x27;m wearing it down, giving it a nice full look. Great smell too, and I like that it is all-natural. Once set this sucker will hold all day too. Now if only I can get my fiancee to come around to the beeswax smell I&#x27;ll put this on my reorder list.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best for me but it does smell good. It&#x27;s just a little too hard to work with and doesn&#x27;t hold as well as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Being new to the handlebar mustache experience and I was initially leery of using too stiff a wax, thinking it would be difficult to apply or remove, or worse, that it would be flaky.  Nope on all counts.  It gives me all day hold...or mostly all day, since the still new &#x27;stache is a little wild yet...without being oppressive.  It&#x27;s easy to use and has a subtle, pleasant smell that reminds me of my Southern youth when honey...good honey...came with the honeycomb in the jar.  The tin conveniently fits in the match/watch pocket of my chinos and jeans.</li>
    <li> Holds the hairs like iron and works very well</li>
    <li> No need to continue searching. You have found the best wax available. My moustache was hard to control and I never could get the look I wanted. Plus I ride a motorcycle. This stuff really does the job. You will learn how to apply after a few days of practice. You will need to soften this wax a little, I have no problem finding a warm spot when riding my Harley, when I&#x27;m caging it just crank up the heat open the lid and a few seconds under the vent and your ready to apply. I use the secondary clear wax and apply twice a day and it holds. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best mustache wax I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve tried Clubman&#x27;s, Fisticuffs, and Firehouse Wacky Tacky (my second favorite so far), but this wax provides the best hold thus far. You&#x27;ll need to warm it up to get it out of the can, but once it&#x27;s warm enough to blend into the stache, it works wonders. This stuff holds all day. My mustache has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update- I reviewed this product about 9 months after growing my mustache. Now, about 2 years later (take a couple months), I just want to say that this is still the best wax I&#x27;ve used. With longer tips, Clubman&#x27;s wax holds better and so does Firehouse&#x27;s Wacky Tacky, but neither of them provide the &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; hold I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;m now on my second tin of Secondary and it is the best grooming product I&#x27;ve owned. Once dried into the &#x27;stache,, my curls literally feel like plastic. &amp;#34;Plastic Hair&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t sound all that great, but this is the kind of plastic that doesn&#x27;t warp after an afternoon of yard work in Florida. I&#x27;ve achieved the best natural look by applying a good amount of wax in the middle and a small amount on the tips and I&#x27;ve pulled off the curls by applying a good amount to the ends. Keep this stuff on you (in your pockets)... keys, wallet, cell phone, wax... they are my entourage.</li>
    <li> Hello all! My review....this is a really good wax! I go for a natural look and it works great. The hold is great and the smell, of the wax, makes it even better. Whenever I run low...I know where another purchase, will be made. Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my boyfriend to tame his beard and totally dug it!</li>
    <li> my Hubby really liked this stuff.  He told me it makes his moustache more manageable.  thank you much</li>
    <li> Very strong stuff!  I find that it works best for me by putting it on a cuticle tool and heating it with a hair dryer first.  I am in the early stages of my handlebar, so I don&#x27;t have to use very much.  I have also ordered the Primary Moustache Wax for every day use.  I should have ordered that first.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to receive a complimentary tin of Moustache Wax that I gave to my husband in exchange we would test this product &amp; post our results here in this review. My husband had never used a wax before so this was a learning process for both of us. As suggested by a friend we kept the tin closed tightly and let in sit in some warm water until it softened up. My husband was then able to work with the wax and make little handle bars out of his moustache. Seeing as he keeps it pretty trim, they were really small handle bars. But this stuff worked great!</li>
    <li> The product is a bit difficult to get out of the container, even when heating it with the suggested methods. There are other brands that are easier to apply.</li>
    <li> This wax definitely does what its suppose to do. It holds very well over a good amount of time. My Dad likes it but its not something that he will use everyday. For daily use he prefers the CanYouHandleBar Primary Moustache Wax it leaves more of a natural feeling. He&#x27;ll be saving this for special occasions when  he needs a stronger hold.</li>
    <li> I almost think they should reverse the names of the Primary and the Secondary waxes.  the primary is great for a softer hold.  the secondary, however, has some outstanding hold.  I&#x27;ve gone on bike rides, canoeing, kayaking, hard sweaty workouts, hikes, runs and even rinse off showers and it didn&#x27;t budge.  I was also pleased with how little was needed to do the job. If you are looking for a good holding wax, this is definitely it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and did not take warning. When I first opened it I found the wax was so hard it rattled in the tin. I too got the email from the owner on how to prepare it prior to use. I put it in hot water to melt it. The best way I can explain it is it&#x27;s like sticking your finger in hot candle wax. As soon as it touches your finger the wax begins to hardens before you can get it to your mustache. It is an absolute hassle to try and use. After 3 days I gave up and threw it in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Love This stuff! As a first time handlebar mustache guy it did take me some time to learn how to use it.  and if you&#x27;re not able to warm it up they can feel like you&#x27;re trying to pull my hairs out of your mustache I use it primarily for the end of my mustache it holds great all day. It&#x27;s too stiff for the middle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My husband does not have a long mustache but using wax helps keep it in shape. CanYouHandleBar works great he loves it. This is the first time he has used this product. He says it is one of the best. It holds his mustache hairs in place without them feeling stiff, It is easy to do he just followed the instructions I gave him. Heats it with a blow dryer worked well. It also has a nice smell.  I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I just started waxing my &#x27;stache and this was my first foray into the craft. The quality is good but the top layer has a bit of a crust being exposed to the air a bit so it gets softer the more you use it. Also, the wax does have a bit of a fragrance to it which smells a bit weird. It&#x27;s not bad, but it takes a while to get used to. It&#x27;s a good product otherwise though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t hold like I would&#x27;ve hoped. It takes forever to soften</li>
    <li> I use the end of the handle of my Kent mustache comb to scrape a couple grains of rice size and rub between index fingers to get soft and then smoothe it through and comb it. Turn the ends up and voila. I can handlebar!</li>
    <li> this wax is the stiffest I&#x27;ve ever tried. To apply it, I soak the can in hot water for 15 mi Utes, then dump it out and soak it for another 5 minutes in fresh hot water. Then, I scrape a small amount on to my fingernail and Apply it along my stache. Usually I scrape out an amount 4 times and I have enough on there. It&#x27;s heavy on beeswax, so very stiff and thick. Once applied, I melt it on my stache with a blow dryer for about 30 seconds. I then comb it in and style it. With a handlebar made from this wax, even rain won&#x27;t make it droop.</li>
    <li> This wax was very hard. Even with my husband leaving it in his pocket all day it was no pliable. He had to use a lighter to melt it. Not sure why we had such an issue i read the reviews and it sounded like a good product</li>
    <li> Good stuff. More waxy than some ,good hold, does not wash out easily</li>
    <li> The CanYouHandlebar Secondary Moustache wax comes in a tin packaging. There is NO instructions with this item in the box itself or on packaging. Which made things a bit difficult for my husband and I at first. When I opened the lid, the wax was ROCK SOLID. I was confused, until I read the description on the post on Amazon where I had ordered it from. You can find the instructions on the sales page. However, I believe that there should be something printed on the tin or something that comes in the box explaining how to soften the wax safely. It says to either warm in warm water OR in a pocket. My husband was able to rub his thumb into the wax for a minute or two to soften it up. We also used the warm water bath method. This worked much better than warming it with a touch or in a hand/pocket etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softening the wax was probably the most consuming part of testing this product. I used a small bowl of warm water. Left it sit and checked in in intervals of 5 minutes. I found that the wax only started to be come warm enough to mold between my fingers by about the 15 minute mark. Otherwise, I had to use my nail to dig some of it up. The second time that I tried this, I made sure to microwave the bowl of water and that made the water much hotter, leaving it only 5 minutes before it was able to be dug out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SCENT*&lt;br /&gt;This has a very strong beeswax scent to it. Which, I find to be rather soothing. Some may not be fond of this. The scent will be applied to the moustache right under the nose, so keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*USE*&lt;br /&gt;My husband doesn&#x27;t have a very long mustache but it does get kind of \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and sets funny if he grows it out too long. Also, it&#x27;s VERY prickly and uncomfortable for me to kiss or nuzzle him when it&#x27;s grown out. So I was excited to have him try this product!&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves the hairs soft, NOT STIFF! The wax blends nicely, once warmed and rubs very well into the hairs. Even when it \\&quot;cools\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very hard in the hairs, doesn&#x27;t flake or get gunky. Which was nice. Hubby approves! It&#x27;s also been \\&quot;Kiss tested\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been Wife approved! :)&lt;br /&gt;2. The wax also (if left on hands) is great for cuticles! My cuticles are horrible and I had tried a dab of this on my hands. Very soothing on cracked and dry hands or cuticles. I love it and will probably be taking one of his tins (as I am trying both the primary and secondary products) for my own use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PACKAGING*&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in first photo, I was able to test all three products. The Primary &amp; Secondary waxes (Which, in our opinion both work about the same-look the same-effects are the same etc), we really don&#x27;t see a difference in either of them. The Beard Oil is also in photo. Check out my review on that! Love all the products and they look GREAT together! These would make a really nice Fathers Day or Christmas basket gift item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note, this product is handmade, hand packaged locally! In fact, not very far from where we live. I am head over heels over buying local and fully support our small businesses and handmade products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]t flake or get gunky.

    <li> No bad! Works well and no strong scent</li>
    <li> I actually like this, I am asian so my stash is super hard to control. This holds nicely fast delivery also.</li>
    <li> First time using mustache wax. I have a very bushy mustache and this really helps keep it under control, giving it a nice shape instead of the bristly mess it can be. The smell is mainly beeswax and slightly sweet. Just soften it between your fingers for a few seconds before you apply it and comb. Easy-peasy.</li>
    <li> This wax smells awesome, I just couldn&#x27;t seem to warm it up enough to work it into my mustache. I tried all the suggestions from the other reviews but nothing worked. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and I&#x27;m too impatient, I don&#x27;t know. All it did was pull and pill up in the hair, and it even caused a few to come out as I tried to work it through. I recently purchased some wax from another website ( thebeardbaron.com) and that stuff is awesome. It softens up to a Chapstick like consistency and works in perfectly. Plus it only costs $8!! So I can safely say that I reccomend that one instead of canyouhandlebar.</li>
    <li> Ive tried other waxes but this is by far the best wax for that perfect stache curl! this does the trick just a little bit one each side and twist twist twist. stays on for hours and washes off clean! And yes Now I can handlebar!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s boss has a classic curlycue mustache, and so we gave him this product to try out.  John absolutely loved it.  He said that the wax goes a long way, and it makes his mustache &amp;#34;behave&amp;#34; (which I guess means that it curls nicely).  John is a bit of a nature buff, so he really liked the fact that the wax contains beeswax.  He definitely recommends, and I have to say that his mustache looks very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/A231RHRNN5AA83</li>
    <li> This is the first wax that I&#x27;ve tried on the first handlebar I&#x27;ve ever grown. After purchasing, I received an email from Doug (owner) with detailed instructions on how to use it and a follow up to see how things were going. First of all, the wax is great and does exactly as advertised. Second, the customer service is above and beyond, which is hard to come by these days. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone seeking a high quality shaping wax.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t suffer from a limp stache. Maintain the hold you need with Secondary Moustache Wax!</li>
    <li> This is yet another GREAT product by the CanYouHandlebar folks.  I have had a mustache and beard since I was 18, so after 46 years of trying things to keep those darned little &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hairs in line, I have finally found THE product!  Unlike other mustache waxes, this one isn&#x27;t so stiff that my &#x27;stache looks like Snidely Wiplash&#x27;s, yet it has enough body to keep things in place all day.  It also makes my &#x27;stache look fuller.  The only tiny problem I have had with it is that it is a very hard wax cake, so I have to warm it a bit before I can get enough wax on my fingers to do the job.  Not a big deal at all.  Even if you don&#x27;t have a beard, you might want to try their beard oil, too.  I use it on both my beard and mustache, and it makes both a bit more soft and a LOT more kissable, according to my lovely wife!  (Yea guys, soft beards and &#x27;staches ARE more kissable...I am living proof!)</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock and pulls out hairs if it&#x27;s not warm enough. I used a lighter to soften it up a bit (blow drier would work too) then carefully apply. It will hold forever if you use plenty. I woke up this morning looking ready to go. It didn&#x27;t wash out too easy. This won&#x27;t be my daily driver, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Great product- I love the smell of it on my man&#x27;s &#x27;stache.</li>
    <li> Im pretty pleased with the product. This wax can hold my moustache for several hours. It have a soft and nice aroma. The consistency of the wax is hard when its cold, but after warming it up, its pretty malleable. The only thing i don&#x27;t like ( but i don&#x27;t see it as a problem), is that after hours of use, it turns into oil and my moustache lose his shape (Yes my moustache is not a thing) . In general it gives a nice natural hold to my moustache and just need a few rewaxing during the day.</li>
    <li> I recieved this for an honest opinion and I gave this to my daughter&#x27;s father. He said he loves it, just a little bit goes along ways use to much and it makes his beard feel gunky. So far he has liked all the products from this brand that I have given to him.</li>
    <li> The wax is very stiff and hard and difficult to get out of the canister to apply.  I&#x27;m guessing that is why it holds my handlebars so firm, which it does very well.  But it does seem a bit difficult to apply and I&#x27;ve never used wax that was so tough to get out of the can.  I&#x27;m almost thinking it might be old?  I&#x27;ve thought about returning it, but I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already.  And it does hold very well.</li>
