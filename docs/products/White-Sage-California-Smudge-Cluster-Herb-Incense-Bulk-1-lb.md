    <li> This item is working very well for me - prices have gone up a little but it was the best deal and is just great</li>
    <li> There was a lot more loose leaves in this order than the one I got before.</li>

    <li> Great deal well dried</li>
    <li> This was the best sage quality, freshness, quantity and burn quality that I have yet to experience in loose sage, the &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34; or leaves were complete and not broken into &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; in the bottom of the box, it lasted me 7 months.  I would suggest this product.  Thanks for the excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Love this stuff. Great price for such wonderful sage</li>
    <li> Product as expected.  Good condition upon arrival, great aroma, make some great smudge for naming ceremonies, etc..</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading reviews, but ultimately dissppointed. Sadly the sage was a crumbled up mess. It looked like a spice-ready dried herb, almost no whole leaves, certainly nothing to make my sage bundles. I can&#x27;t comment on how it might have burned since I was unable to make any bundles. The entire purchase was a complete waste of money!</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected and a good value.</li>
    <li> I rated it because it was not the same amount and price , it had way less than before at the price o 29.00 dollars and the previous orders of the same sage was 25.00 which was way more bulk than before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been spoiled with the sage I&#x27;ve bought from Frontier, which I consider the gold standard in sage and other herbs. This seemed a bit on the old side, It was about half stalks with attached leaves, which is what I prefer. The rest was crushed leaves. It&#x27;s do-able, but I don&#x27;t know as I would reorder from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did come in a timely fashion as promised.</li>
    <li> the sage was saddening seeing as how the leaves were in the infant stage and should not have been picked. Smudge is a spiritual journey and should be respected in all ways.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful product. Packaged nicely, very fresh, perfect for smudging.  Smells perfect, not many sticks. Will definitely buy my sage from this company from now on.</li>
    <li> I will purchase again! It was delivered before the expected time. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Contents were sealed and extremely fresh. Will buy again from this seller</li>
    <li> awsome purchase, smells goooood</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive the shipment of sage. Buying natural products sight unseen on the Internet can be challenging at times. Amazon provides quality product&#x27;s, but vendors do change often. This sage arrived to me unbroken, a full pound, and fresh. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am surprised by the quality of this sage. It is nothing like any other sage I have ever bought. In fact, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sage at all. It does not burn properly; once I light it up, it sort of just fades out, like it&#x27;s a dud. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sage either. When I went back into my kitchen just now to tell my husband that I&#x27;m writing a review, I said to him, &amp;#34;Yuck this does not smell like sage&amp;#34; and he responded, &amp;#34;Yeah, I don&#x27;t know what that is&amp;#34;. Save your money and purchase something else. :(</li>
    <li> Love white sage. Great supplier. This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought from them. Good quality clusters. Great for the Inipi.</li>
    <li> There is no scent like white sage.  I do not smudge, but a little burning white sage is delightful in the house.  Large dried stems thick with whole big leaves.  The color and scent is fresh.  I am secure in recommending this to anyone and will be reordering myself.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been burning White Sage for years and what I received is not White Sage. It is very gray in color, it does not look like or smell like White Sage. I purchased (what I thought was the same) from this seller in November and loved it. I have some of that order left, as I didn&#x27;t want to run out. This is not the same as the first purchase. I will not purchase again and don&#x27;t recommend it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Delicious smelling sage with some sticks attached which made for easier handling when making smudge wands.  I was delighted with the quality of this herb.  So much so, that I had to share it will friends and will need to order from this company again!</li>
