### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I loved that it controlled the frizzy hair!!</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It works great!</li>
      <li>it works great on my hair and i would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product to add some control.</li>
      <li>I use it on two fair haired girls with fly aways and it sets and holds without being crunchy.  </li>
      <li>We love it!  </li>
      <li>It provides very light hold.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it keeps my fine hair from having static electricity in the winter!</li>
      <li>It smells of lime which i find very refreshing and clean smelling, love putting it in after my shower.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t add any volume or stylability, but nothing but Aquanet is going to do that for my hair, anyway :)  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Glad to find a cruelty-free and vegan mousse.</li>
      <li>Love the lemon smell when applying.</li>
      <li>It is just okay though.</li>
      <li>and i gotta say it works a lot better</li>
      <li>So glad to be able to get this light styling mousse.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I have really curly hair that frizzes real easy</li>
      <li>I recommend it to all my friends because it is a natural product with good hold.</li>
      <li>The original version did a good job, the next day you still had a bit of lift and not too oily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.     </li>
      <li>All in all better than any alternative I have seen so far..</li>
      <li>It did lift and look good for a few hours, but if you live in a hot climate like I do in Florida you have to be carful with hair products if you have fine and oily hair as the heat exacerbates the moisture factor in your hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice too and isnt too sticky and doesnt give your hair that wet look.</li>
      <li>It really helps define my curls so they don&#x27;t get fuzzy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sticky.  </li>
      <li>It did not seem to make much difference over not using any product at all.  </li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair, and this mousse works well for me.</li>
      <li>This is a reasonably priced, non-aerosol product that holds my soft floppy hair pretty well.  </li>
      <li>keeps my hair soft but still keeps fizz out pretty well.</li>
      <li>Was shipped new version that has Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
      <li>If you have fine and or oily hair the next day your hair will be oily and flat.  </li>
      <li>It has an initial burst of really nice lime scent that dissipates fast so as not to interfere with other scents or hang with you too long.  </li>
      <li>I first put on my curling gel while my hair is wet, then a little mouse on top of that</li>
      <li>But I use it every morning on my wet hair before I blow dry my hair in order to keep static electricity away all day.</li>
      <li>It felt soft in my hair, which is the only positive thing I can say about it.  </li>
      <li>the picture on Amazon is the old style bottle.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something that wasnt toxic but did the job for my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>i am trying to use all natural products.</li>
      <li>I use a natural curling gel</li>
      <li>my Face should have marketed the new version for normal to dry hair and the old version for normal to oily hair.  </li>
      <li>It works okay, but old habits are difficult to break; prefer the aerosol mousse cans of national brands such as  Suave Professional Extra Hold (in the black can) as they provide a more consistent thicker feel (consistency) in ones hand prior to application.</li>
      <li>When searching for all natural holding products to use daily, this came up to us as an option.  </li>
      <li>I recently started looking for less harsh more natural hair products and this mousse i picked up on a whim at my health food store</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this, but it left my hair dull and stringy!</li>

<li> I wanted to love this, but it left my hair dull and stringy!</li>
<li> Natural hairspay couldn&#x27;t tame my hair and finally I shelled out the money to try Kiss My Face natural mousse.</li>
<li> I have very frizzy hair but never did like regular mousse because it leaves the hair stiff and plastic-like</li>
<li> So if you are traveling, the new style is less convenient to pack.</li>
<li> They use it daily to smooth down small pony tails and other simple braids.  </li>
<li> It has a very strong smell which I found unpleasant.  </li>
<li> Therefore it makes the hair look as it were naturally not frizzy</li>
<li> and I can just let my hair dry.</li>
<li> Overall, not fantastic.</li>
<li> I then need to wet it and go for a flatter look.</li>
<li> It works well for a few hours but after about 3 it weighs down my hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and weighed down.</li>
<li> Not Original Formula, I had no idea it changed.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff, but manageable.  </li>
<li> but it didnt seem to completely tame the frizzies</li>
<li> I only use products without harsh chemicals and from companies that don&#x27;t do animal testing, so this fits the bill and is not overly expensive.</li>
<li> (well pvp is usually what they put in mousse and it&#x27;s a plastic).</li>
<li> I have been using it for at least a year now.</li>
<li> Unlike the other reviewer, I like the smell, but I found it difficult to get out of the bottle</li>
<li> I have very thick, wavy hair.</li>
<li> Granted it&#x27;s expensive, but it tames my hair and keeps the curls from frizzing but doesn&#x27;t make it a hard plastic curl like pvp containing mousse.</li>
<li> One had opened during transit and as a result all the bottles were sticky and dirty</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently started looking for less harsh more natural hair products and this mousse i picked up on a whim at my health food store and i gotta say it works a lot better then i thought it would. I have really curly hair that frizzes real easy so i needed some thing that could hold up to it and this stuff does the job. It smells of lime which i find very refreshing and clean smelling, love putting it in after my shower. keeps my hair soft but still keeps fizz out pretty well. overall i like it and will continue to use it. A+</li>
    <li> In the interest of using products that are not harmful to me or the environment, this passes per the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep review (rates 3 out of 10).  It provides very light hold.  The scent is light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is a reasonably priced, non-aerosol product that holds my soft floppy hair pretty well.  It has an initial burst of really nice lime scent that dissipates fast so as not to interfere with other scents or hang with you too long.  Love it.</li>
    <li> When searching for all natural holding products to use daily, this came up to us as an option.  We love it!  I use it on two fair haired girls with fly aways and it sets and holds without being crunchy.  They use it daily to smooth down small pony tails and other simple braids.  I recommend it to all my friends because it is a natural product with good hold.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it is organic and I wanted to give it a try.  It has a very strong smell which I found unpleasant.  It&#x27;s very sticky.  It felt soft in my hair, which is the only positive thing I can say about it.  I only used it with a straightener, so I can&#x27;t say how well it would hold a style.  It did not seem to make much difference over not using any product at all.  I cancelled my subscription and I won&#x27;t use it again.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with my three bottles now, one of which broke in shipping...</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair. This is a great product to add some control. I combine it with a frizz serum and I can just let my hair dry.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair, and this mousse works well for me. It doesn&#x27;t add any volume or stylability, but nothing but Aquanet is going to do that for my hair, anyway :)  I only use products without harsh chemicals and from companies that don&#x27;t do animal testing, so this fits the bill and is not overly expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it keeps my fine hair from having static electricity in the winter! I have been using it for at least a year now. In my opinion, it has NO holding or styling power. But I use it every morning on my wet hair before I blow dry my hair in order to keep static electricity away all day.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair but never did like regular mousse because it leaves the hair stiff and plastic-like (well pvp is usually what they put in mousse and it&#x27;s a plastic). Natural hairspay couldn&#x27;t tame my hair and finally I shelled out the money to try Kiss My Face natural mousse. Granted it&#x27;s expensive, but it tames my hair and keeps the curls from frizzing but doesn&#x27;t make it a hard plastic curl like pvp containing mousse. Therefore it makes the hair look as it were naturally not frizzy (you can tell when someone has pvp mousse that always has that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look). It&#x27;s worth the price.     **Note: the picture on Amazon is the old style bottle. It no longer comes with a cap, just a bigger thing to pump it. So if you are traveling, the new style is less convenient to pack.</li>
    <li> Glad to find a cruelty-free and vegan mousse. It is just okay though. It works well for a few hours but after about 3 it weighs down my hair. I then need to wet it and go for a flatter look. All in all better than any alternative I have seen so far..but I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> Works well.  It manages curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff, but manageable.  Love the lemon smell when applying.</li>
    <li> Not Original Formula, I had no idea it changed. Was shipped new version that has Moroccan Argan oil. If you have fine and or oily hair the next day your hair will be oily and flat.  It did lift and look good for a few hours, but if you live in a hot climate like I do in Florida you have to be carful with hair products if you have fine and oily hair as the heat exacerbates the moisture factor in your hair.  The original version did a good job, the next day you still had a bit of lift and not too oily.  I am bummed it has changed.  Its my opinion Kiss my Face should have marketed the new version for normal to dry hair and the old version for normal to oily hair.  I now have 3 bottles of product I cant use.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It really helps define my curls so they don&#x27;t get fuzzy.</li>
    <li> One had opened during transit and as a result all the bottles were sticky and dirty</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that wasnt toxic but did the job for my naturally curly hair. I use a natural curling gel but it didnt seem to completely tame the frizzies so I was looking for a product to go with it. Decided to try the Kiss My Face mousse and it seems to work well. I first put on my curling gel while my hair is wet, then a little mouse on top of that, then diffuse. Worked well. It smells nice too and isnt too sticky and doesnt give your hair that wet look.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to replace my aerosol mousse for a while so I thought I would try this one. It didn&#x27;t amaze me either. Unlike the other reviewer, I like the smell, but I found it difficult to get out of the bottle and I need to use a LOT of it for it to work. It also tends to leave a buildup in my hair. Overall, not fantastic. Maybe I just needed something with a stronger hold.</li>
    <li> Tried this 3 pack of Organic styling mouse. It works okay, but old habits are difficult to break; prefer the aerosol mousse cans of national brands such as  Suave Professional Extra Hold (in the black can) as they provide a more consistent thicker feel (consistency) in ones hand prior to application.</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to get this light styling mousse. Our local drugstore no longer carries it.&lt;br /&gt;It works great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it left my hair dull and stringy! It gave my hair no lift. I wanted to love it because of its having organic ingredients, but it&#x27;s a FAIL.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and weighed down. I loved that it controlled the frizzy hair!!</li>
    <li> i order this stuff all the time. i am trying to use all natural products. it works great on my hair and i would recommend this product.</li>
