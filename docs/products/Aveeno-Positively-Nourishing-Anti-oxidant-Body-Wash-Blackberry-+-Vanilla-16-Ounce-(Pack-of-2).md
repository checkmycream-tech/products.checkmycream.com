      <li>I love this bodywash because it smells good, but not overpowering like some.  </li>
      <li>As with all the body was products in this Aveeno line, great body wash, great on dry skin, but not as good as the fig scent.</li>
      <li>but this one is mild and it feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Both my husband and I love the smell of this body wash.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Body wash smells great and skin feels so soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this and Amazon typically has the best price on this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, but overpriced.</li>
      <li>It really does it&#x27;s promise and more!    </li>
      <li>Even though it smells wonderful, it still leaves my very sensitive skin soft, clean and nourished with no irritation.</li>
      <li>I just lather this on instead of plain soap, and it leaves my legs smelling delicious, and silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I really love this body wash, I think the scent is actually quite nice.</li>
      <li>The soap is really terrific, works beautifully, does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
      <li>Washes away clean.</li>
      <li>This body wash smells amazing and makes my skin soft without leaving any residue.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin silky clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I like that Aveeno covers my thirst for sinus-free yet lingering scent, while lightly moisturizes me that really lasts!  </li>
      <li>Easy on the skin and reasonably</li>
      <li>Love Aveeno products in general, and I love this one in particular.</li>
      <li>Cost is worth it</li>
      <li>Pricey for what it would actually cost on a store but great smelling &amp; works well on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little heady for me, but still sweet and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I love using Aveeno Positively Nourishing Body Wash because it makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product</li>
      <li>In fact I bought this and the calming chamomile version... used the blackberry one first</li>
      <li>It was shipped &amp; received sooner than first indicated.</li>
      <li>Gentle too!</li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I really want to be able to buy larger amounts</li>
      <li>Positively Nourishing Anti-oxidant Body Wash Blackberry + Vanilla, 16 ozs., (Pack of 2)]]</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much for lots of long lasting suds when used with a body puff sponge/scrubby, but you will find yourself needing to use more if used with a washcloth, and you will go through it very quickly if you don&#x27;t use anything (ie: except your hand).</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this body wash.</li>
      <li>The Alba, Jason, Avalon Organics have a more potent smell compared to the Japanese brands but tends to feel heavy after bathing.</li>
      <li>The smell is absolutely heavenly, and I have yet to find any body wash with a smell just quite like it.</li>
      <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
      <li>It is so relaxing and very inviting to your nose.</li>
      <li>It is superior to the other present options.</li>
      <li>It smells better than any other body wash I&#x27;ve every owned, like berries and cream, or Bath &amp; Body</li>
      <li>Some body washes have a lingering smell, feels really clean like the Japanese brands, but</li>
      <li>I just wish that I could still find this particular fragrance in the stores</li>
      <li>I had really high hopes for this product being Aveeno and saying \\&quot;anti-oxidant\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of body washes, name it, I&#x27;ve tried it, including the Japanese favorites of Shiseido Mild and Kanebo (now Kracie), as well as the the organic brands of Alba, Jason, Avalon Organics, etc, to that extent!  </li>
      <li>and im trying new products all the time.</li>
      <li>Aveeno always leaves my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances</li>
      <li>Product keeps skin soft and rinses away with ease.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores near me anywhere.</li>
      <li>and it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and have until now used the hypoallergenic unscented Dove soap bars, but once I happened upon this I shall never go back!</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and even most sensitive skin formulas from other brands will leave little red bumps on my skin (non-itchy).  </li>
      <li>and I was so disappointed when it got discontinued, but I was super excited to find it on amazon!!</li>
      <li>The lather is smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward residue behind, and leaves your skin smelling great.</li>
      <li>It lathers very well, so not much is needed.</li>
      <li>The scent of it lingers a tiny bit, a gentle little whif just as you&#x27;re getting out of the shower.</li>

Some body washes have a lingering smell, feels really clean like the Japanese brands, but not enough moisture  throughout the day, especially during summers.  The Alba, Jason, Avalon Organics have a more potent smell compared to the Japanese brands but tends to feel heavy after bathing. The Bath and Body Works, also feels heavier.  I like that Aveeno covers my thirst for sinus-free yet lingering scent, while lightly moisturizes me that really lasts!  It really does it&#x27;s promise and more!    Am hooked!</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for the past several years. It&#x27;s an awesome product! Even though it smells wonderful, it still leaves my very sensitive skin soft, clean and nourished with no irritation. It&#x27;s like a double treat for your skin and your senses. I am so sorry Aveeno no longer makes this scent. I can&#x27;t imagine why, but I sincerely hope they will reconsider their decision to discontinue this product.

    <li> great price great item I love the smell and it seems to work great.  I really want to be able to buy larger amounts</li>
    <li> I love this bodywash because it smells good, but not overpowering like some.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances but this one is mild and it feels good on my skin.  I just wish that I could still find this particular fragrance in the stores so I don&#x27;t have to order it online.</li>
    <li> Smells like one of my Strawberry Shortcake characters from when I was younger!</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff ,but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying :(</li>
    <li> Way too pricey (2 bottles for over $20)!! I found at Target for 5.99 a bottle.  Save your money! For once, Amazon fell short in this department.</li>
    <li> I really love this body wash, I think the scent is actually quite nice. The lather is thick off of a small amount, so you get more bang for your buck. In fact I bought this and the calming chamomile version... used the blackberry one first and now my showering experiences are a little disappointing, but apparently a lot calmer.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno Blackberry Vanilla body wash, but I can never find it in stores. It smells better than any other body wash I&#x27;ve every owned, like berries and cream, or Bath &amp; Body Work&#x27;s Black Raspberry Vanilla. Aveeno always leaves my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and even most sensitive skin formulas from other brands will leave little red bumps on my skin (non-itchy).  Aveeno is the only brand of scented body washes that my skin agrees with.</li>
    <li> After hearing and seeing that this was no longer in stock at any of my local stores, nor on their websites, I rushed to amazon to purchase this before it disappeared. The smell is absolutely heavenly, and I have yet to find any body wash with a smell just quite like it. Makes me look forward to my showers and baths so much more! I have very sensitive skin, and have until now used the hypoallergenic unscented Dove soap bars, but once I happened upon this I shall never go back! Usually perfumed anything somehow irritates my skin or my nose, but not with this! The lather is smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward residue behind, and leaves your skin smelling great. The scent of it lingers a tiny bit, a gentle little whif just as you&#x27;re getting out of the shower. Amazing product, and to admit I don&#x27;t use shaving creme anymore. I just lather this on instead of plain soap, and it leaves my legs smelling delicious, and silky smooth. Go for it ladies!</li>
    <li> Great transaction, just as described!  Will order again!</li>
    <li> The scent is a little heady for me, but still sweet and pleasant. As with all the body was products in this Aveeno line, great body wash, great on dry skin, but not as good as the fig scent. You don&#x27;t need much for lots of long lasting suds when used with a body puff sponge/scrubby, but you will find yourself needing to use more if used with a washcloth, and you will go through it very quickly if you don&#x27;t use anything (ie: except your hand).</li>
    <li> The soap is really terrific, works beautifully, does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do. HOWEVER, the price was way more than you can buy this product for in any grocery or drug store, like 33% more.  So yes, great product but Amazon missed the boat on the pricing.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know why Eveeno quit making this product. My only complaint is that this product was sold for $5.97 at Walmart and in order to buy this product the buyer has to pay an absorbent sum.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this wash!! It is so relaxing and very inviting to your nose. I will definitely be buying more of this product</li>
    <li> Will purchase again. Body wash smells great and skin feels so soft. Family loves it</li>
    <li> Product keeps skin soft and rinses away with ease. A little product goes a long way. Smell is perfect.  Cost is worth it</li>
    <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this scent and I was so disappointed when it got discontinued, but I was super excited to find it on amazon!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. Skin feels soft and clean. Gentle too!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.It was shipped &amp; received sooner than first indicated.I recommend this body wash to all who are looking for a reliable Product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  It helps with winter dry skin.  It&#x27;s a good value compared to what I have seen in stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product! . Washes away clean.Leaves your skin silky clean and fresh. I would buy again and again</li>
    <li> Of all the Aveeno body wash products, this is my favorite. I am puzzled as to why this was taken off the store shelves by Aveeno. It is superior to the other present options.</li>
    <li> Aveeno is the best moisturizing body wash that I ever used. I love the way this smells and it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells amazing and makes my skin soft without leaving any residue. This is my second time buying it and im trying new products all the time. I love this one!</li>
