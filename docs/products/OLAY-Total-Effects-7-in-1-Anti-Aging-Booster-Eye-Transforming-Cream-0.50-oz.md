      <li>GREAT EYE CREAM  </li>
      <li>Another great Olay product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has not caused me to break out (which I do very easily), so that is also awesome.  </li>
      <li>She was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait to start using!</li>
      <li>Awesome product my circles looked way better after just a couple times of use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and good value.</li>
      <li>It feels very nice on, and is a good weight-not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Again, nice moisturizer, very available and excellent price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good at treating or preventing the aging process under the eyes.</li>
      <li>So is really good cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this before but it was a good price on here.</li>
      <li>I use olay products because they are a good value.</li>
      <li>Also, good price.  </li>
      <li>It has not increased, which is good, but it has also not decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its a good price</li>
      <li>I could see this being a good product for a man to use since it would add moisture with the slightest brightening affect.  </li>
      <li>I buy it because olay products are good quality versus price, i have been using them for years  </li>
      <li>Olay works just as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I think this product is good for moisturizing the under eye area and also provides a touch of tinted coverage.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m 66), and the area under my eye has never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>The product is creamy and feels good going on.  </li>
      <li>I read good things about the Olay line in a well known consumer magazine and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve changed the formula from an excellent, creamy, rich product it used to be, to something that just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
      <li>and was very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Love this eye cream!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>

      <li>and the fine lines are greatly diminished.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of moisturizing the under eye are which is important.</li>
      <li>This cream is the best one I&#x27;ve found for moisturizing and not irritating anything.  </li>
      <li>It did make my face look nice without makeup, a nice glow that I knew wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
      <li>love it, really a good product</li>
      <li>and she liked it too.</li>
      <li>I  noticed any brightening, but it&#x27;s a nice, moisturizing eye cream.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought, &amp;#34;Snake Oil&amp;#34;, but gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and will order again.  :-)</li>
      <li>Product as ways good, priced at an excellent low amount</li>
      <li>: Very easy to apply.</li>

      <li>All in all, the best product I have used so far is \\&quot;Clinique Repairwear Intensive Eye Cream.\\</li>
      <li>The best drugstore eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>Creamy, absorbs quickly, smells good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesnt work- dont buy this</li>
    <li> Waiting for results to occur.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if this will help slow the lines developed as aging. The product feels smooth and soothing so far.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have used</li>
    <li> Love this! It works as a concealer too! Two products for the price of one! Received super fast and great price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It isn&#x27;t going to make me look younger, it does, however keep my eye area moisturized, and the tint helps diminish dark circles. I feel better about myself when I use it, and, really, that&#x27;s what counts!</li>
    <li> Just a little under the eyes in the mornings/evenings is all it takes. Great product. I really like this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I used this for a couple months but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with my eye area.</li>
    <li> Great texture and not greasy.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have used only two jars of this cream and&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I was completely satisfied&lt;br /&gt;with the results.  I will give it a 4 star rating</li>
    <li> I really like this  eye cream. I find it very moisturizing and it brightens up my eye area. I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement in my wrinkles, but I have only been using it for about a month. Overall, a good product for a great price. The best drugstore eye cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> I have been using this completely around my eyes twice a day, every day for the past few weeks or month.  No bad side effects at all.  I have 2 small children and for a while had somewhat dark rings under my eyes from lack of sleep.  My mom said she definitely noticed a dramatic change with this since using this product. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It has not caused me to break out (which I do very easily), so that is also awesome.  And you only use a tiny amount each time, so this jar will last for a long time! I am betting at LEAST 6 months to a year.&lt;br /&gt;So I really, really like it!</li>
    <li> reduces appearance of dark circles, goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> this cream is GREAT for dark undereye circles, i have always had them and this stuff does the trick. a little dab goes a long way, i expect my jar of cream to last for 4-6 months.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Concealing and brightening.</li>
    <li> When I ordered the anti-aging eye treatment, I noted that it was slightly tinted. However, when I opened the jar, I found that it was more than slightly tinted which was not acceptable to me. I intended to use it for a night cream and certainly don&#x27;t need any tint at all while I am sleeping! I am hoping that I am able to return it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work a advertised.  Used it or a month with no changes in under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Now, I first must say I am 27 so my fine lines aren&#x27;t as deeply set as someone twice my age...but they&#x27;re evident, nonetheless. With that said, I LOVE this cream. It is definitely hydrating and in one week, I was able to see a DRAMATIC difference. The slight darkness is gone and the fine lines have almost disappeared. I would highly recommend this for someone in their late 20s to get a \\&quot;head start\\&quot; on beating the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> Looks like someone touched it before I got it.</li>
    <li> Nowhere on the site did it note that this product has small sparkles in it...strange.  Overall, its a decent product but dont think I would buy it again.  Don&#x27;t like the sparkles so its just not for me.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for a transformation.  Not sure I like the product. Will give it more time .</li>
    <li> very good,thank you !five stars.</li>
    <li> It really helps to hide dark circles and helps to prevent wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used all of mine and would suggest ordering it, I&#x27;ll get more at a later date. I also ordered it for my mom and she liked it too.</li>
    <li> This product seems to do what I expected and certainly was within my budget!  The only problem:  the shipping and handling cost over two times as much as the product....my fault.  I should have looked at  the ad a lot closer.  I had super saver on the other items I purchased.</li>
    <li> this is a fake one. the one i recieved is different (the cap, the printing of words ) from the picture. I bought another one from Walgreen to compare. And they are different. I WANT REFUND</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Really am happy with my purchase...already seeing results. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve made up my mind about it. It seems to work alright: it moisturizes and helps reduce dark under-eye circles to a point. I don&#x27;t really have fine lines around my eyes yet, so I cannot speak to how it works for lines or wrinkles. That said, I give it 3 to 3 1/2 stars. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for an eye moisturizer, since it does not work any better than some others I have tried. The cream seems to have some color or shimmer so that when you put it on, it brightens up the eye right away. That&#x27;s kind of nice, but it&#x27;s only cosmetic. I purchased this since it advertises that is can help lighten dark spots as well as moisturize and brighten dark circles. I have two brown spots under one eye that are either freckles or premature age spots. The cream has had no effect on them after about 4 weeks. Overall this eye cream is alright but definitely no miracle worker. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and probably go back to my old eye cream that worked just as well if not better for moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I downgraded this product from 3 to 2 stars. See my comment.</li>
    <li> Yes, I know it says &amp;#34;7&amp;#34; effects, but I need it for lightening dark circles and moisture.  :)  If it does something else, hoorah!  It is not doing much of anything for crow&#x27;s feet.  This is my favorite cream, in trying many others.  Olay is my favorite brand, in trying many others.  The cream gives a small amount of moisture, without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the mornings, with no makeup over it!  To me, that statement tells the story!</li>
    <li> really helps to moisturize and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It helps take away the puffiness and moisturizes the skin around the eyes. Helps makeup go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, not greasey and seems to be working .</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy and a little goes a long way.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any puffiness since using.  My skin is pretty sensitive and I have not had any reactions - which is great!  I have been using the same jar for 3 months and there is still a ton of product left.  I will definitely purchase again when I eventually run out.</li>
    <li> This moisturizes the dry skin around my eyes. It&#x27;s light and not greasy and soaks into the skin area well. I love Oil of Olay products so will continue using this.</li>
    <li> Work first one I fine and can see the result.</li>
    <li> I began by using Olay 7 Daily Moisturizer and decided to follow suit with the Eye Treatment cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on very smoothly and is a soothing cream for the delicate eye area. Will purchase again, defnitely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished my jar and have not noticed any difference other than the sparkly effect of the silica particles (which I don&#x27;t care for - they&#x27;re not \\&quot;brightening\\&quot; they&#x27;re more like glittery and can really irritate your eyes if you&#x27;re not super careful). This cream was a total waste of money and time. It did absolutely nothing for the dark undereye circles I&#x27;ve recently developed and I didn&#x27;t notice any diminishing effect on the fine lines around my eyes. None at all.</li>
    <li> Product as ways good, priced at an excellent low amount</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.  I can&#x27;t feel or see any visual effects.  I do like another a couple of other products by Olay but this one, didn\&#x27;t do anything wonderful for me.</li>
    <li> Delicate scent.  Smooths on easily.  No irritation to skin or eyes.  I would buy again.  When ordered, it was delivered within a couple of days.  Sure beats driving in the ice and snow.</li>
    <li> I normally like to buy items that are all natural (no tints).  But I wanted to go on the cheaper end to found this item to fight fine lines as well moisturize and protect.  This eye cream doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I had hoped.  Also, it has a little tint, that minimally helps to cover up under eye circles.  The downside to this cream is sometimes during warmer weather, it will bunch up and leave behind creases beneath your eyes.  To me, it&#x27;s a light weight under eye concealer (try to use a primer first).  All in all, the best product I have used so far is \\&quot;Clinique Repairwear Intensive Eye Cream.\\&quot;  I will not give up looking for the best eye cream for the best price.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  And the search continues!</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it said it would. It made my skin smooth and moisturized. It isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t have a scent, and improved my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. I also have very sensitive skin, especially my eyes- and I wear contacts- and it didn&#x27;t affect them negatively at all. The cream also seems to have a *little* color to it compared to others which helps with the dark eye circles underneath. I plan to keep re-ordering.</li>
    <li> This product feels good/cool when you put it on and I like that it also covers up darkness below the eyes.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t  fragrance free</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream since 2003 when I was 24 years old.  I chose this particular eye cream because I had already been using Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer SPF 15  for several years and was very pleased with it.  I have been equally pleased with the Total Effects Eye Cream.  It is a thick cream, so a little goes a long way.  I use it twice daily and it usually lasts me about 4-5 months, unless one of my 3 young children gets ahold of it.  I do not wear make-up and the tint to the eye cream really helps hide the dark circles under my eyes.  I do have some very fine lines, but they&#x27;re much less noticeable than other women my age.  This cream provides great, non-greasy moisture too.  I have eczema and the skin under my eyes gets very dry and scaly during winter, or rather that used to happen before I started using this cream.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem in years.  As a long-term user of Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream, I can whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a great moisturizer that helps hide dark circles and minimize fine lines.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product considering the company&#x27;s reputation. Unfortunately my skin did not like it and I developed a rash that turned my skin red and dried it out. So I&#x27;m back to using the Nivea eye cream for men.</li>
    <li> This eye treatment is great because it doesn&#x27;t cake under the eye.  I use Lancome makeup but the under-eye moisturizer would just cake under my eyes ( I tried Clarin, Arden, etc. too) and they all caked.  This one didn&#x27;t and it is a lot less expensive than the others.  I would definitely recommend it.[[ASIN:B000F65JSC Olay Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream, 0.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B002UUT45A Nivea For Men Q10 Eye Roller, .5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and had seen little difference with over six month&#x27;s of use. I read good things about the Olay line in a well known consumer magazine and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for about three months and find that it has really helped to reduce the dark circles under my eyes. I have a tendency to have dark circles and my seasonal allergies make me look like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect this cream works by including some tint in it but either way it works and by using just a bit on my finger tip it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing make up. I use it only the morning and then I use some of the other olay products at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I would recommend it to men and women who want to lighten the area underneath their eyes and who understand it might do this in part by coloring their skin.</li>
    <li> I use this in the evening after taking my makeup off.  It feels smooth going on and it will last for awhile…because I do not have to use a lot to cover the eye area.  The only thing I feel it doesn&#x27;t do, is remove eye puffiness!  That&#x27;s why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> So far working well but see no major difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now to try to reduce the puffiness and dark circles that take over my under-eye area. I have been using it daily as recommended but am disappointed in the results. My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very easy to apply. Smooth, gentle cream. Hydrates the skin where it is applied. Does not cause a breakout when used in a small area. In fact, it caused no negative reaction on my skin even though I have very sensitive skin. Since it only requires a tiny amount to apply, one jar will probably last me 6 months to a year. It&#x27;s also less expensive than many other anti-aging eye treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I have not noticed any change in the puffiness of my under-eye area. It has not increased, which is good, but it has also not decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: It&#x27;s not very expensive, so it&#x27;s worth giving it a try as it does seem to have helped some people. So far, though, it has not helped me. Unless something drastic changes with this in the next few months, I will not continue to buy this product. Should something change, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and I am pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few years now (I&#x27;m 66), and the area under my eye has never looked so good.  No wrinkles or dark spots.  I use it twice a day along with Olay day or night cream.</li>
    <li> Very happy with how this brightens my aging eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Feels great on fragile skin and seems to smooth lines just a bit?&lt;br /&gt;May simply be hopeful about any change in my appearance, but I do love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite item, i have always had under eye circles and darkness and this really lightens it up. i love it</li>
    <li> I use this product almost every morning and it is great. The little tint really brightens up my eyes. Just let it dry and you can put on makeup over it it easily. My skin is combination leaning towards dry. I&#x27;ve had no problems with allergies to this product.</li>
    <li> am 42 and beginning to develop lines below eyes. Olay&#x27;s eye cream&lt;br /&gt;has no dramatic effect but cheap enough for anyone to try.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye product.  The cream has the perfect texture-not too hard and not too wet.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so far - noticed a difference straight away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now.  I bought it mainly for wrinkles.  Secondary concerns were dark circles and dehydration.  Puffiness has never been an issue for me... until now.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on.  I think the cream is maybe over-hydrating, causing puffiness?  Maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to the ingredients?  I only use it at night.  I will continue using it to see if the puffiness goes away.  Maybe I&#x27;ll start using in the morning, then switch to morning and evening and see what works best.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the wrinkles, but the dark circles seem to be better.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed the formula from an excellent, creamy, rich product it used to be, to something that just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. I have been an Olay user for many years..most of which I liked.&lt;br /&gt;I had not seen this one and decided it might halp my puffy eyes but it did not.</li>
    <li> This product works, and it works quickly.  Quite frankly, I was not expecting much when I purchased it.  I am a guy in my 50&#x27;s.  Dark circles under my eyes appeared a couple of years ago and have grown more pronounced over time.  What I had read about these circles indicated that, aside from diet and sleep, aging naturally thins the skin under the eyes.  This allows the visibility of veins beneath the skin and produces the visible dark circles.  I could see nothing in the list of ingredients on Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Treatment that would seem to be of any benefit.  It was hard to imagine how vitamins, water and glycerin would counter this.  I honestly thought, &amp;#34;Snake Oil&amp;#34;, but gave it a try.  I have been using this product for about a month.  The dark circles are gone.</li>
    <li> Sparkles and perfume are not needed in an eye cream.</li>
    <li> better than expensive Macy&#x27;s beauty counter products such as Clinique, Estee Lauder and Lancome.</li>
    <li> It is helping with the crows feet and puffiness</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the puffiness of my eyes.  It also goes on very shiny and stays shiny which I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the complaints about glitter.  I don&#x27;t see any glitter.  It is very shiny when applied, but that goes away as soon as it is absorbed-in a few minutes.  It feels very nice on, and is a good weight-not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to evaluate long term effects.</li>
    <li> Favorite eye cream ever!</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly.  My under eye area is smooth, and not sunken in.  I use it along with Garnier Nutritioniste Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roller, for best results.  After a week, the dark circles aren&#x27;t gone, but hopefully they will lessen with continued use.</li>
    <li> Awesome product my circles looked way better after just a couple times of use. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used Olay products for years, so I was confident purchasing this. WRONG!. It caused an allergic reaction, the area around my eyes became red, itchy and swollen. Then the left lid started to droop after the swelling went down.  I will be finding something else to use, because I will not put this on my eye area anymore.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I expected too much or this product is just not for me.  At least, in my case, I didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have recently developed darkness under my eyes which is why I researched and bought this product. I am 37 and my skin is changing. I have used and liked other eye creams but none have relieved me from my under eye dark spots. This actually did work and I still use. Very often I buy a skin products with hope and usually I am disappointed and don&#x27;t buy again. Not true with oil of okay products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years.... I&#x27;m 32. I definitely notice a dry, red chapped eye area when I don&#x27;t use this.  Makes my skin feel moisturized and refreshed. I&#x27;ve tried other products more and less expensive but my skin has bad reactions to all of those. This is the only product that works for me.</li>
    <li> Like it very much, does the job but it isn&#x27;t a 5 star.  Have yet to meet an eyecream that is.  I&#x27;ll reorder this when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Good price too.  Happy overall.</li>
    <li> The eye cream feels rich and creamy. I already feel the difference to the area under the eyes. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I&#x27;m very pleased and will order again.  :-)</li>
    <li> Works great! I have been using Olay 7 eye and face cream for quite a while. I love the coverage and effects.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered timely.  I have used more expensive products in the past and feel this product is just as good as more expensive products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I got a coupon, after trying it, I would never buy this again. This product is too thick, has glitter (Mica), and I couldn&#x27;t wear it under makeup b/c it smeared. Also, it basically did nothing for my eye area.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t match what I was looking for. I was hoping for something creamier - this really has a light texture. I use it after applying toner and lightly tap it before smoothing it around my eyes. After using this, I also apply an evening face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to apply, smooth, non greasy, good for sensitive skin, a little product goes a long way, sturdy packaging&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Didn&#x27;t really notice much difference in fine lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I didn&#x27;t really get the &amp;#34;this product really works!&amp;#34; feeling. I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference when I woke up in the morning. Will probably try another product next time.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away!</li>
    <li> Creamy, absorbs quickly, smells good.</li>
    <li> I like this better than other creams I&#x27;ve used. A little goes a long way. It really smooths out the texture of the skin around the eyes and helps with fine lines. Would purchase again, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s good at treating or preventing the aging process under the eyes. I use it to treat and prevent dark circles. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Nice and very moisterising!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before but it was a good price on here. There are probably more expensive creams that work better, I wouldn&#x27;t know. This one is great though.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions. I think this product is good for moisturizing the under eye area and also provides a touch of tinted coverage.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks an it works great.  I am a 53 year old woman who takes good care of herself, but can&#x27;t help the ever increasing skin on my eyelids that age brings for some of us.  I started to feel the difference with my fingers when putting on lotions or make up (less sag) and then I started to see the difference. Far less puffiness even after little sleep.  Brighter under the eyes as well.  My skin is sensitive and this does not bother it at all.  The cream has the consistency of a whipped product and spreads easily.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all, so will last awhile. No perfumes or scents.  I will absolutely continue to use this and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL for under the eyes, if you are starting to get wrinkles!!! It hydrates, then disappears, great for dark circles too!!! And its not that expensive!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF, I WON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE!! THIS IS MY EYE CREME!!!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and decided to give this a try.  Was surprised to see the actual small size of the jar but since it only takes a very tiny dab I know it will last quite a long time.  I like it and it seems to do well under the eyes on top of my concealer.  Tiny bit of a shimmer but looks good.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what this is supposed to do but whatever it is, I don&#x27;t believe it is doing it. I will save my money for a different product next.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes the skin around my eyes feel. Helps with under eye circles .</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and purchase process!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE eye cream. Applies smoothly and blends well with makeup.  If you search Amazon thoroughly, you might be able to find this product at a decent price. I have found it as low as $9 for a full size.</li>
    <li> GREAT EYE CREAM  USE THIS .  MY UNDER EYES  ARE NOT AS PUFFY AS THEY WERE AND MY UPPER EYE  LIDS  LOOK WIDER  AND CROWS FEET SEEMTO GO AWAY.  L</li>
    <li> I am 76 years old and people are always surprised when I tell them my age.  I think that this product gets a lot of the credit.  I use it all over my face and am quite pleased with the effect  A little bit goes a loooooooooong way!</li>
    <li> My under eye skin was VERY dry, and I also have dark circles. This eye cream healed all that dryness without being greasy. I wear it every night and morning under my make-up. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for the dark circles, but it takes care of my small wrinkles and moistures really well. Even though I&#x27;m 38, my eyes look healthy and young! For my dark circles, I just wear concealer. I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Product just not for me I am a brown skinned African American and the cream left a beige hue on my skin might be a good product maybe I will use it for the night time only</li>
    <li> I am not necessarily pleased with t his product. After use the area around my eyes still feel dry.</li>
    <li> I  noticed any brightening, but it&#x27;s a nice, moisturizing eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cream.  It is creamy, but not greasy.  Makes your face feel and look soft.  I think the only thing that would make it the best face cream ever would be if there were SPF15 in it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a short period, i have major faith in the oil of olay products so im hoping that i will see results within the next month or so. But for now i will just keep my fingers crossed that it doesnt let me down.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few years now.  I use it at every night and every morning, right around my eyes.  I feel it has made a big difference in the wrinkles.  But you have to use it every day.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great.  Seems to hydrate without being all oily.  Also, good price.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> After the first use, my under-eye fine lines seemed smoother.  The product is creamy and feels good going on.  I have now used it about a week and the lines seemed diminished even more.</li>
    <li> realy small but you dobt supost to use a lot or this i ben use i like i dont see to much change yet but work on my husband</li>
    <li> I just received this item in the mail yesterday and tried it immediately. It is the first product that I&#x27;ve tried that has immediate results. My dark circles started to dissappear (I think there is a lightening effect in the cream but it still made me feel better) and the skin under my eyes felt tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Philosophy&#x27;s dark circle cream (the one in the tube) and Lancome&#x27;s anti-puffer cream AND Garnier&#x27;s eye roller..and I have not been impressed with any of those but this Olay cream is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for a longer length of time and if my results are negative I will re-rate this product but if not- then the stars stay!</li>
    <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation but have the dark circles under my eyes that I want to hide without the heavy concealer and this works great for moisture helping the crows feet with a tint of color. I have bought this for years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter. She has never tryed this but I think she will like it as I do. It really helps with the under eye circles and softens the crows feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and see some difference.  It&#x27;s nothing major, but I definitely notice that my under eye circles are not as dark.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to not working my night job anymore since I am more well-rested.  Whatever the case is, I do believe that this product works in comparison to other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  Plus, the price is very fair and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for weeks and feel that it does nothing.  I see no difference in my skin whatsoever.  I really like Olay Products and use several of them but this product adds no value to my daily beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> When  you read the product description it says that it helps reduce the \\&quot;appearance\\&quot; of under eye darkness, that must be mostly due to the slight color of the cream which makes it act like a concealer. So don&#x27;t be fooled it never says that it will actually diminish those dark circles. I have been using this product for over 6 weeks now and have not noticed any lightening of my under eye darkness. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream--light weight, excellent coverage, and comfortable to wear.  It also comes in dark color.  The best I&#x27;ve ever used !!</li>
    <li> This cream is fine except if you accidentally get some in your eyes.  It stings.  Other than that, the cream works fine.</li>
    <li> It does not have retinol in it, which I the opposite of why I bought it. The info was incorrect before purchase.</li>
    <li> Though .4 oz seems like just a tiny bit, it lasts forever. Just a little under the eyes in the mornings/evenings and it&#x27;ll cause the dark circles to fade with time. it works better if you try and get better sleep and avoid rubbing your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious how it works, it&#x27;s really just a very mild fade cream. The dark circles under your eyes are really capillaries that have burst from rubbing them too much. This cream just fades the result.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the product is genuine I compare it with the one I normally buy at Walmart and the texture and package are different I&#x27;m going to cancel my order</li>
    <li> Looks pretty good. Waiting to see effect after some time passes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for years and this eye cream is one of their best products. It doesn&#x27;t go on greasy so you can use it am or pm. I honestly feel that this has helped prevent fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> best eye cream for the price out there.</li>
    <li> I used the entire pot before deciding to write a review. It&#x27;s a tiny little pot, and with generous application probably won&#x27;t last more than 3 months for some users. After about a month, I knew this wasn&#x27;t going to do anything. After applying, it seemed like some of my fine lines looked a bit better. But after washing my face they looked the same. I don&#x27;t think this had any long term effect, it only looks good when you&#x27;re wearing it. So I started just using it my whole face on days when I didn&#x27;t want to wear makeup out. It did make my face look nice without makeup, a nice glow that I knew wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores. But it&#x27;s definitely not worth paying the price for something that doesn&#x27;t work as it claims it will.</li>
    <li> Great product. Its not a miracle butlong term use is where you see dramatic results.  It does remove dark circles and helps with puffiness.  It also brightens your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was using the Regenerist eye cream, and I loved that, but I switched to this one based upon the claims it would erase dark circles.  The cream is colored, so it does minimize my dark circles with out makeup, and really helps get rid of the I-haven&#x27;t-slept-in-4yrs-when-will-theese-kids-sleep-through-the-night? look.  Love this eye cream!</li>
    <li> after using it twice a day for 3 weeks, so no difference in wrinkle disappearance or reduction. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Feels great and lasts a long time. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some extra moisturizing under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a staple in my beauty regimen. It combat dry skin, crows feet, puffiness, and dark circles.  I love this eye cream and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Great value for a solid performer. You can spend much more but there&#x27;s no need to. This eye cream works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Good products and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short amount of time, but I can say I do like the feel of it, and it does seem to be helping my dark circles and fine lines under my eyes. I hope it continues to improve my tired looking eyes!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and good price.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep wrinkles away not harsh.</li>
    <li> Just recently received this and have been wearing it at night and before wearing makeup. I like it because it is not too oily and very sheer.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother。She said it is pretty good！</li>
    <li> i really like the cream, i feel like it hydrates my undereye area well and has been diminishing the darkness, puffiness and wrinkles in the area. I am only 30 but i have big eyes and dont take great care of my skin; i dont have the time, energy or willpower needed to drink near enough water or care on a consistent basis. this lotion is helping me look and feel better and that makes it worth my money</li>
    <li> I have used this product to treat dry itching and red eyelids. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and good value. I was surprised when it showed up in a little jar, but it doesn&#x27;t take much and works wonders.</li>
    <li> For what is out there in this price range this cream isn&#x27;t bad. If you can afford to pay a little more there are many better ones.</li>
    <li> Great lotion in theory, however I&#x27;m not sure this is the real thing. I did not see any difference and it seemed as though about 1/3 of the product was missing from the bottle. It wasn&#x27;t properly sealed like all Olay products normally are. Its a good price but they take some of it anyways...</li>
    <li> I use olay products because they are a good value. Unfortunately, I have seen no change at all with the total effects anti-aging eye treatment.</li>
    <li> Nice big jar of eye cream w/a little tint to brighten your eye area. I use it every morning &amp; let it sit before I apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Too strong for application under my eyes and the fumes apparently irritated my eyes.  I had to stop using it after only a couple of applications.</li>
    <li> This really helps. Will purchase again and recommends.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! It is light weight and non-greasy. I have seen a slight improvement in the darkness under my eyes, mostly just an improvement in how dry the skin is. When I remember to use it at night, the next morning my under eye area is less puffy and dark.</li>
    <li> If you read and use my reviews, you know I like the Olay 7 signs products!  Again, nice moisturizer, very available and excellent price.  Go ahead, give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have used eye moisturizer for years.  It provides just the right amount of moisturizing and a has a nice tint that lightens up they under eye area.  No scent so good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Awful stuff and left eyes puffy and itchy.  But maybe that&#x27;s just my skin which tends to be normal.</li>
    <li> I bought it as part of my recommended regimen from Olay.  It&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;m 27 and in law school so I thought it might be good to do what all the other girls are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets one star because it moisturizes under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses one star because it made the circles under my eyes worse.  I now look like I have been punched in the orbits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses another star because that weird tinting has to be washed off.  You also have to be very careful that you do actually rub it in completely because it dries lighter than what it looks like.  Even at the smallest amount, you&#x27;re going to be there awhile so set some time up for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses another star because even if I wash off the stuff the twice a day it says I should be applying it to my skin, it still manages to put some sort of weird bump on top of one dark circle.  I&#x27;m not sure what it is.  I want to call it a stye but it doesn&#x27;t look anything like what my brother had when he was a toddler.  It also refuses to pop or produce anything so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what it is.  It&#x27;s just this bump that won&#x27;t go away now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses the last star because it reduced the fine wrinkles around my eyes by making them into deeper wrinkles so, yeah, I had fewer fine lines at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend unless you are just looking for a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> love it, really a good product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products. Bought these products for my mom for Christmas. She was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait to start using! Competitive or lower prices than at retail!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product. It seems to make the area around my eyes smoother and possibly my dark circles lighter.</li>
    <li> very good. give you 5 star.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream ever.  Love it.  Love also Olay sculpting cream.  Works very well!!!!  Will continue to use same always.  I am a platinum senior.</li>
    <li> Smooth - not too heavy yet very effective.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes feel great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work due to an eye infection, will try again at a later date.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works great! While there are no miracle cures, this does minimize the effects of aging.</li>
    <li> I see no results from this product, I think it&#x27;s a waste of time and money. I&#x27;m sorry I got it!</li>
    <li> This product has a good thick texture allowing proper application and portion control (and a little goes a long way making its price for its value very reasonable). There are no perfumes and there are no residual sticky or greasy feeling after application. Also; I ran out of my normal face cream without realizing I was completely out (seperate Oil of Olay product), so I used this product as a temporary substitute on my entire face including the eye area. My face felt well-hydrated for the entire day. I have never before used a hydrating product made for the eyes on my entire face. I was very happy with the results and felt that if my entire face felt this well-hydrated (and not greasy or shiny), then this product must truly be well-designed and produced. I have used department store brand names as well as other over-the-counter products; I am sincerely happiest with this product.</li>
    <li> Skin got raw and red from it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in excellent condition. No complaint. I have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone who might be interested</li>
    <li> I love it is a very special for our eyes, I am using every day in the morning and in the night.  my skin look a lot better and I am looking younger too.  So is really good cream. Special is a light pink so look very natural when I put on.</li>
    <li> This feels great on your face and around your eyes.  I use it in the morning and at bedtime and it seems to help my skin greatly.</li>
    <li> I love Olay Total Effects eye treatment. I love the price, I love the fact that Olay is a company that has done a TON of research into what works well for skincare treatment and I use it daily and nightly. I love the consistency of the cream - no reactions, no sensitivity, no allergies. It&#x27;s like my skin just soaks it up. LOVE Olay products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and absorbs quickly, but I saw no difference in my skin. PLUS it has this weird gold shimmer/glitter that sticks around under my eyes and I can see it through my concealer/makeup and it just annoys me! I have no idea why they would put glitter in an eye cream. Try something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since a few years now.  I first chose this product after a lot of research, because I followed malicious/bad advice which caused massive wrinkles around my eyes (literally in a few days).  It was a wonder product for me the first time I used it, as it helped erase those wrinkles in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since winter 2014 I have switched over to using oils as moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have this product in my arsenal, and I use it in conjunction with oils.  This is the only cream that I ever use.  I keep extra at hand, so that I never run out.  lastly, I would add that I have become conscious of avoiding Parabens and toxic chemicals in my creams and cosmetics.  Olay face and eye creams have parabens but I would still use this brand, because this is one of the best out there.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream....love how it goes on.</li>
    <li> I prefer the eye moisturizer than comes with the lash kit but I haven&#x27;t found that moisturizer sold separately anywhere.  This product has a color too it so extra gentle blending is needed.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in womans day magainze and had to try it due to the fabulous review. This product lives up to its reputation.</li>
    <li> I brought this to slow down the aging around my eyes. This product definitely give you an instant lift in the morning, perhaps because of its tinted color. This product allows me to leave my house without concealers for my undereye circles because of the tinted color. I like because I definitely notice the immediate difference in the appearance of my eyes once its applied to my eyes. However, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet because I have to still wait and see if they actually help with my fine lines.</li>
    <li> Another great Olay product.  Rich, smooth cream!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye treatment. It has a little bit of a tint to it but it seems to absorb without actually leaving any color on skin. It give a nice bit of moisture but does not leave any greasy or slippery residue so you can get right on with your makeup. I&#x27;m a long time user of Olay products and the Total Effects line as well. I don&#x27;t expect these products to change my skin, but I do want the moisture to keep my skin softer and to at least give the illusion of being smoother, and this definitely helps.</li>
    <li> Really love clay. And this is just another item i love. I would recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a month for under eye puffiness and dark circles and have seen NO change...very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I am using it now... my friend had amazing results, but so far my results are just okay - nothing significant</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for approximately 8 years. Its worked fabulous. Has a hint of shimmer (not noticeable like makeup or anything) and never feels oily or heavy. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> New and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Would use no other.</li>
    <li> It really does what it says it does. After week one I saw visible results. I waited for two weeks after using it to write this review and it deff 100% works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay skin care for years, after wasting money on expensive products.  Olay works just as good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Affordable, easy to find and buy.  My face fools people into thinking I&#x27;m much younger, so yes, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;thanks God bless</li>
    <li> I love this. It does a great job of moisturizing the under eye are which is important. It is also slightly tinted to help cover those bags as well. After awhile my under eyes weren&#x27;t as dark as they were. I&#x27;m on my second jar (which lasts a long time at 2x a day) and I&#x27;ll continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> this is my first time using this so I will have to wait &amp; see how it works. but, I am a big fan of Olay products...</li>
    <li> I tried another product, but it just didn&#x27;t compare to this one, so I have returned gratefully to Olay</li>
    <li> Im giving this product a 4 star instead of a 5 because Ive  not used it long enough to see major improvements.  That being said i can say i noticed tighter looking skin  below my eyes upon the very first application. I will use this for awhile,and then add to my comments here good or bad in the near future.  I chose this brand over others because the slightly flesh toned colour appealed to me and made sense for the task at hand, that is, to lighten the under eye skin as well as snug it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i will also say a little goes a long way, so at the moment I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that I&#x27;ll keep seeing progress!</li>
    <li> Reduces puffiness and crow&#x27;s feet, but not dark circles.  Dark circles stayed, but after three months of using every morning, the crow&#x27;s feet and puffiness are greatly reduced.  This does have a bit of color in it, so it helps cover the circles a bit, but not correct them.  It does burn my eyes sometimes, but no more than any other eye cream I tried.</li>
    <li> Love it, not greasy but seems to really moisturize.</li>
    <li> I had a severe allergic reaction to the cream as soon as I tried it--developed red, scaly , burning rash all around eyes. Will need to return.</li>
    <li> Just as I have stated in other ratings, Olay products are the best for me!  This product is so smooth, creamy, light, and works!  It does exactly as it states!  I really love it!  Thank you Olay!</li>
    <li> I used the older version of the Olay eye cream. But, they really have improved it.  I use this eye cream and their matching face cream over my RocC  day cream.  It has just enough slight coloring that it covers dark circles.  I use my little paddle to place the cream around my eyes, as you should never put your fingers into the jar. Certain germs can contaminate the entire jar, and cause it to go bad way before it&#x27;s time.  GREAT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;Fonnie</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY eye creams searching for one that would work for me. I have extremely sensitive skin under my eyes and most of the ones I tried left me looking older and more wrinkly than prior to using them! The more expensive ones I tried (Arbonne FC5 and Boscia Enlivening Amino AG) caused my under eyes to burn. I also tried Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle eye creams, Roc Retinol Correxion for sensitve skin and ended up with more wrinkles than were originally there and dry patches. I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance eye cream as well and although this one did not seem to cause a reaction it did not absorb either so did nothing for my under eye wrinkles/dryness. I decided one day to just pick this one up without knowing much about it figuring I&#x27;d end up disappointed again. Imagine my surprise when I used it and there was no burning sensation. And a few days later I started noticing my under eye area slight darkness is gone and the fine lines are greatly diminished. I am 45 years old so I am not expecting a miracle here. But I don&#x27;t want my eyes to make me look 80 either! I had given up finding something that would truly work and wouldn&#x27;t cause me more problems. But I found it in this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using this about 4 weeks now and am coming to the end of this first jar. It is working wonderfully for me. Moisturizes very well, doesn&#x27;t irritate, no fragrance and reduces fine lines and dark circles. Wish I&#x27;d have found this long ago!</li>
    <li> This product gets great reviews, but I am not sold on it yet.... I will continue to use it until I am. I may just be challenged when it comes to tinted products.</li>
    <li> Very soft, creamy , and just a bit of highlight....this is my all time fav., and the price is not bad though I don&#x27;t remember the amount right now....can&#x27;t find this anymore on the shelves so I&#x27;ve had to go thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Pleased with product.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s helping....it&#x27;s only been a few days.</li>
    <li> I notice that the black circles under my eyes are lighter. My eyes are no longer puffy. It keeps my eye area hydrated and soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When I received this, I had to return it. It appeared that the product had already been used, as there was a finger-shaped indentation in the cream. I was looking forward to trying out this product, and I had great faith that it would work wonderfully. However, I simply could not use it, since it appeared that someone else already had.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin, it moisturizes, it&#x27;s not greasy, there&#x27;s no smell, but that&#x27;s about it.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference in lines, puffiness, dark circles.  I will say that the color scared me when I saw it since it has pigment to it.  If you are concerned about that, don&#x27;t be, it blends right in with your skin and I can&#x27;t imagine the pigment would be visible on any skin tone.  I could see this being a good product for a man to use since it would add moisture with the slightest brightening affect.  I am not planning on purchasing this for myself again.</li>
    <li> Great bargain. Fast service. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a month. I have noticed the difference in my dark circles but not neccesarily my fine wrinkles which is why I ordered the cream. I think it&#x27;s still too early to judge it so I&#x27;ll post another follow up review in about a month or 2.</li>
    <li> Used every single day &amp; night till gone, no nothing, would not buy again seen nothing different skin same Nothing special I would recommend</li>
    <li> I still see no change in one month I put on at night before going to bed as it has color and Im a male maybe better for woman I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ll never order again.</li>
    <li> I know that this product isn&#x27;t on the natural side, but it works well for under makeup. I use another more natural cream for night time that does not work well under makeup. It has a tiny bit of a lightening effect and absorbs well. It just works. I wish it was well rated on the EWG, but I will continue using it until I find a more natural replacement. I have used it for several years now because I can&#x27;t seem anything else that works as well. One jar lasts 6 months for me since I only use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> great price and product</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years!</li>
    <li> I recommend it. I didn&#x27;t have it for two months and could feel t he difference. A must have.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream every day for the past 7 years.  I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for the past 20+ years, and my co-workers thought I was 10 years younger than my true age.  They were amazed to discover my real age when I had a milestone birthday this year.  It&#x27;s great!  Total Effects twice a day keeps the wrinkles away.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports rates this well. I like it, reduces the blu-ish under my eyes, keeps the skin tight. Very good stuff</li>
    <li> well, OK. I don&#x27;t know...</li>
    <li> Makes your eyes brighter a all the ski  aroud it  promotes collagen to have a youthful skin eyes it&#x27;s a miracle</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, goes on smooth and non greasy.  You only need a dab...great product!!  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the first eye cream I have used.  So far no complaints.  Wish I had something to compare it to, but I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Feels great, goes on smooth, already ordered and received a second jar ,just so I don&#x27;t run out! Price is extremely reasonable!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months and the puffiness has disappeared and the dark circles have also disappeared. My husband saysthat my eyes are looking alot better than what they have been in years.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of trouble with eye creams causing my eyes to burn and itch during the day.  This cream is the best one I&#x27;ve found for moisturizing and not irritating anything.  There is a reason why it is rated so highly, it works!</li>
    <li> I buy it because olay products are good quality versus price, i have been using them for years  thank you</li>
