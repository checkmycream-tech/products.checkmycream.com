      <li>I&#x27;ve literally had to wash it off midday because it was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>but it is my favorite deorandent</li>
      <li>Old Spice Wild Collection Hawkridge deodorant sounded kind of awesome.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to the oh old spice.</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t wear it because the perfume is so strong that I get a headache.</li>
      <li>I love sweet smells.  </li>
      <li>Great scene, obviously with a bit of coconut in it.</li>
      <li>[Smells to me like Beeswax, light fruit, and cedar.]&lt;br /</li>
      <li>For a while now, I&#x27;ve been having people I know (family and close friends who&#x27;d be comfortable telling me things like this)</li>
      <li>This is my primary deodorant.</li>
      <li>But, overall, great stuff.</li>
      <li>however, it is very effective, ALL DAY and even till the next morning.  </li>
      <li>I will boycott to my hearts end if you ever stop making this, its fresh, bold, mature, addicting, gets me laid and goes greAT WITH the spray and body wash.</li>
      <li>Sure, the scent is great when you smell the actual stick of deodorant, but mix it with the unique chemistry of your body, and it takes on completely new dimensions.</li>
      <li>The rumors are true, this deodorant might just convince the ladies you have wings.</li>
      <li>Some guys may not like it smelling so sweet</li>
      <li>Yes, I am a woman, and Yes I LOVE the Hawkridge scent of Old Spice on me!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger deodorant for a long time to great results (I love that stuff).</li>
      <li>I finally found the deodorant that I really enjoy and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible, but nor is it very masculine.  </li>
      <li>So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
      <li>My favorite flavor of old spice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deodorants, but this is by far my all time favorite.</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent, like vanilla mixed with a musky outdoor mountain smell.</li>
      <li>Has more antipersperant (18%) than many other brands.</li>
      <li>love the smell of this deodorant AND it has more antiperspirant than other sticks (18%)  </li>
      <li>But today I&#x27;ve made a huge discovery regarding this one in particular.  </li>
      <li>For myself I experienced this since using this product and variants of it for the past two years.</li>
      <li>There are some that smell really good on the stick, like Bearglove for example, but then once it reacts to my body&#x27;s temperature it smells sour.</li>
      <li>I saw a pigeon, but no matter how long I chased it around, it didn&#x27;t seem very interested in becoming my cool animal</li>
      <li>The power of marketing is strong at Old Spice, and yet, this is a disappointment.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I am a female, I love the male oriented deodorants and out of the many Old Spice smells we have used this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>OK, truthfully, the commercial involving some hawks screaming into a dude&#x27;s junk were probably the driving force behind the idea this stuff would be good.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>My favorite is the wolf one (smells like fruit roll-ups, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing), with the bear one coming in second.</li>
      <li>Product is a favorite of my teenage sons and we can no longer find this in stores.  </li>
      <li>I recently bought the HawkRidge deodorant as it smelled interesting in-store.</li>
      <li>My brother&#x27;s ex girlfriend took a whiff, and sure enough, said that it smelled like my brother.  </li>
      <li>these keep my pits from smelling exactly like my butt.</li>
      <li>After a little research online, it turns out that this is a known issue with the current formula with the product and have to admit I am very thankful that what I experienced was mild in comparison to others.</li>
      <li>I bought it initially for my teenager boy as his BO is quite strong.</li>
      <li>It last very long and always keep me smelling good.</li>
      <li>Most other deodorants - anti-perspirant or not - usually fail on me after 8 or so hours.</li>
      <li>It has a clean fresh scent that lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>I bought a stick of Hawkridge deodorant, because evidently it gives you power over hawks and high rolling card sharks.  </li>
      <li>After I figured out that less is best, I really like this scent over all the other ones I have from Old Spice.</li>
      <li>I really reccomend it.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell of this stuff.</li>
      <li>The smell is not the same as the fantastic Hawkridge body wash.  </li>
      <li>go into a laundromat, buy a box of those cheap sheets from the vending machine next to that sleeping guy, and rub them all over your body while reading a quilting magazine.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOATHE the smell of this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this deodorant, my brother and I were \\&quot;weird\\&quot; and \\&quot;odd\\&quot; and \\&quot;unique\\&quot; smelling.</li>
      <li>Definitely a fave, fantastic, wish we had it here in Australia</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re going to have to supply your own hawks, and the local casino is totally uptight when it comes to trying to bring a trained bird of prey into their establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely the most feminine fragrance out of all the Old Spice deodorants, but I could see how it could be a unisex type smell.</li>
      <li>no longer have the receipt from the store I bought it at, but I am not really interested in using it any more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other of the new Old Spice collection scents and, while they are all really good, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>After a couple months, I found myself going to the Old Spice as my first choice.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been scared of hights as much, i was sitting on my chimminey watching the neighborhood when my neighbor pulled up in a new shiny car.</li>
      <li>Well, just a few days ago my brother told me an interesting story about what had happened at school (he is in high school).</li>
      <li>His usual fresh scent is so strong that it makes my eyes water when I&#x27;m near him.</li>
      <li>If you have not noticed, female deodorants a third more expensive than what men deodorants cost and don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job as a man&#x27;s deodorant</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smell good&lt;br /&gt;me like&lt;br /&gt;me smell long time</li>
    <li> This version smells completely different from the invisible solid version http://www.amazon.com/Old-Spice-Collection-Hawkridge-Anti-Perspirant/dp/B00B30SHEC/ even though it has the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop giving scent products the same name if their scents are different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody else has mentioned that this stuff kinda smells like bleu cheese once it&#x27;s applied. Bleu cheese and coconut. Kinda nasty. I guess the sticker on the cap is to attract suckers like me.</li>
    <li> Smell lasts all day. Tropical birds and hawks follow me.  I did get into a staring contest with an eagle but it was a draw since we both saw a salmon and broke eye contact to get it. The eagles was faster due to his wings which i find a unfair advantage. I also find myself eating more berries and seeds but its fiber and can&#x27;t be that bad. I haven&#x27;t been scared of hights as much, i was sitting on my chimminey watching the neighborhood when my neighbor pulled up in a new shiny car. I felt the urge to go to the bathroom so i climbed down.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves the smell of this stuff. After I put it on she cant stay off of me!</li>
    <li> Marketed towards guys with swift minds, you&#x27;ll find that the Old Spice Hawkridge deodorant does not disappoint. I found that the scent was not overpowering but subtle. Of course what matters is that did perform well and wasn&#x27;t just masking natural body odor.</li>
    <li> Yes, I am a woman, and Yes I LOVE the Hawkridge scent of Old Spice on me!!! I bought it initially for my teenager boy as his BO is quite strong. My boy said it smelled too &#x27;vanilla&#x27; for him and he was indeed correct, it has undertones of vanilla or something very light,not the usual &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell that he and hubby are used to with the old, Old Spice...so I gave it a try and OH MY!! I am hooked. If you have not noticed, female deodorants a third more expensive than what men deodorants cost and don&#x27;t do nearly as good of a job as a man&#x27;s deodorant does, they are smaller and thus last less.I was buying almost weekly deodorants because of the intense fragrances that merely mask BO with strong scents but still leave you smelly after a few days of usage... I have now switched completely to Hawkridge and I have stocked up on them as I am not going back to girly overpriced and over scented deodorants. Thank you Amazon for carrying it as a subscribe and save item. I am no longer having to search all my local big box retailers in search of this deodorant (I think it&#x27;s quite popular, and not stocked continuously). Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband needed new deodorant, so I stood in CVS and smelled all of the new Old Spice scents. His usual fresh scent is so strong that it makes my eyes water when I&#x27;m near him. Once I opened this, I was sold. It&#x27;s a nice mellow scent. Yes maybe it smells of coconuts. Maybe it reminds me of our trips to Hawaii before our baby was born. Either way, it works for both of us.</li>
    <li> This is one of the finest scents created by Old Spice.  It has a clean fresh scent that lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> I have been using Old Spice&#x27;s Swagger deodorant for a long time to great results (I love that stuff). I decided to branch out and mess around with other scents. I recently bought the HawkRidge deodorant as it smelled interesting in-store. Unfortunately, it seems to have something like 7 billion percent more smell strength - I can&#x27;t wear it because the perfume is so strong that I get a headache. I&#x27;ve literally had to wash it off midday because it was overwhelming. Also, I&#x27;m afraid that the air around me might be made flammable by the scent, and if I get to close to a spark I&#x27;ll be engulfed in an odorous fireball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have the receipt from the store I bought it at, but I am not really interested in using it any more. I guess I could use the remainder of the stick as some kind of smell weapon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deodorants, but this is by far my all time favorite. There are some that smell really good on the stick, like Bearglove for example, but then once it reacts to my body&#x27;s temperature it smells sour. This one amazing all the time. So disappointed that they stopped selling this scent at popular retailers I&#x27;ve gone to.</li>
    <li> Hawkridge has a gross smell, I think Old Spice is discontinuing it.</li>
    <li> Was wanting to buy the antiperspirant version of the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different caps on the deodorant containers would be much more helpful.</li>
    <li> I will boycott to my hearts end if you ever stop making this, its fresh, bold, mature, addicting, gets me laid and goes greAT WITH the spray and body wash. TOOOOSHaayy</li>
    <li> Product is a favorite of my teenage sons and we can no longer find this in stores.  Scent is good without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of these Wild Collection scents for a while. My favorite is the wolf one (smells like fruit roll-ups, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing), with the bear one coming in second. But today I&#x27;ve made a huge discovery regarding this one in particular.  For a while now, I&#x27;ve been having people I know (family and close friends who&#x27;d be comfortable telling me things like this) tell me that I have an odd smell. It&#x27;s not good or bad they say, just a bit odd. This worried me, but I didn&#x27;t think there was anything I could do about it. I knew that some people just have unique scents due to differing body chemistry, and I thought that my \\&quot;weird\\&quot; smell was due to this. (There was also a time when my siblings thought that my scent might be tied to my heavy consumption of Srirracha hot sauce, but I stopped eating it and they said my scent didn&#x27;t change). Well, just a few days ago my brother told me an interesting story about what had happened at school (he is in high school). He had worn a girl&#x27;s jacket for a short while during the day, and a while later after he had taken it off, she said that it smelled weird. She passed it around and everyone agreed that it had an odd smell. My brother&#x27;s ex girlfriend took a whiff, and sure enough, said that it smelled like my brother.  Concerned about his weird smell, he later asked my other siblings to smell him. Turns out, they said, he had the same weird smell as me. He thought it might be a family thing...  UNTIL HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS USING THE SAME DEODORANT AS ME -- OLD SPICE HAWKRIDGE.  Sure, the scent is great when you smell the actual stick of deodorant, but mix it with the unique chemistry of your body, and it takes on completely new dimensions. Now, I do realize that this may indeed be a family thing -- perhaps something with our unique genetics and body chemistry led this particular scent to smell odd on us and it won&#x27;t have the same effect on you... But be warned.  We just made this discovery today, so now I&#x27;m facedwith rebuilding my sweet smelling reputation that I&#x27;d worked so hard to build. Thanks to this deodorant, my brother and I were \\&quot;weird\\&quot; and \\&quot;odd\\&quot; and \\&quot;unique\\&quot; smelling.</li>
    <li> When you need to smell like a delicious man!!!! :D</li>
    <li> Have used Old Spice deodorants before have not been impressed.But picked Hawkridge up in New York and I really love the subtle coconut aroma.No irritations and does not interfere with colognes.Big surprise.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells so good. It kind of reminds me of coconut. It works really well and helps me to not have bad B.O. as I sometimes have with other deodorants.</li>
    <li> I was just told that I smell like a coconut car wash air freshener. Six hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if she meant it as a sleight or if she finds me scintillating?? Either way I smell like I just returned, triumphant, from Narnia. I leave it to you to determine if that&#x27;s a good or bad thing.</li>
    <li> I finally found the deodorant that I really enjoy and smells amazing. It last very long and always keep me smelling good.</li>
    <li> The deodorant stinks and smell nothing like the antiperspirant.  The antiperspirant smells great.  Don&#x27;t see how they could be that different.</li>
    <li> Caveat: scents and deodorants work with specific body chemistries. What works for someone else may smell like skunks and rotting flesh on you. (Well, probably not THAT bad, but you get the drift).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I appreciate about this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;1) Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering, but is pleasantly noticeable. I have a hard time with many men&#x27;s deodorants because they smell very chemically when I put them on. This smells faintly of vanilla and warm spices. Wife loves it, and she&#x27;s the only one really smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;2) Most other deodorants - anti-perspirant or not - usually fail on me after 8 or so hours. This stuff keeps going for 24 (e.g. If I&#x27;m camping or backpacking) or more.&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s NOT an anti perspirant! Every one I&#x27;ve tried has left me itchy and raw pretty quickly. With this stuff, my pits sweat no more than when I&#x27;m wearing an anti-perspirant, and I don&#x27;t feel super gross in return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying this stuff in this scent for as long as Old Spice keeps making it.</li>
    <li> My favorite flavor of old spice. Smells refreshing and keeps me alert</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  My wife doesn&#x27;t like cologne smell but after smelling this scent she&#x27;s ok&#x27;d me to get a smell like this. Does this fragrance come in a cologne?  If so, I would love to by it.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the strangest smelling Old spice scent to date.  It smells like a cinnamon crumb donut!  I stupidly put it on before sniffing it and now I&#x27;m stuck smelling like a Winchell&#x27;s donuts shop until tomorrow.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a somewhat more &amp;#34;light hearted&amp;#34; type of scent, I&#x27;d say this is the type of stuff for it. Great scene, obviously with a bit of coconut in it. But, overall, great stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have a chance to say something about this product, to my surprise.  I first purchased this at Walmart so that I could actually smell the deodorant.  I chose it and another brand that I thought would work well with my cologne.  After a couple months, I found myself going to the Old Spice as my first choice.  Why? It not only matched my cologne well, it lasted and lasted and lasted all through the day, without any hint of my usual sweat smell.  I don&#x27;t know what they have done to make that happen, but I am so pleased, that I thought I&#x27;d pass that along.  Years ago I stopped using the Anti-persperation stuff because of the Aluminum and other metals they use to plug up the sweat glands.  It stopped the sweat, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with the toxic metal loading in the brain, and the migraines.  The first simple deodorants lasted about half a day, so I would apply more mid day, but that was not good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Now however, it is very effective, ALL DAY and even till the next morning.  I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but you should know they have done it.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to the oh old spice. It has a fruity smell to it which isn&#x27;t commonly found in men&#x27;s deodorant. Try its not for everybody but it is my favorite deorandent I&#x27;ve ever worn</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favourite old spice</li>
    <li> The smell is GREAT! BUT you sweat, your shirt gets discoloration and your skin gets sticky. Only go with &amp;#34;Old Spice Deodorant Soft Solid&amp;#34; the only one that lasts the longest</li>
    <li> I know these Old Spice deodorants are marketed to guys but I think all girls need to take a whiff of this one.  It smells kind of tropical, a bit of coconut.  Some guys may not like it smelling so sweet but I think that&#x27;s a damn shame.  I love sweet smells.  If I smelled a guy who was wearing this my nose would be glued to him.  Grab the shovel to pry my face off.&lt;br /&gt;It rocks.&lt;br /&gt;The end.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this deodorant! I use it and I&#x27;m a female. Definitely the most feminine fragrance out of all the Old Spice deodorants, but I could see how it could be a unisex type smell. Just an FYI if you&#x27;re buying this blindly on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Stopped being carried in the local store so I had to stock up. Best smell ever and in a gel so no white stuff</li>
    <li> Nor did I find myself with any new &#x27;horse riding&#x27; abilities. Regardless, I&#x27;m fairly relieved to still be Caucasian, as Caucasian is clearly the best race to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; + Smells great. [Smells to me like Beeswax, light fruit, and cedar.]&lt;br /&gt; + Lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - Made me vaguely racist on first application.</li>
    <li> It works great, the smell is pretty nice, I would describe it as minty/talcish smell.  It last all day.  Would be glad to recommend.</li>
    <li> It smells nice.  Strong odor but pleasant.</li>
    <li> If you experience any slight burning sensation, stop using this product. For myself I experienced this since using this product and variants of it for the past two years. Then finally this morning I the skin of my armpits broke out in a horrible rash on my way to school and had to turn around with both arms raised the entire way back. After a little research online, it turns out that this is a known issue with the current formula with the product and have to admit I am very thankful that what I experienced was mild in comparison to others. It&#x27;s unfortunate as I do enjoy this product, but it is not worth losing skin over.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to. So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn. The other island scents are merely average. My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties. I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are suckers for Irish Spring and Old Spice. Although I am a female, I love the male oriented deodorants and out of the many Old Spice smells we have used this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> The smell is not the same as the fantastic Hawkridge body wash.  The deodorant smells OK, but it is difficult to identify the fragrances.  I will not buy this again.  The whole Old Spice Wild collection deodorants are to be avoided.</li>
    <li> Old Spice Wild Collection Hawkridge deodorant sounded kind of awesome. OK, truthfully, the commercial involving some hawks screaming into a dude&#x27;s junk were probably the driving force behind the idea this stuff would be good. The power of marketing is strong at Old Spice, and yet, this is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawkridge smells not so much like a manly mountain man with a pet hawk, as much as it smells like a cross between Downy fabric sheets and your grandma&#x27;s bathroom. Every time I apply this to my armpits, I start thinking about sweaters and if I&#x27;ve put enough shell-shaped decorative soaps next to the sink. \\&quot;What if Edna comes by? Did I put the towels with embroidered ducks on the -- WHAT AM I DOING??\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go into a laundromat, buy a box of those cheap sheets from the vending machine next to that sleeping guy, and rub them all over your body while reading a quilting magazine. Same experience -- marginally cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, so don&#x27;t anyone else order it! The coconut smell is awesome and I have received complements on my new &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; which I am then embarrassed to say is just my deodorant. I don&#x27;t use anti-perspirents. I&#x27;ve tried a few other of the new Old Spice collection scents and, while they are all really good, this is my favorite. So don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely a fave, fantastic, wish we had it here in Australia</li>
    <li> these keep my pits from smelling exactly like my butt.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t last 24hrs bad scent😠😵😡</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOATHE the smell of this deodorant. It has this sick, sweet smell that lingers on everything. I pick up a blanket, or a pillow, or a t-shirt and it doesn&#x27;t smell like my boyfriend, it smells like this. And this is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> Warning, if you don&#x27;t want a clingy girlfriend, move along. Admittedly, my boyfriend is already quite the attractive man, but when he wears this scent it&#x27;s impossible to keep my hands off of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawkridge is warm, sort of like a spicy coconut, and it doesn&#x27;t fail to deliver. The rumors are true, this deodorant might just convince the ladies you have wings.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this deodorant AND it has more antiperspirant than other sticks (18%)  so it keeps me smelling real nice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t keep my wife off me, must buy!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores but my favorite deodorant. Wife approved an people always tell me I smell good and like coconuts!</li>
    <li> Has a nice scent, like vanilla mixed with a musky outdoor mountain smell. Sounds peculiar but it is a really nice light one. Not too overpowering. Has more antipersperant (18%) than many other brands. I really reccomend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the usual story:  My previous stick had run out and I wanted to try something new.  Advertising works, and brilliant advertising works brilliantly - I bought a stick of Hawkridge deodorant, because evidently it gives you power over hawks and high rolling card sharks.  I was expecting something that smelled like autumn pine forests, leather, and fist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not expect - what I got - was the unmistakable scent of coconut.  Not willing to give up so easily, I slathered on the usual amount:  Just enough to smell like a Jimmy Buffet hangover.  I ventured outside, waiting for a flight of hawks to descend majestically onto my arms.  This did not happen.  I saw a pigeon, but no matter how long I chased it around, it didn&#x27;t seem very interested in becoming my cool animal friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this was never REALLY about birds.  It&#x27;s about *birds*.  By which I mean ladies.  I walked into the local pub and struck my best Errol Flynn pose.  The bartender winked at me.  With both eyes.  At the same time.  Now that I think about it though, she might have just been blinking.  I had been standing there with my hands on my hips and my chin held slightly too high for at least 5 minutes, waiting for a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this product doesn&#x27;t really give you dominion over man, or beast - and it smells like a piña colada.  You&#x27;re going to have to supply your own hawks, and the local casino is totally uptight when it comes to trying to bring a trained bird of prey into their establishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terrible, but nor is it very masculine.  It&#x27;s a bit like wearing a pink muscle shirt:  You&#x27;ll have to supply your own mojo in order to overcome the questions this scent might raise.</li>
    <li> After I figured out that less is best, I really like this scent over all the other ones I have from Old Spice. It is refreshing, and if you have a long day, this one does not have a horrible after odor like Swagger or After Hours. This is my primary deodorant.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make me smell like a hawk, nor has this increased my ability to fly, but I can say my appetite for small game animals has increased almost ten fold and my ability to screech is now unparalleled among my office co-workers.</li>
    <li> Girls go crazy over this scent</li>
    <li> My husband loves this.</li>
