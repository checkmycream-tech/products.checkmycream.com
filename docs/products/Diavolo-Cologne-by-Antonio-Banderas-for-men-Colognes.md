    <li> Lively fragrents reely smalls niece.</li>
    <li> este perfume no huele a nada! al momento de ponertelo viene un olor bonito, pero el olor desaparece en un minuto o menos,&lt;br /&gt;no vale la pena comprarlo, hay otros perfumes de Antonio Banderas que huelen bonito</li>
    <li> Best buy ... thoroughly recommended ... Excellent product. Delivers what it promises</li>
    <li> i buyed the last version of Antonio Banderas eau de toilette but this version is not the same...shipping is fast and excellent price</li>
    <li> Cheap, Farenheit wanna be. Wife hated it so I will probably wont use it again LOL. I like it though.. :(</li>

    <li> I have used and really liked a few of Banderas aftershave sprays, but it seems that those are no longer in production.  Thought I would try another based on a WRITTEN description.  For me that did NOT work.  Weak fragrance, and not one that the wife likes on me either.  Went back and ordered hid Spirit spray, and this time it smells like it originally did - the last time I ordered some it arrived virtually without fragrance (I assumed it was so old that potency was just lost).  I hope what ever is the next scent maintains longer availability and works for me.</li>
    <li> The perfume has a excellent smelling. Its a light and soft smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell has a great time duration in the body.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Perfume.</li>
    <li> Smell its nice and fresh... I bought it like a gift to my father, unfortunately he hated it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like the perfume, I think is the kind of fragrance that you could smell after taking a shower...</li>
    <li> el produco  a pesar de tener el nombre de un artista renombrado no es de muy buena calidades de un aroma para se&amp;ntilde;ores mayores</li>
    <li> great perfume, great box, and also is Antonio Banderas so what do you expect? jajaja.Have a great smell and the girls love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne before, so I knew how it smelled. I personally don&#x27;t recommend buying cologne online unless you&#x27;ve tried it before. That being said, I&#x27;m a big fan of this particular scent (quite long lasting, too.) A great deal for how much you get.</li>
    <li> Long silage, If you are a fan of Fahrenheit by Dior, then you will enjoy this. Powerful night scent.</li>
    <li> me encanta. Es hermoso, suena, la entrega se hizo muy rapido y en excelentes condiciones. Muchas gracias por el servicio</li>
    <li> primera vez que cmpro una colonia por esta via y relamente no me equivoque es un producto de buena calidad, la fragancia dura bastante</li>
    <li> This perfum  has almost no odor por smell is not fixed..it&#x27;s unfortunately a disappoitment</li>
