      <li>Boar hair brushes take a bit longer to break in (12-24 lathers), but they preform beautifully.</li>
      <li>Great deal.</li>
      <li>This brush works GREAT for me.  </li>
      <li>Does a great job at lathering up</li>
      <li>Great brush.</li>
      <li>I can get a really great lather with soap, and this brush feels great on my face.</li>
      <li>*great</li>
      <li>This brush creates and holds a great lather.  </li>
      <li>It builds an impressive lather very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easily one of the best starter brushes and just all around good brush</li>
      <li>However, this brush is surprising good for the price... about nine fifty.</li>
      <li>It lathers well and is a good price.</li>
      <li>It is a good brush.</li>
      <li>now that ive got some good split ends and flyaways</li>
      <li>Had difficulty creating a good lather with my cheapie boar brush.</li>
      <li>After all the good reviews in regard of the Omega I decide to give it a try.</li>
      <li>&quot; is really working in nicely, the bristles are splitting and softening wonderfully, and it&#x27;s really great at creating a lather.</li>
      <li>Good value and nice brush</li>
      <li>I own a number of brushes, among them good badger hair as well ...</li>
      <li>Takes on water easily, lathers well and brushes on great.</li>
      <li>Boars hair doesn&#x27;t compare with badger in the beginning, but the badger brush is as good as it will ever be, while the boar has more upside.  </li>
      <li>Nice brush.  </li>
      <li>I have two of these brushes and they are wonderful, I purchased one when I was into shaving with a Straight Razor and</li>
      <li>It is stiffer than my badger brushes but very easy on the skin compared to lower quality boar brushes.</li>
      <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of the Omega brushes so far.   </li>
      <li>Good luck finding a stand for it because it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as soft as a \\&quot;best badger</li>
      <li>Feels very comfortably.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still going strong and still has nice backbone, and spring.</li>
      <li>Created a nice lather that applied easily.  </li>
      <li>BUT I love it anyway</li>
      <li>What I love about this brush, that could make me a boar bristle convert ...</li>
      <li>this brush just gets better and better with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>This is a safe bet if you&#x27;re looking to try boar bristle lathering.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it</li>
      <li>What more could you want?</li>
      <li>and it just keeps getting better.  </li>
      <li>I fee like I get a better shave.</li>
      <li>And I can&#x27;t explain why, but using a shaving brush is just much, much better than using my fingers to work in the shaving soap.</li>
      <li>so the softer I can get it before shaving the better.</li>
      <li>I know it is nitpicking but display the item accurately for your clients or they will look for honest vendors.</li>
      <li>Strong, well-constructed, and puts up a good lather even on the first couple of uses.</li>
      <li>It feels better than my cheap badger brush.</li>
      <li>the soft tips feel great against your face.    </li>
      <li>Great brush, it broke in fast, was at a VERY reasonable price(the thing is dirt cheap!), and I use this brush over my $50 silvertip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a face lather guy, and this brush is super easy to load!</li>
      <li>This brush is huge compared to the other 3 boar brushes i have and works the best.</li>
      <li>But other than that, it is definitely a good brush that feels good in your hand and gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Finely built tool, albeit the sticker came off after 3-4 uses.</li>
      <li>Great with artisan soaps and traditional soaps easy to load and to lather.</li>
      <li>The handle is huge to the point of fatiguing my hand</li>
      <li>in that regard the picture was accurate.</li>
      <li>Liked it so much, bought a 48, too.</li>
      <li>but I enjoy the brush.</li>
      <li>Avoid the cheap $12 badger brushes here on Amazon, get something that doesn&#x27;t lose hairs and lathers up soap like a champ.</li>
      <li>I wanted to experience a really good boar bristle brush ... and with regard to the head this brush makes the grade as far as I&#x27;m concerned (the handle is still cheap plastic, but attractive nonetheless - I have the red handle version).   </li>
      <li>I had a cheap badger brush that I put up with for a while.</li>
      <li>I carried out a fair bit of research on what was the &#x27;right&#x27; shaving brush, and was certainly leaning towards a badger hair brush.</li>
      <li>Now if they&#x27;d only put a great handle on a boar bristle brush they&#x27;ll get a full five star review from me ...</li>
      <li>i waited awhile to review this, because i knew that a boar brush would take some use to break in and get an accurate picture of its true capabilities.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really significant.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t love was that it really smelled \\&quot;piggy\\&quot; and also the plastic chrome handle felt really cheap in my hand.</li>
      <li>This is a nice brush for the price, but I think I like a shorter, more dome-shaped badger one a little better.</li>
      <li>Great brush for a beginning wet shaver.  </li>
      <li>Once broken in, this brush has a perfect mixture of backbone for lathering shave soaps and is dense enough to also be great at bowl lathering shaving cremes or soap in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Face lathering really helps with softening my beard, and I&#x27;m finding that a boar bristle brush does a better job than my badger hair.  </li>
      <li>You can pay a whole lot more for a shaving brush, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would.</li>
      <li>But based on cost, and also few good reviews here, I took the plunge and I&#x27;m pleased I did.     </li>
      <li>you are new to wet shaving or more accustomed to badger, make sure to give your boar brush a good 10 minute soak in hot water before using it.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll continue to use different brushes as the mood strikes me on any particular day, but I&#x27;m becoming a boar bristle guy more and more ...</li>
      <li>I never thought I would enjoy a boar brush as much as I do.  </li>
      <li>It took a few weeks to fully break in, but feels great and is 100% useable on day one.  </li>
      <li>If I could only own one brush this would be it.</li>
      <li>So decide for yourself if it is worth it.</li>
      <li>I think, for the cost, it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>Lost a couple hairs on the first use, but not bad for the price.  </li>
      <li>this particular brush is nice and big, has a good backbone, lathers well (after 6 or 8 uses to break it in) and is sturdy and easy to clean (wash with a little shampoo every so often to break up soap residue).  </li>
      <li>It is very large</li>
      <li>Other cheaper tempting brushes can be stressful for new shavers but this is a great starter brush</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who is just beginning to use brushes or for someone who is looking for a budget friendly replacement.</li>
      <li>Got mine in red and looks great on the countertop next to a stick of Arko.  </li>
      <li>Like it much softer than the Semogue 830 and broke very nice with a few uses.</li>
      <li>I guess it will last me a couple more years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard issues where cheaper brushes drop a lot of the bristles, and again, not my experience, it dropped maybe 10 bristles the first time I used it, which I would expect.</li>
      <li>Takes a few minutes to whip up a good lather, but boy does this brush make a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>While I haven&#x27;t used this brush as much as the other Omega I mentioned above it&#x27;s already beginning to show splitting of the bristles (really important for a boar bristle brush, the more the ends of the bristles split the better the brush becomes to use).   </li>
      <li>They are totally luxurious to use ... soft, elegant and hold a tremendous amount of moisture and lather.</li>
      <li>To me, they&#x27;re a bit too long, so it works more like a paint brush than a shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much out of the box.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a big brush. It lathers well and is a good price. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Lost a couple hairs on the first use, but not bad for the price.  Created a nice lather that applied easily.  I would say there was a light scent to the brush, but only noticeable when I held it up to my nose and sniffed it before first use.</li>
    <li> After break in this has been a great shaving brush! The bristles keep getting softer, but still have enough backbone to really work the lather into your beard. You can pay a whole lot more for a shaving brush, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would.</li>
    <li> I carried out a fair bit of research on what was the &#x27;right&#x27; shaving brush, and was certainly leaning towards a badger hair brush. But based on cost, and also few good reviews here, I took the plunge and I&#x27;m pleased I did.     I&#x27;ve heard issues that boar/pig bristle is too stiff and needs breaking in, but I&#x27;ve not found this to be the case.     I&#x27;ve heard issues where cheaper brushes drop a lot of the bristles, and again, not my experience, it dropped maybe 10 bristles the first time I used it, which I would expect. Since then, no problems.     And it doesn&#x27;t smell, at least if it does, the smell of my shaving soap masks it effectively.     And I can&#x27;t explain why, but using a shaving brush is just much, much better than using my fingers to work in the shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Finely built tool, albeit the sticker came off after 3-4 uses. By far the biggest brush in my arsenal (had to buy a little taller stand, as I was worried it&#x27;d be hitting the counter). Not quite a boar guy just yet....still learning. But this brush is everything it is listed as, and as the reviews say, I&#x27;m the weak one in this partnership. Give me a little time, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll either change to 5 &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34;, or will have sold it, as I will stick with the badger brushes I know (from pure to silvertip), and the obligatory synthetic Plisson.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I had purchased another Omega boar bristle shaving brush, \\&quot;Omega Shaving Brush #10048 Boar Bristle aka The PRO 48\\&quot; here on Amazon as well. I bought it because it looked like it had a really full knot and long bristles - in that regard the picture was accurate. What I didn&#x27;t love was that it really smelled \\&quot;piggy\\&quot; and also the plastic chrome handle felt really cheap in my hand. BUT I love it anyway (really I do) ...  I own a number of brushes, among them good badger hair as well ... real stuff, 100% Silver Tip Badger Hair. They are totally luxurious to use ... soft, elegant and hold a tremendous amount of moisture and lather. That&#x27;s always the basis for the comparison with badger hair to boar bristle brushes, i.e.: boar bristle brushes are NOT as soft and DON&#x27;T hold as much moisture or lather.  This brush is NOT A BADGER HAIR BRUSH ... but that doesn&#x27;t matter one bit to me. I didn&#x27;t buy it to simulate or compete with a badger hair brush. I wanted to experience a really good boar bristle brush ... and with regard to the head this brush makes the grade as far as I&#x27;m concerned (the handle is still cheap plastic, but attractive nonetheless - I have the red handle version).   PROS: Really long bristles, nice tight and full knot, really soft for a boar bristle brush, little to no smell, no shedding (so far after a few uses)  CONS: Nothing really significant. I don&#x27;t love the plastic handle, but it&#x27;s a $13.95 brush, not a $139.50 brush, other than that nothing I can think of for a boar bristle brush.  What I love about this brush, that could make me a boar bristle convert ... REALLY AND TRULY ... is that it&#x27;s remarkably soft and full. It&#x27;s as soft as a \\&quot;best badger hair\\&quot; brush IMO ... and that&#x27;s pretty much out of the box. While I haven&#x27;t used this brush as much as the other Omega I mentioned above it&#x27;s already beginning to show splitting of the bristles (really important for a boar bristle brush, the more the ends of the bristles split the better the brush becomes to use).   The Omega \\&quot;Pro 48\\&quot; is really working in nicely, the bristles are splitting and softening wonderfully, and it&#x27;s really great at creating a lather. This brush is already breaking in well, and it began softer than the \\&quot;Pro 48\\&quot; and I&#x27;m guessing it will continue to improve as I use it. However it&#x27;s all about the lathering for me. This brush creates and holds a great lather.  I do a combination of working up a preliminary lather in a bowl and then finish working up the lather on my face. This allows me to really \\&quot;tune\\&quot; the lather to my liking as I paint it on and work it into my beard. If it&#x27;s a little wet I&#x27;ll work it a little longer, if it&#x27;s a little dry I&#x27;ll wet the head of the brush and work some water into the lather on my face. Either way I get to work the lather into my beard well, and that works well for me. I have a rather coarse beard that grows in multiple directions so the softer I can get it before shaving the better. Face lathering really helps with softening my beard, and I&#x27;m finding that a boar bristle brush does a better job than my badger hair.  So I&#x27;ll continue to use different brushes as the mood strikes me on any particular day, but I&#x27;m becoming a boar bristle guy more and more ... and I have to say I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of the Omega brushes so far.   Now if they&#x27;d only put a great handle on a boar bristle brush they&#x27;ll get a full five star review from me ...</li>
    <li> Had difficulty creating a good lather with my cheapie boar brush. The Omega 49 creates heaps of lather in a very short time. Liked it so much, bought a 48, too.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Takes on water easily, lathers well and brushes on great.</li>
    <li> This brush is huge compared to the other 3 boar brushes i have and works the best. I use it for hard soaps and it lathers better than any other boar brush I have used. It is stiffer than my badger brushes but very easy on the skin compared to lower quality boar brushes. I will use this over my BBB for hard soaps every time. Highly recommend. If I could only own one brush this would be it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got 2 other brushes, a boar and a badger. They&#x27;re smaller. I really like this one, and I&#x27;ve found that where it really shines is with soaps. Normally I use cream and don&#x27;t do so well with shave soap, but this brush changed all that. I can get a really great lather with soap, and this brush feels great on my face. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this brush.  There&#x27;s a lot to like out the just $13 this thing cost me.  I MAY get an upscale Semogue Owner&#x27;s Club boar brush *some* day if I go gaga over boar bristles, but it won&#x27;t be for a while, if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+  Affordable&lt;br /&gt;+  Colors!&lt;br /&gt;+  Price-to-performance ratio makes it a *great value*&lt;br /&gt;+  Knot is enormous&lt;br /&gt;+  Knot is dense&lt;br /&gt;+  Very little shedding&lt;br /&gt;+  Very long bristles&lt;br /&gt;+  Performs well on hard and soft soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-  Does not come de-funked (smells of sanitizing chemicals)&lt;br /&gt;-  Takes a longer time than normal to de-funk (about 10 lathers)&lt;br /&gt;-  The handle is huge to the point of fatiguing my hand&lt;br /&gt;-  The handle is difficult to fit in most stands&lt;br /&gt;-  It&#x27;s hard-bristled (but not scratchy, mind you)&lt;br /&gt;-  Swallows up creams when used in hard water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I&#x27;d rate this a buy/recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this over a year after purchase and it just keeps getting better.  Boars hair doesn&#x27;t compare with badger in the beginning, but the badger brush is as good as it will ever be, while the boar has more upside.  Mine just keeps getting better, and hasn&#x27;t broken or rotted despite heavy use.</li>
    <li> I think shaving is a lot mowing grass... it takes too much time, the cost of the items to do the job cost too much and it will just grow back again. That said, I don&#x27;t like to spend too much on the items I need to wet shave and am prepared to accept less than a baby&#x27;s behind on closeness. Now that I&#x27;m retired getting a modest shave every other day is satisfactory. However, this brush is surprising good for the price... about nine fifty. It&#x27;s pretty stiff and does lather up nicely with the Proraso I use [[ASIN:B001JHEY14 Proraso Shave Soap, Sensitive, 150ml/5.2 oz (147 g) Jar]]. This brush is replacing the one I received in the Van Der Hagen set [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] purchased in November 2011 because the bristles are falling out. It&#x27;s a big brush... both in handle diameter and overall length... it&#x27;s about 1-1/2\\&quot; x 5\\&quot;. I think, for the cost, it&#x27;s worth 5-stars and I&#x27;m pleased with it and it&#x27;s a much better quality than a cheapskate like me expected.</li>
    <li> Great once you get it broken in. The hairs are a little rough at the beginning  but they seem to loosen up over time and keep the strength in the brush. It is very large but I enjoy the brush.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would enjoy a boar brush as much as I do.  I always thought badger was the be all, end all.  The fine gents on Badger &amp; Blade turned me onto boar brushes, especially for soaps, and this brush gets used at least 50% of the time.  It took a few weeks to fully break in, but feels great and is 100% useable on day one.  It&#x27;s a big brush, so be mindful of that, but so very pleasant to use.  Got mine in red and looks great on the countertop next to a stick of Arko.  One thing that had me concerned was that it seemed to lose a few bristles in the beginning, but things have settled down and the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to shed anymore.  I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve probably lost about 20-25 bristles since I&#x27;ve started using it.  Nothing to be too concerned about I guess.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong at this price, really.  Heck, I should buy another as a backup.</li>
    <li> Easily one of the best starter brushes and just all around good brush i find myself reaching for it quite often. F</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are longer, relative to the handle than they appear in the picture.  To me, they&#x27;re a bit too long, so it works more like a paint brush than a shaving brush.  It does hold water and lather pretty well and has only lost a couple of bristles.  This is a nice brush for the price, but I think I like a shorter, more dome-shaped badger one a little better. I&#x27;m switching back and forth, so we&#x27;ll see if that changes over time.</li>
    <li> In general, you get what you pay for.  The Omega Pro 49 is an exception to this rule.  Once broken in, this brush has a perfect mixture of backbone for lathering shave soaps and is dense enough to also be great at bowl lathering shaving cremes or soap in a bowl. Like to face lather?  the soft tips feel great against your face.    If you don&#x27;t know what I mean by \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;, it&#x27;s the state of boar brushes when the tips of the boar hairs split into 2-3 tips, the classic split ends, but in this instance, split ends are desirable.</li>
    <li> i waited awhile to review this, because i knew that a boar brush would take some use to break in and get an accurate picture of its true capabilities.  now that ive got some good split ends and flyaways this brush just gets better and better with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you are new to wet shaving or more accustomed to badger, make sure to give your boar brush a good 10 minute soak in hot water before using it.  it needs a little extra prep to soften up.  this particular brush is nice and big, has a good backbone, lathers well (after 6 or 8 uses to break it in) and is sturdy and easy to clean (wash with a little shampoo every so often to break up soap residue).  not that i&#x27;m an expert, but you will have a hard time finding another brush that works as well for the money.</li>
    <li> Great brush, it broke in fast, was at a VERY reasonable price(the thing is dirt cheap!), and I use this brush over my $50 silvertip.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I fee like I get a better shave.</li>
    <li> This is the brush I use with my everyday shave. I works just like it is suppose to and is gentle on my face. Recomended buy nick shaves on YouTube [...]</li>
    <li> I have two of these brushes and they are wonderful, I purchased one when I was into shaving with a Straight Razor and the more expensive German made Badger Hair brush wasn&#x27;t doing the job because it was to soft and would not lift the whiskers up when applying shave cream, This Omega Boars Hair brush on the other hand is just stiff enough where it works the soap under the hairs and causes them to soften and stand up, I keep one in the bathroom and the other in my travel kit.</li>
    <li> best brush I ever had. It is large. Feels very comfortably.</li>
    <li> Good value and nice brush</li>
    <li> Like it much softer than the Semogue 830 and broke very nice with a few uses.</li>
    <li> Needs to get a little broken in but it can hold a lot of soap and it gets very easy to make a decent lather</li>
    <li> I bought this on Amazon last year I think, and it is still going strong today. The initial shedding wasn&#x27;t too bad and to this day, it only drops a hair every once in a while. The smell is off-putting (it&#x27;s boar hair, what do you expect?) but fades with time. It&#x27;s still going strong and still has nice backbone, and spring. This is a safe bet if you&#x27;re looking to try boar bristle lathering.</li>
    <li> This is a larger sized brush. It fits well in the hand. It is stiff enough to make a wonderful lather but not so stiff it irritates the face. My guy loves this product more than his other shaving brushes. We don&#x27;t have a problem with shedding bristles or funky smells. Excellent shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush for a beginning wet shaver.  Be warned though it is real boar hair and may smell a little once you get it wet.</li>
    <li> I gave this brush to my 80 year old Father. He said it was the best brush he&#x27;d had since he started shaving!</li>
    <li> Strong, well-constructed, and puts up a good lather even on the first couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Great with artisan soaps and traditional soaps easy to load and to lather. Stiff but nor irritating. Great deal. $40 brush for $10. A beginner can put their faith In this brush as well as a seasoned wet shaver. Other cheaper tempting brushes can be stressful for new shavers but this is a great starter brush and I plan to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a high quality brush. I highly recommend it for anyone who is just beginning to use brushes or for someone who is looking for a budget friendly replacement.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush! I had a cheap badger brush that I put up with for a while. This one puts that thing to shame! I&#x27;m a face lather guy, and this brush is super easy to load! It builds an impressive lather very quickly. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, how about the smell? Well, when it was new, it smelled like the hairs came from an animal! Ain&#x27;t that crazy? Oh wait, it&#x27;s called BOAR HAIR!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good brush. But it sheds hair every day. Every time I shave there are 3-4 hair I have to pick from my face. I have had the brush for less than a year. I guess it will last me a couple more years and then I will have to buy a new one. Previous brush lasted me 10 years. So decide for yourself if it is worth it. But other than that, it is definitely a good brush that feels good in your hand and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have several brushes of different types and like to display the original packaging with the brush when it is not in my rotation. When I recieved this one it was in a plastic ziplock bag. Lord knows where this one was kept or what it was exposed to. I know it is nitpicking but display the item accurately for your clients or they will look for honest vendors.</li>
    <li> This brush works GREAT for me.  Have had NO problems whatsoever with this brush.  If you are shaving this way I would definitely recommend this brush.  Dont think you need to spend on the expensive brushes.  Use a good soap though!</li>
    <li> This is my first Boar bristle shaving brush and I&#x27;m sorry I waited this long to try one out.  I did not experience any &amp;#34;animal smell&amp;#34; with this brush nor did I find the bristles to stiff on my face.  I prefer the stiffer bristles as it is easier to whip up the soap in my mug. The bristles hold the soap well and brushing it on to my face was not a problem nor was it uncomfortable.  After shaving with it for 3 days I only lost one bristle. This is a well-made brush which I found recommended on a Youtube video.  I now prefer this brush to my Badger brush and will use this going forward.  Try it ... you&#x27;ll like it Mikey!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Boar hair brushes take a bit longer to break in (12-24 lathers), but they preform beautifully. I highly recommend this product to someone looking to get into wetshaving. Avoid the cheap $12 badger brushes here on Amazon, get something that doesn&#x27;t lose hairs and lathers up soap like a champ.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at lathering up</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot.  Good luck finding a stand for it because it&#x27;s huge.  It is both stiff and soft at the same time and I understand that it will get even softer as the tips start to split.  It feels better than my cheap badger brush. Takes a few minutes to whip up a good lather, but boy does this brush make a lot of it.  The lather is rich, super creamy, and the brush holds enough for 3-4 passes with only an almond sized dab of shaving cream.  Price was very good too.  If you&#x27;re a badger brush user, give this boar brush a chance.  It might surprise you.</li>
    <li> As a owner of three high end brushes I was looking to add an board hair to my collection. After all the good reviews in regard of the Omega I decide to give it a try. I can&#x27;t understand why such a cheap brush out perform a lot of expensive versions I had tried before. Very good brush for the price!!</li>
    <li> Not for me. Just comparing it to my badger hair brush. Stunk pretty bad too!</li>
