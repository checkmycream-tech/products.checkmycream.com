      <li>I love nautica cologns etc for men.</li>
      <li>It shipped very quickly and arrived in retail packaging.</li>
      <li>but it did smell like the cheap stuff too.</li>
      <li>When he puts it on, he smells good -- manly, but not over-the-top-I-just-cut-down-a-fir-tree masculine.</li>
      <li>If you like fresh, crisp scents, you will love this cologne!</li>
      <li>I love how fresh and clean it smells.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean .</li>
      <li>Best most long lasting scent I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really clean, light, and fresh scent which comes out somewhat strong at first but fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Very crisp, clean, and lasts between 5-8 hours.</li>
      <li>&quot; Fresh and Clean.</li>
      <li>I like the ocean type scent of floral v fruity that mildly lingers but doesnt overwhelm.</li>
      <li>this cologne is good but its hard to find in the stores thankfully to amzon i was able to find it cheap</li>
      <li>It has a light crisp citrus scent to it, and I&#x27;ve always had compliments from the ladies while wearing it.  </li>
      <li>It did not smell exactly like the original</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my brother and he also liked the smell of the same.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh, not overpowering, lasts long, and is very cheap for what you get.</li>
      <li>The white sail sounded refreshing</li>
      <li>Smells identical to many colognes I have smelled before, D&amp;G Blue is one of them.</li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff smells, brings me back to simpler times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of most Nautica colognes, but White Sail is definitely exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>We have only found one cologne that smelled better on him</li>
      <li>It was very affordable and arrived fast.</li>
      <li>But it is a light and last all day scent so cant complain.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive but dont be fooled Ive gone by price before... go by your nose</li>
      <li>This one is just what it sound like \\&quot;White Sail\\</li>
      <li>I found it on Amazon for 1/3 what it normally costs!</li>
      <li>Smells quite similar to Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s Light Blue scent.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend wore this when we first started dating forever ago and shortly after he ran out</li>
      <li>will add a disclaimer that I think a lot of fragrance deliciousness (or non deliciousness) comes from a person&#x27;s natural chemistry.</li>
      <li>and it delivered exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I went out shopping at a local retail store for some new fragrances and found this cologne with a scent-scratch sticker.</li>
      <li>Nautica has a long list of colognes and I have three so far.</li>

<li> As usual, can&#x27;t beat amazon&#x27;s price.</li>

<li> (an Yves Saint-Laurent ridiculously expensive scent), but this is a no-brainer for the price.</li>
<li> if you ask me, just don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.com because it will probably be a fake.</li>
<li> The projection is quite terrible.    </li>
<li> I can smell him all day long.its not one of those nasty over powering smells.i</li>

    <li> All in all a good perfume for the price. The delivery was timely and the packaging was also good. This was a gift for my brother and he also liked the smell of the same.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling fragrance!</li>
    <li> I went out shopping at a local retail store for some new fragrances and found this cologne with a scent-scratch sticker. Scratched the scent sticker and thought it smelt great. It&#x27;s got a nice hint of citrus, vanilla, woods, and tea. It&#x27;s a really clean, light, and fresh scent which comes out somewhat strong at first but fades quickly. The projection is quite terrible.    If you&#x27;re a big fan of this scent, I suggest buying a smaller bottle to carry around and spray yourself every 2-3 hours. Definitely recommended if you can find a 100ml/3.4 oz bottle for less than $20.</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing. It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. It came packaged nice, and I had no issues getting it here.</li>
    <li> Nautica has a long list of colognes and I have three so far. The white sail sounded refreshing so I went for it and it delivered exactly what I expected. I have all the top colognes and for the name the oz, and the price you can&#x27;t beat Nautica&#x27;s colognes . The smell is crisp, fresh, a summer time shorts and polo type of deal, it has an alcohol base it&#x27;s clean . It last&#x27;s the day; it delivers.</li>
    <li> I heard about this cologne from a friend who likes it. I used it the moment it arrived. I love how fresh and clean it smells. If you like fresh, crisp scents, you will love this cologne!</li>
    <li> I looked for this everywhere. I found it on Amazon for 1/3 what it normally costs! I&#x27;m one happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s fragrance of choice. We have only found one cologne that smelled better on him (an Yves Saint-Laurent ridiculously expensive scent), but this is a no-brainer for the price. When he puts it on, he smells good -- manly, but not over-the-top-I-just-cut-down-a-fir-tree masculine. It seems to be relatively long-lasting and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add a disclaimer that I think a lot of fragrance deliciousness (or non deliciousness) comes from a person&#x27;s natural chemistry. This happens to smell fantastic on my boyfriend, but my brother has tried wearing this and it wasn&#x27;t as great. I would recommend trying to get some samples (or a small size) before you commit.</li>
    <li> this cologne is good but its hard to find in the stores thankfully to amzon i was able to find it cheap</li>
    <li> I bought this for my man,I&#x27;ve never smelled this scent before &amp; omg its amazing! I can smell him all day long.its not one of those nasty over powering smells.i am always going to keep this on hand for him!!</li>
    <li> Best most long lasting scent I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wore this when we first started dating forever ago and shortly after he ran out and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! However I finally looked on amazon and lo and behold there it was, at an awesome price! It shipped very quickly and arrived in retail packaging. I love the way this stuff smells, brings me back to simpler times.</li>
    <li> Smells quite similar to Dolce &amp; Gabanna&#x27;s Light Blue scent. Very crisp, clean, and lasts between 5-8 hours. Great product if you ask me, just don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.com because it will probably be a fake.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a bottle of this before, but I remembered the price to be a little cheaper. When I got it, it turned out to be twice as big as the one I used to have, so that makes sense now. Smells fresh, not overpowering, lasts long, and is very cheap for what you get. As usual, can&#x27;t beat amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> This scent is just what you would expect from Nautica. My grandson has them all! This one is just what it sound like \\&quot;White Sail\\&quot; Fresh and Clean. My handsome grandson loves Nautica and this one is a great addition to his large collection. Each scent represents how you feel for that day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this cologne for awhile after purchasing a smaller sampler version.  It has a light crisp citrus scent to it, and I&#x27;ve always had compliments from the ladies while wearing it.  I&#x27;m a fan of most Nautica colognes, but White Sail is definitely exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Smells identical to many colognes I have smelled before, D&amp;G Blue is one of them. But it is a light and last all day scent so cant complain. I gave it to another friend who liked it. I&#x27;ll stick with my Voyage, Nautica.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok cologne for the price. It did not smell exactly like the original but it did smell like the cheap stuff too. so it is something in between.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for myself. It was very affordable and arrived fast. I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and a good price</li>
    <li> I love nautica cologns etc for men. They arnt overwhelmimg in scent nor price. I like the ocean type scent of floral v fruity that mildly lingers but doesnt overwhelm. Try nautica blue too. Very inexpensive but dont be fooled Ive gone by price before... go by your nose</li>
