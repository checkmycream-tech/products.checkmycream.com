### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product .  </li>
      <li>The best I could get from them was a 50% refund.</li>
      <li>I was happy to return the unused and unopened product if they supplied me with return postage, for which they would not.  </li>
      <li>Great</li>
      <li>luck (good genes).  </li>
      <li>Beware of these FREE TRIALS!!</li>
      <li>I ordered the cream with a 14 day free trial period and wanted to give this cream a try as I am always on the look at for a good product for my skin.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ll continue using it and hope for better results.  </li>
      <li>I love it .  </li>
      <li>When I called no one seemed to be able to locate the order.  </li>
      <li>If you sign up for a trial it is easy to miss</li>
      <li>I received the cream and gave it a try, seemed fine</li>
      <li>I fell for the scam about the free trial.</li>
      <li>Now this is the real kicker!!!  </li>
      <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you for the FREE TRIAL, is that if you don&#x27;t return the unused portion of the bottle in 14 days, they will charge you the full amount.</li>
      <li>The hydrella eye clean is another scam product.</li>
      <li>I contacted Good Housekeeping personally because I saw an ad on Facebook which routed me to their website affiliation using the Good Housekeeping logo, Dr. Oz and Ellen DeGeneres to &amp;#34;lure&amp;#34; you to buy both this product AND a 2nd one called Dermal Meds.  </li>
      <li>It goes on so easily and makes my skin so much softer.</li>
      <li>The creams are nothing special and the cost is phenomenal if you don&#x27;t read the small print, which I didn&#x27;t, as it was a free trial on Facebook.</li>
      <li>First of all, I did not sign up for nor did I see in any of the material on line or anything that was shipped with my &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>For all of you that is interested in this product, please do not get sucked in.  </li>
      <li>The bottle came half full seems like, and after 3 days of using it once a day, I had to take the top off to get the product out of the bottle because the pump would no longer work because it was pretty much out of creme.</li>
      <li>Apparently when you accept the free trial you are agreeing  to buying the product monthly at a charge of £89.72 PER MONTH.</li>
      <li>Biogeniste is perpetrating a classic fraud and scam!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping yo see more results after using it a little bit longer.</li>
      <li>Well, I ordered this just before New Year</li>
      <li>There is NO remedy for the physical effects of ageing, except three things &#x27;can&#x27; help:  1) good, professional and subtle cosmetic surgery, 2) staying out of the sun, 3)</li>
      <li>Sad when real people are actually looking for honest reviews from real people and all you see is stuff posted by companies.  </li>
      <li>Well, my credit card was charged nearly $100.00.</li>
      <li>They send you a trial and before you know it nearly ninety pounds as been taken from your credit card.</li>
      <li>The ads are a joke (you&#x27;ve got a photo of some middle-aged woman, and then the SAME EXACT PHOTO next to it, with the contrast pumped up to hide the wrinkles).  </li>
      <li>Good Housekeeping emailed me back saying this was an illegal use of their logo and they reported the website as they have NO AFFILIATION with either of these products.  </li>
      <li>These companies are in the USA and you have to call them directly and demand your money back.</li>
      <li>The last two are free, however the first one can be rather expensive.  </li>
      <li>I think it is very cheeky of a company to give its customers less than 4 days to try their product.  </li>

<li> I think it is very cheeky of a company to give its customers less than 4 days to try their product.  </li>
<li> So save up all this money you waste on these rip-off miracle creams and put it in a piggybank towards your facelift - and make sure you pay for a decent one from a pro and not some amateur who is going to make you look like you&#x27;ve just emerged from a wind tunnel.  </li>
<li> Then there are before-after photos of women who have clearly had facelifts, and then the FAKE photos of celebrities supposedly before using this product (which if you do a bit of google searching are photos that have been digitally enhanced to make them look 20 years older)...  </li>
<li> These people are a typical example of American Greed, they should be banned from commerce and put in jail.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s  not what I expected</li>
<li> The product arrived, it was a waste of time but 3 or 4 weeks later my account was debited by £89.72.</li>
<li> Total sham and as careful as I am with these things</li>
<li> Shame on BiioGeniste and a system that allows shady ripp-off artists like them  to fleece the American consumer!</li>
<li> The other reviewer is correct, they will charge your credit card $89.95 within a couple of weeks.  </li>
<li> So sorry I didn&#x27;t check here first.</li>
<li> The company misrepresents the trial period, tries to hard sell you when you try to cancel the product, and charges your credit card before you have had the opportunity to actually try the product.</li>
<li> The positive reviews are fake.  </li>
<li> But they are not worth any stars...</li>
<li> I was forced to cancel my VISA card to prevent further thievery by these crooks.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> TOTAL RIP-OFF.  </li>
<li> and it took the cream a little longer then usually to get it as it was Holiday time.  </li>
<li> I have to start by saying that I have delicate skin that does break out if I use anything harsh products.</li>
<li> Also, for the money, it is not better or worse than any over the counter wrinkle cream for $20!</li>
<li> Misleading, false and immoral marketing.  </li>
<li> All fake.  </li>
<li> I have never opened either of the products and am afraid to even use them, concerned that in addition to this being a fraud, that the product may damage my skin.  </li>
<li> dreadful product and a dreadful company to deal with</li>
<li> Absolutely disgusted  by this business company and how it works!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is not to be trusted. The before and after photo is so obviously doctored, they did not even bother to use a different photo to photoshop for the so-called after photo! Furthermore, I saw the same advert for two totally different products!</li>
    <li> The company misrepresents the trial period, tries to hard sell you when you try to cancel the product, and charges your credit card before you have had the opportunity to actually try the product. Before you know it, you owe $90 for a product you have used 3 times and do not want.</li>
    <li> Read the Terms &amp; Conditions before you give them your credit card, people!!!  Once you order the &amp;#34;free ($5) trial&amp;#34;, then you&#x27;re charged $90 2 weeks later, and then $90 a month indefinitely!!!  Total scam.</li>
    <li> Biogeniste is perpetrating a classic fraud and scam! They offer a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sample, get your credit card info and then charge you $89.76 plus $5.95 for an unwanted follow-up shipment as if you became a subscriber for their supposed &amp;#34;anti-wrinkle cream&amp;#34;. These people are a typical example of American Greed, they should be banned from commerce and put in jail. I was forced to cancel my VISA card to prevent further thievery by these crooks. Shame on BiioGeniste and a system that allows shady ripp-off artists like them  to fleece the American consumer!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I saw the ad with before and afters.  All fake.  I fell for it and bought it.  The positive reviews are fake.  Sad when real people are actually looking for honest reviews from real people and all you see is stuff posted by companies.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  not what I expected but I&#x27;ll continue using it and hope for better results.  I&#x27;m hoping yo see more results after using it a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product .  I love it .  It goes on so easily and makes my skin so much softer. Great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scam do not buy this product.  They send you a trial and before you know it nearly ninety pounds as been taken from your credit card. The product brought me out in a rash. The hydrella eye clean is another scam product. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CREAM</li>
    <li> If you sign up for a trial it is easy to miss that if you don&#x27;t cancel within 14 days, the trial bottle now becomes an $89.00 trial.  I like the product but not for $89.00 a month.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SCAM!!!  The other reviewer is correct, they will charge your credit card $89.95 within a couple of weeks.  I contacted Good Housekeeping personally because I saw an ad on Facebook which routed me to their website affiliation using the Good Housekeeping logo, Dr. Oz and Ellen DeGeneres to &amp;#34;lure&amp;#34; you to buy both this product AND a 2nd one called Dermal Meds.  The &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; is that using both products together is the answer to reducing wrinkles.  Good Housekeeping emailed me back saying this was an illegal use of their logo and they reported the website as they have NO AFFILIATION with either of these products.  When I called them after a fraud alert from my credit card company, they said that if I wanted to &amp;#34;cancel&amp;#34; I had to return any unused product.  First of all, I did not sign up for nor did I see in any of the material on line or anything that was shipped with my &amp;#34;free sample&amp;#34; anything about agreeing to future shipments and charges.  Additionally, after I paid the initial $4.95 S&amp;H, my phone immediately rang with a fraud alert from my credit card company.  I have never opened either of the products and am afraid to even use them, concerned that in addition to this being a fraud, that the product may damage my skin.  Because the rep told me that they would continue to attempt the charge on my card after 36 hrs., I had to cancel the card and get a replacement card.  I was happy to return the unused and unopened product if they supplied me with return postage, for which they would not.  Total sham and as careful as I am with these things, they fooled me, too.  Their URL on the website where you are directed via the Facebook ad, has the words &amp;#34;good housekeeping&amp;#34; in it so I thought it was legit.  It is NOT.  Again, buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Absolutely disgusted  by this business company and how it works!! I ordered the cream with a 14 day free trial period and wanted to give this cream a try as I am always on the look at for a good product for my skin.  I have to start by saying that I have delicate skin that does break out if I use anything harsh products. Well, I ordered this just before New Year and it took the cream a little longer then usually to get it as it was Holiday time.  I received the cream and gave it a try, seemed fine but after three days of use my skin got red, so I called Bio Geniste back and cancelled the monthly shipment.  No problem I thought. Well, my credit card was charged nearly $100.00. So I called as I had cancelled within the 14 day trial period.  To my surprise, I was told that I had called 15 days from the day the cream was shipped to me and that I now had to pay for the cream that I did not what.  I think it is very cheeky of a company to give its customers less than 4 days to try their product.  DO NOT Buy this Cream or any product from this company.</li>
    <li> This is a total scam do not even go there. The creams are nothing special and the cost is phenomenal if you don&#x27;t read the small print, which I didn&#x27;t, as it was a free trial on Facebook. So sorry I didn&#x27;t check here first.</li>
    <li> Can I give Zero stars? What they don&#x27;t tell you for the FREE TRIAL, is that if you don&#x27;t return the unused portion of the bottle in 14 days, they will charge you the full amount. Also, for the money, it is not better or worse than any over the counter wrinkle cream for $20!</li>
    <li> The only thing anyone needs to know about this product is that the morality of its marketing will tell you all you need to know about the product.  I have just been stung and caught to the value of almost €450 between Biogeniste and its sister product Hydravella. Misleading, false and immoral marketing.  It beggars believe that this is acceptable marketing. I do not believe it would be acceptable in the UK or Ireland or Europe but do not know. Liars.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I fell for the scam about the free trial. The product arrived, it was a waste of time but 3 or 4 weeks later my account was debited by £89.72. Apparently when you accept the free trial you are agreeing  to buying the product monthly at a charge of £89.72 PER MONTH. Also there is an offer of a reduced price eye serum offered at the same time, I accepted this also and the same thing happened, my account wad debited by £91.63 for this one and if I hadn&#x27;t noticed it that amount would have been taken EVERY MONTH. These companies are in the USA and you have to call them directly and demand your money back. The best I could get from them was a 50% refund. You can contact them on 001-88965-3999 and 0203-514-4789. The UK number puts you through to the USA. Beware of these FREE TRIALS!! They are a con.</li>
    <li> dreadful product and a dreadful company to deal with</li>
    <li> I purchased this item, and also got a 2nd item(wrinkle rewind).  I realized after I had placed the order that it was a mistake, so I called the company to cancel it before it even went out.  When I called no one seemed to be able to locate the order.  Well I got it!!!.  The bottle came half full seems like, and after 3 days of using it once a day, I had to take the top off to get the product out of the bottle because the pump would no longer work because it was pretty much out of creme. The 2nd item came in a separate order.  I called the company to cancel the order because #1.  I did not have enough time to experience any effects it would have if any at all.  #2.  I did not have enough in the bottle to last for the period allowed. I called to cancel the item and was giving several options . #1. cancel and be charged 39.95.  #2.  Send back any unused portion and you pay for all shipping.  Now this is the real kicker!!!  The 2nd item that I received, was also billed separate. Instead of this billed as one I had to pay a separate 39.95 to cancel this one as well.  For all of you that is interested in this product, please do not get sucked in.  These people are just out to get your money, and that&#x27;s IT!!!..  This is a SCAM!!!  If you have a credit card with them, my suggestions is that you cancel it!!! They can not be trusted.  It should be against the law to have a company operating this way!!!  I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because I have no choice but to select something.  But they are not worth any stars...</li>
    <li> Product did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> Cannot even BELIEVE people fall for this scam!  The ads are a joke (you&#x27;ve got a photo of some middle-aged woman, and then the SAME EXACT PHOTO next to it, with the contrast pumped up to hide the wrinkles).  Then there are before-after photos of women who have clearly had facelifts, and then the FAKE photos of celebrities supposedly before using this product (which if you do a bit of google searching are photos that have been digitally enhanced to make them look 20 years older)...  TOTAL RIP-OFF.  Can&#x27;t even believe this is sold on Amazon - next thing you know they&#x27;ll be selling counterfeit money.  Vanity+stupidity&#x3D;rip-off.  There is NO remedy for the physical effects of ageing, except three things &#x27;can&#x27; help:  1) good, professional and subtle cosmetic surgery, 2) staying out of the sun, 3) luck (good genes).  The last two are free, however the first one can be rather expensive.  So save up all this money you waste on these rip-off miracle creams and put it in a piggybank towards your facelift - and make sure you pay for a decent one from a pro and not some amateur who is going to make you look like you&#x27;ve just emerged from a wind tunnel.  What I have written here is ALL you need to ever know.</li>
    <li> 100% cheater！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！ DON&#x27;T BUY!!! And why the police don&#x27;t investigate them？？？？？？？？I never heard about the brand at all！ And never ever place a order. But they somehow get my credit card info and place a order for me deliberately! And charge me a lot money....</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product as the company that produce it will rip you off, I was scamed out of over £180 for a tiny amount of product in a pump bottle that doesn&#x27;t even work and a tub with the smallest amount of cream you can imagine... Would give this no stars if I could....</li>
