      <li>Truly cleans your face and leaves it super shiny.  </li>
      <li>I pretty much don&#x27;t have break outs anymore!!!</li>
      <li>Neostrata is great and it sounds like if one of the face washes works for you, you will see improvement in just a few days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Neostrata Cleanser for about 10 years and decided it might be worth it to try the Antibacterial version.</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist - works wonderfully on preventing acne without irritating skin.</li>

      <li>Just don&#x27;t read the ingredients &amp; enjoy your new pretty skin!</li>
      <li>GREAT product for oily skin; not at all for dry, sensitive, hormonal skin.</li>
      <li>I let it sit for a minute then rinse with another hot washcloth.</li>
      <li>Bath and Body Works just revamped their soaps to omit triclosan because of the potential health risks), some toothpastes, antibacterial plastics, deodorants, and more.</li>
      <li>Wipe your skin with the hot wash cloth as a pre-cleanse, then use this product.</li>
      <li>I would not consider trading it in for any other product (and I have tried many!) .</li>
      <li>but it cleans deep and has been clearing up my cystic acne better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have been using it consistently since then , and i could see a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
      <li>Sure, my skin cleared up otherwise, but it left the problem of treating face wash induced eczema.</li>
      <li>Thanks for selling on Amazon!</li>
      <li>I don t think it does anything more and am not sure it I&#x27;ll get it again If I can find something better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the regular stuff, how could this be any different?</li>
      <li>keeps my skin clean and not tight feeling.</li>
      <li>I wish I could say positive things about this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of NeoStrata and am very content with the way it cleared up my acne.</li>
      <li>and I can say it really did not help at all.</li>
      <li>It really gets in your skin.  </li>
      <li>I would high recommend it to anybody!</li>
      <li>and it really works</li>
      <li>If only it could be more natural</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give such a great,  much needed product, a negative review just because it did not work for me.</li>
      <li>It feels like a mild wash- actually like washing my face with baby bath-</li>
      <li>I use topical medication as well, but this stuff can maintain you when you&#x27;re in a jam and the topical gels I use are now more of an added bonus.</li>
      <li>It is better if you alternate it with another product such as an aprocot scrub.</li>
      <li>bought this because it has triclosan in it - the main ingredient in the product my dermatologist was charging me an arm and leg for.</li>
      <li>It may work for some people, but if you have moderate to mild acne, I would think twice before using it.</li>
      <li>I have rosecea which is why I purchased this anti-bacterial face wash with high hopes it wood kill the bacteria on my skin which contributes to my flare ups.  </li>
      <li>I have experienced oily skin, combination skin and everything above all my life and have feverishly tried different products to control all areas of my face plus avoid my adult acne I have from time to time.</li>
      <li>I was breaking out right after I get a facial.  </li>
      <li>Also can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>I usually use the normal PHA4 Neostrata facewash but after reading these reviews, I figured I should try something that would help my acne more.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately did not work for me, as my skin was already sensitive and it only dried it out more, created more oil, more bacteria, and prolonged my skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;hot-mess&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It is slightly drying so use a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been developing actual acne; something I luckily didn&#x27;t have to deal with as a teen.</li>
      <li>It is a clear gel that foams with water.</li>
      <li>and my skin is amazingly clear.</li>
      <li>and my skin will still clear up in 1-2 days.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the acids are a bit much if my face is sensitive, so I use Cetaphil on those days, but NeoStrata definitely gets the job done.</li>
      <li>will clear up body and face acne</li>
      <li>I have been using this facial cleanser for years and have very acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of NeoStrata and am very content with the way it cleared up my acne. I use twice a day, morning and night. Naturally, I still break out here and there but this product keeps them in check with its antibacterial properties. I&#x27;m going to order my second bottle now and hope that things continue to go well...so far this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for acne.&lt;br /&gt; If only it could be more natural so I don&#x27;t have to feel quite so guilty about using it. That&#x27;s why I rated 4/5-- So yeah...... Just don&#x27;t read the ingredients &amp; enjoy your new pretty skin!</li>
    <li> I have this product 3 stars to be fair.  I can&#x27;t give such a great,  much needed product, a negative review just because it did not work for me. I have rosecea which is why I purchased this anti-bacterial face wash with high hopes it wood kill the bacteria on my skin which contributes to my flare ups.  It immediately irritated my condition, within 2 hours of using.  As all of us with sensitive skin well know,  we have to find and use the products that OUR skin will tolerate.  This one might be the one for you.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has been great in helping me control my breakouts. I use it twice a day, morning and night, and it leaves my face clearer and softer than other acne cleansers I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great Cleanser.  Have been using this for about 2 months now per the recommendation of my dermatologist and have noticed a change for the better.  Sometimes the acids are a bit much if my face is sensitive, so I use Cetaphil on those days, but NeoStrata definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> keeps my skin clean and not tight feeling. Takes all makeup off even long wear and keeps my skin clear with its anti-bacterial properties</li>
    <li> will clear up body and face acne my dr recommended and it really works</li>
    <li> this cleanser was recommended to me by my esthetician about eight months ago. I have been using it consistently since then , and i could see a difference in my skin after the first use. I would not consider trading it in for any other product (and I have tried many!) . It is a clear gel that foams with water. The active ingredient is triclosan, which is an antibacterial that kills anything for me that caused pimples. I swear that when i use this product twice a day, EVERYDAY, I NEVER EVER break out!!!! its wonderful. only reason for four stars-its the only product in my cabinet containing PARABENS. thats all.</li>
    <li> Absolute waste of time and money. It does not help at all. Not even as a placebo effect. My acne did not see any improvement after finishing the entire bottle. It&#x27;s just not worth the price and money. I used this with tazorac actually and I can say it really did not help at all. So in the end neither tazorac nor NeoStrata help out.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I was able to get this product from you.  The price is excellent and for that I say thank you. I have been using this for some time and enjoy the way it makes my skin look and feel. I will be buying for some more very soon.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist suggested i try this product for my cystic acne. i had acne as a teenager, but it came back when i was 23. for the past year and a half i struggled trying to find a product that worked for me. initially i started seeing results within the first 2-3 weeks, ive been using this product for the past year now and i swear by it!! i also went back on birth control (ortho tricyclen) the combination has cleared my face completely. i use the antibacterial wash in the morning when i wake up and before bed. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all, my acne scars from my cystic acne are starting to fade immensely. i love my new skin thanks to neostrata!!!!</li>
    <li> Can only find this brand online.  good product and inexpensive the amount you get.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleanser! It&#x27;s hard to find a facial soap that contains triclosan anymore!</li>
    <li> Worked well for me. Just like others have mentioned. I have ordered one more. Undoubtedly one of the most effective items.</li>
    <li> One of the best anti-acne washes around. Even great for sensitive skin. Can use it once or twice a day.</li>
    <li> This Product is very very good tool to make your face cleaned and softed. Not left your face dried, but you must moisturized your skin after to used it. to make the perfect match Cleanser</li>
    <li> Good facial wash, works for all family, helps keep  skin in balance, good for daily usage. My  teenage kids like it too.</li>
    <li> I wish I could say positive things about this product. What started off as a recommendation by a aesthetician at the medspa at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for a few deep pimples I had developed, turned into a bit of a nightmare. I used the Neostrata antibacterial face wash about once or twice a week, tops, however over time I developed thick, eczematous patches around my mouth. What a nightmare! Sure, my skin cleared up otherwise, but it left the problem of treating face wash induced eczema. Not fun. Be careful using this product if you have skin that is already mildly dry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neostrata Cleanser for about 10 years and decided it might be worth it to try the Antibacterial version. Based on the description I figured it might be better-- and it&#x27;s a little cheaper. I&#x27;ve always loved the regular stuff, how could this be any different? Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the other reviews. I may be in the minority, but I also found this cleanser to be drying and not very effective. I use a Clarisonic in combo with my face wash-- never any problems with the regular cleanser. In fact it improved things, but with this cleanser it dried things out in 1-2 days (ok with me, I have oily skin), but then my breakouts started to increase and get worse.  At times I can normally use the regular Neostrata cleanser without the Clarisonic or anything else and my skin will still clear up in 1-2 days. I used this for 2-3 weeks and finally went back to the normal cleanser, which cleared it up in about a 1.5 weeks (that&#x27;s how bad the break out was--- it took that long). It sounds like this works for some people, but if it doesn&#x27;t, do try to stick with it like I did. Neostrata is great and it sounds like if one of the face washes works for you, you will see improvement in just a few days. Keep that in mind, don&#x27;t make it worse by continuing to use it if it&#x27;s not for you. So I&#x27;m back the the regular cleanser, but I&#x27;m still a believer. I use topical medication as well, but this stuff can maintain you when you&#x27;re in a jam and the topical gels I use are now more of an added bonus. I just need to wash 2 times a day consistently and be sure to open the pores with warm water before (8-10 water splashes or shower). I also let it dry on my skin-- that seems to help the regular wash get even deeper.</li>
    <li> For the past 3-4 years I&#x27;ve had trouble clearing out my pores. I am a blacksmith/metalworker, and my skin is constantly barraged with coal dust, ash, high heat, metal grit and rust in the air. It really gets in your skin.  Since mid 2013 I&#x27;ve also been developing actual acne; something I luckily didn&#x27;t have to deal with as a teen. It&#x27;s a bit depressing suddenly having it at 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several big brand products, natural remedies and so on, and nothing worked. I was basically down to just dealing with the acne and pulling blackheads out with the &amp;#34;glue strips&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this Neostrata wash here about a month ago and bought it based solely on the reviews. I lather it in my hands in the shower, spread it on, leave it for a minute or so, and scrub it off. A month later and my skin is amazingly clear. No noticeable blackheads, no real acne &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; (just a spot here and there), no dry or red patches. My skin apparently loves whatever this is made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? I work in conditions that are downright abusive to my skin and this product has helped immensely.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever found for acne prone skin. It is better if you alternate it with another product such as an aprocot scrub.</li>
    <li> Nothing my dermatologist has prescribed or recommended comes close to this. After just a couple of treatments my rosacea was totally gone. I thank God every day for this product, not kidding.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice easy foaming gentle cleanser that works well for my oily/sensitive skin. It lasts a long time as you only need a small amount to lather.</li>
    <li> Also can&#x27;t live without this product. I use their acne spot treatment too, but after washing my face morning and night with this product&lt;br /&gt;my face feels fresh, clean and acne free. Really Good stuff and better than all the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> A great product for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> This product is over my expectations. It cleanse your skin deeply. It def works for blackheads. The only bad side is it is expensive.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. Helps clear acne and does not dry face. Arrived on time and lasts approximately 3 months. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is a great item, it was received on time and in perfect conditions. I will definitley will buy more items through Amazon. Great service!</li>
    <li> This product has helped with my acne more than any product I have used. I use it 1-2 times a day. Great product.</li>
    <li> I pretty much don&#x27;t have break outs anymore!!! My face looks clearer and pimples barely show up. I&#x27;m in love with this facial cleanser, and recommend for skins like mine, prone to breakouts and full of blackheads.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after someone on another forum recommended it. I am very happy with it. I have experienced oily skin, combination skin and everything above all my life and have feverishly tried different products to control all areas of my face plus avoid my adult acne I have from time to time. This product has done it. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I needed an antibacterial soap for my face so that I can stop taking oral antibacterial medication for acne. I think at best it maintains the face once I&#x27;ve applied all the medication I take for the acne. I don t think it does anything more and am not sure it I&#x27;ll get it again If I can find something better.</li>
    <li> Loved these items....will definitely purchase again and refer friends!!!!</li>
    <li> Truly cleans your face and leaves it super shiny.  Love it!  Neostrata makes me look 10 years younger.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I was breaking out right after I get a facial.  This helped minimize the breakout by 90%...  I bought a second bottle few days ago.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  Only for few days after I get a facial.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for oily and acne-prone skin. It contains an ingredient called Triclosan, which is great at battling bacteria that causes the breakouts on my skin. My skin always feels clean and refreshed after using it. I am sure you will see a great result after using this product. I would high recommend it to anybody! 5/5 STARS</li>
    <li> Ordered this antibacterial cleanser in an attempt to control my hormonal acne. Read wonderful reviews about the product. Unfortunately did not work for me, as my skin was already sensitive and it only dried it out more, created more oil, more bacteria, and prolonged my skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;hot-mess&amp;#34; status.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my boyfriend who had lifelong difficulties with oily/combination skin and some acne has found a miracle in this product. His face has NEVER looked so good. Oil production has regulated for him, his acne has cleared, skin tone and overall appearance has improved. GREAT product for oily skin; not at all for dry, sensitive, hormonal skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for years and have very acne-prone skin.  Recommended by my doctor and it is the only cleanser that has agreed with my skin for years.  Very light wash, no scent, and the bottle lasts forever!  Thanks for selling on Amazon!</li>
    <li> The past few months I&#x27;ve been dealing with cystic acne you know- that hormonal feels like its growing straight from the bone painful acne?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because it has triclosan in it - the main ingredient in the product my dermatologist was charging me an arm and leg for. This works better than what I was getting from my dermatologist. This is actually the only face-wash I&#x27;ve found that has it. It feels like a mild wash- actually like washing my face with baby bath- but it cleans deep and has been clearing up my cystic acne better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. I can&#x27;t believe the difference! It is slightly drying so use a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the method I&#x27;ve been using. Press a hot wash cloth (not too hot, but hot)to your face to open your pores and slough off dead skin cells. Wipe your skin with the hot wash cloth as a pre-cleanse, then use this product. I let it sit for a minute then rinse with another hot washcloth.</li>
    <li> I usually use the normal PHA4 Neostrata facewash but after reading these reviews, I figured I should try something that would help my acne more. I have mild acne and this made my face dry and made me break-out worse than before. It may work for some people, but if you have moderate to mild acne, I would think twice before using it. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin but I found this to be much harsher than other reviews lead me to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this but I do recommend the other normal Neostrata facewash (doesn&#x27;t foam, and VERY gentle). This one [[ASIN:B000UPQXGA Neostrata Facial Cleanser 6oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps somebody out! Good luck!</li>
    <li> After recently reading about the potential dangers of the chemical (which has also been used as a pesticide) triclosan, I am completely uncomfortable massaging this product into my skin.  This chemical (the active ingredient in NeoStrata&#x27;s Antibacterial Facial Cleanser) has been linked to breast cancer, and affects hormone and thyroid levels, among others.  Please research the negative affects of triclosan before using this product.  My dermatologist recommended that I use this with a minocycline regimen, but I no longer feel safe using this product.  This chemical is also found in antibacterial hand soap (Bath and Body Works just revamped their soaps to omit triclosan because of the potential health risks), some toothpastes, antibacterial plastics, deodorants, and more.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing! I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had a problem with acne almost all my life and this is the best product ive used for it.  One step and your done.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great wash, it foams and leaves your skin feeling clean. It does dry a little, so I use Neostrata moisturizer, that helps a lot. I was recommended these products by my cosmetologist, I don&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s face broke out a year and a half ago.  A friend who used to work for a dermatologist pulled me aside to ask if she could make a suggestion.  My daughter started using this stuff and the difference was immediate and immense.  Her face is now (a year and a half later) clear.  She uses this twice a day.</li>
    <li> Favorite wash ever ! Recommended by my dermatologist - works wonderfully on preventing acne without irritating skin.</li>
