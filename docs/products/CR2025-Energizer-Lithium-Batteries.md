<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All batteries were dead. Tried contacting the seller but the email would not go through. Waste of money</li>
    <li> No issues on time, great value.</li>
    <li> they work great on my house alarm remote</li>
    <li> These have worked great in my FitBit Zip.</li>
    <li> As described, on time, and great pricing. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> These batteries that I bought through Amazon are fresh and perform very well.  The price is right and they are working well.</li>
    <li> Bought from &amp;#34;The Perfect Deals&amp;#34;. Product is genuine, not a knock-off.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> These batteries are great. The price of the pack of 10 would be the price I would have to pay for one&lt;br /&gt;battery in the stores. I would definitely recommend these and I know I will purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;Again price can not be beat.</li>
    <li> Great price for extra batteries (I use them for my 3D glasses for my lcd TV).</li>
    <li> It is so easy to order these more unusual batteries when I need them. The price is reasonable because the shipping is free. I order all my disc batteries from this company.</li>
    <li> Order processed timely.&lt;br /&gt;Item received as per description</li>
    <li> Like many others here, my batteries have almost no charge. I replaced the battery in my FitBit a week ago, and tonight got a message indicating my battery is low and I must change it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad product, and judging by the similar complaints, Amazon needs to remove this item entirely from its inventory.</li>
    <li> works great, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> As advertised, only used 2 of the 10 batteries and didn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
    <li> Received them quick! And they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re supposed to...</li>
    <li> Same great quality as buying individually, but cheaper to buy in bulk</li>
    <li> reliable and cost effective..each wrapped  sperately...would buy again...John...End...</li>

    <li> Batteries were for remotes and they were very cheep.</li>
    <li> works well with heart rate monitors.</li>
    <li> Great price! as expensive as batteries are and especially these types this is a great deal! It cost you nearly $5 for one battery in store.</li>
    <li> Best deal anywhere on these!</li>
    <li> Fresh, strong batteries at a great price!</li>
    <li> Good price for these name brand batteries.  I like to keep extras on hand.  Hold a charge well</li>
    <li> grear product  and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.  Used in fitbit, supposed to last 6 weeks. Only lasted one.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good shape, in original packaging- and worked.  The price was much lower than buying them at the local drug store.  A good value!</li>
    <li> completely dead batteries - worked for less than a day when the battery i replaced worked for 4 months.</li>
    <li> I guess these work, only time will tell.</li>
    <li> These batteries are a joke I don&amp;#34;t know how people get away with this crap!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> wow what a difference name batteries make.  bought some cheap ones and was changing the battery in my Fitbit every other day.  now it has been a few weeks with the one battery!</li>
    <li> The batteries were packaged in 2012, so 1/3 of their self-life is already gone.  I would not consider that as being fresh.</li>
    <li> These batteries only lasted a few days in my fitbit. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Heck of a lot cheaper than buying at a local store! Also, the Energizer brand promises long life. Goodbuy!</li>
    <li> Product received as described. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it arrived 3 days later than promised.</li>
    <li> Did an awesome job in getting the product to me and it was what I actually order at a very good price!</li>
    <li> Did not last nearly as long as store bought batteries.</li>
    <li> These are a simple commodity. I&#x27;ve never had one brand perform better than the others in my Polar exercise band (for reading my pulse).  I bought these for the unit price, and it looks like a good deal.</li>
    <li> These are for my business &amp;#34;security&amp;#34; panic button... no more messages sent to the call center indicating the button has been pressed, only to find out our batteries are low.</li>
    <li> I am a teacher so I bought A LOT of these.  All of them worked well!</li>
    <li> 10 batteries for my car key, watch, AC window unit remote, and more!  Just make sure you check the date before you open them.  Should be on the package. Check to see if they are outdated...</li>
    <li> Great buy and all have worked properly out of the package. The delivery was also prompt. I&#x27;ll probably never buy batteries like this anywhere else as long as Amazon makes them available.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re batteries -- what can I say.  The product arrived on schedule and is as advertised.  The price is very good so this one is a winner.</li>
    <li> Good item as described</li>
    <li> I bought these batteries to replace the dead ones in my Samsung 3D glasses, and they worked; however, they arrived in a cellophane bag in sets of five (as pictured) as though they had been removed from a larger bulk package.  None of the blister packs have expiration dates on them.  Yes, they are stamped &amp;#34;Energizer, Made in China,&amp;#34; and yes, each blister pack also says, &amp;#34;Energizer.&amp;#34;  The problem is that I don&#x27;t know how fresh these are.  While they work, I don&#x27;t know whether to expect a short or long shelf life, hence my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> Used these for my fitbit.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price at Walmart or anywhere else!!!  Batteries work great!!</li>

    <li> The batteries seem to be working well, although they certainly don&#x27;t appear to last as long as the one that shipped with my&lt;br /&gt;Fitbit Zip. All in all, an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price..I have so many extras.</li>
