      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>

      <li>I love the smell of lavender.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased more for myself and some for family members.</li>

      <li>but I prefer Nexus conditioning shampoo as it works better on my hair.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really helps my hair.  </li>
      <li>I saw this Paul Mitchell here on Amazon and Lavender is one of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>My wife spends a lot of time making sure her best shampoo isn&#x27;t left in the shower.</li>
      <li>I wear a helmet for my sport and top shelf shampoos were not relieving that itchy feeling in my scalp.  </li>
      <li>My beard and head felt very clean, but it didn&#x27;t improve the feeling of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazon had the best price and the arrival was in a reasonable reasonable time frame.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell of my hair after it dries too, feels to clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love Paul Mitchell products, especially his tea tree products, however, this lavender kind does not smell good at all.</li>
      <li>I have developed a fondness for lavender and it has a great scent.  </li>
      <li>And my hair is getting healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>The smell is incredibly strong.</li>
      <li>I love the Paul Mitchell tea tree special line.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was a fine product.</li>
      <li>Helps with dandruff and it smells fine as hell</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Lavender Mint each time I wash my hair and it makes my hair feel so clean and fresh!</li>
      <li>I bought it mostly for that minty fresh, tingly feeling</li>
      <li>but if you are trying to go sulfate free this is not quite there.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great shampoo.</li>
      <li>I did not like this scent and prefer the original PM Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
      <li>this shampoo isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
      <li>Think I&#x27;ll stick with the tea tree special shampoo line.</li>
      <li>Saw it on Amazon, and price was way more reasonable than at beauty parlors, so I ordered it.</li>
      <li>It kept his room smelling fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I love lavender and tea tree, but this particular mixture is overpowering.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, but I used to really like the original Tea Tree shampoo, as the cool/tingling feeling and the way it would make the whole room was pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Luckily I also bought Redken&#x27;s similar mint shampoo which smells MUCH better and gives me those tingles!</li>
      <li>I admit, I was pretty excited about having a lavender shampoo.</li>
      <li>the Lavender and Teatree and Peppermint offer a wonderfully moisturizing with just a bit of peppermint to keep the moisturizer from laying fine hair down flat to the head.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super soft and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, if it improves the feeling of my beard and stops dryness in the facial hair, it would still be worth the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff got really high reviews in some men&#x27;s magazine, and I have to say it seems &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering or overwhelming, but a definite aroma to it that I like.  </li>
      <li>I just know that when I first started using the product it agreed with my hair.  </li>
      <li>It really does moisturize!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this shampoo didn&#x27;t give that awesome &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling, nor did it smell like lavender.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>First off, it arrived in a plastic zippie bag (thankfully because the bottle had opened and leaked all over during shipping).</li>
      <li>Delivery was very prompt.  </li>
      <li>thanks, Michael Wiles</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really such a personal product and everyone&#x27;s hair and taste is so individual, but I&#x27;m so happy with this shampoo</li>
      <li>also Really Like the scent.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is worth the 5 stars, so the extra shipping was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually smelled kind of gross to me, upset my allergies</li>
      <li>bought on Amazon for the costs--I am in a more remote place and the local shop won&#x27;t special order it which meant online purchasing.  </li>
      <li>review is more or less based on the smell and how well it cleans/treats.</li>
      <li>Bough some here, but later got a better price on a deal at a local Hair Cuttery.</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair feel and look clean - help get rid of oily and dry, flaky scalp.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>the price is way too high.</li>
      <li>A friend recommended it highly and gave me a shampoo//conditioner set.</li>
      <li>While there, the hotel room had several bottles of complimentary shampoo, conditioner and lotions.</li>
      <li>I now have much more limp hair--so I&#x27;m looking for change.</li>
      <li>I could not smell the lavender scent and possibly the mint scent was too powerful.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the same as my regular cheap shampoo that i normally use.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations I have on the Paul Mitchell brand.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations I have on the Paul Mitchell</li>
      <li>I also have fine hair and this shampoo does not weigh it down or leave a residue.  </li>
      <li>I think I will end up going back to the original stuff for the next purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been a little more educated recently about shampoo ingredients...</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really see the difference like i had with the regular Paul Mitchell mint.</li>
      <li>I actually don&#x27;t like the smell as much as I thought I would.  </li>
      <li>Then I found out how much it costs and decided to find a different shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and starting to go a little gray.  </li>

    <li> this shampoo isn&#x27;t anything special. it&#x27;s the same as my regular cheap shampoo that i normally use. the price is way too high.</li>
    <li> I have had Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea mint shampoo before in the past. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought this that it had Lavender in it. The product works great! It leaves my hair super soft and clean. It just has a woodsy smell to it.</li>
    <li> great product with good fragrance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It smells great and really helps my hair.  I use it often, as well as other Paul Mitchell products</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It leaves my hair smelliing great and feeling wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Will always love this shampoo! Feels great going on and keeps your head moisturized. Love the smell of my hair after it dries too, feels to clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love Paul Mitchell products, especially his tea tree products, however, this lavender kind does not smell good at all. Actually the smell made me sick. I couldn&#x27;t use it and had to throw it away which was a waste of money. If you want a Paul Mitchell tea tree, then get the regular one cuz that one doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it&#x27;s kinda tingly and makes your hair very soft. This one on the other hand, don&#x27;t bother the smell is way to strong and just terrible!</li>
    <li> I like it and the smell.  It really does moisturize!</li>
    <li> I wear a helmet for my sport and top shelf shampoos were not relieving that itchy feeling in my scalp.  This stuff did the trick!  I also have fine hair and this shampoo does not weigh it down or leave a residue.  I have purchased more for myself and some for family members.</li>
    <li> the fragarance stay in my hair til I wash it again. And my hair is getting healthy and smooth. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a fine product. I&#x27;ve read reviews online about paul mitchell shampoo so i decided to try it myself. I remember I also had it at a Hilton hotel which I loved so that was also a factor. Helps with dandruff and it smells fine as hell</li>
    <li> Cleans your hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  Nice scent.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great.  This was my first time buying a PM product as I usually use American Crew but I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Let me start with a little bit of a warning: I&#x27;m bald. But I do have a little stubble on my head after a few days of not shaving and I also have a full beard. I haven&#x27;t bought a bottle of shampoo in years, even decades. Just from memory, I would guess the last shampoo I bought was in 1993-1994. It was the regular Paul Mitchell in the white bottle. I always liked the pleasant smell of it. So my wife and I were on a weekend getaway. While there, the hotel room had several bottles of complimentary shampoo, conditioner and lotions. One of the shampoos was called Bumble and Bumble Surf Foam. I decided to try it on my beard and loved it. Then I found out how much it costs and decided to find a different shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use whatever shampoo is in our shower. My wife spends a lot of time making sure her best shampoo isn&#x27;t left in the shower. I saw this Paul Mitchell here on Amazon and Lavender is one of my favorite scents. I had been sold on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s brand back in the 90s. So I ordered the shampoo and conditioner. The plan was to wash my beard and head/hair every other day. I admit, I was pretty excited about having a lavender shampoo. Then I received it and started to use it. It&#x27;s not the lavender I know of. As a kid, my grandfather used to have a bowl beside his clothing dresser. He kept warm water in it and dropped lavender in it. It kept his room smelling fresh and clean. He also would rub some on his hands and smack his hands on his face after shaving. He told me it&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; a man ever needs. I was expecting this to smell something like his lavender water. It doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a woodsy smell, a very slight mint smell and a dull lavender scent. It&#x27;s okay, if it improves the feeling of my beard and stops dryness in the facial hair, it would still be worth the price. It didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work. My beard and head felt very clean, but it didn&#x27;t improve the feeling of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is more or less based on the smell and how well it cleans/treats. It cleans well. The other two are below average. I&#x27;m still giving it a 3 star since I&#x27;ll finish the bottles. There&#x27;s nothing offensive or bad about it. It just doesn&#x27;t live up to the expectations I have on the Paul Mitchell brand.d on the smell and how well it cleans/treats. It cleans well. The other two are below average. I&#x27;m still giving it a 3 star since I&#x27;ll finish the bottles. There&#x27;s nothing offensive or bad about it.

    <li> Great product and you can definitely feel your scalp tingling. Really makes your hair feel and look clean - help get rid of oily and dry, flaky scalp. I could not smell the lavender scent and possibly the mint scent was too powerful. I did not like this scent and prefer the original PM Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I debated about writing a review for shampoo. It&#x27;s really such a personal product and everyone&#x27;s hair and taste is so individual, but I&#x27;m so happy with this shampoo it seemed worthwhile to post a review anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no &#x27;beauty&#x27; expertise to describe it--I just know that when I first started using the product it agreed with my hair.  My hair is fine and starting to go a little gray.  It also has a tendency to frizz out a bit and has gotten dry where I&#x27;m living.  With this shampoo (and conditioner, but I haven&#x27;t bought that on Amazon just yet, so no review) my hair has been improving.  The shampoo can&#x27;t help the fineness, or my inherent lack of style, but it does seem to help the texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also Really Like the scent.  I have developed a fondness for lavender and it has a great scent.  Not overpowering or overwhelming, but a definite aroma to it that I like.  Of course, this is definitely a place where personal preference comes in, in contrast I generally don&#x27;t like the vanillas or coconut type scents on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought on Amazon for the costs--I am in a more remote place and the local shop won&#x27;t special order it which meant online purchasing.  Amazon had the best price and the arrival was in a reasonable reasonable time frame.  I have an FPO address but the seller does not ship FPO so I had to use a re-shipper.  (However, this is universal for things like shampoo so oh well).  The product itself is worth the 5 stars, so the extra shipping was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/18/11 edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a little more educated recently about shampoo ingredients...this one does contain (as of my last bottle purchased) Ammonia Laurel Sulfate...apparently not the worst of the sulfates but if you are trying to go sulfate free this is not quite there.  I only really thought about it because of a recent online discussion I&#x27;ve been reading plus I have moved to where the water is quite different and instead of frizzy I now have much more limp hair--so I&#x27;m looking for change.</li>
    <li> I love the Paul Mitchell tea tree special line.  I love the smell of lavender.  Why not put Paul Mitchell and lavender into my basket and wash my hair?  Alright!  Bad idea.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  Unfortunately, this shampoo didn&#x27;t give that awesome &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling, nor did it smell like lavender.  In fact, my hair still felt dirty and smelled like a wet dog.  It isn&#x27;t a shampoo I will be trying again.  Think I&#x27;ll stick with the tea tree special shampoo line.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. First off, it arrived in a plastic zippie bag (thankfully because the bottle had opened and leaked all over during shipping). I used it the next day and was thoroughly unimpressed. I bought it mostly for that minty fresh, tingly feeling you get from these type products. However, this didn&#x27;t give me that feeling and wasn&#x27;t all that minty. It actually smelled kind of gross to me, upset my allergies a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I also bought Redken&#x27;s similar mint shampoo which smells MUCH better and gives me those tingles! Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell products are usually great--but this one is so over-scented, I can&#x27;t use it. A friend recommended it highly and gave me a shampoo//conditioner set. The smell is incredibly strong. I love lavender and tea tree, but this particular mixture is overpowering. I hate to throw out a full set of hair products, so I just use it occasionally and rinse a long time. I&#x27;d recommend it for normal to slightly oily hair, as it dries out the hair a bit. It does have nice sheen and control, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I thought it was the regular mint but it wasn&#x27;t.  didn&#x27;t really see the difference like i had with the regular Paul Mitchell mint.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It keeps my hair soft without weighing it down. Plus no more dry scalp! I also don&#x27;t hAve to suffer through heavily medicated smell. I highly recommend. Ive been looking everywhere for a shampoo to manage all the above. FINALLY we have a winner!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used!!!  The 1st time I used it, I felt a big difference in my hair. It felt like it does when you spend alot of money to get you hair done at a salon.  I have tried everything from the bargain shampoos to the most expensive, included Bumble &amp; Bumble, nothing came close to  this Paul Mitchell Lavender mint.  I even made everyone feel my hair..lol. I will only use this product from now on. I will recommend this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This stuff got really high reviews in some men&#x27;s magazine, and I have to say it seems &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but nothing special. It cleans well, but I used to really like the original Tea Tree shampoo, as the cool/tingling feeling and the way it would make the whole room was pretty nice.  I think I will end up going back to the original stuff for the next purchase.</li>
    <li> I actually don&#x27;t like the smell as much as I thought I would.  The product definitely has that lavender/mint smell, but after using it for a few days I didn&#x27;t grow to like it.  I do think there are a lot of people out there who would love this, but it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent aside, it&#x27;s a great shampoo and I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it.  Four stars.</li>
    <li> I ave curly hair and this left my hair too dry. I think I am done with Paul Mitchell products. Natural products work best for my hair.</li>
    <li> wonderful part of the Paul Mitchell scented collection.  Makes hair smell so wonderful and the Lavender and Teatree and Peppermint offer a wonderfully moisturizing with just a bit of peppermint to keep the moisturizer from laying fine hair down flat to the head.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple of years and switch off with a different shampoo every 3-4 days.  This shampoo makes your hair smell WONDERFUL; like LAVENDER.  Yummmm</li>
    <li> the last two bottles I have ordered of this product come with broken lids, this one had leaked out half the product. need to contact manufacture about bad caps. thanks, Michael Wiles</li>
    <li> I have used these products for years and love them!</li>
    <li> The Tea Tree Lavender Mint shampoo is salon grade without the harshness.  I have thick, straight hair and I need to wash my hair everyday.  This shampoo lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair like a haystack.  My hair has some bounce afterwards without the use of a conditioner.  The minor downside is the price and the lack of a tingling normally of tea tree shampoos.  Overall a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Cleanses and smells divine.  Will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> .. especially during summer, for whatever reason. Bough some here, but later got a better price on a deal at a local Hair Cuttery.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell hair spray for many years so thought I would give this a try.  It smells great but I prefer Nexus conditioning shampoo as it works better on my hair.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo some years ago.  I switched a long time ago because it was so expensive.  I have been wishing I could find it again.  Saw it on Amazon, and price was way more reasonable than at beauty parlors, so I ordered it. So happy to have it again.  Delivery was very prompt.  No problems.  I will keep ordering it now.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree by Paul Mitchell is the best!  I love the scent of Lavender Mint each time I wash my hair and it makes my hair feel so clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. The lavender mint combination and the tee tree oil are perfect for fine hair.</li>
