      <li>I liked it so much, I ordered when I returned home.  </li>
      <li>Originally came across this product at a hotel in Atlantic City.</li>
      <li>Like many others who have posted reviews, I first tried this soap at a hotel where I was staying.  </li>
      <li>The price is steep but well worth it!  </li>
      <li>There are tiny particles in many nice bars of soap, but this is the first one where it felt like they were scratching my skin.</li>
      <li>This soap has seemed to stop all breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Lasts a good long time.</li>
      <li>It cost more than the normal soap but worth every penny--especially for individuals with sensitivities.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
      <li>It is terrific, smells nice, cleans well, good size, and is not  at all harsh to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Personally, I think they put way too many of these granules in it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this soap.</li>
      <li>I first used this cleanser at a hotel in Lansing, MI.  </li>
      <li>Found this soap in a hotel we stayed at and simply fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>However, the soap at the hotel lathered up much better than the larger size I bought from Amazon</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing too.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I smell clean all day long.</li>
      <li>I definitely get where people feel that their skin is really smooth after using this soap, because your skin does feel that way, but within a few moments, I realized that it leaves more of a film on your skin, than any actually moisturization.</li>
      <li>I discovered this soap during a hotel stay at Skyline in New York.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s soap, and the Minty Bar in the past, this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why the large size would be different.</li>
      <li>Has small grains to really make you feel clean.</li>
      <li>and my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
      <li>Not dry!  </li>
      <li>Initially, I thought it was a little pricey for just a skin cleanser, but decided it is worth it.</li>
      <li>in it so is slightly abrasive to really get the dirt off but gentle enough for your face and other sensitive parts.</li>

    <li> Like many others who have posted reviews, I first tried this soap at a hotel where I was staying.  I loved its orange frangrance and the nubbly scrubbing bits in the soap that leave your skin smooth.  It is very moisturizing too.  I am so glad to have found it available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I discovered this soap during a hotel stay at Skyline in New York.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  This soap has seemed to stop all breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  Not dry!  I have also noticed an improvement in my skin overall.  I did a search online and am now exlcusively using this soap for face and shower.  Due to cost, I still use Dove for regular handwashing, but that is it.  You will love this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, has stuff inside it that gives a scratchy feel!</li>
    <li> I also discovered this cleanser while staying at a hotel, and from then on my skin has been spectacular. Im a  teenager and i used to suffer from breakouts, but no longer. This product is amazing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and fresh.</li>
    <li> I discovered the Cali Tarocco line of bath products when staying in a boutique hotel in NYC.  I absolutely love this soap! It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like harsher soaps will, and it has a wonderful aroma of orange.  Additionally, the shampoo and conditioner are both wonderful.      I went out and bought some as soon as I got home, and I haven&#x27;t been sorry.</li>
    <li> I also discovered this soap in a hotel, in Newport Beach.  It is terrific, smells nice, cleans well, good size, and is not  at all harsh to the skin.  I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s soap, and the Minty Bar in the past, this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> .The best soap I have ever purchased. I smell clean all day long. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive.  Lower the price.</li>
    <li> First found this at a nice hotel. Fell in love with it. Great soap, beautiful scent. My husband loves it also. Has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it so is slightly abrasive to really get the dirt off but gentle enough for your face and other sensitive parts.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of my skin.  Soap smells great.  The hotel soap at the Inn on  Whitworth, Love it there and ordered my own.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful.  The price is steep but well worth it!  My wife love&#x27;s it and so do I.</li>

    <li> Like others, I found this at a hotel (travel size bar) and really liked it.  However, the soap at the hotel lathered up much better than the larger size I bought from Amazon and it also didn&#x27;t have the exfoliating &amp;#34;granules&amp;#34; like the larger size.  Personally, I think they put way too many of these granules in it.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again, very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t know why the large size would be different.</li>
    <li> The best soap ever, great exfoliation texture, great aroma. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I first used this cleanser at a hotel in Lansing, MI.  I liked it so much, I ordered when I returned home.  Initially, I thought it was a little pricey for just a skin cleanser, but decided it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Best body soap I have ever used. Leaves you smelling great. Originally came across this product at a hotel in Atlantic City. Can&#x27;t get enough of it.  One bar is equivalent in size to Irish Spring bar of soap.  Very thick, lathery discharge soap.  Has small grains to really make you feel clean.</li>
    <li> We love this soap.  It cost more than the normal soap but worth every penny--especially for individuals with sensitivities.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I definitely get where people feel that their skin is really smooth after using this soap, because your skin does feel that way, but within a few moments, I realized that it leaves more of a film on your skin, than any actually moisturization. I don&#x27;t know how actually to describe it, but if you&#x27;ve ever used a soap before that you then thought, I need to wash myself again to get this off of me, this is that soap.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  I use it as a facial cleanser.  It has a nice fragrance and cleans my face well.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this item isn&#x27;t referred to as \\&quot;soap\\&quot;; it works and smells amazing as both a cleanser and moisturizer. You will love it!</li>
    <li> We love blood orange soap from Tarocco.  It smells great in the shower.  The whole Tarocco line is great, but the bar soap lasts the longest.</li>
    <li> It is great soap for men. I have bough it for years.</li>
    <li> Great Smell, love the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; particles embedded in it.  Very moisturizing when I ran out of Shaving cream I discovered I could actually shave with this soap and it felt great!</li>
