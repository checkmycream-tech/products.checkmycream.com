      <li>I have been with sexy hair for years,  I love it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is healthy and full!</li>
      <li>I started using cheap drug store shampoo again and things are already looking better.</li>
      <li>This made my hair very volumized, and smelling good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m stoked I found the product I love at the price I originally found it at.</li>
      <li>It was delivered very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly and was well packaged to prevent damage.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, bodyless hair thats prone to breaking and an oily scalp.</li>
      <li>decided to buy it since i use their hairspray and gel pretty good makes my hair nice and soft</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of their products but</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for a great inexpensive product.</li>
      <li>I purchased this shampoo and conditioner combo thinking the shampoo was sulfate free as advertised on the page.  </li>
      <li>Sulfate free?</li>
      <li>gluten free label to trick us into trusting them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a sulfate free user for over a year</li>
      <li>The price was cheap.</li>
      <li>Gluten free?</li>
      <li>my hair has more body than it did before (making it look actually normal) and i love the smell.</li>
      <li>so I was so excited to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have been using Big Sexy Hair Volume Shampoo and Conditioner for years and its definitely one of the best for my hair.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m impressed with it so far especially at this price.</li>
      <li>just what i was expecting makes my hair so soft and falls nicely i have received many compliments on how nice my hair looks, out of the blue too!</li>
      <li>like it&#x27;s balding and my bangs are no longer full.</li>
      <li>Very upset that the shampoo looks more like the conditioner.</li>
      <li>Other than that...it was a great buy.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>I love Big Sexy Hair products.</li>
      <li>To top it off I only have to retouch my roots which saves me money, gotta love that!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell or texture when washing my hair, but after I&#x27;d have to say I love how soft and clean my hair felt.</li>
      <li>Before I tried Big Sexy Hair Volume shampoo and conditioner, my hair would fade within 3 weeks!</li>
      <li>Well worth a try.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find the Big Sexy Hair (original) shampoo and conditioner in the salons in my area anymore</li>
      <li>Seems like a knock off, we returned it right away.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good just be careful and don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
      <li>The price is a great deal cheaper than the local and big name stores.</li>
      <li>I found this same Big Sexy Hair two pack while I was on vacation at a great clips for the same price.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I have nothing bad to say about this shampoo and conditioner I love it and will for sure use again!!!</li>
      <li>Big Sexy Hair makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>and I got my first gray hairs...</li>
      <li>My daughter first purchased this product at Costco</li>
      <li>I where my hair in a short clasic bob cut, so a trim takes care of the issue and I make sure to give my hair a break from the volumizing shampoo from time to time.</li>

    <li> I have never had better hair  than having used this!!  It is AWESOME!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I was given a refund, thank you</li>
    <li> bought as a gift, price seemed good</li>
    <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out of my hair like normal conditioner does, but otherwise I really do think it helps with volume.</li>
    <li> Gives my thin limp hair some body and oomph!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell or texture when washing my hair, but after I&#x27;d have to say I love how soft and clean my hair felt. Would I buy it again? No. But I&#x27;ll finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this shampoo and conditioner I love it and will for sure use again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde and color my hair red. Before I tried Big Sexy Hair Volume shampoo and conditioner, my hair would fade within 3 weeks! After using this for the last 4 months,  my hair retains the my shiny red color better,is growing faster, and is the healthiest it has ever been. To top it off I only have to retouch my roots which saves me money, gotta love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duo smells delicious too, like something you would get at a fancy spa. My husband cannot get enough of the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Remember this does have proteins in it, so you do NOT want to wash your hair everyday****</li>
    <li> I have celiac disease and products containing gluten make me sick.  I was thrilled to find this product because it said free of gluten.  However, after I used it a couple times I started to feel sick and realized that wheat is listed in the ingredients, which is a form of gluten.  I will never purchase from this company again.  This product is NOT GLUTEN FREE!</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair. This product is amazing! I have nice hair again. I am so glad I found this product.....Love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was as expected.</li>
    <li> Made me feel sexy as ever!!!! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Great product but You can find it in Ross and its alot cheaper.. each bottle shampoo or conditioner is only 12.00</li>
    <li> anything for my wife has to be good</li>
    <li> This is false advertising at best and malicious intent at worst.  Hydrolyzed what protein is listed as an ingredient in both the shampoo and conditioner, and both are labeled &amp;#34;gluten free&amp;#34; on the front.  How dare they use a &amp;#34;trendy&amp;#34; gluten free label to trick us into trusting them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a rash on my scalp, face, neck, and chest and my hair is falling out.  This is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed in my daily routine, and I only used the products twice.  I finally checked the label &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; and found out they LIE on their packaging!  Disgusting.  This company will never get another dollar of mine.</li>
    <li> Not sudsy takes twice as much to wash hair. Not my favorite</li>
    <li> I love Big sexy hair products, but this was disappointing. The shampoo only lathers if you use a ridiculous amount! Just average, nothing special and definitely not worth the price... Which is a huge disappointment from this brand!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product it smells like children&#x27;s bubble stuff, and did nothing for my hair.  It has been deemed the emergency shampoo and conditioner in our house...basically if we run out of the good stuff we use this crap.</li>
    <li> This does work as a volumizer and I do really like. It receives 4 stars, because after using for a few weeks it does have a drying effect on the hair, as most volumizing shampoos do on my hair. I where my hair in a short clasic bob cut, so a trim takes care of the issue and I make sure to give my hair a break from the volumizing shampoo from time to time. This shampoo gets 4 stars, because it is not as consentrated as I like and it takes a great deal more shampoo to get a lather. Other than that...it was a great buy. My local Ulta does not come close to this price, even when it is on sale.</li>
    <li> Great product. Quick shipping. Love this stuff. MAkes hair feel thicker and fuller.  Great price compared to salon prices. Will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I have spent considerable more for volumizing  products.  This is the best I have tried at a great price. Well worth a try.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair SO SO BAD!!! :-( Smelled beautiful, though. I&#x27;m a huge fan of their products but the shampoo and conditioning is not for me.</li>
    <li> It does wonders for me...thin and grey but natural curl...</li>
    <li> just what i was expecting makes my hair so soft and falls nicely i have received many compliments on how nice my hair looks, out of the blue too! fast delivery. will shop with them again.</li>
    <li> Came on time and was just what I had expected.... Thanks so much for a great inexpensive product. Great Buy</li>
    <li> I love Big Sexy Hair products. The Spray N Play hairspray, the Root Pump volumizing mousse, their dry shampoo. But this did not work for me. I used them twice and gave them away. My hair has never been so tangled or dull. It turned my hair to straw. I got the Surface Bassu after my hair stylist recommended it and it is great. Buy their dry shampoo, their mousse, and their hairspray but skip the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner really did make my hair have a little more volume to it. I have very fine hair so it&#x27;s hard for me to get any kind of volume in my hair. The scent was Lemon grass.. Not my favorite . Aside from the smell it works great.</li>
    <li> I have always bought this locally, but the last time I went to buy it it wasn&#x27;t on sale.  I purchased this at a much discounted price.  It was delivered very quickly.  My favorite shampoo and conditioner.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about 3 years and highly recommend them to anyone with fine limp hair. Of course a good cut is a must but the shampoo is lovely and the conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy for my fine hair.  My hair is healthy and full!</li>
    <li> Big Sexy Hair makes my hair feel just like  Suave for $1 does.  Spent too much for something that promises to be more.</li>
    <li> I bought this duo because I wanted to add lots of volume to my hair, but after ordering the product and carefully reading the label I saw the second ingredient as &amp;#34;Sodium Laureth Sulfate.&amp;#34;  The label reads as &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; but the product is not.  I would not recommend the shampoo for anyone trying to avoid using sulfates when washing their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hoarder of salon products and I&#x27;ve tried so so so many!  Against my better judgement I bought the duo set because it was on sale in the salon I go to and I needed shampoo.  They didn&#x27;t carry my regular brand so I got the Big Sexy.  it truly does what it says it will!  I can totally tell the difference when I wash and condition my hair with this product.</li>
    <li> Men it&#x27;s ok that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the authentic product. It looks nothing like the picture. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and always purchased it from Ulta but decided to just buy it online instead of the store. What a disappointment. I was too scared to use it on my hair. Seems like a knock off, we returned it right away.</li>
    <li> Order this for my wife who has been using this for years, the Color Safe version is what was sent.</li>
    <li> super good deal for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;in my salon they run $16 each for the 12 oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;so i decided to buy 3!</li>
    <li> this stuff is the bomb!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find the Big Sexy Hair (original) shampoo and conditioner in the salons in my area anymore so I was so excited to find them on Amazon. I even told my Mom about it and she bought some too. I have curly hair and I use hair gel, with this shampoo it doesn&#x27;t take as much to get the hair products washed out. The conditioner is good just be careful and don&#x27;t use to much. These bottles will last me forever!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and the product itself works wonders. I have thin brittle hair and this stuff made my hair thick and full looking. I absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> I do think it makes a difference in the body of my hair the only negative the conditioner does not do a very good job of untangling my hair.....may need to try and mix in another conditioner and see if that helps....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed because I can&#x27;&#x27;t really tell that it helps with volume. I have thin and fine hair too. It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> My daughter first purchased this product at Costco and I didn&#x27;t want to try it, but she didn&#x27;t like it and I needed shampoo so gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I order it from Amazon.com since I cannot get it anywhere else -- and I&#x27;ve looked.  Nice shampoo that gives fine hair volume, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and smells nice without being perfumey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a sulfate free user for over a year and this was fine for my hair but smelled HORRIBLE. I thought I could deal but after a week I&#x27;m discontinuing use. The smell is just too gross.</li>
    <li> I had hoped, based on previous reviews, that this product would work well for me.  Not only is my hair just as flat and lifeless as it always has been, but it is a tangled mess!  Continuing to use this product would only damage my hair.  Upon attempting to return this product, I learned that I would have to pay shipping!!!  Who charges shipping to return a product that doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to?!  FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON!!</li>
    <li> It cleans a protects my hair but doesn&#x27;t make my hair have volume.</li>
    <li> decided to buy it since i use their hairspray and gel pretty good makes my hair nice and soft</li>
    <li> Great deal,,these bottles are hugh and the price is fabulous,30.00 for the set and checked Wal-Mart price 25.00 per bottle,,so what u think?Im buying mine on AMAZON...LUV AMAZON</li>
    <li> I have been with sexy hair for years,  I love it.  It has a great smell and works great on my hair.  I just Love it</li>
    <li> This item does wonders for my daughters hair. The price is a great deal cheaper than the local and big name stores.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when I got it the shampoo looks way different that what I have purchased locally it is thick and creamy not the clearer version I was expecting it to be and it didn&#x27;t have the same smell that my original purchase had. Very upset that the shampoo looks more like the conditioner. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be reordering this product if it reads like the item you use when you get it the product should be the same what&#x27;s with two different types of the same thing?</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s first choice for her shampoo and conditioner.  It arrived very quickly and was well packaged to prevent damage.  Would definitely recommend to others</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.  The one at the store is so much better with more volume.  I think this may be a fake that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t give my hair volume.</li>
    <li> i have really thin, oily, limp hair so i bought thins product hoping it would help give my hair a boost. i&#x27;m impressed with it so far especially at this price. my hair has more body than it did before (making it look actually normal) and i love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have fine, bodyless hair thats prone to breaking and an oily scalp. Its hard for me to find a hair product that keeps the oilies at bay while not over-drying my hair and leaving it even more prone to breakage and simultaneously throwing my scalp into oil production overdrive so I have no choice but to wash it every day. I found this same Big Sexy Hair two pack while I was on vacation at a great clips for the same price. for the size, the price made sense and these two bottles lasted my daughter (she has beautiful thick long hair so she has to use a lot) and I 3 months. I fell in love this product, it sufficiently cleans my hair without stripping it dry leaving it soft and manageable. For the first time in forever I can skip a day of washing without worry that my hair will be oily and gross. The only catch was when I needed to go out and find more shampoo and conditioner. I dont know if it was a christmas sale or what, but the local great clips carries the same product in a normal sized bottle for the same as I had paid for more than twice the amount. Its taken me so long to find a product that I like, I didn&#x27;t want to walk away from it but at that price I couldn&#x27;t  do it. I&#x27;m stoked I found the product I love at the price I originally found it at. At this price I will keep using it until something better comes along, but price and results considered I doubt I will be looking.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out. Gave me fly-aways, bad. Terrible lack of detangling. I hated it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have the scent that it does when bought in salons or stores. I think it was old. Dried my hair out too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo, just not what I received.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo and conditioner combo thinking the shampoo was sulfate free as advertised on the page.  It is not! The 2nd ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate; this is false advertising!!! Do not buy this shampoo if you are wanting to use shampoo free of sulfates!</li>
    <li> If you want volume try this product.  Your hair will have body,  feel soft. I have tried a few products and love this one</li>
    <li> Sometimes it difficult to find the shampoo and conditioner in stores. It really does give your hair great volume and smells good. The price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is awful.  The shampoo is ok but the conditioner makes my hair fall out a lot more than usual.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, not sure why, but I would not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> This made my hair very volumized, and smelling good. The price was cheap. Though, I wished the product itself was a little more dense. It would slide right out of my hands before I could get into my hair, and I had to get big handfuls of shampoo to actually get my hair scrubbed, meanwhile the bottle was half way gone. But, they did last a couple months.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE! I have very fine stringy hair and I get so many compliments now that I use this shampoo and conditioner. I actually love my hair now. Amazing stuff. Tons of healthy beautiful looking volume.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and leaves my hair feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have very fine thin hair. And this helps me get the volume I want. I can&#x27;t go without it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Big Sexy Hair Volume Shampoo and Conditioner for years and its definitely one of the best for my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have thin strand, straight, dark blonde hair, but I have a LOT of it. I received some sample bottles of this and used them up in about two weeks. My hair was already quite thick and shiny, but this seemed to strip all the build up off my scalp and made my hair even more shiny and bouncy than before. I bought the full sized bottles, thinking it was a good decision. I should&#x27;ve done some research first. This shampoo claims to be &amp;#34;free of&amp;#34; several things, but is NOT. Sulfate free? Nope (it has an even harsher than usual one). Gluten free? Not at all. I don&#x27;t really care, but it bothers me when companies make false claims about the ingredients in their products. I also saw a significant number of reviews where people claimed they experienced hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for two months and my hair has rapidly become dull, brittle, and thin. I&#x27;m losing about a handful of hair every day in the shower and from brushing. I&#x27;ve never had hair loss like this in my entire life. My middle part is looking like it&#x27;s balding and my bangs are no longer full. My ends are wispy because of all the breakage. I&#x27;m 21 and I got my first gray hairs... I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the conditioner that is causing all of this. It could be either or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot think of any other explanation for the sudden change in my hair. My diet and lifestyle have not changed and I have always had naturally beautiful hair that is easy to care for. I can use almost anything on my hair. I started using cheap drug store shampoo again and things are already looking better. I&#x27;m almost certain this product is what destroyed my hair. It has me wondering if I&#x27;m allergic or sensitive to something in it, or if other people just don&#x27;t realize how much damage this shampoo/conditioner could be causing underneath the mask of their other hair products.</li>
    <li> It was very messy , the conditioner had spilled out.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for my hair, i recommend to anybody with thick long hair and also gives plenty of volume if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and the conditioner. Definitely keeps your hair light. Only downfall is that if you use together or either of them daily, your hair becomes very dry.</li>
    <li> The product advertised did not reflect for color treated hair yet that is what was received.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was purple leading me to believe it is a fake product</li>
