      <li>Fun bracelets.  </li>
      <li>loving my bracelets they look just like the picture, they arrived right well before the shipping date they stated, i will definitely do business with the co. again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is amazing how the quality is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>The reason that I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars is because the bracelet does not close securely and easily opens and can fall off.  </li>
      <li>I have the white &amp; black and they are both beautiful!!!  </li>
      <li>I will also note that I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear many types of metals but this seems to be made of stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely rose gold color, not gold, and only gets 3 stars because it really doesn&#x27;t look like the photo.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how good they actually look.</li>
      <li>Though I would be willing to pay a little more if they held up better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually purchase knockoffs but this one was amazing!</li>
      <li>Looks just like real!</li>
      <li>frm the pprevious item that i order exactly as shown n</li>
      <li>This bracelet is identical to the real thing with all the right markings.  </li>
      <li>They look pretty close to the real thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im really satisfied.im</li>
      <li>but I am a male and they fit.</li>
      <li>Which really takes away from the look of the bracelet.  </li>
      <li>For those who are like minded, you will really like the bracelet(s).</li>
      <li>I am not trying to pass this off as the real deal.</li>
      <li>You gently turn the H to the side and it opens up.</li>
      <li>The real one is $650.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not trying to fool anyone with these and don&#x27;t care if anyone wants to know if they are real, I just like the look and don&#x27;t want to pay a lot for an item like this.</li>
      <li>It is very very similar to the original one.</li>
      <li>Had to give to my girlfriend because of how small it is but very nice looking, make larger size for men</li>
      <li>These are not true to the normal size of an authentic H bracelet, it is much smaller and the plastic is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve managed to fix them and they&#x27;re still in decent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Looks good but they open so easy the white one broken from the H the first time i tried to wear it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>and i would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>The mstirial is so cheap that the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; color is taking other color</li>
      <li>I just wanted some stackable bracelets that I could wear with my watch or other arm candy and these fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Love them but becarful there ment for people with small wrist</li>
      <li>I have white gold turquoise and a pretty canary color.</li>
      <li>I need to be super careful and mindful</li>
      <li>The discription isnt clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again, not bad for the price especially cause you get both black and white, but you really have to take care of them.</li>
      <li>It could &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; fit a small child.</li>
      <li>I have a real H bracelet and was curious about this one.</li>
      <li>They have held up after several wears so far</li>
      <li>First of all i was little bit dissapointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are not true to the normal size of an authentic H bracelet, it is much smaller and the plastic is cheaply made. The clasp doesn&#x27;t stay shut so it always fell off... I threw them out. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Looks just like real! Great quality</li>
    <li> Beautiful but falls off many times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Had to give to my girlfriend because of how small it is but very nice looking, make larger size for men</li>
    <li> Black and rose gold love it</li>
    <li> The Bracelets do not stay locked!  I cannot wear them</li>
    <li> perfect . I love this</li>
    <li> Beautiful bracelets. They go with everything. I want more! Please let me know when you have more for sale. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fits small, however my wrists are very small. Great look, did take 2 months to receive.</li>
    <li> The metal is not a yellow gold.  Which really takes away from the look of the bracelet.  I probably won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> It is very very similar to the original one. For the price is an excelent deal considering that the original one cost 10x.</li>
    <li> First of all i was little bit dissapointed i thought  they come 2pair just like as shown on the pict.:( thats all. N this is not only the itemor product  i&#x27;ve order frm the pprevious item that i order exactly as shown n Im really satisfied.im so sorry:(</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! I was quite skeptical to buy a knock off especially from amazon but it was great quality and looks extremely real. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments and no one assumes it&#x27;s a knock off. Looking to purchase another one!</li>
    <li> I have a real H bracelet and was curious about this one. Actually great and a perfect gift. Probably would buy another</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for the price. The real one is $650. The only flaw if you you were going to inspect it, and I mean really inspect it up close to your eye,  is that the H is a little thicker at the ends of the letter. also the black enamel is 1mm to far from the end of the bracelet. There is a gap between the bracelet ends and enamel</li>
    <li> The braclet is very nice fits perfect to luv it i would defiantly get the white one to for summer time</li>
    <li> I just wanted some stackable bracelets that I could wear with my watch or other arm candy and these fit the bill. They have held up after several wears so far and the gold is a good quality color of gold, not to butter-yellow, you know? So, I say go for it. I&#x27;m not trying to fool anyone with these and don&#x27;t care if anyone wants to know if they are real, I just like the look and don&#x27;t want to pay a lot for an item like this. Still, people never question whether they are real and people who should know have thought they were the real deal, so if you want to pass them off, I don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong for the price. Save money on your bracelets so you can buy a nicer handbag:)</li>
    <li> Too small but still pretty</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how good they actually look. I dont have huge wrists but I am a male and they fit. However, i don&#x27;t see them fitting some of my friends. If you are big or got big arms then probably would pass unless you can get a size that fits for your measurements.</li>
    <li> it arrived before they said and it was just as the photo, quality and nice finish to it  , i love it and i would highly recommend it.  Great bangle  for all occasions.</li>
    <li> Too small! This won&#x27;t fit anyone! Should have mentioned length, and the fact that it has to slide on. There is no closure option.</li>
    <li> LOVE these bracelets!  I have the white &amp; black and they are both beautiful!!!  I&#x27;ve worn them a handful of times and they seem to be good quality.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t say what size/diameter the bracelet is. The bracelet fits small thin wrists.</li>
    <li> This bracelet is identical to the real thing with all the right markings.  I was so pleased with it when it arrived. It looks and feels expensive.  The reason that I&#x27;m giving it only 3 stars is because the bracelet does not close securely and easily opens and can fall off.  I need to be super careful and mindful whenever I wear it that I will not lose it.  Other than that I would have given it 100 stars if I could.  It arrived before expected as well.  I will also note that I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear many types of metals but this seems to be made of stainless steel.  That was also a big plus for me.  Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually purchase knockoffs but this one was amazing! I highly recommend it. Shiny gold and beautiful black, just perfect for my small wrist!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of the colors. They look pretty close to the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a few weeks to come but I was expecting that. I wanted the black&lt;br /&gt;since I have white gold turquoise and a pretty canary color. they look nice stacked. just 2</li>
    <li> loving my bracelets they look just like the picture, they arrived right well before the shipping date they stated, i will definitely do business with the co. again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> They look great and good buy for the price. Though I would be willing to pay a little more if they held up better. The H which is the lock is really delicate. I&#x27;ve had it break off the band and it&#x27;s even fallen off my wrist randomly, a few times. I&#x27;ve managed to fix them and they&#x27;re still in decent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, not bad for the price especially cause you get both black and white, but you really have to take care of them.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is a cheap imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this, it looks like a dollar bracelet</li>
    <li> I love it! It is amazing how the quality is exactly the same. I read the low reviews and I don&#x27;t know what they got! Message to the seller! Please provide me with all the colors! Yellow, red, pink, white, green, blue!!! I want it all!</li>
    <li> there are fakes in sth.</li>
    <li> awesome, can&#x27;t wait to go out to wear them, they look gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Its a little smaller than I expected can&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
    <li> My order came in but only one bracelet came in I was supposed to get to  bracelets I got ripped of!!!</li>
    <li> Poor quality, latch constantly comes undone.</li>
    <li> heavy and look very good even has a nice logo inside</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but it&#x27;s too small</li>
    <li> For the other reviewers- it is NOT a slide on. You gently turn the H to the side and it opens up. My wrist are extra small so it was roomy. But if you have a size 8&amp;#34; or up wrist its not going to fit. You might be able to get away with a size 8&amp;#34; wrist. Its beautifully made and looks identical to what&#x27;s real. It even has the writing-just perfect. Its GOLD. Not rose gold.. I ordered them and received the black one. I love it. My only quam is it says Black+White so idk if I was supposed to receive both?...</li>
    <li> Fun bracelets.  Actually got two and wasn&#x27;t expecting that!  Nice weight and finish.  Friends with real ones were impressed!</li>
    <li> Looks good but they open so easy the white one broken from the H the first time i tried to wear it</li>
    <li> The discription isnt clear. I thought it came with 2 bracelets</li>
    <li> The mstirial is so cheap that the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; color is taking other color</li>
    <li> I love love this bracelet.  It&#x27;s beautiful quality and looks like the real thing.  if you are looking for a fashionable bracelet, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Love them but becarful there ment for people with small wrist</li>
    <li> Perfect shipped quickly!  I absolutely love them!!!! Would buy again!!</li>
    <li> At first when I got this I thought it was awful quailty but after wearing it for a long time its AMAZING. It hasn&#x27;t scratched up at ALL and nothing has faded off. For me its the PERFECT size but others may need a larger size. GREAT I LOVE IT. AMAZING KNOCK OFF</li>
    <li> My only negative is I wish it was a little bigger. I do have oarge wrists and it is tight, It looks very nice and is good quality. I ordered it in white too. I would wear them both more if they were more comfortable ( larger)</li>
    <li> It was way too small. It could &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; fit a small child. Also was a rose gold color.</li>
    <li> One of the bracelet it&#x27;s broken .. not happy</li>
    <li> I ordered the black bracelet, and was pleasantly surprised that I got both the white and black. I know some people stated they only got one. I&#x27;m not sure if it varies based on who is shipping out that day? Also, mine did have the replica Hermes engraving on the inside. It is definitely rose gold color, not gold, and only gets 3 stars because it really doesn&#x27;t look like the photo. Either way, I still like the look of the bracelet. I am not trying to pass this off as the real deal. For those who are like minded, you will really like the bracelet(s).</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, compared to others sold here on amazon.  I am planning to buy more!</li>
    <li> they look like awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> as good as the real thing</li>
</ol>
