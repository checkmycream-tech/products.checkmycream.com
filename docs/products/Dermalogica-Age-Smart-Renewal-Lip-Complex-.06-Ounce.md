      <li>Does cause some peeling at first but gets better the longer you use it.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this with the trial size Age Smart Kit and fell in love.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I love Dermalogica Age Smart products and this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>thank u dermalogica for producing such a good products</li>
      <li>This is such a good lip gloss.</li>
      <li>and it really solved my problem aft using it for 2 weeks :)</li>

      <li>If your lips are in great shape I&#x27;m not sure you can truly appreciate how well and quickly this product works, but, for me, it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I finally finished the whole thing but honestly will not purchase again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light yet lasts thru the night keeping my lips soft &amp; moist.</li>
      <li>but I could have just used Vaseline, really!</li>
      <li>I loved the product but it was a little pricey for the size!</li>
      <li>no where did it say to remove it--but full disclosure of directions isn&#x27;t like it used to be in the old days.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feel good but not magical</li>
      <li>Age Smart Renewal works wonders and stays put.</li>
      <li>really moisturizes-</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very steep price.</li>
      <li>Really like this lip treatment and my lips</li>
      <li>This lip treatment is really hydrating and leaves</li>
      <li>Have tried absolutely everything.</li>
      <li>It works very well with my lips after the laser treatment.</li>
      <li>and i find it very healing for my lips.  </li>
      <li>I got this along with other items from this brand, I love all of it.  </li>
      <li>I love lots of other dermalogica products but this one did not do anything for me.</li>
      <li>But ever since I used this product, my lips look amazing and no more crack.</li>
      <li>and I like the applicator as it fits and applies better then the typical lip treatment</li>
      <li>After trying many products, this one is the only one I now utilize because it works and only needs to be applied 2 - 3</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically just an overpriced wanna-be in fancy packaging with a high price.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>You twist it up to just get what you need and it comes out of little holes on the top so it won&#x27;t make a mess under the top.  </li>
      <li>So - it&#x27;s not like a stick of chapstick- more like a vaseline in little dots.  </li>
      <li>My lips always dry and crack specially in winter time.</li>
      <li>I love Age Smart Renewal Lip Complex.  </li>
      <li>The quality is fine, but I won&#x27;t buy it again; it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
      <li>I used it only at night, before turning out the light, and the tube didn&#x27;t even last 2 months.</li>
      <li>It makes your lips very soft.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips very soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very soft product</li>
      <li>Saw much better results with a $2 small Vaseline for lips product.</li>
      <li>so this was a huge let down for me.  </li>
      <li>it is clear but</li>
      <li>At least it has a better flavor than Dermalogica&#x27;s \\&quot;climate control lip treatment\\&quot;, that crud tastes HORRID and needs to be reapplied frequently to keep your lips semi moist.  </li>
      <li>But, Dermalogica keeps my lips soft, they haven&#x27;t been chapped since I started using this product.</li>
      <li>I love this Lip Complex -</li>
      <li>a nice gloss look behind</li>
      <li>Covers lips very smoothly and last a long time verses other lip moisturizers that wear off in minutes.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes or benefits that would make this lip product better than other, cheaper lip treatments.  </li>
      <li>a motorcylce and dry lips is a real problem</li>
      <li>I found this when searching for an alternative to DDF&#x27;s Glossy Lip Treatment (as it has apparently been discontinued).  </li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate (Colorado) and always seem to have chapped lips.  </li>
      <li>I apply @ bedtime and first thing in the morning, and mid-day if they&#x27;re feeling dry due to a lipstick I have on.  </li>
      <li>I got so far as I hv very dry lips</li>
      <li>Great product and much less expensive via Amazon over the Salon!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I guess this is the best lip blam I got so far as I hv very dry lips and it really solved my problem aft using it for 2 weeks :) thank u dermalogica for producing such a good products</li>
    <li> This lip treatment is really hydrating and leaves a nice gloss look behind I use it in place of chapstick and sometimes underneath my lipgloss. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> great texture, keeps lips hydrated, but too gleamy, glossy for me for day time, excellent for bedtime. lips are smooth when waking up.:)</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this with the trial size Age Smart Kit and fell in love. It came at a time when my poor lips were in horrible shape and within 2 nights they were completely healed and looked plumper because they were again hydrated! If your lips are in great shape I&#x27;m not sure you can truly appreciate how well and quickly this product works, but, for me, it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s very steep price. And because of it&#x27;s price point I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d necessarily use it as an everyday lip balm, but it&#x27;s a miracle for cracked, dry lips!</li>
    <li> Covers lips very smoothly and last a long time verses other lip moisturizers that wear off in minutes. at $26 a stick it&#x27;s a great buy. Keep lips moist in the driest of conditions.</li>
    <li> After spending, I don&#x27;t know, ABOUT 30 BUCKS yes I expected a miracle. but I could have just used Vaseline, really! If you wanna know how it works, have you ever used Vaseline on your lips? There you go.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging of this- it is great.  You twist it up to just get what you need and it comes out of little holes on the top so it won&#x27;t make a mess under the top.  So - it&#x27;s not like a stick of chapstick- more like a vaseline in little dots.  No color- it is clear but really moisturizes- it isn&#x27;t waxy on your lips.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for years and i find it very healing for my lips.  would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;k.</li>
    <li> I loved the product but it was a little pricey for the size! I would buy again if they lowered the price.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip treatment and my lips do look and feel much better. Does cause some peeling at first but gets better the longer you use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with dry and peeling lips and have tried every product out there with very little results. THIS is the stuff. I apply every night at bedtime and my lips are soft, smooth, and no longer peel! Yes!</li>
    <li> It feels nice and I like the applicator as it fits and applies better then the typical lip treatment but I didn&#x27;t notice any other changes or benefits that would make this lip product better than other, cheaper lip treatments.  I like it but not sure I would spend this much again.</li>
    <li> i love this for my lips , i use it at night , since it is not colored , and i wake up with nice soft lips ! it can be worn during the day , but i like color to lips for the day time ! other than it not having color it has no flaw !</li>
    <li> My lips always dry and crack specially in winter time. But ever since I used this product, my lips look amazing and no more crack. Thank you Dermalogica for this great product.</li>
    <li> It makes your lips very soft. Love the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT AT NIGHT TIME</li>
    <li> This is such a good lip gloss. I love Dermalogica Age Smart products and this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I got this along with other items from this brand, I love all of it.  It is great for my skin type, which is combo, but extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> Keeps your lips sooth and conditioned in the harsh winter months skiing the Colorado Rockies. Great over lip stain in the summer too to give you some definition to you lips.</li>
    <li> Thick serum that softens lips</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this overpriced so-called \\&quot;renewal lip complex\\&quot;.  I found this when searching for an alternative to DDF&#x27;s Glossy Lip Treatment (as it has apparently been discontinued).  It has no staying power whatsoever, Carmex would serve better as an exfoliator for your lips than this crud.  It&#x27;s basically just an overpriced wanna-be in fancy packaging with a high price.  I am not one to shy away from spending $20 and up for a product that works well, but this is not it.  At least it has a better flavor than Dermalogica&#x27;s \\&quot;climate control lip treatment\\&quot;, that crud tastes HORRID and needs to be reapplied frequently to keep your lips semi moist.  All in all, I am not impressed at all with Dermalogica&#x27;s product line.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I finally finished the whole thing but honestly will not purchase again. I love lots of other dermalogica products but this one did not do anything for me. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I love Age Smart Renewal Lip Complex.  It&#x27;s light yet lasts thru the night keeping my lips soft &amp; moist.</li>
    <li> I usually like Dermalogica products, despite their cost, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again. It&#x27;s a very soft product so goes on a little thick. I used it only at night, before turning out the light, and the tube didn&#x27;t even last 2 months. The quality is fine, but I won&#x27;t buy it again; it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
    <li> There is nothing that can compare to this product when it comes to keeping your lips moisturized.  After trying many products, this one is the only one I now utilize because it works and only needs to be applied 2 - 3 times/day maximum.  I apply @ bedtime and first thing in the morning, and mid-day if they&#x27;re feeling dry due to a lipstick I have on.  Other lip moisturizes I&#x27;ve tried needed constant re-application.  I highly recommend this for those looking for a good moisturizer for your lips.</li>
    <li> Second time buying it. i have bought about 10 of these in total. authentic for sure. I suggested to my mom and friends and everybody loved it. That is why i bought more. it is cheaper than the stores and spa. It will protect your lips and stop them from cracking.</li>
    <li> I love this lip treatment - have been buying it for years.  Great to find it on Amazon a lot cheaper than what I have been paying.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love how easy it is to apply with the lip stick style tube.  Keeps lips from drying and cracking.</li>
    <li> i feel that this product did not live up to it&#x27;s promise. I was expecting &amp;#34;age smart renewal complex&amp;#34; and all this is is vaseline in an annoying hard to use wind up messy applicator.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from a beauty supply store and on amazon.  Identical.  Sometimes amazon has rip-off&#x27;s but not this time.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve always had severely chapped lips, and two or three applications of this a day keeps my lips soft and supple throughout the day, even in harsh weather.</li>
    <li> This is the second order I purchased. This lip treatment is very hydrating and leaves a nice gloss. It keeps my lips very soft. I use it in the morning and at night. It works very well with my lips after the laser treatment. Thank you Dermalogica! I would highly recommend this product. This is the best I ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I use this befor I go to bed</li>
    <li> I use this daily and my lips have never looked so good! They appear smoother and it tastes good too!</li>
    <li> This treatment is great for lips.  I use it at night to make the fine lines soften and to keep them from being chapped.  I don&#x27;t totally love the scent, but the texture is great and I think it does work to make lips look great.</li>
    <li> I love this Lip Complex - I have tried every other over the counter lip product and nothing compares to Dermalogica.  I live in a very dry climate (Colorado) and always seem to have chapped lips.  But, Dermalogica keeps my lips soft, they haven&#x27;t been chapped since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the third order I purchased. Lasts long and makes our lips softer. I liked it because It does what it says.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lip product. I use twice a day and have noticed a difference I. The moisture on my lips.</li>
    <li> I have always had the driest lips. Have tried absolutely everything. Lipsticks always looked horrible. This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever tried. My lips feel amazing for hours.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Dermalogica Fan so this was a huge let down for me.  It&#x27;s far too greasy for any use but bed time, the packaging is awkward and tends to seep out into the cap.</li>
    <li> dermalogica products are always a good investment as they do work. i use this product because my lips are very dry and i see a difference overnight.</li>
    <li> did not do anything for my chapped lips. To me it&#x27;s not worth the money I spent. Saw much better results with a $2 small Vaseline for lips product.</li>
    <li> Great product and much less expensive via Amazon over the Salon! I ride a motorcylce and dry lips is a real problem Age Smart Renewal works wonders and stays put.</li>
    <li> Feel good but not magical</li>
    <li> The product goes on smooth and stays on for a good time. I have used an other product with honey before and for the price difference I would not get it again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years - under lipstick or by itself.  It&#x27;s great. Packaging is handy and easy to carry in your pocket.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and the Dermologica product line.  My skin looks and feels so much better.  As of 8/2014, I&#x27;ve been using Dermologica products for about 6 weeks.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin.  I look forward to using this line for a long time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Winter, the time to buy this product.  The rest of your face may get chapped &amp; dry, but your lips will remain soft &amp; moist no matter how cold it gets. :)</li>
    <li> This product had a plastic cover on it, once you removed the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never seen a product with a plastic cap over the contents of the product and looked at the literature enclosed and no where did it say to remove it--but full disclosure of directions isn&#x27;t like it used to be in the old days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I called the nitwit company that I bought it from, as referenced above, and they told me to cut it off.  WRONG...!  I ended up damaging the product and trying to apply it was useless so I wrote to the company and requested a refund.  They refused and told me to contact the mfg.  I wrote back and told them it was THEIR responsibility because they told me falsely to cut the plastic covering (the punch line follows and it was well worth reading the preceding).  Then they wrote and asked me to send them a PICTURE of the item they sold me!!!!  TG Amazon refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, product does moisturize your lips and  does last a long time, but it&#x27;s too soon to say whether or not it actually enlarged my lips.  I&#x27;ll follow up in several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the product I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars...you can guess what I rated Beautogen who was the middle man in this scenario.</li>
