<ol>
    <li> Great product.  I like this better than the $40 Kiehls eye cream I have. It&#x27;s nice and light, but very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I bought it at Walgreens. They had a sale... I pat water under my eyes and then apply the product and it instantly plumps up the skin. Hyuralaunic acid will not work without water...</li>
    <li> It feels nice but no change in moisture level throughout the day and makes my mascara blot. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! I have super sensitive skin and have used numerous products that irritate my skin.This worked great!  I get especially nervous when trying things around my eyes. The last time I tried something new because of really dry skin, I bought an expensive product for sensitive skin. I woke up with swollen eyes. For some reason Neutrogena always seems to work for me! Tho it did burn just a little bit in a small area I had ezcema, it works great</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! I have stopped using regular moisturizer since buying this.  I use the face gel along with the eye gel and it leaves me feeling refreshed. It is not greasy.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Nothing really special.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s not greasy like so many eye creams but hydrates just as well, if not better.</li>
    <li> Helps to soften the lines around your eyes. I love it</li>
    <li> great neutrogena product</li>
    <li> Really great hydration around my eyes~  Don&#x27;t have to use anything else before applying my makeup now!&lt;br /&gt;TerryW&lt;br /&gt;Grove City, Ohio</li>
    <li> Noticed an almost instant difference!</li>
    <li> This product is a Godsend. I got this and the Regular HYdro Boost, Moisturizer, Both are Amazing Products!!!..I will be 40 next year and I promise you that I donot look it!!!...</li>
    <li> I chose this item because it was highly recommended in magazine.  I tried it and really  think it is a great product.  I can see a difference with the wrinkles under my eyes.  It did not remove them- but made them look smoother.  I plan to reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the whole Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel series.  I use three of the products and find each to make a real difference in the way my skin feels and looks.  The Eye Gel Cream keeps the areas around my eyes moist and firm.  I have used many eye creams before, but like this one the best.  Hope Neutrogena keeps this series for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this eye cream.  I think this is the best, most effective line of products that Neutrogena has ever produced.  It is also the best eye cream that I have used period.  It is absorbed quickly and my undereye area looks and feels better.  I&#x27;m on my third or fourth tube which says it all - I&#x27;ll try something but only stick with it if it works.</li>
    <li> This eye gel cream is pretty terrible.  I bought it without looking at the description closely.  It&#x27;s scented, so I can&#x27;t use it freely around my eyes because it burns if I get it in my eyes.  I don&#x27;t want to throw it away, so I am trying to use it carefully below my eyes, but it&#x27;s been a week and I see no difference in the color or puffiness.</li>
    <li> I use only Neutrogena products on my face (very sensitive skin) and love them.  Unfortunately, this eye gel has raised small bumps on the skin around my eyes when I use it.  I will need to try a different eye cream.</li>
    <li> This product is just amazing, I really love the feel in my eye area, no sticky, and do the job!</li>
    <li> this eye gel is hydrating and cheap, but it offers no other benefits. good deal over all.</li>
    <li> Look at the ingridients people. It is the EXACT SAME as the gel CREAM for the face (of the same line) you get 3x more product for the same price.</li>
