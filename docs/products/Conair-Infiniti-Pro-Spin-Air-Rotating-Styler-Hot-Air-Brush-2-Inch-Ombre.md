<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The styler works great! The only reason I gave 4 starts and not 5 is because of the brush size. I wish it came with different (smaller) diameter brushes as well to accommodate for shorter hair style users as well.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed is that my hair is more freezy when I use this dryer/comb vs my regular blow dry and hand held brush. SO, I would like to see the bristles on the brush be more metallic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great feature is that the brush rotates in both directions, so if some hair is caught on the brush, it is easily entangled.</li>
    <li> Great, does not hold your hair very tightly so the curl is loose, but you can do great things to your hair  with it if you focus.</li>
    <li> If I could give a negative score I would . Huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, it takes a little getting used to (the spinning) but there are many ways it can be used. If I want a lot of curl I use the low spin, roll and hold it longer, for a straighter more volume look I use hi and no spin and just add a curl at the ends. Works well, would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and wonderful for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not capable of doing my hair at all! I got this little guy. Did my hair and literally the first person I saw asked if I had a blow out. Miracle do happen!</li>
    <li> My mom gave me this as a present and I like it for the most part. I have super thick and long hair so the first couple of times I tried it, it took forever. However, the learning curve was really easy for me to grasp. I like that it doesn&#x27;t rotate automatically, and often times I do not rotate it at all. The bristles are really soft so I have to do thin sections to make sure that it grips my hair. My hair looks softer and shinier after using this product compared to my old blow drier. Make sure to keep the cover and don&#x27;t throw it out with the box. Always put the cover on after use to prevent the bristles from flattening. I found that for my long hair, I let my hair air dry for a while or blow dry it quickly with a regular blow drier then style it with this brush. It ends up taking the same amount of time to only dry my hair 50%. That is my only complaint. Decent price, especially if you have never purchased one before.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> I loved the product but with less than a month of use has stopped spinning, but does not turn heats, having bought on amazon do not know where to complain.</li>
    <li> Dirty item.  Do not want to even touch it</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s way bigger than i expected</li>
    <li> This product style my hair very easy and fast, I Have a long hair and this is not a problem .. is big for a travel, but in home works very good</li>
    <li> This works great with straight hair. It&#x27;s not as easy as explained at first but you get the hang of it. Gets really hot. My hair looks shiny when I use this. I don&#x27;t get as much volume as I expected. I don&#x27;t like how I have to first dry my hair before I use it though, because it doubles my styling time.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I like it. I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it again given the chance. It has allot of power so when operating, you must have a strong grip, or the machine will pull your hair and you will get it all tangled. One thing I don&#x27;t like is, it isn&#x27;t as controlled as the woman in the videos make it seem. It just spins and I have to maneuver my hair all the time. Its okay, but you can do better with a blow dryer and a brush</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I was so excited to use it. I have a long fine hair and it works wonderful. The styler is quite big but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. However my hair got tangled a lot if I don&#x27;t section my hair well. I love that it rotates.</li>
    <li> This tool is excellent and works very well for my fine, limp, chin length wavy hair. It adds volume and gives it a nice smooth finish. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Brush cannot hold hair to swirl. The type of bristles and the position of buttons are worthless.  Great idea but needs improvement</li>
    <li> I thought this spin brush was great and it gave me that salon blown-dry look! It does take me as much time as it would to blow dry and straighten my hair but I think it is worth the time it takes!</li>
    <li> love it, use it every day! Recommend for short to long hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;already recommended to some friends.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst products!!! Every time I went to have it spin my hair it just tangled my hair!  It is big and very difficult to hold and use!! Definitely would not recommend this Conair product</li>
    <li> this product Infinitipro Spin Air Ratating Styler is very easy, not heavy, fix my hair vary fast. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> It is a great hair dryer. My formerly short, now medium length hair, was looking frumpy. Not any more. This hair dryer gives it that &amp;#34;just been to the hairdresser look.&amp;#34; And it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is similar to the one they are now advertising on TV but with a much cheaper price tag .. and it does a great job.  Worth buying.</li>
    <li> Volume, extra shine, and blow dry fresh out the shower with no product I love this thing.</li>
    <li> A friend of my wife has one and highly recommended it, so I ordered one for her.  Now she doesn&#x27;t use it much, but I do (my hair is much longer than hers).  The rotating brush has sufficient power but air flow seems to be lacking.  I had to experiment with it but now I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a faster and easier way to dry and style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Three things:&lt;br /&gt;1. I tried to use it to dry, it didnt work. I had to brush and dry all the hair with a regular blow drier before using the product.&lt;br /&gt;2. After having the hair completely dry, I used this product to style and give a better finish to the edges, and it was a big frustration. The brush is so floppy that it folds when it touches the hair. And my hair is straight. I can only imagine how bad it is for those who have curly hair trying to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;3. I even tried to use it after coming back from the salon, just to keep the style they had done there but again it didnt work. Not even to keep what was already done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not hot enough, it is only 110V and its not powerfull enough.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is floppy. Its really not portable. It is a big piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned mine after 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have really really (did I say really?) short hair it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been watching this for months -- in super market, on Conair product page, on amazon, etc. It seems working amazingly for most consumers however unluckily not me. My permanent perm-pressed straight hair (not naturally straight) could be the reason for failure. This styler can hardly style my hair. They are still straight without any beautiful curves after completely blow-to-dry. Besides it&#x27;s obviously more fuzzy compared to  the performance of ordinary hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to return after two trials then reported honestly to amazon and they accepted my return. The service is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got really poofy hair. Like, OMG it&#x27;s perpendicular to the floor poof! This is easy to use (once you get used to it) and though it&#x27;s not the fastest, makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve been to the salon for a blow out. Other sizes would be nice though.</li>
    <li> I moved to a city where a wash and set will run at a minimum $45 which is a bit much every week.  So I started doing my hair myself and wound up damaging my hair in every way possible.  Then I found this gem and I am ecstatic.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to cause damage to your hair but gives just the right amount of heat to get the job done.  It gives your hair a nice little curl and shine when used with the right products.  I recommended this to all my friends because that&#x27;s how much I love it!</li>
    <li> I cannot express how amazing this product is. I have thick hair that can be very difficult to handle at time. I have tried so many products out there and nothing is like this rotating brush. you have full control of the brush and you can rotate it in 2 directions and it&#x27;s not too hot. Hair is going to be as close as a salon finish but that&#x27;s up to you. You have control over the heat levels or if you want the cool air, you have that option too. I can&#x27;t begin to explain how easy it is to use and you will get great results. the price is great too.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see how this product would work as the reviews were good and the product videos were awesome. But it didnt work the way they show in the demo. My hair is wavy, so I thought this product would work wonderful with my type hair. But actually it didnt.&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking it would straighten my hair and create big curls towards the bottom as they showed on the video, it does creates some curls but no straightening for sure. Infact the auto swirl tangles my hair and it becomes messy, instead of looking straight and nice, it becomes worse.</li>
    <li> Best hairstyling tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Good bye blow dryer and curling irons!</li>
    <li> Its ok. It doesn&#x27;t really work for long hair but I expected much... It smooths FlyAway&#x27;s though</li>
    <li> i have long, layered, naturally wavy hair, the longest part hits below my bra line. a friend of mine ordered one and told me about it. i wanted to give it a shot since the price was reasonable. i dont straighten my hair every day but when i do it&#x27;s a 2 step process - blow dry then flat iron. the flat iron def flattens. this tool straightens but add body &amp; silkiness. i also love how it doesnt make my hair stick straight.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer now but was ready to send it back after the first use.  There was definitely a learning curve for me but really glad I kept at it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It saves time stress and money. With it, there is no need for any trips to the salon when I am on vacation, no need for hair dryer, all I need is a good leave in conditioner and I am all set. Did I mention that I can add curls to my hair with it as well? It is the perfect hair tool.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, this is not the right styler for you! Your hair will never look straight with this simple styler. It is not enough hot to straight up your hair. However, once you have them straight, you can give them form using the spin air rotating.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer takes a little getting used to, but it makes drying my hair a breeze. I have really thick hair, so it still takes quite a while to dry my hair, but this makes it less stressful to get a finished look. Still experimenting with products...</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST MACHINE THAT I USED EVER I LOVE IT, A HAVE TO MUCH HAIR AND THIS MACHINE IS AMAZING I LOOK THE SAME AT THE MODEL IN THE VIDEO I LOVE MY HAIR I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS, IT HAVE TO BE CONAIR &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ES LA MEJOR MÁQUINA QUE HE USADO PARA CEPILLAR MI CABELLO LO AMÉ, TENGO BASATANTE CABELLO Y EL CEPILLO FUNCIONA SUPER BIEN, EN VERDAD MI CABELLO SE VE COMO LA MODELO DEL VIDEO AMÉ EL RESULTADO DE MI CABELLO, TENÍA QUE SER CONAIR &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> For the first time ever, I do not have to use a flat iron on my hair after drying.  My hair has a tendency to be frizzy after blow drying.  I would either have to use a flat iron or the old fashion rollers and let my hair air dry.  I loved the way my hair looked after having it styled and blow out with a dryer and brush by my hairdresser.  I was never able to achieve the same results, as I could not hold a blow dryer and roller brush at the same time.  This gives me beautiful results.  I wish they would make a model that offered a variety of brush head sizes.  After a recent hair cut, the roller was too large to for my hair.  However, I love this spin brush so much, I bought a spare.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Exceeded my expectations.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Fast shipping.  Does a great job and hair is shiny and looks great</li>
    <li> After searching and searching for the perfect one-handed blow dryer for my hair, I found the Conair Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  I read some reviews before I bought it, and was initially put off by complaints about the anemic air flow, but decided to give it a try anyway.  My hair is long and tends to frizz, so I&#x27;ve been searching for a one-handed dryer that will not only dry quickly without drying my hair to straw, but straighten at the same time.  I&#x27;ve used the Conair Infiniti Pro Wet/Dry Hot Air Styler for a while now and am happy with it---I love Conair&#x27;s products in general---but the rotating feature was the one thing that would really make styling my hair so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I finally did take a chance on it---the big 2\\&quot; inch round barrel is perfect for the length of my hair, and the bi-directional spinning combined with more powerful air and faster spin on the high setting gets the job done.  The only BIG complaint I have is that the bristles are WAY too soft---they need to be stiffer in order to pull the hair better to straighten it and not become useless in a short time, or at the very least there should be a replacement brush.  Generally, it&#x27;s a good product and reasonably priced, but tweak it with much stronger bristles and you&#x27;ve got a real winner!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Dual rotation, it there are two buttons to rotate the brush in both directions, making it convenient for lefties and righties.&lt;br /&gt;2. Travel easy, so much easier to pack than the oblong hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;3. The bristles are soft&lt;br /&gt;4. Cord is long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. YANKS on hair! I was told that when you spin the brush close to the roots (for volume) that it would not &#x27;catch&#x27; your hair and yank.....it did. And it hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you have thin hair, or are concerned about hair loss, you will find A LOT of hair in this brush&lt;br /&gt;3. The COOL setting does not allow the brush to spin&lt;br /&gt;4. The air doesn&#x27;t blow out strong enough, therefore, you have to dry your hair with a traditional blow dryer first, and style with this.&lt;br /&gt;5. Can&#x27;t control how fast it spins, when you&#x27;re on low -- it will spin slow. When you&#x27;re on high heat -- it will spin fast. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it and will continue to use it because it&#x27;s easier than traditionally blow-drying my hair which I hate.  But I have to be extremely careful so my hair doesn&#x27;t get yanked. This may not happen with people who have shorter hair.  My hair goes down to my mid back.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is awesome!  I have thin wavy hair and when I use this blow dryer I don&#x27;t have to do anything else to it.  It gives it body and style at the same time.  Goodbye curling iron!!</li>
    <li> I have thin, lank hair that wants to do its own thing, which is to flip every possible direction except where I want it. This styler dries and smooths my hair at the same time, gives it body and shine, and leaves it easy to manage all day. The curve it gives my chin-length bob is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t tangle even when I hit the wrong button and make the brush spin in the wrong direction. The more I&#x27;ve used it, the more intuitive the buttons have become so that finding the right one is just second nature now. This styler worked well for me when my hair was to my shoulders and it works well now that it&#x27;s chin length. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick or even medium hair, you will need to blow dry it to about 50-80% dry before using this spin air rotating styler. But for those of us with thin hair, this styler works to dry hair at the same time it styles it -- and that extra time on the spinning brush makes the style hold that much longer. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> This device was a gift to my mother that really loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The consequence is that my wife wants one too! So, it should be good.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.  The barrel is a bit large for shorter hair.  Hard to get the desired flip with shorter hair.  Mine hair is top sholder length.  My friend who has longer hair tired it and loved it.  It can be a bit confussing at first as to which way to spin brush to get the desired curl or flip, but after a couple of tries I got it.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is just too curly for this, but it pulled more hairs out (one at a time) that I could take. Also, the spin button is in an awkward spot and you can accidentally spin it when you don&#x27;t want to. I returned mine.</li>
    <li> I need to buy myself a back up of this.</li>
    <li> This is unbelievable! I have never loved my hair so much!</li>
    <li> It is a good product. However, I did not use it but couple of times. It pulls my hair somewhat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to master anything even remotely close to a professional looking blowout at home until I discovered this gem in Target next to the InStyler (my other styling must-have)&lt;br /&gt;This thing works great at giving you a bouncy smooth style with more volume and less heat then the Instyler.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Garbage. Stopped working after only a few uses. It took forever to do my hair with this anyway.</li>
    <li> I would have preferred to give this one 3.5 stars.  It leaves hair nice and silky.  I especially like how my ends came out.  It does take some getting used to.  It also does not have much wattage and,m therefore, it takes far too long to use.  My hair is quite long so I had to partially dry it with a blow dryer.  Even those with shorter hair will have to do this.  I think my length may have made it even more difficult to operate.  The bottom line for me was that it would take far too long to style my hair.  I am not sure why the wattage is so low.  I gave this to my daughter and she felt that hair tangles in it easily. (I did not really have that problem.) I don&#x27;t think it is worth the expense.  I liked to use it to finish the ends but that is a rather expensive appliance for just finishing ends.</li>
    <li> It is a torturing device painfully pulling your hair. If you don&#x27;t want to gradually lose your hair and being bald don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a nice for my 19-year old daughter have before she went back to school. Her aunt who has very similar hair uses a product called, &amp;#34;True Ceramic Pro&amp;#34; I was under the impression that it was a similar product and she&#x27;d have something that may work better. I don&#x27;t have any idea about these kinds of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these hair styling devices don&#x27;t work the same. I didn&#x27;t know that. She and her mom told me that her hair is too thick and the brush&#x27;s bristles are too soft. &amp;#34;Perhaps if the brush had harder bristles, maybe&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, they liked the fact that it was solidly built and had the weight of a good blow-dryer but it was not designed for women of color and/or women who have thicker, weighted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her mom suggested that maybe if a woman had her hair permed or &amp;#34;straightened&amp;#34;--to use a cultural vernacular--then this could work. Otherwise, they would have enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom since a friend recommended it to her. She LOVES it! She isn&#x27;t very coordinated so this was perfect.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life? This is exactly what I have been looking for. It styles my hair wonderfully and leaves my hair with a shine that it never gets with a dryer and brush. I think I will order a second one as a backup in case they decide to discontinue this model (I hope not). The only drawback is it has a little bigger barrel than I would like, but it still works great.</li>
    <li> The air that comes out of the brush is not too hot. I didn&#x27;t get the result I was expecting. In my case, it is so much faster to blow dry and flat ironing than just using the spin air brush.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely brilliant. I was contemplating for a while before I purchased this product . Did as much research as I could , looked up a million reviews and its definitely worth it. I have thick , long , dense , curly INDIAN hair!! You can imagine!! I have it cut in layers. It takes as much time as it did when I used the flat iron, but the good part is less damage from the heat. It does give more shine and feels smooth. It takes a while for my hair to dry so I used the spin brush with a blow dryer and it sped up the process. In all I am glad I purchased this product . Saves me a trip to the salon. Totally recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get tangled between the rotating brush and the handle. When it&#x27;s not pulling my hair it&#x27;s ok but I wouldn&#x27;t give up my normal blow dryer for it.</li>
    <li> This spin dryer has been great so far (3 days). It is not loud, and does really well at curling the hair. I have to apply almost no heat to style it after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> I considered sending this back without even trying it, afraid it would get tangled in my hair or take too long to style. What a pleasant surprise that it didn&#x27;t get tangled, and once my shoulder length hair was mostly dry, I was able to style it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the spin brush. Granite it isnt a hair dryer. I still use my hair dryer and then i use the spin brush. Not heavy and easy to use, and it does what i need it to. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have thin fine shoulder length hair with long layers.  This did nothing for me.  I can&#x27;t use these type of bristles.  I need the hard plastic bristles.  I was going to return it but let my friend give it a try.  Her hair is thicker and she loved how it worked.  Guess I did something wrong, who knows......  she bought it from me.  I will stick to my very old ConAir hot air brush with the plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic styling tool.  I have never been good at maneuvering a brush with a blow dryer.  This tool takes care of that for you....super easy to use.  No tangles....just great, smooth style or you can create curls if you have long hair.  Mine is chin length.</li>
    <li> I have fine medium length hair and this smoothes my hair but not the frizzies. I think it&#x27;s better for people with thicker hair. I didn&#x27;t have any problem learning the basics or getting hair caught.</li>
    <li> Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Style  I love this styler it is easy to use and gives you a Salon look</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy on your arms too!</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND LET ME USE HER INFINITIPRO TO STYLE MY HAIR FOR A WEDDING. THE RESULTS WERE AMAZING.  MY HAIR IS VERY FINE AND STARTING TO THIN. I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE RESULTS I OBTAINED.  MY HAIR IS SHORT TO MEDIUM LENGTH AND IT DID WELL WITH ALL THE LENGTHS.  EVEN MY BANGS WERE AWESOME, ABSOLUTELY NO TANGLING. MY HAIR LOOKED SO MUCH FULLER, SHINIER AND THICKER. AFTER WASHING MY HAIR I WILL APPLY A SMALL AMT. OF GEL AND LET IT PARTIALLY DRY BEFORE I STYLE IT.  I LOVED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I BOUGHT WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE KNOWING HOW FAIR AND HONEST AMAZON IS WITH THEIR RETURN POLICY IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY WITH IT.  LOVE THE INFINITIPRO AND LOVE AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I have long (past the middle of my back), curly, frizzy hair.  I used to use a flat iron or the instyler, but could only achieve straight, flat, lifeless hair.  I have used this spinbursh only a few times and I absolutely love it.  No frizz, smooth hair with loose, shiny curls.  I am not using any products on my hair anymore either with the exception of hairspray on my short bangs.  This product cut the time it takes me to do my hair in less than half.  I used to blow dry it for 10 minutes, then flat iron it for 30 minutes.  Now, I just use the spinbrush and it takes me 15 minutes, start to finish.  I can actually sleep later now and look better!!! I love this styler!!!!  My niece introduced me to this spinbrush and we both think it is worth every penny.  I will save the cost of this in a month by not using products in my hair.  My hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this healthy in years, since I color it and highlight it every couple of months.  Must have!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve used this product for four years now and I love it just as much today as I did four years ago. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it, my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck and I can make bouncy natural curls at the ends or make me hair completely straight.  If I could give it six stars, I would.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the Conair Infinitii brush/blow dryer. I have a straight layered cut about shoulder length, and this dryer dries, smooths, and styles my hair for a sleek healthy look. Very satisfied. I would give it a 5 if it had two switches (like my previous one) for controlling heat and high to low volume. This one has only the one switch.</li>
    <li> This dryer/styling brush has saved me about 10 minutes every morning. I have an artificial shoulder joint and this is lightweight and easy for me to use. And...my hair looks great! I love this thing.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hair tool I have ever bought. I creates amazing volume and extra shape! It creates real effects just like in the advertising video. If you have very thin and volume-less hair like me, a blow base could definitely help. Cheers!</li>
    <li> My hair is a little longer than chin length and naturally curly. I also consider myself hair-illiterate. I was struggling to use a hair dryer / round brush and it just wasn&#x27;t working for me. I was very frustrated. I received the Infinitipro last night and had to try it out - worked marvelously! I definitely need to practice to get the look I want to achieve but I most definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Hairbrushes is loosing every time when I used. My sine of bathroom is so messy with a little tiny black hair of hairbrushes. Also its very easy to tangle your hair if you do not learn how to use by video. Manual does not kindly to explain how to use. I WISH EACH HAIRBRUSHES STAY AT TOP CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME, Not at the beginning. I am disappointed to not easy to use / easy to maintenance.</li>
    <li> I looked at a lot of these rotating brushes before trying this, and I am more than thrilled with the product.  The key is to dry your hair 85% with a normal dryer first - you don&#x27;t have to style it... just get the moisture out from the roots up.  Then section off and finish with the spin brush.  I have medium length hair that is fine.  I have always dried my hair with a round brush.  When my husband retired, I told him he should at least help me since I still have to get up and go to work.  So for the longest time every morning he held the blow dryer on my round brush while I turned and turned and turned... My shoulders and arm would get so tired, but him working the blow dryer part helped tremendously.  Plus, I got compliments on my hair all the time.  But... since the day I brought the Infiniti Spin Air Brush a couple of months ago, I have not needed or even wanted his help one bit. This spin brush does just as good a job plus it&#x27;s kinda fun to do.  I still get compliements on my hair.  I am ordering a second one to keep in my gym bag for post-workout smoothing.  I know the girls in the locker room at the Y are gonna be asking me a million questions when they see it.  Poor husband.  Once again replaced by a small electrical appliance.  :-)</li>
    <li> I had been hesitant because I saw some iffy reviews but I gave it a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did. While it isn&#x27;t perfect it&#x27;s still great. I&#x27;ve never been very good at blow drying and using a round brush even though I have straight, shoulder length hair. This solves the problem. It&#x27;s better if you&#x27;re hair is almost dry, but so far I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was excited about using the Conair spin brush until.... the first time I used it. I washed and dried my hair. After about 15 minutes of use, the brush stopped working. The rotating part of the brush started to spin funny &amp; while trying to spin, started to shake, then stopped working all together. Sadly to say I only owned it for about a month. Other issues for me, were that the cord isn&#x27;t long enough, and the bristles are to soft. I was excited about it at first but now very disappointed. Sending it back for a full refund.</li>
    <li> great hair styling tool. I have medium length hair and it works great. does not tingle the hair!</li>
    <li> This product is really fantastic, and I get amazing results - it looks like I&#x27;ve just gone to get my hair blown dry when I use it. It makes my hair smooth and shiny, while giving it the little flair at the ends that I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve with just a blow dyer. It&#x27;s also really simple to use. Before purchasing it, I was scared that the spinning brush plus the heat controls might be too much for my hair, but the brush is surprisingly soft, which makes the spinning pretty gentle. I&#x27;ve gotten my hair only slightly caught in it once, but it was very easy to undo. Also, the heat settings are not really that hot. (So if you have quite curly hair and want them to be straight, you might want to pull it straight with a round brush and blow dryer first.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, however, will not replace any products you currently have (straightener, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.) - I find that because I have curly/wavy, thick hair, I still have to use the straightener for some of my hair if I want to achieve a straight look, especially at the roots of my hair where the SpinAir brush is less effective. Also, you can&#x27;t really use the SpinAir brush on wet or even damp hair. I find that it works best when I have already blow dried almost completely (so that it feels dry to the touch on the outside, but still feel very, very slightly wet in the under layers). Also, because I have thicker hair, I have to separate my hair into sections to use it, making it a little time consuming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a very positive person.  However, I don&#x27;t get it.  What is everybody raving about??  First of all, if you have frizzy, curly or wavy hair, this is not for you.  I had to blow dry my hair first, then flat iron, then use the rotating styler. It did not come out smooth, even when i used a smoothing product prior using the Styler. I get better results with a round brush and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is not hot enough.  It also leaves your hair with static electricity.  It \\&quot;did\\&quot; get stuck and tangle my hair, just not as bad as the Instyler did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would probably be good for people with straight, thin hair that is not frizzy.  Even then, a brush and blow dryer would give them better results, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.  In my opinion, this is just another ridiculus idea that someone came up with to make money.  Save your money and use a blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
    <li> I had Revlon Hot air brush for long time and happy with it, but I left it at a place where I was traveling, so I had to buy a new one. I was going through lots of reviews and found this one has lots of good review, so decided to give it a try. But, I found it as \\&quot;just OK\\&quot; for me to create volume. My old Revlon did much better. This Infinitipro is not powerful enough. My hair is still fall flat even after I used spin feature as the manufacturer recommend. It doesn&#x27;t create volume at all. If you are looking for volume, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The first 2 tries I hated it! It ripped so much of my hair out and didn&#x27;t use it for a whole month until I decided to give it another try and I&#x27;ve learned how to use it properly and love it :) it doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out anymore. It leaves my hair feeling soft shiny smooth and lots of volume/bouncy</li>
    <li> This styled is great!!  I have arthritis, so this is a Godsend for me....it&#x27;s perfect for me... one tool to dry &amp; style with one hand!!  I  just blow dry my hair until.it&#x27;s almost dry, use the styled to finish, &amp; it looks like I just stepped out of the salon!</li>
    <li> Good product! Facilitates life a lot!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Hair gets amazing after using it!</li>
    <li> Product has no power!&lt;br /&gt;Quality poor</li>
    <li> not what i expected, it is soft so will take a while to make the style especially if you have thick hair.</li>
    <li> This device is good in a pinch, but definitely not my go to. I am no good with a round brush and traditional hair dryer, so this device is great in that it allows me to get a pretty blowout from home. However, I feel that it damages my hair and is more trouble than it is worth. I have medium-long straight hair and I find that tit gets tangled up in the spinning brush way too easily even when it is brushed out first. I find that a lot of my hair is pulled out, so I would definitely not use it every day. Also, I notice that when I use it my hair ends up tangled all day long and I wind up having to brush it about once an hour just to be able to get my fingers through it. Also, having to wait until my hair is 90% dry already is inconvenient. My hair does look great when I use it so its definitely not a total loss! I get a nice bounce with plenty of volume and get many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;PS - my hair is medium-long, medium-thick, and naturally straight in case that helps anyone</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t spin on wet hair. Can however bump your hair once it is dry.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s awesome............I am  terrible at drying my hair, it&#x27;s very curly and frizzy, this really works great.&lt;br /&gt; I let my hair air dry a bit and while it&#x27;s damp, I then fix it with this Conair infiniti Pro for about 10 minutes and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;It smooth&#x27;s my hair and  gives it bounce and fullness.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so happy I bought this, it&#x27;s saving me money on getting my hair professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;This is actually my first review on any product, I thought it was worth sharing.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Fred Meyers.  Original price 49.99... on sale for 49.99.  Yes, you read that right.  I did find a coupon but I still paid more than if I waited and ordered it here with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;My hair?  Very straight, over shoulder, fine, processed blond (or I would be dirty grey)&lt;br /&gt;What I expected... lift and curl.&lt;br /&gt;What I got was sleek, barely curved, SHINY hair. It mimics what my hairstylist does when she dries my hair after a cut.  I did use &amp;#34;Ion&amp;#34; sprayed lightly.  It is a product that I got at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Really, really light and doesn&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it takes a few minutes to figure out and YES I am keeping it AND the receipt just in case the motor blows early.  It&#x27;s fairly powerful.  It&#x27;s a keeper.  : )</li>
    <li> Dows nothing for my hair. My hair is thick and wavy and it just makes it even worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised that not every women has this.  This styler does three things at once; it Dries, and brushes at same time.  I watched my wife using this frequently in the morning and it blow mys mind that other women don&#x27;t use this.  I almost feel like a guy invented this thing bc he got tired of waiting for his wife to get ready.  Anyways, very cool, very efficient.  One Con would be if the rotating styler somehow started messing up your hair bc your hair got tnagled.  Never seen this happen with my wife, but i assume it could?</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this brush, but like most theories, it is not good in practice, at least not for long thick hair. I have shoulder length thick wavy hair. I like blowing it out straight.The problem is the dryer inside the brush works to give hair volume, a looot of volume. It is great for fine flat long hair, but definitely not for already big thick hair. Also, it really does not dry all that well.</li>
    <li> Handle is a little too large for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and have a Spin Air Rotating Styler that I use everyday. It shortens my daily routine by at least 20 minutes as it is so easy and simple to use. Plus it gives great volume and bounce to my hair that was not achieved with my normal hairdryer + styling brush combo. I recently travelled to the US on conference and needed to look good. I knew from experience that my Australian styler has a different plug and power wattage. So before jumping on the plane I purchased this item and had it waiting for me at the hotel. It&#x27;s every bit as good and is now ready for my next US trip.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this styler!  It&#x27;s easy to use and makes my hair shiny and smooth.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and is thick and FRIZZY.  I usually blow dry it straight with a round brush and then I have to flat iron it to keep it down.  I still blow dry my hair before using this - just a rough blow dry to get my hair about 80-85% dry and then I use the spin brush to style it.  It gives my hair volume but also keeps it smooth.  The only downside is that if you accidentally put too much hair into the brush, it can get stuck in the crack at the very to or very bottom of the brush area where it spins.  My recommendation is to make sure you are  sectioning out your hair and don&#x27;t place too much into the brush while spinning it.  That&#x27;s my only complaint - otherwise, this brush is WELL worth the $$! :)</li>
    <li> Recommend the video they have in place on Utube&lt;br /&gt;on use of product, but not necessary to view. Just&lt;br /&gt;helpful.  Your hair should be partially dry or it takes a&lt;br /&gt;long time.  This is fantastic and seems to be really&lt;br /&gt;easy on your hair.  This is an important fact to people&lt;br /&gt;with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I consider myself with 2 left hands when Is about styling my hair. Now, I feel like I&#x27;m going to hair saloon  every time after I&#x27;m using this hair brush.</li>
    <li> Great product really works great.  Styles nicely and is much easier than the ole hair brush and hair dryer technique</li>
    <li> I am a parapalegic and this product has answered my prayers: It can be used with only one hand!! I&#x27;d like the handle a litte thinner, but that&#x27;s just my preference...it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great styler brush -- easy to use and gives volume and shape.</li>
    <li> great for quick drying and styling hair</li>
    <li> So nice, I bought it twice. Gave one to my Mom. She loves it. Definitely a must-have for those of us who&#x27;ve never mastered the brush and blow dryer method. You do need to dry your hair somewhat before use because the blow dryer is not powerful enough to complete dry your hair. Small price to pay for the in or out flip we&#x27;ve all been searching for.</li>
    <li> This tool works pretty well, but it doesn&#x27;t really dry your hair.  You will need yo pre-dry your hair first.  Also, be careful not to make your hair sections too big, or your hair will get tangled in the barrel as it spins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m terrible at doing my hair - especially when it comes to straightening my hair.  Either I straighten too much and there is no body/volume, or I can&#x27;t get it straight enough and curls pop up everywhere.  The infiniti made it really easy to straighten my hair and give volume.  I still had to use the straightening iron in a couple spots, but overall this is the easiest thing I&#x27;ve ever used to straighten and volumize my hair.  No waiting on hot curlers, no trying to use a curling brush and a hair dryer at the same time, this was just one simple, straightforward process.  Saved me time and energy and made my hair look great.  I expect even better results as I get more used to the device.  Thank goodness there are products out there for us non-stylist types.  This will save me from the constant pony tails or curly updo&#x27;s I typically resort to out of frustration.</li>
    <li> This brush is one of the BEST things I have ever bought! It dries my hair with extra body and bounce ... just like I&#x27;ve been to the salon each day! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to my hairdryer after this! The brush is soft, so no painful scalps, plus your hair glides nicely within the bristles ... no getting the brush stuck in your hair! The rotating motion is easy to get the hang of ... but even if you press the \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; direction, it doesn&#x27;t make a tangle of your hair! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair came out Great!  Don&#x27;t listen to the fussy reviews.    This is the best thing i have ever used on my hair and thats almost 50 years of experience.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it...</li>
    <li> This hair brush dryer really works well, and it actually styles my hair for me.  I just have to hold it in place, and it does all the work.  My hair is fairly thick and hangs below my shoulders, and it tends to be a litte frizzy.  With this my hair is smooth and shiny.  Because I am not very strong I was worried that it would be too heavy for me to manage.  However I can actually hold it in one hand.  I am delighted with the result, and am surprised (with my weakness) that it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I erred in ordering a 2&amp;#34; barrel; it&#x27;s too large for my hair  However, I gifted it o my niece who loves it.  As soon as the holidays are over and I have a little extra cash, I will order it again with a smaller barrel</li>
    <li> The handle on the brush is too big to hold easily and the button to make it spin is awkward to push and hold.</li>
    <li> I just gave myself a blow-out...and it looks great! I have long, thick hair, approximately to my bra strap. My hair is def more silky and smooth. This product was perfect for my needs. It is for someone who normally blows out their hair with a round brush and hair dryer and it takes forever and never looks as smooth as the salon does it. It took a very short time to learn how to use the brush if you are familiar with blowing out your own hair with a round brush / hair dryer..     This brush did not save me any time styling my hair, it just helped me to do a beautiful job. You still have to go section by section which takes the same amount of time. The placement of the spin buttons worked well for me. If you did accidentally spin the brush the wrong way it was easily reversed with no consequences. I love how you can dry both sides of each section by switching to the opposite side of the section you are working on and simply spin the brush in the opposite direction.     I air dried my hair to about 80% dry as instructed, and then used the spin brush on small sections at a time. What&#x27;s great is that you have one hand free to manipulate the hair, instead of having to set the hair dryer down every time you grab a new section or reposition the hair. It did tangle my hair a little bit if I took to large of a section, but it is easily untangled by pushing the button to release the hair in the opposite direction so it was really no problem.     If you have long hair, do not allow the hair to wind up more than once around the brush because it will not pull through, if that makes sense. Keep the hair going up and over the brush and basically brush through it while it spins. When you get to the ends you can curl it around the brush a little more. I am so happy with this product! No more expensive salon blow-outs!</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer with removeable round brushes that I thought I really liked.  The second one died.  I returned to the same store.  They didn&#x27;t have it anymore.  I saw this and was a bit put off by the price and the spin.  But I wanted a round brush dryer, it was late and I bought it.  Before I opened it, just a few minutes ago, I decided to read amazon reviews.  Many convinced me to go ahead and try it.  Wow.  The brush is nice and soft.  My hair looks great.  It took about 5 minutes, tops, to style.  My hair is just to my shoulders, long layers, fine.  My big concern was that my hair would become one with the brush.  Not even one time did it pull my hair.  As for the weight--think of it as a light workout.  My hairdresser has well-toned arms.  I&#x27;m happy with the weight.  It doesn&#x27;t spin on cool.  I think it might be a nice feature to have a separate cool button that you can access while spinning.  Just writing that is dizzying, so maybe not a good idea:)</li>
    <li> With time and practice, you really can make your hair look like you just came out of the salon!  The first time I used it, (after watching some youtube videos), My hair really looked good and shiny...the first time in months!  (I just had a baby 5 mos ago and haven&#x27;t had a hair cut or blow dry or anything since).&lt;br /&gt;I use this every time I want to dry my hair after a shower, but I&#x27;ve been going super fast (remember I have a 5 mos old baby) so my hair doesn&#x27;t get all wavy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick hair and semi-long - (to bra strap area on my back).&lt;br /&gt;You do have to regularly blow dry your hair to about 85% dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does got pretty HOT.  I have always used it on HIGH setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it came in a 1.5&amp;#34; diameter, I think I could get better waves or loose curls like my old hair stylist did w/ the brush and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes on some small sections, I hold it vertically spinning, and let my hair spin through past through the brush so it curls the hair more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good if you don&#x27;t want to use a flat iron, but want silky smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, so I&#x27;m sure with more time, I can figure out better styles to create with it.</li>
    <li> I hated it. It did not work as advertised. I returned it after two weeks. I kept hoping it would get better, but it did not.</li>
    <li> This product I bought to try at the same time as the Conair BC171CS Ionic Hot Air Brush 1.25 Inch. The pricing on both products made it affortable I didn&#x27;t know which I would like better. The Infinitipro has a very large handle with my small hands &amp; long hair it was tiresome and the brush bristtles are so soft it took longer to dry my hair. This is a heavy duty Air Brush when you lock in the brush even on my thick hair it can take the pressure. Also the air intake is at the bottom so no fear of over heating which I&#x27;ve done by covering the intake with my hand. I rated it 4 stars due to it&#x27;s very large handle which for me was very tiresome, too soft brush &amp; lack of additional smaller Air Brush tools to snap on.</li>
    <li> This is so great, I hope Conair never stops making it! I always have trouble doing a blow out on my long hair using a brush and hair dryer, but this makes my hair look likes it&#x27;s been professionally done. I think it&#x27;s probably because of the tension it creates when you use the spin function. That is one thing you have to be careful with is the spin function. The buttons seem to be a little sensitive to touch and it would start spinning when I would barely touch them, so you do have to be careful maneuvering your hand around. But my hair never got tangled on it, so it&#x27;s fine. My hair looks good right after I dry with it, and it still looks good in the days afterward.</li>
    <li> I bought the Infinitipro because it claims to have ions preventing your hair from flying away.  Well, there are no ions to be found in my opinion.  My hair looks as though I&#x27;ve had an electric shock!    After using the heat setting on the Infinitipro and then going to the cool setting, I found this product does NOT cool off...at all!!!    I&#x27;m sending it back!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair styler in the world! It takes the job of your best brush, best blow dryer, and styler all in one! It makes your hair healthier and shinier after one use! The more I use it I like it even more! I also get better at styling the more I use it! I love this product! Easy, fast, and beautiful results! Get this item!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with this product. It gives my hair extra body and curl, I get lots of compliments.  It is easy to use, however, be careful not to get too much hair on the brush when it is spinning or it can get caught on the top part if you angle it wrong and it will hurt.  Just make sure you separate your hair into smaller sections when you use it.  I partially dry my hair with my hair dryer before using this, so I would say it doesn&#x27;t replace your hair dryer. It depends on the thickness and texture of your hair though.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use anything else. This is the absolute best invention since the birth control pill. It even controls frizz. My neighbor bought one after she begged to try mine.</li>
    <li> returned it. As others said that grip of brush is not great. brushes get irregular extremely early</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving it one star because it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted I wanted a rotating barrel and made a mistake so nothing wrong with the product.</li>
    <li> I had some doubts on whether this would work well and I&#x27;m pleasently surprised that it does even on my thick past-shoulder length hair! FANTASTICALLY! I&#x27;m not a pro but I often get compliments on my hair and know my way around curling iron and straightner. I&#x27;ve always had trouble doing a round brush blow-out on my own. I&#x27;ve watched how-to videos of all kinds but manuvering a brush and a blow-dryer is too hard for me! If I wanted a bombshell look I always dried my hair completely and had to use a large barrel curling iron essentially doing damage every time! With this I air-dryed my hair until it was about 70% dry (because I had time today, I would blow-dry on an average day)and read the full directions and tips. I really got the hang of it quickly and had half my head done in ten minutes! I DID NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS on my hair so all the shine and body I got was strictly from this item!!! I recommend reading the tips, and starting from the ends and rotate while pulling up and down on the section using tension as you go...just as you would when using a round brush and blow-dryer. I smoothed each section and then held it spinning close to the roots after that. Then I pressed reverse as I pulled the item down and out of my hair making a sprial--mimicing the technique a stylist would use. Then I finger brushed the hair and WOW what a great look! I cannot believe how awesome my hair looks! I fully believe if you give this a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I have thick, slightly coarse hair, that&#x27;s layered and cut just below the chin. Since using this brush, my hair has been so smooth.  I do dry my hair about 75% to 80% with my regular hair dryer before using the spin brush. I know with as thick as my hair is, it would never dry in a reasonable amount of time with this brush. While my hair is still damp, I rub a little bit of argan oil between the palms of my hands and work through to the ends.  Then I use the spin brush. It&#x27;s amazing how well this brush works. I do not have to use a flat iron. I&#x27;ve had many comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looks since using it.  I would recommend it for anyone, especially if you have short to medium length hair.  It does take some practice or at least it did for me. But it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I am one of the cosmetically clueless.  30 years old, and since i mastered the ponytail at the age of 18 (yes that&#x27;s right, it took me until age 18 to figure out how to do a decent ponytail!), I rarely do anything to my hair for the sole reason that I am no good at it at all.  A few years back, I went to a very patient stylist who labored to teach me the hair dryer/round brush method of doing my hair, and I managed to learn how to use a straightener after to tame the fluffed up broken strands that resulted from this process.  At the end of all that, I ended up with a passable head of hair that would look decent for about an hour until i touched it, came in contact with wind, rain, sleet, sun, snow or otherwise did anything other than sit with my head perfectly still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this bad boy.  I will adnit it takes some getting used to (a 5 minute learning curve for something hair inept like myself).  I was concerned at first with the width of the brush.  It is easily the size of a full two inch round brush or iron.  I first tested on dry hair as soon as I got it out of the box.  It did nothing really for my dry hair, except make it big and static-y.  I do NOT recommend it for dry hair unless you have some sort of tamer or prewet it.  This morning I used it on my freshly showered, shampooed and conditioned hair.  I was worried about it pulling out strands, or tangling in my hair, but they have designed it so in order for it to rotate, you have to hold a button down (you can also direct the rotation clockwise or counterclockwise by pushing different buttons-super useful when switching sides of hair).  Even when holding down the button I did not manage to cause tangles, rips, or pain in anyway (which i ALWAYS manage when using a manual round brush.)  It took about as much and maybe even a few minutes less time to dry may hair, but I didn&#x27;t need the straightener step.  My hair feels smooth, has a nicely contoured shape and looks as good (or better) than when it is freshly done from the salon.  My husband (the man of few compliments) even commented positively on it (Okay, so he said \\&quot;How much did that cost me?\\&quot;....but that&#x27;s glowing praise coming from him :-)  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the disclaimer.  This is NOT for short hair.  with this big of a brush, I would assume your hair would need to be shoulder length or better (mine is just around my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommended using for touchups to dry hair, unless you&#x27;re looking for that \\&quot;Just touched a light socket\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful at the roots.  This is a BIG FAT brush.  When you put it to your roots on spin, you will end up with BIG FAT hair if you overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful just past the roots.  This is a BIG FAT brush.  If you put it under your hair towards the top of your head, you could end up with UFO shaped hair.&lt;br /&gt;Take the time to get your manual dexterity into alignment.  You have to hold the button and position the brush.  You have to make sure you&#x27;re pushing the right button so that it spins the direction you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used it, you&#x27;ll realize that this is a GODSEND and worth every penny you paid for it.

    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work when my hair is already dry either. It is completely worthless for me; I returned it a few days after purchase at Walmart. I was able to control the rotating function easily after a few minutes of use, the first day. I liked the rotating function but I can&#x27;t give it more than 1 star because it did absolutely nothing for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it doesn&#x27;t blow enough air - not enough power. Also I wish it would be less thick because it would create better waves then. I have the revlon hot hair brush, it doesn&#x27;t rotate but it gets pretty hot and gives me results, I wish it had the automatic rotation feature...</li>
    <li> This is the first time I write a review for anything but this brush was so good I&#x27;m amazed! My hair is thin wavy and extremely damaged! After using this brush my hair looked healthier than ever the heat from the brush isnt as hot as a blow dryer so I&#x27;m guessing it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair as much my hair looks like i got it blow dried by a professional ! I didnt even have to iron it after and my side swept bangs actually stayed to the side (I couldn&#x27;t really style my bangs with an iron) I also tried this on my mom her hair is very curly and thick and her hair look beautiful it honestly looks like a professional blow dry!       * the spinning is a little confusing at first be careful not to knot your hair (although its kind of hard) try playing with the buttons before styling and get a comfortable grip because the brush is kind of big   :) :)</li>
    <li> This product does NOT replace your blowdryer. I still blow my hair dry almost completely, then I run a holding gel through my hair and use my infiniti pro styling brush. This gets my hair very smooth - I have very curly/wavy hair ( with blow dryer and flat iron, takes almost an hour to straighten) This product does not save me any time, just gets me better results in the same amount of time, gives my hair extra bounce and elimiates my chi flat iron. I love this product, and was using a revo styler before this purchase, but couldnt afford the $150 price tag for a new revo. This product does the exact same thing as my revo, I am very happy i made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Was excited to receive this in the mail.  Tried it out for the first time this morning.  Will take getting used to.  I have shoulder length hair and learned the hard way that you REALLY need to section off your hair.  When you don&#x27;t, the hair that is not &#x27;spinning&#x27; will become a tangled, twisted mess.  My hair is also naturally wavy, and I was hoping this would straighten it a bit, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  It DOES give a little bit of lift at the roots, however.  We&#x27;ll see how long the fullness lasts.  Just ok.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE how much volume this gives my hair...but the only downfall of using this versus a regular hair dryer is that it takes almost three times as long to dry my hair.  Another downfall is that you can&#x27;t really get all of your roots completely dry with this product, so I find myself drying as much as I can and then following up with a quick blow from my regular hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;If you have plenty of time to spare to dry your hair, this product does a phenomenal job, as long as you don&#x27;t mind using your standard dryer to finish the job.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly and freeze prone hair. So, you can imagine how many styling tools and products I have!When I decided to buy this one after seeing the advertisement on tv , my husband smiled and said:really,another one?!!But when it arrived and I used it he was like \\&quot;WOW,Did you go to a hair salon?\\&quot; It does miracle on my hair.It is easy to handle,works fast and neat without any mess,gives a perfect volume to my hair,no freeze at all,and good shine too .What do I need more?! It&#x27;s not just for making hair straight ,you can even use it to make soft waves especially at the ends.The two bottoms for spining rotation may seem a little confusing  at first but I bet you will learn how to work with them in just a few minutes. The  amount of heat is well adjusted too.It styles the hair,but dosent damage it.I have this rotating styler for more than a month now ,and love it more and more each day.My mom never has had any styling tool in her life. She is a natural looking girl who rarely uses makeup or styles her hair unless for some weddings or big parties.She and my sister both fall in love with this Spin rotating styler and asked me to buy one for each of them too. So this would be my sister&#x27;s next birthday present and my mom&#x27;s literally  first hair styler ever!</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH IS THE BOMB IT MAKES IT LOOK AS THOUGH YOU JUST LEFT THE SALON. KINDA TRICKY AT FIRST BUT ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT YOU LL BE HAPPY</li>
    <li> I was hardly able to use a dryer and circular brush without getting it tangled in my hair &amp; then spending twenty mins to get it out. For me this is SO much easier! I haven&#x27;t had a problem being able to hold it &amp; I have pretty average size hands. (size 8 in gloves) Of course this product isn&#x27;t gong to work if you have short hair b/c it is a 2\\&quot; brush. My hair is mid length.  If your not sure about the size go buy a 3\\&quot; brush, if the brush works with your lenght, then I&#x27;m sure this will tooI love it! Don&#x27;t get me wrong its not a product that your going to take out of the box and be a very good at it at it, it takes some practice &amp; getting use to, but its well worth it! I recomend useing the low setting untill you get the hang of it! Once you get the hang of it, its a lot faster than my old way of drying my hair and then useing a straightener, &amp; add a lot more body also.</li>
    <li> Packed in after second time that I used it with a smell of burning motor had burned out complete waste of my money</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve owned the rotating brush that you use along with the blow dryer and it worked great but both your arms would get so tired.  With the Spin brush, you don&#x27;t have to use both hands and it drys so quickly.  You can either dry it straight out of the shower or blow dry it some before to make it easier.  I like to partially dry my hair so it takes even less time, but one thing I would recommend, if you have bangs or any shorter areas, don&#x27;t pre dry them.  Your hair will be dry by the time you start \\&quot;spinning\\&quot; and it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> How do I clean the brush? Although I don&#x27;t use it on dirty hair, I don&#x27;t always use it on freshly washed hair. My old Revlon and Conair models came with interchangeable brushes, and it would be great if this Infiniti brush head was removable. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this a week ago, and I absolutely love it. I have extremely curly hair, and I&#x27;m used to spending an hour or two in front of the mirror first blowdrying and then going back and straightening. It was time consuming and horrible for my hair. So, I bought this and honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to be some miracle product, but I figured it would help a little with blowdrying, because I&#x27;m awful at blowdrying and my hair ends up a giant, frizzy mess. I took a shower and towel dried my hair and started working in layers. By the time it was all dry, I looked like a hair commercial. My hair looked and felt thick, bouncy, soft, shiny, and voluminous. I only had to use my straightener for one small section that was being stubborn (also if I want my ends to be straighter, because the brush tends to curl them a little). I&#x27;m really not sure how long it took me to dry and style it, but it definitely didn&#x27;t feel like it took as long as when I was blowdrying and straightening. So far, I&#x27;ve only had one problem with the brush, and it may be just because I try to dry too big a section sometimes, but occasionally a couple pieces of hair will slip off the top of the brush and get caught between the top piece and the brush (I don&#x27;t really know how to describe what I&#x27;m talking about?) but it&#x27;s nothing tragic.  This is also a great price for a product that works so well. The day before I ordered it, I was at Sally Beauty Supply looking at their rotating brushes, and they were more expensive and all a) brands I had never heard of and b) looked cheaply made. So, definitely buy from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I wanted to be in love with this conair product but unfortunately I do not have anything good to report.  I tried it six times.  Nada.</li>
    <li> Purchased August, 2011.  I have layered hair, and it is perfect for the longer lengths, adds body and shine, but I have shorter layers on the top and sides and would like to curl them as well.  This barrel is just too large to be effective on those layers.  I am looking for this item with a smaller barrel, and will purchase it immediately! (Are you listening, Conair?  I love the concept, and if you have medium/long hair, it will serve you well.  We just need something for those of us with shorter bangs, layers, and bob cuts that will add volume bounce and shine .....  about a 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel?  There are such animals out there, but none with rotating soft bristles.  So.........I recommend this highly for longer lengths, and those of us with shorter layers are awaiting something for us as well!</li>
    <li> Just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Very good.&lt;br /&gt;You probably will love using this amazing device.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tired of typing here, but I&#x27;m happy with the brush.</li>
    <li> This spin brush has been a tremendous help in styling my hair while drying it.  I have very thin hair and it is difficult to style.  I&#x27;ve tried several different types of systems, and this seems to work the best.</li>
    <li> Helps add body to my otherwise flat straight hair. Easy to use, no need for curling brush or iron now.</li>
    <li> I love this. I used to blow dry my hair, then try to straighten and give it body with a hand-held heating brush. This does it all in one. I do usually dry my hair half way with a regular dryer, then switch to this one. I have thick hair, so this works better for me. Of note: this brush is large, so it probably will not work too well on short hair. I wish they had a smaller brush attachment for when I have my hair cut shorter.</li>
    <li> Great for long hair.  Never tangled my hair.  If you are uncoordinated with a round brush and blow dryer this is your friend!</li>
    <li> This is the coolest hair dryer I have ever owned! Before using this product, I would have to go and get my hair professionally blown out to look like this! I love this dryer and get compliments on my hair all the time now!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, it is convenient and does a good job of blending the function of a blow drier and a brush all in one, we strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with my hair lately, it has been frizzy and unmanageable.  It did not matter what products I tried.  This arrived before it was supposed to  and my hair is SHINY SMOOTH AND AWESOME!!!!  It is fun to figure out because of the way the brush turns.  Even if you hit the button and go the wrong way your hair does not get tangled, believe me, I tried!  GREAT GREAT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> Only one problem with this brush.  It works so well my wife took it from me and won&#x27;t give. It back.  I only got to use it twice but I liked the way my hair felt after dring it with this.  Itfelt softer than ever and I did not have the usual problem with my hair sticking up in the air from static.  I should have known my wife would try it out.  Her hair is very long (below the waist).  I askedhe how she likedit and her response caught me by surprise.  She said that belive it or not it was in her words \\&quot;incredible\\&quot; and did everything it said it would and more.  She said she has never had one of these that did not get tangled several times in her long hair and this one did not tangle even once.  She has always had a problem with static and she was very impressed when not only did it keep static out of her hair during that day but after sleeping, when she says her hair always gets filled with static from rubbing against fabric, it was solved with this.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE PRODUCT, HOWEVER, IT LOOSES POWER ALMOST EVERY TIME I USE IT. NOT A PROBLEM WITH MY ELECTRICITY BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH OTHER STYLERS.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be like the Revlon air brush, but it was not.  The bristles left my hair very staticy.  I used it once and never used it again.</li>
    <li> Thanks for these infinitipro spin. Very beautiful. Strong&gt; and priced appropriately. Ouseltna and at the right time  thank you for amazon  thank you for myus</li>
    <li> My sister bought the infinity airbrush and brought it to thanksgiving for my mom and I to try. I was very skeptical of the as seen on tv product, but when I saw my sister&#x27;s hair I was stunned. She has very long course hair and it was silky smooth. When I tried it I was afraid my curly hair was going to get tangled in the barrel, but this never happens even when you reverse rotation. You get the tension a hairdresser achieves that I am never able to get on my own, and the result is smooth shiny hair. I don&#x27;t even have to break my hair up in layers, it just grabs the underlayers as I move it down my neck. The only suggestion I have is to partically dry your hair before using it so it is lightly damp. Not the best with just out of the shower wet hair. I am not one to spend a lot of time on my hair so this is a Must Buy!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this tool, but after a lot of user review research I took a risk and ordered it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have med-long hair (just a few inches below shoulder), and prior to this tool I had given up blowing out my hair because it was too time consuming and difficult with a traditional dryer and brush as my hair grew longer. As the product guide recommends for longer hair, I dried my hair about 70% of the way with a normal dryer (about 5 min.). Then I used the Infiniti Styler to do the actual styling (about another 10 min). The movement takes a little getting used to but once I got the hang of it, my hair definitely was smoother/less frizzy. It was also easier to get it into the shape I wanted with volume. I think once I get used to the buttons and the feel of it, the styling time will be much quicker and with even better results. Now I wish I had known about this styler when I had a shorter bob cut for years. It would&#x27;ve been so much easier with shorter length hair, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you do.  My main complaints are the size of the handle and the placement of the controls. The handle is pretty big which makes it kind of awkward and difficult to get a good grip, and I have big hands. The placement of the directional buttons which is basically a toggle left and right, isn&#x27;t very ergonomic. I found it difficult to press the button precisely enough for consistent rotation at certain angles. It would also be great if the cold temp. setting was a simple blast button rather than having to flip the switch up another notch above the high heat setting. It&#x27;s hard to do when you&#x27;re working the top back of your head and can&#x27;t see or feel the switch well. If they could work out those issues this would revolutionize at home blowouts forever!</li>
    <li> My hair is really fine, and hardly ever has volume. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there and usually have to work to get what little volume I can. This product makes my life so much easier! Its very easy to use, and holds the volume in. The only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars is because its not a powerful dryer and if you have really thick hair it might take you longer. However, I suppose in the long run I save more time because I&#x27;m not trying to use a dryer, comb, and then curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend has the same product, and her hair is as opposite to mind as it can be. Her hair is curly, thick, and long. Her hair has never looked better, and it was on her recommendation that I got it. Even though our hair is different, this product did wonders for both of us. The only difference is that since her hair is so thick, she drys some of her hair before she uses it to save time. My hair is fine enough where I don&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
    <li> I love this styler!  I have thick curly hair and it works great.  Would recommend to anyone needing a good styled.</li>
    <li> This styling brush works well with chin length to shoulder length hair.  It will give hair a smooth finish and slight under curl. If you need more body, you have to use another blow dryer first to get lift at the roots.  For anyone that struggles with using a styling brush and dryer in each hand. This is a nice, quick alternative.</li>
    <li> love it so much, got one for my daughter so we won&#x27;t fight over it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 2, and I got my hair cut on a whim. I picked a style that required some styling, which wasn&#x27;t a bright idea, as I don&#x27;t really have the time to spend on styling my hair... I loved the way the stylist cut and styled my hair, but when I attempted it, it was just a big old mess.  I am not good with a blow dryer and round brush.  It was a disaster.  So after spending an hour blow drying, and &#x27;styling&#x27;, I quit, and pulled out the flat iron to smooth my hair, and went about searching for a product that could help me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Infinitpro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  After much research, reading just about every single review on amazon, and watching some youtube videos, I figured I would go for it.  I bought mine elsewhere (in large part for the return policy)... and also because I was able to get it in blue.  I came home, took a shower, and let my hair air dry for a bit, approximately 40 minutes, as suggested in many of the reviews I read.  I have medium-short length hair, thick as can be and just as coarse.  I read the instructions, took the styler and went to work. 20 minutes later I emerged from the bathroom, sweat free, and with my hair pretty much resembling the way it looked when I left the salon the day I got it cut.  That has never happened to me before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that this was going to work the way I was hoping, in fact, I figured I was setting myself up for major disappointment with the expectations I had for the product. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I have never mastered styling my hair.  Even using a flat iron takes me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 minutes. Twenty minutes and I was done!  I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Takes some practice but is awesome.</li>
    <li> This brush is very convenient, it is fast and easy. I use it and I bought another one for my sister, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Live this! Bought one for every female in my family.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of beauty products and always read reviews before buying them which, I always found very helpful. Big thanks to everyone who write reviews and make it easy for others to make the right purchase. I thought it was time to give back and write a review myself. This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written and here is why....    I just got this spin brush yesterday, it works like magic and I love it!!!!  I have long really thick Asian hair so I rarely style my hair because it takes so long. I also just got a layered hair cut which looks messy without styling.  Since my hair is so heavy it has always been difficult to get volume, I gave up on blow drying. But this spin brush really creates sexy volume, cuts drying time in half, is easy to use, and it definitely changed my whole image. For those of you who don&#x27;t have hours to blow dry and style your hair everyday, this is definitely something to invest in.    Don&#x27;t forget to use heat protectant spray before you style.    I found this video below useful on how to use spin air brush safely without applying too much heat.    [...]</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on my gray, fine hair, but it is a nice product.  My hair is just weird...</li>
    <li> It does just what I wanted -- -WRAPS THE WET HAIR AROUND BRUSH AND LEAVES IT CURLED/WAVY.</li>
    <li> I have two left hands when it comes to blow drying my hair! I have a beauty supply inventory in my bathroom.   There is nothing our there that I have NOT tried and bought to style my hair!! Hahaha I even have the famous blower that you stand on your vanity and you move with the brush ,the blower remains still.  Well I thought whats one more try and I bought the brush  WOW !!  At first it looked huge and kind of rugged,but after starting to play with it I was so impressed with the way I was  getting the volume and styling it ,seriously.  I am overjoyed that I took the leap to buy this item,it works !   Now for the short hair ladies I would not recommend it.Since the brush is big ,its difficult to wrap the hair around it.  I have hair just below my ears.  All the reviews that are negative about the brush almost kept me from purchasing it,but the positive ones were twice  as many AND the price dropped $20.00 so I was convinced.  Now I just have to find a place for all the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that I wont be needing any longer.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I use this product and we both like it for different reasons.  I have short (2-3\\&quot; on top, 1\\&quot; on the sides) thick, coarse and straight hair.  I like this brush because the spin function can be used to either volumize or flatten a section of my hair depending on whether I spin with the grain or against the growth of the hair.  Some reviewers have claimed this brush doesn&#x27;t work well on short hair due to the large barrel size, but my hair is very short and I find it works great, I guess it depends on what you are trying to do with it.  I use it to volumize my hair up top and flatten the sides/back, then I use a small flatiron (HAI twig) in a random fashion to create a tousled look.  For me, this gives better results in less time than the same method using our normal hairdryer.    My wife has long (mid-back), thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair.  She mostly uses this product to blow her hair straight rather than volumize it.  She didn&#x27;t like it when we first got it, but after I took a liking to it she gave it another shot and decided that she did like it after she got used to it, its a different process than blowing hair straight with a normal dryer and round brush.  Although it is much less powerful than our regular dryer (500w vs 1800w), she found that she could dry her hair faster using this brush because having a free hand saves her from having to section things off as carefully as with the normal dryer.  Also she likes that using less heat is better for her hair.  The only qualm she has with this product is that it does not dry her roots very well, so if she is in a hurry she has to hit them with the normal dryer first and then use the spin brush.</li>
    <li> Only used it once.  just didn&#x27;t like it.  not enough hot air to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product- gives professional blow dry results</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this before but saw all the amazing reviews for it here on Amazon so I figured why not give it a try? I got it in the mail within a few days and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Let me just say, I need to order 2 more of these in case they stop making them. Now, normally my hair is wavy, a little on the fine side, but I have a lot of hair, it is pretty long, and blow drying it usually consists of rough drying it by about 80% then using a round brush and then a flat iron bc I can never get it smooth with the blow dryer. Well those days are over!! I was able to figure it out right away. There are 3 heat settings low, high and cool. The brush doesn&#x27;t spin on cool btw. But this worked amazing! I still had to rough dry it. Especially for someone with a lot of hair or thick hair, bc the dryer on this would take a lot longer to do from soaking wet hair. But this is still a million times easier. It totally cuts out the round brush, plus you can do your hair with one hand. I just clipped it up in sections and was able to do my whole head perfectly and very easily on the first try within about 15-20 min. I didn&#x27;t really have any problem with tangles, which surprised me because my hair usually tangles easily but if you get one just spin the brush the opposite direction for a second and it is instantly untangled. Now anytime I do my hair, it looks like I just walked out of the salon. My hair was sleek shiny and full of body without even using any products. All I put was a little light hold hairspray and it looked great all day. I have been using it ever since and get a ton of compliments on my hair now. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone with really short hair only because the barrel is about 2 inches wide but shoulder length and beyond, this would work just fine. I wish someone would have come out with this a long time ago. A salon blowout at home, easy and under $50 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it. Very very happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> Awesome hair tool.  This has taken me from totally inept at straightening my hair to damn-near expert.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical thinking I might knot up my hair or get it all tangled but this really works.  I blow dry roots first and use dryer brush for styling and shine.  Great product because my arthritis makes it hard to hold a brush and blow dryer. My hair is medium length.  Both my daughters now want one!</li>
    <li> My hair is just past my shoulders and prone to frizz. My first shot at this was a rush job while I was about to be late for work. No time to practice or explore. No worries.....my hair came out silky feeling &amp; very shiny. I was surprised every time I walked by a mirror how great it looked &amp; the style held all day.  Be ready to hold the tension against the pull of the rotation but it&#x27;s nothing difficult. So glad I took a chance on this. I say go for it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this just before Christmas and just love it.  My hair is fine but with its own natural(but slight) wave.  In the past, I&#x27;d use both a blow dryer and a flatiron, but found that the intense heat would really damage my hair.  With this product, I towel dry my hair, add some protective product to the ends, let it air dry as long as possible, then use the styling brush.  For my slightly-below-shoulder hair, it works beautifully.  I don&#x27;t get quite the curl or bounciness shown in the model, but it is noticeably smoother and shinier than even when I would get keratin treatments.  For me, the trick is to ensure that I section it and not try to cram too much hair around the brush.  Did I mention that I love this tool?  I&#x27;m going to get one for my stepdaughter who&#x27;s too busy with vet school to mess with too many styling tools.  It did take me about a week to really feel comfortable with using it, but the ramp up time is so worth it.  As another reviewer said, I&#x27;m considering buying a second one just to make sure I have a spare one...yeah, I love it that much!</li>
    <li> Easy to use &amp; works wonders to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had a smaller barrel it would be perfect !</li>
    <li> This is soooo easy to use. My hair looks so much better after using it. The texture is bouncy and it appears shinier, healthier. It is not fast at drying, but it works!!!</li>
    <li> it always catch my hair!&lt;br /&gt;It is not that good as my imagine.&lt;br /&gt;it does not work good on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I am right handed, had surgery on right hand.  Could not blow dry my hair until I got the Infinitipro Spin Air Styler.  Works great.  One hand styling is a trick but this worked because it has brush and dryer in one.</li>
    <li> This product works great and your hair comes out smooth and straight.  The brush spins as you use it and doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the dryer was more powerful but its great anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt I could do without this product I  hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I really like this spin dryer, it gives me a professional blowout that I would pay 30.00 for. I mostly use it on semi wet hair after shampooing, but it also works on dry hair for a touch up. My hair is very cury and fine and this straightens it out and gives lots of body. I get compliments and it has paid for itself over and over again.</li>
    <li> i purchased this for my daughter for christmas. on christmas day she opened it and tried using it. there seemed to be a loose metal piece in it and when she plugged it in it somehow burnt out or started sparking. i ended up sending it back and got a refund. it wouldnt allow me to just do an exchange so i had to order another one which was a few dollars more by the time i ordered the 2nd one. when we got it again there seemed to be another loose piece in it but she tried using it and it seemed to be working fine. we decided to just keep it since it does seem to work properly. the only thing is i guess it takes some practice to try to use it because her hair was getting tangled in it and we kept laughing at how it worked. i suppose we should try to watch some video on how to use it. i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;d ever buy another one but we&#x27;ll just keep this one. by the way, not regarding this product, the customer service i received from amazon was awesome. i&#x27;d rate their customer service as 5 stars. because the price was different from the first and the second time i ordered it they refunded me the difference as well. awesome customer service from amazon. this product: it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist. I complained that I could never blow dry my hair as well as she did at the salon. Well, this product changed that. I can now get VERY close results at home.</li>
    <li> I gave it away. It only made my hair frizzy. Did not give me any volume whatsoever. Not enough power to be able to dry or style. (I have long thin hair)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as it was recommended to me by someone and i was surprised to see how well it works, you do have to dry your hair a little prior to use but but this only speeds up the drying process.     What i like:  It grabs the hair pretty firmly and rotates very well;  I like that you HAVE to press the button for the brush to rotate this way hair doesnt get tangled;  I like the speed settings, it spins faster wen you turn up the heat;      What i dont like:  I wish it were cheaper :D  I wish it had different brush head sizes  I wish the head rotated on the cold setting</li>
    <li> This is a neat item. I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the stylist after using this product. It dries my hair rather quickly and tames the frizzies. I used to have to iron my hair after drying to get the frizz controlled, but this dryer does it all. And that means my hair is no longer exposed to heat from the iron. I&#x27;m very surprised. The only complaint I have is that it occasionally catches a hair on a specific area. But, as long as I try to keep the hair away from that area, it doesn&#x27;t catch. Might just be a flaw with my unit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Hard to use as you have to keep your finger on the activation button.  Got stuck and stopped.  I have very fine and thin hair, so if it doesn&#x27;t work on me, I&#x27;m not sure who can use it.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product. I am still learning how to use it, but I can already get the result I was looking for when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It works perfect for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another styling tool since the flat iron had caused so much damage to my hair. The Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler does take a little getting used to, but the result far exceeds any iron I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is slick, shiny, and healthy. I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair is managable even in humid conditions. I get salon look results everytime. Kudos, Conair, this brush is a Godsend!</li>
    <li> This product is bulky and hard to hold. While I do like the way my hair looks after using it, I wish it wasn&#x27;t so thick and bulky in my hand while trying to use it. I am 65 with small hands and it really will severly limit my desire to use it as often as I would like. If you have full mobility and larger hands I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Amazing products!!!!I love it!Every morning Im just looks great!Im so happy with this order!&lt;br /&gt;Just you need drying with the blowdryer until 80 percent dry and then use the hot brush!Such amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Save a lot of time every morning!</li>
    <li> I bought this in high hopes and am totally bummed. I have shoulder lengh frizzy, layered hair and this just makes it look like I did nothing special to it at all.Looks like I work up in the morning, and just used a hair dryer. I think I&#x27;ll try it again when my hair is longer.</li>
    <li> I love it! Don&#x27;t get me wrong its not a product that your going to take out of the box and be a pro at it, it takes some practice &amp; getting use to, but its well worth it! I recomend useing the low setting untill you get the hang of it! Once you get the hang of it, its a lot faster than my old way of drying my hair and then useing a straightener, &amp; add a lot more body to my hair also. I was never able to use a dryer and round brush without getting it tangled in my hair &amp; then spending twenty mins to get it out. For me this is SO much easier! I haven&#x27;t had a problem being able to hold it &amp; I have pretty average size hands. (size 8 in gloves) Of course this product isn&#x27;t gong to work if you have short hair b/c it is a 2\\&quot; brush. (mine is shoulder length) If your not sure about the size go buy a 2\\&quot; brush, if the brush works with your lenght, then I&#x27;m sure this will too!</li>
    <li> If you have long hair, don&#x27;t buy this product! it will only tangle it up and pull your hair out.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this brush.  The girl on the advertisement made it look like your hair would be full...even with 1/2 a perm left &amp; shoulder length hair....my hair is not full.  I will keep it as i hate returning things...but i would not recommend this unless you have thick hair &amp; a lot of body like the woman in the ad...mine is thin &amp; i do have 1/2 a perm left...</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!!  I have short, thinning hair, so I did not notice any of the problems that other users said they were having.  My hair dried very quickly and the dryer was not heavy, possibly because I wasn&#x27;t holding it as long as someone with longer hair.  I used the original \\&quot;Infiniti\\&quot; with the spin comb for years and thought it was fine, until I used the \\&quot;Infiniti\\&quot; spin brush - the brush attachment is much better, in my opinion.  Even though my hair is short and doesn&#x27;t go all the way around the brush, I still find that I get more volume and lift from the spin brush than from any other method I have tried.  I am a hopeless klutz trying to hold a regular blow dryer and  separate brush, but I don&#x27;t seem to find the two buttons for forward and reverse spin to be confusing.  I do have to use a curling iron to add curl to my hair, but I get much better results by using the iron after using the \\&quot;Infiniti spin brush,\\&quot; than by using the curling iron alone.  I can appreciate the problems other users are having, but if you have short or thin, or fine hair, this might just be the product for you!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this styler. I LOVE it! I will say the motors don&#x27;t last more than a year or so but I will gladly keep buying them. Nothing makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve had a professional blow dry like this styler. After you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy to use and you use it on damp hair after doing a quick blow dry. It&#x27;s like a dryer and a curling iron all in one. Your hair should be about medium length or longer to get it to curl.</li>
    <li> It does everything that it said it supposed to do. It&#x27; a great product to have.</li>
    <li> My old hot-air curling iron broke and so I searched for quite awhile to find a suitable replacement.  After reading the reviews on the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, I decided to buy it.  After all, it seemed superior to the kind of hot-air styler I had before (non-rotating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really big.  2\\&quot; around to be exact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also -- it is kind of loud but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked as it is supposed to but works much better when rotating.  I would say that the bristles are too soft and the brush too big for it to be of any use when it is not rotating.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with this product.  I do like it but I think they need a few more sizes (smaller sizes) to get more diversity out of it.  As it is now, it&#x27;s kind of a one-note product.  You can get a good blow-out but if you have long hair, you might find that you don&#x27;t get very good volume without putting a lot of product in your hair first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  If your hair is super wet, this brush does not work very well.  You want mildly damp hair.  I recommend wrapping your hair in a towel for a few minutes before using.</li>
    <li> This device works great on long, thick/curly hair. It smoothes the hair while drying it. As for the people who are complaining about it not drying their hair, try air drying until the hair feels about 70% dry then use the spinner. All women should own something like this, curly hair or not because it gives lots of gorgeous volume as well.</li>
    <li> This works really well for me.  I have a muscle weakness disorder and find it more than a little difficult to use the ole&#x27; brush-and-dryer method of styling my hair.  This makes it so much easier for to get the same effect with much less effort.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and get a lot of compliments on my hair, which is very straight and fine and difficult to make look &#x27;full&#x27; but this does the trick.  It says on the instructions that this is not a blow dryer and if you try to use it that way, it will work but will take much longer so I do a little quick blow dry - no styling at this point - just drying the roots mostly.  Then I switch over to this little miracle worker and within a few minutes my hair is done.  It makes it look full and silky shiny.  The handle is larger than most styling tools but I actually think that helps me simply because I don&#x27;t have to grip tight (which is hard for me) to hang on to it.  It just kind of rests in my hand most of the time.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other tools like this but find it hard to believe that their higher prices mean they do a better job.  And not a single tangle!  I&#x27;m completely satisfied and would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described! Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is so quick and easy to use. I have medium length thick, curly hair.  I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair to look like a salon blowout. Until now. I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments. With one hand this product does the work that usually required two. I highly recommend t. It&#x27;s not bulky or heavy like some reviewers say.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Its nice not to have to hold a hair dryer. It needs more speed and strength when rotating .</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, but is a great tool for blow drying hair. It&#x27;s cumbersome but very effective.</li>
    <li> This is just amazing. Better than any other drying and styling tool that I have ever used! It is so easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t tangled your hair and it gives your so much shine that it is almost unreal. I was used to go to the beauty salon twice a week before I moved to the USA. Now I can afford that so I had to do magic to do my hair by myself. I had try everything and nothing compares to this amazing tool. It makes it so easy to handle and it dry and style your hair so fast. I like the volume that it gives your hair, also it leaves the ends of your hair beautiful. I read in other reviews that the size was a problem for short hair, but mine is just under my shoulder, and it works perfect. I like that is not heavy, so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when I&#x27;m doing my hair. I really love this product. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. My hair looks like I had a blowout every time I use it.  However, don&#x27;t expect it to last a long time. This is the third one I&#x27;ve had to buy in 2 years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hot enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a month ago. I hvae long, thin (in strand thickness, not number) and slightly wavy hair, so that after a head wash- without proper styling, its very cumbersome and unpretty to leave it down. I usually put it up in a bun. Even on days that I go out , its difficult to style it with a blow dryer and a round brush on my own. This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It is not for getting those curls and ringlets that you can achieve better with a curling iron or hot rollers, but it provides the polished, blow dryed look for easy going styles and casual work hair dos.&lt;br /&gt;It takes barely 10 minutes for me to do my hair and the result is better than what I would achieve with 40 minutes with a blow dryer. The hair is also softer and shinier. The product says that there is minimal heat damage, Id still use a heat protectant though as the strands become pretty hot during styling. It does add volume like it claims, and it does curl the ends of the hair beautifully. To make the style stay, I use styling mousse before styling - for special occassions. Otherwise using just the heat protectant and the spin brush is enough for a ten hour work day!&lt;br /&gt;I will give it 4 stars and not 5 because I think it would be better if the instrument came wtih various sizes for the thickness o the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is the cool setting : it does throw out somewhat cooler air on cool setting, but the brush itself is so hot and takes so long to cool down, that the hair doesnt really &#x27;set&#x27;. The air thrown out on cool setting oculd have been colder... but thats alright, I make do with turning the device off altogether and waiting.</li>
    <li> All i can say is that this really is a must have,i have really long wavy hair my hair really looked like i came from a salon.....Money well spent worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have mid length thick hair and this product left my hair frizzy. I tried it 4 different times; blow dried my hair 1st and use this to style. I never had any luck. If you have thin, short hair this will probably work for you very well. Also the blow dryer is not very strong. Needless to say I returned this product for my money back.</li>
    <li> So I do like this styler for my hair. My hair is fine, so the soft bristles do pick it up. I can see other types of hair not being picked up so easily. The plus side to the soft bristles are when I&#x27;m not so careful about my hair and it starts tangling, it&#x27;s easier to get my hair out of the bristles. I would check the bristles out in a store before your purchase to see if they are right for your hair. If they are, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 6 months</li>
    <li> I compared a lot of air brushes like this one when my old one broke down a few months ago. I was hesitant about buying the Infinitipro because of the rotating function since I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work well, but I was wrong. I&#x27;ve had this product for a bit over a month and it is great! I have thin hair in tight ringlets and it takes me about 15 minutes to style my hair with the Infinitipro. The rotating function takes a bit to get used to but once you know how to control the rotation direction with ease it is very easy to do your hair. My arm doesn&#x27;t get tired anymore while trying to rotate the brush myself. My hair length is slightly lower than my shoulders but the big brush still does a good job styling it. It does not have a lot of power like a regular blow dryer, so it might not work well with very thick hair, but the high setting on mine is enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair needs to be almost dry, but not completely dry, for the product to work well. Since the high setting is not too hot it is easy to handle the brush without burning your fingers, and it has not damaged my hair. I really like the bristles in the brush because they are not the stiff plastic ones and actually resemble a regular round brush. So far, I love this product, and they only hesitation I still have is about the life of the product. I hope that it does not die on me on the next year, but so far it is working perfectly.</li>
    <li> After using the [[ASIN:B000JUV816 Conair SD6IS Ion Shine 1875-Watt Hair Dryer with Three Attachments]], a non-rotating \\&quot;styler\\&quot; blow dryer for several weeks at a friend&#x27;s house, I decided to purchase one as I found the attached comb made blow drying quick, with results like I had used a separate brush and blow dryer (something I have never been able to manage). I extensively read both amazon and beauty website&#x27;s reviews of different options and finally decided to purchase this Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, even though it was slightly more expensive and not exactly what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Orders of magnitude easier to use than a separate brush and blow dryer, with comparable results&lt;br /&gt;-Shinier, smooth hair, especially when using the cool shot afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively inexpensive for a hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is, as other reviewers mentioned, a bit hard to grip as it is rather large. However, I did not find this to be a problem. For those with rheumatoid arthritis, carpel tunnel, or small hands, however, it may be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;-It is difficult, even after repeated use, to figure out which buttons make the brush turn which direction, especially if you switch back and forth between hands as you do different sides. Often, it is a matter of trial and error, which can get frustrating&lt;br /&gt;-It does dry hair more slowly than a straight non-rotating styler brush&lt;br /&gt;-There are no removable brush attachments and I find that the bristles do not penetrate my hair enough to really grab onto it and give you the grip you need to style&lt;br /&gt;-It is a bit of an awkward size to do bangs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;For me, I primarily want my blow dryer to more or less dry my hair straight with no frizz and I believe a straight styler such as the [[ASIN:B001330XFA Infiniti by Conair SD8R Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, Black]] does a much better, quicker job of that for a lower price. As I was debating selling it, however, my cousin visited me and used it. On her short hair, it worked wonders. It sculpted it nicely, made it glossy and smooth, and gave it that just-got-out-of-the-hairdresser&#x27;s look and so I ended up giving it to her. I would say that if what you are going for is simply drying it straight, go with the non-rotating styler but if you have shorter hair or a style that involves a lot of sculpting of various layers, go with this one.sculpted it nicely, made it glossy and smooth, and gave it that just-got-out-of-the-hairdresser&#x27;s look and so I ended up giving it to her.

    <li> I have no talent when it comes to hair styling and am trying to let   my hair grow out and into a mid length bob.  This product has made  it a much easier task for me.  My hair is still a tad short for maximum  use of this product, but I think I will like it even more as my hair grows longer.  it will become even easier to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t think it would really work as easy for long hair, but for a medium length it&#x27;s the answer to all my hair problems. I don&#x27;t need to go to a salon to arrange it. In 20 minutes I&#x27;m done and it looks great!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas. My wife has cancer and loss her hair and the wigs today are not stylish so I got this for here to style here wigs before going out. It has been a easy product for her to use.</li>
    <li> I have over processed hair and have bought conditioners at $65 an ounce.  Well never more this product was the best investment I have ever made.  Leaves my hair silky smooth.  I use the hair dryer first but style with this anyone who buys it won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Very good product and look very Nice. The cost is good and ship is very fast If you are looking for The item like this go ahead</li>
    <li> It does the job, just be careful to put small amount of hair to do the job better.</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my mom originally but her hair is too short for the two inch barrel so I kept it for myself. I LOVE IT. It makes drying my hair so much easier. My hair is long, just above my butt, and it was super easy once I got the hang of it. The barrel rotates both clockwise and counterclockwise. I am extremely happy!! I just need a smaller barrel one now for my mom.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair, and it used to take me about 20 minutes to blow-dry it, then straighten or curl, depending on how I wanted it styled. The Infinitipro cuts that time in half. While it&#x27;s drying my hair, it curls the ends and straightens the roots and middle section of my hair. Plus, the ions make everything look sleek and shiny without having to add any product. It took me a few times to get used to using it, but even the first time still worked great. NOTE: make sure you divide your hair in sections, just like at a salon. I pin all my hair up on the top of my head and just leave a few sections at the bottom, then keep letting out sections until I get to the very crown of my head. Then I flip my head upside-down and dry/curl for a minute that way, which adds volume. Definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this kind of product back in Europe and it was very practical, so I decided to try it here too..  It does his work, but it&#x27;s a little bit to heavy and after 3 month still having an ugly smell, but not so bad to return it.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;I bought today 1 infinitipro spin air rotating styler with you, And I want to know which color is ?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler  from USA as I cannot find it in the UK Amazon. All fine arrived on time in a bigger box than required, (milking the postage to Europe) the arrived with a USA plug... It was clearly address to Portugal, in Europe so you could of sent with adapter plug and charged it. Now my wife is going to get her birthday presente late as I need to get na adapter plug for it. Also saw that it works with 125 volts and Europe uses 220 volts.&lt;br /&gt;A little attention can go a long way for Amazon, supplier of the product and any other middle people involved...</li>
    <li> This actually works.  Im a klutz when it comes to using both a brush and blowdryer...so this was a great answer.  My hair is also long and thick so I was thrilled that it didnt pull out my hair or getting stuck in brush.  It does a good job...not perfect but more than I expected.</li>
    <li> The air flow is too weak to dry your hair with. You need to blow it out first and then use this slow-moving gadget. The only fast part is the spinner and your hair will catch between the rotating part and the still part. I had high hopes for this styler but was disappointed on almost all fronts.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY curly hair (it looks like an Irish dancer wig) and over half a year ago I stopped chemically straightening my hair for the first time in years... Which I didn&#x27;t think about very much until I decided to get a very short A-line!&lt;br /&gt;I always dried my hair in braids, even when it was &amp;#34;straightened&amp;#34; to be more normal-person curly, because that was the best way I could prevent frizz and end up with dry hair that was easily flat-ironed.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the normal round brush and hair dryer method on many occasions for over a decade, and I&#x27;m just not coordinated enough for it or strong/patient enough to hold them up for the amount of time it takes trying to style my thick hair. But when I chopped off all my hair unthinkingly, I couldn&#x27;t put it in braids or any kind of ponytail, so by the time it dried it was defying gravity and just could not be flat-ironed nicely. (And the cut I got was NOT made for curly girlies like me.) Then I found this product when I was desperately searching for a solution to my accidental high-maintenance nightmare hair.&lt;br /&gt;This may give nice flowing bounce to hair that is naturally straight or long, but I have never straightened my hair so easily in my  life!! I LOVE this thing. Now I can not only have short hair with layers, but I can dry my hair in no time, and I don&#x27;t even have to touch my flat-iron anymore. It&#x27;s much more gentle on my hair and definitely takes a lot less time than any method I (or a hair-stylist) has used for me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for use:&lt;br /&gt; --DO let your hair air dry most of the way before you use this styler&lt;br /&gt; --DO use the low setting unless you really need the high setting to set your style (less damage &amp; fly aways)&lt;br /&gt; --DO NOT keep your finger on the spin buttons the whole time, your hair will still dry nicely wrapped around the unmoving brush&lt;br /&gt; --DO make sure your hair is BELOW the top of the bristles, using the top of the brush is NOT how this was designed to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you notice your *Spin* is starting to lose its gusto in the middle of styling, it&#x27;s probably because the little motor is overworking itself. And by overworking, I mean overheating. This is why I recommend using just the low setting and not over-doing the rotate function. Rotate works best for getting your hair into the bristles of the brush and catching tricky layers. The longer or more textured the hair you want to style is, the more likely you will have to manually rotate. (I am very sorry to say that this is not an actual magical hair dryer.)&lt;br /&gt;This device is limited, like all modern tech, in its capacity to do work for you. You don&#x27;t get to hold it in a static position and end up with fabulous hair with no effort at all. However, I believe this is the only cord I have ever encountered and not tangled, because it has a fantastic pivot base on the styler. So while you are required to still do some wrist-work, you don&#x27;t have to fight a cord every time you move, and the dryer works fantastically without the spin function being on, so you only have to hold one thing. It might not live up to the perfect picture of convenience Conair adverts may lead you to believe it is, but in my opinion it does enough to be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;In 4 months, my spin in going strong (I don&#x27;t push it, of course) but if I do ever kill the motor I will continue using this product without auto-rotate.r /&gt;If you notice your *Spin* is starting to lose its gusto in the middle of styling, it&#x27;s probably because the little motor is overworking itself.

    <li> Great Product. Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Is so easy to use and i get compliments about my hair all the time. No more wasting money on a blow dry at the salon, i can do it myself at home now in half the time!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]] I love this! So easy to use-very lightweight and easy to handle!Dries hair smooth,has enough power to get the job done.I have curly,frizzy hair and have tried every new gadget that comes along,this is the best so far! I highly recommend this styler.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length stick straight coarse and no layers asian hair, and I LOVE this product. It&#x27;s my first time using a spin air brush and after about 10 minutes I figured it out. I start off with wet towel dried hair, apply a bit of volumizing mousse or heat protectant, then I blow dry my hair with my head upside down by bending from the waist. I get it to the point of slightly damp hair and then section my hair with flat pins. I use the spin brush on the low setting because on the high setting the brush dries my hair too quickly before I can get the volume into it. Plus, on the high setting the end of the barrel gets too high for my hands to guide the brush where I want it. I find that it helps to hold the brush at the roots for 10 second then unwind it without tugging. Let the section you just worked on to cool and don&#x27;t mess with it otherwise it will undo the volume you just worked into it. When I&#x27;m finished I work a bit of shine serum into my hair, a little bit goes a long way. I went to showoff my work to my husband and he said it looks like I just went to a salon. I have to say that I would LOVE this product even more if my hair was layered; because with a blunt straight across haircut the ends tend to flip out due to the weight of my hair. I highly recommend this product to people who like the blow out salon effect. This along with my travel blow dryer will be my go to tools for when I&#x27;m traveling. Won&#x27;t leave the house without it. ***NOTE*** if the effect doesn&#x27;t give you the shine you want, you might want to use a defrizzing and moisturing product before blow drying and then maybe spraying a shine serum into your hair after using the spin brush. My hair looks like I&#x27;m ready for a Pantene swing your hair around commercial.</li>
    <li> product came as described.  my hair is too curly for the product and takes a lot more time to style it.</li>
    <li> After a month of use, this styler has earned a mixed recommendation for this reviewer.  Despite the advertised 50% less frizz, there was no significantly less frizz from normal blow drying.  The rotating action tends to be too fast and can easily tangle up hair.  Despite drying the bulk of one&#x27;s hair, it does not dry the roots very well, thus there can still be a need to use a regular blow dryer.  Overall, this reviewer would not rate the Infinitipro styler as being much better than a round brush and blow dryer, especially if one has curly hair.</li>
    <li> I found this styler very cumbersome.  The handle is, in my opinion, huge and it&#x27;s hard to grip it enough to use it effectively.  I have very thick hair and found that the bristles didn&#x27;t smooth my hair, but made it frizzy.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> The Infinity looked and sounded as though it would be a good product for me, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to deal with my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> An awesome product and working perfectly fine with expected result.</li>
    <li> Awesome, love it, for long curly thick hair it is a necessity!&lt;br /&gt;A little time consuming but the results last more than a few days!&lt;br /&gt;Did not think the price was appropriate, a bit high.</li>
    <li> Spend 10 minutes with this beauty every day  and say bye bye to bad hair days! I simply love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing it on a YouTube video.  I did not read the directions first (mistake)and lost more than a few hairs! Then I read the directions.  Once I got the hang of it (it took about 10 min) I loved it. I have really curly hair and I have to dry it, flat iron it, and then curl the ends, whichs takes FOREVER! This does all that in one step and gives great body!  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I discovered this because my mom uses it on her thin straight hair, to give it fullness and body. I have thick unruly curly hair and it&#x27;s perfect for my hair too. It totally smooths out the curls and creates soft bouncy waves. I love it! I find it super easy to use. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 6 years old and I must say I have dreaded doing her hair for six years!  Every and anything that I have ever used on her hair has not worked.  I decided to try this product and I have no regrets.  When I used a traditional blow dryer on her hair she screamed and yelled.  Now, my life seems much less dramatic and for that I am thankful.  I washed her hair and towel dried it and started from the back section by section.  I was not able to post a picture of my daughter&#x27;s hair, but if you go to a twitter account I created for her you will see a picture of her sammys_hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Relieved Mother</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wishing for this exact product for years!  I&#x27;m thrilled Conair finally invented it!  I have shoulder-length, straight, medium-weight hair which is cut in long layers around my face.  The Spin Air brush easily and quickly dries and shapes my hair into the exact style that I want.  I think some people might have a bit of a learning curve; it&#x27;s possible that the brush could tangle if you have longer hair or aren&#x27;t careful.  I believe I have an advantage because I&#x27;ve been using the Revo-Styler for years (a spinning brush that you use along with a regualr hairdrier) so I am very accustomed to operating it. However, once you get the hang of it, I think it&#x27;s very easy to use. The construction is sturdy and the product is a reasonable weight and size.  My arms don&#x27;t get tired using it.  I love, love, LOVE this product and I&#x27;m going to buy a second one to have as a backup for the future!</li>
    <li> my husband gave me one  as a gift, and i liked it so much I ordered a another one as a backup, it lets you dry your hair and styles it at the same time in half the time it ussually took me before.</li>
    <li> Last one I had was really quiet but the motor on this one is very noisy and causes static on the radio.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time ever i&#x27;am writing a review for a product.This hair brush works perfectly for my hair.Being an indian with dark brown fine hair and lot of frizz,it immediately smoothened my hair and that too in 10 min.I give it a 4 star because it does not make your hair as straight as hot iron.But excellent for frizz and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> I purchased an infinitipro Spin air rotating styler as soon as they came out.  Since then I have purchased a second one to have just in case.  I have used it on my friends hair against their will and they all ended loving it also and purchasing one for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use and just does wonder with hair.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I thought.  I have medium length hair but it is very thick and porous so it takes a long time.  I like the fact that it is lightweight and the spin controls are easier than my old Revo styler.  I have not experienced much tangling with this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this styler!!  It takes awhile getting use to but.......WOW!  The frizz is gone and it gives me beautiful, shiny hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine, chin length hair (blunt) and this didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  I think the idea is great and it may have worked better for me if the brush was smaller in diameter. I will definitely try it again when my hair has grown out a bit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite handy if like me you&#x27;re not too good at blowdrying...a downside is this ends up being rather time consuming</li>
    <li> This product disappointed me.  Although I must say it makes your hair very soft, I&#x27;m not sure why it creates more frizz than it does smooth your hair.  It can&#x27;t be my hair because in comparison a regular flat iron does not do this to my hair. Other than that, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because I didn&#x27;t want to get it, have it not work, and be out the money I paid for it. I have very thick, frizzy hair and absolutely HATE drying and styling my hair. I let my hair air dry 75% and then tried it and......It Worked!! It took a few minutes to get a hang of it but my hair looks great! Looks the same as if I had gotten my hair blown out with a large round brush at a salon.</li>
    <li> Product is okay however, living in Australia, I didn&#x27;t realise that I&#x27;d need a new plug as our powerpoints are different! Oh well, I&#x27;ll be better educated next time when buying electrical items.</li>
    <li> nice curl hairbrush. I would like a little more air flow</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a dryer with a brush attached for a long time. This is a great product and the spinning brush is awesome. Unfortunately the brush is way too big. I wish it came in a smaller size.</li>
    <li> The spinning hot air brush is my favorite styling tool.  Love the results.  Finally, a solution for people like me, who has trouble wielding both a brush and a hair dryer at the same time.  This tool gave me the sleek look I wanted, especially with the many layers I have which tends to make things more difficult.  I really liked how the brush was designed with the many bristles, which grab the hair securely and pulling it taunt.  One aspect that can be improved is the gap at the top of the brush.  My hair tends to get caught whenever I take up a big chunk of hair.  So be very careful in sectioning off your hair when you put the rotating brush on it.  Another tip for users is to start at the root and continue to move the brush towards the end while its head rotated.  If you keep the brush in the same place, hair can easily get tangled, which can be remedied by hitting the reverse button.  Also, the brush doesn&#x27;t offer a lot of heat to dry overly wet hair.  Like many have suggested, you can first dry you hair with a regular hair dryer, but sometimes I like to allow my hair to air-dry before using the Infinitipro.</li>
    <li> I have midlength  relaxed Afro hair and I have to say this is the best hair product purchase I&#x27;ve ever bought (including my flat iron)! My first time using it was so simple and the best part is that it rotates and blows out to levels of heat! I have bought the Revo Styler while in University and that didn&#x27;t work. My hair broke and to be honest, me and a hair dryer don&#x27;t work too well - my hair would repeatedly get dry! This in comparision left my hair smooth after the first usage and still is nice, smooth and soft after one week!!I am due to relax my hair - this product allows for me to relax less! IN combination with AntiSnap, A good hair leave in balm (like Chi, Dominican products or FrizzEase), this is one product none of you should ever live without. I had a frien over while I did my hair and she&#x27;s going to purchase one for her household too! I love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is very strait and medium length . Is not found the best job. And pulls a lot of hair out</li>
    <li> So easy to use and makes my hair easy to manage! I love how it rotates in both directions : )</li>
    <li> Both me and my sister already have one of these.  But my sister wanted another one because she has had hers for awhile and feels that the bristles are getting to soft.  I like it but I wish there were some bristle attachments that could be changed on it for different hair types.</li>
    <li> It ripped my hair out and burnt my bangs. I love the idea of this but think it still needs to be perfected.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it is thick and relaxed. This product does not offer enough heat to make my hair come out as nicely as I would like. The style comes out OK, and it is convenient to use, but that&#x27;s it. Also, my hair gets tangled in it all the time. You really need to get accustomed to the direction of the spin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It takes 15 minutes of barely any effort to get smooth shiny locks. I can&#x27;t believe it. I have tried so many things- spent hundreds of dollars and hours of frustrations trying to manage my thick coarse ethnic hair. I have FINALLY found my answer :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it works well. I don&#x27;t have the time, patience (or skill), to use a round brush and blow dryer so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I used my blow dryer to dry my hair about 90%, which is fine, I do that everyday...then I attempted the spin brush. It was (surprisingly) easy to get the hang of. I had a few minor mishaps, but thanks to the reverse button I was able to recover nicely. It&#x27;s big, definitely a handful, but it really does give my hair the smoothness of my flat iron without the &#x27;flatness&#x27; of it. By the end of the week I should have it mastered. ;).</li>
    <li> This item arrived USED!!! I bought this item on July 12th for $39.75. I thought it strange but I opened up the overly taped up box to reveal a hot airbrush with long blonde hair around the entire brush. I am completely horrified and disappointed. While the brush itself seems to be operational it is clearly used. I have never had an experience like this buying on amazon.com. I am a frequent buyer and I have had good experiences thus far. I am not happy about this purchase. I live in the Caribbean and have to have most of my orders freight forwarded which when combined with customs and duties it is expensive to say the least, so it is not economical for me to return this item. This item was sold by and shipped from Amazon.com. I am in utter disbelief, I had such high esteem and respect for Amazon. Where was the quality control on this order? I am not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I, like a lot of other reviewers, have tried just about every straightening/curling/styling tool in the book, and I can tell you this spin brush is just amazing!  I just got it today, and already I know it is the best styling tool I have ever tried BY FAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s about 2-3 inches past my shoulders.  I let it air dry before I went to work so it was extremely wavy and poofy when I got home.  I tested the Infinitipro on my completely dry hair and it styled it exactly the way I like!  My stylist calls it \\&quot;supermodel hair\\&quot; - very loose curls, bouncy and incredibly shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice as far as getting used to pressing the correct button so it spins in the direction you want (and your hair CAN get tangled.  Mine did a couple of times, but it&#x27;s easily untangled by spinning the brush in the opposite direction).  I&#x27;m sure it becomes second nature once you&#x27;ve used it for a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best part is being able to style the back of my hair, which I&#x27;ve been unable to do well with a round brush and regular hairdryer.  This tool is definitely an arm saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair tomorrow and try it out while my hair is still damp, but if I got this great of a result with dry hair, I can&#x27;t imagine it will be anything but awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but it just didn&#x27;t work that well for my hair. I have a lot of volume and my hair is medium-length (shoulder). I spent a good hour trying to figure this thing out and even when I did, it just didn&#x27;t do the job well... Ah, well. At least, I tried it.</li>
    <li> it does not shine hair as it claims.</li>
    <li> I certainly liked the idea of this styler, but it was  much faster than I.My right hand is arthritic, and I  just couldn&#x27;t keep up with it.  However, for someone  more agile, I can see that it would be a fabulous tool.  Karlynn</li>
    <li> Love the soft bristles! An amazing tool. Feels good on the scalp. Love the cool setting, however it doesn&#x27;t rotate on cool setting, not that it is suppose too but still like it. Don&#x27;t have to worry about settings and using different styling tools at once. Dry and style at the same time. Love the rotation!</li>
    <li> super fat brush.  can use spin or not works great to style hair from wet to dry.  Makes hair smooth​ and soft.  I was unsure when I ordered so glad I took a chance.  I often use only this to style my hair no other straightener or curler needed.</li>
    <li> If you are used to blowdrying your hair with a round brush and a professional hairdryer, you will not like this product. I thought it would save me time in the morning to do a quick touch up a hair that looked like it was styled on that day. However, this styler does not give me the finish I am looking for, or that I am used to. So if you will settle with an ok result, you might like it, but I like my hair looking like I walked out of a salon. I returned mine and am back to blowdrying my hair with the round brush.  My hair is slightly wavy.</li>
    <li> I have pretty fine hair and I was hoping this would give me some volume. It does a nice job of smoothing, but I had more trouble with it than it was worth for me. I think it might be great for someone with curly hair who wants to straighten.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and I am always looking for more volume.  This is challenging for me because I am a bit of a dummy when it comes to styling my hair.  I first ordered the 1.5 inch Infiniti Pro because I thought it would be a good size for my just above the shoulder length hair.  Unfortunately, it gave the the dreaded pageboy look that I was hoping to avoid.  Enter this 2-inch beauty.  Even I am able to get volume with this wonder tool.  And even though it deflates as the day progresses, my hair still has a nice shape to it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and one for my sister. We both love it and can&#x27;t stay without it. Leaves hair smooth and shiny. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because sometimes it stops rotating. But it comes back so not such a big deal. When this one breaks or stops working I will definitely buy another one!</li>
    <li> Not enough power. It takes me four times the time to do my hair with this tool versus a regular blow drier. I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Motor not strong enough to rotate with my hair on the brush.</li>
    <li> This has completely revolutionized my daily hair routine.  My hair is fine and on the thinner side, and with a little bit of mousse or gel applied to my almost dry hair (this is key- make sure hair is 80-90% dry), in 3-5 minutes I have a style that equals what my stylist (who is really good!) can do in her salon.  My hair is currently cut in a short-medium length shag, but I am growing it out now into a shoulder length bob.  This tool gives me lift at the roots, and makes me look like I have much thicker hair.  I think it is very intuitive to use and my only desire is that Conair might consider a version with changeable brush heads so people with short hair or folks who want tighter waves can get great results, too.  I am so thrilled with this purchase that I am actually going to buy another one as backup.  Who wouldn&#x27;t want a good-hair-day every day?</li>
    <li> I bought  for my  wife  ...since she  said it was  practical!!... and  I  started to  use it  because  the  cold  mornings  and  WOUWWW FACTOR!!!....... I looked that  I have been  haired by a pro!!...jajaj&lt;br /&gt;My  wife  laugh at me ... because I loved.&lt;br /&gt;So please guy buy one&lt;br /&gt;Also my  wife  friends  all ask for  one....mayby a bussiness..jaja</li>
    <li> First let me say that I really love the way it polishes my hair and adds lift and curve.  Looks like a salon finish.  Now a few \\&quot;minus\\&quot; issues...first of all it states that it is a 2\\&quot; barrel, but it is really 3\\&quot; because of the brushes, which means if you have short hair, or have short layers, it will not work for you unless your aim is to remove the curl.  You need to have enough length in order to wrap around the barrel.  My hair is straight, fine textured and cut in a chin length bob, so it works pretty well.  It also has two buttons to change the direction of the brush.  This is confusing when you change from one side of your head to the other, it seems to be counter-intuitive.  The buttons are not marked and are too close together, so it&#x27;s easy to make a mistake.  Also, you should start from the bottom and work upward, going over the lower levels after working a higher level will give you knots.  You should, of course, section your hair before you start.  The main problem is the weight, it doesn&#x27;t seem like 1.8 lbs is a big deal until you start holding your hand up in the air in one position for extended periods of times, makes for a lot of muscle fatigue.  I would be happier with a smaller barrel (or interchangeable sized barrels) and a lighter weight.  But even with the negatives, I like the way my hair looks, and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to go from wet to dry and out the door.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I purchased the spin brush and decides to give it a try.  I have short hair and it is very fine.  The item did as it said and I had no problem operating the brush.  The problem I had is that the brush is to large for short hair and no matter how many styling products I used it made my hair to soft and flat. I gave it to a friend who has long, thick wavy hair and it does a wonderful job.  It removes the frizz, flyaway hair and leaves a marvelous shine.  She is incredibly happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would make straightening/blow drying my hair easier, but I was sooo wrong! It made my hair frizzy, dry and far worse than I could have imagined. I tried it twice and followed the directions and watched videos before I used it. The bristles were also far apart and sparse; not at all helpful or useful. The Infinitipro also seemed cheaply made, like it would fall apart or break apart if I held it just a little too tightly. I really wanted this to work and am extremely disappointed. The only good thing is I got my refund back super quick ( minus the shipping).</li>
    <li> I love, adore and rave about Blow Dryer brushes - which essentially, this is. However, aside from the two plusses this one has (a spinning/rotating feature and it&#x27;s enourmous, volumizing size) it also has two negatives that outweigh those positives.   First and foremost - it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough. It doesn&#x27;t heat up enough at ALL to create the *oomph* this size styler could give you. You can put this immediately away, after use - with no issues. It&#x27;s not hot. It&#x27;s warm.   Secondly, the bristles should be stiffer. The soft bristles just kinda get smooshed by your own hair.   I had such high hopes for this item. But for $50-ish dollars, it&#x27;s just not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I was a little intimidated by this but loved what I saw on the videos. ( I also went to youtube and saw some there).  After getting used to the spin, I got into a rhythm and was able to get fabulous shine and body. My hair is long so I did a lot of drying beforehand with my regular dryer. But this is a great styling tool that I LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I love the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler!!!  It&#x27;s great for long hair, it leaves my hair smooth and silky!  It may tend to take a little longer if you dry your hair when it&#x27;s completely wet.  It looks big, but it&#x27;s not heavy at all and is really manageable with one hand.  The heat is not overbearingly hot to wear you burn your scalp or hair.  Again, it works great and I just love how it leaves my hair!!!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I used to live in Europe and there I used a Remington Rotating Brush that is not sold in the US and that did not fit the voltage requirements for the US so I could not bring it with me, but I have been very satisfied and was decided to buy a rotating brush here. I bought the Conair brush and I absolutely love it. I mostly use it for curls and I have medium to long hair. The curls stay all day long and it takes 5 to 10 minutes to get a great hairstyle after I wash my hair. I use it on my damp hair, but sometimes I also dry my hair with it.   Although it is great for curls, you cannot get the straight hairstyle they advertise. You can get extremely loose curls, but I always have to use a straightener if I want my hair straight. The edges just won&#x27;t stay straight from the brush only.  However, I knew that from my previous brush so I bought it only for curls.   I am giving it only four stars because it leaves my hair a little frizzy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw the TV ad for this Spin Air Rotating Styler and I ordered it immediately. I looked forward to my first use and washed my hair in preparation.  The styler has warm, hot or cool air which just blows and then has 2 buttons to press for rotation forward or backward. The buttons are close together and it&#x27;s very easy to hit one when you want the other.  The bristles are very soft and they are not firm enough to catch my hair into the brush.  There is no way that I could use this styler to go from wet to dry...  It would take hours.  I had to dry my hair at least 75% with my old dryer and brush before I could even use the styler.  It did NOT add volume.  I have long, heavy hair, so maybe this would work for someone with less hair.  The results were not what I hoped or expected so I am returning the styler.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair &amp; I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have difficulty using a blow dryer &amp; a brush, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great if you have tendonitis or carpal tunnel in your wrists.  The constant turning of the brush is not necessary with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another just to make sure I have a spare!</li>
    <li> After reading the good reviews on this roller brush, I took a chance on it.  My hair is rather thin and fine, and right now it is over processed and dry.  Getting it to look healthy is very difficult. However this rotating brush really gives my hair a great finish! It is shiny and sleek and ends up looking like a pro has been working on it. I like that the heat is not as intense thereby helping my hair out, and I do not have a problem with tangling or knotting as long as I remember to section off my hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> Does nothing to shorten the time my Mom spends on her hair, so she prefers her old blow dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> I would have loved it if it had had a one inch brush because I like wavy hair.  It would be great for someone with long hair who wanted to smooth it out on days she didn&#x27;t shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really bummed...The thing works exactly as described; very easy to handle and use. But, I have long, very fine hair and LOTS of it. Hairstylists can never believe how much hair I have, despite how fine it is. I have never been able to do anything other than straighten it because it&#x27;s simply lifeless. So I was hoping this would help turn that around. But it does nothing for me. It will flip out the ends of my hair, but that&#x27;s it. No volume, no texture, no shape. Plus the \\&quot;no static\\&quot; bristles make my hair static-y. But like I said, the thing works exactly as described and I&#x27;m sure it would work well for anyone with a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair type. Long thin hair, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this product before.  I love it.  It&#x27;s perfect for fine hair, especially if it&#x27;s cut in a bob.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this brush and I am so happy with this purchase!  I could never style my hair like a professional before but now I can!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this brush is wonderful.  I wash my hair, let it get almost dry and then use this brush.  It makes my hair straight so that when I set it, it doesn&#x27;t frizz and it&#x27;s stays pretty straight.  I set my hair to get the style right not to curl it.  It would be better if it had more force when the dryer part blows on the hair, but it&#x27;s still better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  I&#x27;d like to see a brush with smaller circumference because I have shorter hair.  All in all, I really like this brush.</li>
    <li> This is literally the most amazing thing to happen to my hair since the salon!!!!! I could NOT believe how easy it was to do my hair. It came out so soft and smooth. It was like silk. Why every woman does NOT own one of these I do NOT know. For the price I paid, It goes above and beyond anything you could purchase for this price. I am absolutely shocked they sell this product so cheap. I truly have a heart felt thanks to the creators of this amazing styling tool! They saved my hair! No more frying my hair with the straightener. If you have doubts about purchasing this product, rest assured it will be the best investment you have ever made on your hair!</li>
    <li> Well my wife is working with this new spinning hair care item. She hasn&#x27;t bitched yet so this is a very good review if she is happy with her hair. Thank you for a good product, you have saved my life.</li>
    <li> I bought this Air Rotating Styler because of the rave reviews and am so happy with my purchase. I blow dry my hair 80% dry and then use this to smooth and finish my short bob. I live in a very humid climate and this styler helps control the frizzies (smoothing serum a must as well). My only complaint is cleaning the styler is difficult because the brush is not removable. I would recommend the option of a smaller brush for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first ordered the product as it seemed all the reviews were too good to be true but the reviews really were accurate.  The Infinitipro Spin Brush made styling my hair simple.</li>
    <li> Great concept but it didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected it to. At some points it pulled my hair to hard. I was scared it would rip my hair out</li>
    <li> Once I was able to get the hang of this I have really enjoyed the styler.  My hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been before and it looks so much better than when blow dry it myself with the round brush.  I can totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was difficult to work with.  It would tangle and pull out my hair or as my hair wound up on the brush, it would tangle and cause the rotation to cease.  Not recomended</li>
    <li> Initially, I purchased this when my hair was considered long.  Did not have best of luck using it.  Seemed to tangle into my hair. Ouch...very frustrating.  When I cut my hair above shoulder,  I revisited this and it worked great.  No further tangling and pulling into my hair.  Worked easily.  Would recommend for a shorter hair only</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect..my hair is in a BoB and chopped in the back..it came out shiny..and looks like it was blow dried @ the Salon!! My hair is very fine..I need to separate it when blowing because it will tend to tangle.. only neg is I wish that it came with a little smaller brush to exchange when needed.. does my bangs terrific..glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product.  I have longer length slightly wavy hair.  It makes my hair look very smooth and not frizzy.  HOWEVER, there is \\&quot;cap\\&quot; at the very top of the product where my hair gets stuck in the seam/crack where the cap meets the shaft.  When the product is spinning, my hair gets spun into the seam and pulls my hair and breaks it off.  There needs to be no cap -- it should be one continuous piece,  Also, you lose a lot of hair using this product -- you can see it in the brush after every use.  I agree with others that the heat settings need to be improved.  It gets too hot to use,  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair and I wish the bristles had a little more &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; to them, but this styler does help smooth and curl the ends.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick wavy hair that requires LOTS of product year-round to tame frizz.  This styler is the only way I have ever been able to blow dry my hair straight and frizz free. The process is very simple: First I either let my hair air dry to around 80% or dry it with a traditional dryer until it is 80% dry. Then, I apply a heat protector (Biosilk), use the styler, and finish with a little bit of Aveda universal styling cream to tame any flyaways.   I was afraid the styler might knot my hair, but it never has in the month I&#x27;ve been using it.  My only complaint is that, on rainy days, my hair will start to curl again.  However, my hair does this even if I have used my chi flat Iron on the highest setting, so I think that&#x27;s just my hair.  This also makes my hair look way better than with a flat iron; it gives more volume and body like when my stylist uses a round brush to blow it out!</li>
    <li> It IS TOO BIG.  It does not make my hair fuller, actually made it seem thinner.  I usually use hot rollers...back to them.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what this brush can do! I have been getting so many complments on my hair everytime I use this brush1 My hair is super shiny and definitely has that salon look. It does take a bit of time to master, but if you just do small sections there is minimal tangling in the brush.</li>
    <li> Does not work for curling mustaches - scrapes the nose, too. Beards are also problematic - does not remove bird&#x27;s nests, as the birds object.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It makes my hair shiny and full of body. My hair looks better than ever. It is also very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like the flat iron does.</li>
    <li> This is my third Spin Dryer.  All of them still work; I just love this dryer so much that I wanted one for my home, one for the gym bag, and one to keep at our weekend home.  I use this dryer in place of a styling brush and use it at the same time I am drying my hair with a regular hand-held hair dryer (yes, a dryer in each hand).  Styling/drying this way virtually halves the styling time, and in the process adds great volume and style to my thick, baby-fine, shoulder-length, long, layered, bob.  Did I say I love this product?!?  :-)</li>
    <li> After seeing amazing reviews on Amazon, I was disappointed when I saw this. I don&#x27;t think this works very well at all! I have mid-back length hair and using the rotating brush completely tangles it up and rips a lot of hair out of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the dryer function is quite nice and you can use it as a brush to dry your hair. My Asian hair is naturally very straight and shiny. This does not give me any extra volume and it takes 5x as long to dry my hair with just this tool. I barely use it anymore, but when I do I dry my hair with a normal dryer until it&#x27;s completely dry and use this to try to style the ends. It doesn&#x27;t work very well. Any minimal curl that is achieved is dead in about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how anybody would get any results as shown on the box with this rotating styler, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Purchase Worth Every Penny!  As a beauty blogger with fibromyalgia my hair is always a huge struggle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I opened up my Infiniti Pro....I haven used my dryer or any other device!&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight and easy to use there is no stress on how to figure out how to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with thin hair...I can recreate the look of an authentic professional &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; at home without the cost!</li>
    <li> Great dryer &amp; styler - I have fine hair just below my ears and its easy and quick to use.  Keeps my hair shiny and frizz free with some body.  I would like to keep bounce and body for the day and wondering what serum to use with this styler and also how to wash the brush head?</li>
    <li> After getting used to working with this brush, I&#x27;ve been using it as a volumizing straightener.  It gives my hair body and is easy to use.  My hair tangles badly and every styler I&#x27;ve used leaves my hair a mess.  The Infinitipro really doesn&#x27;t tangle my very long, thick hair.  I wish there were smaller brush sizes for my bangs and for curling.</li>
    <li> I found this product a bit clumsy and difficult to use. As someone who likes no-fuss hair styling and products, it&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to use regularly. I also didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in styling. It gave my hair a nice smooth look and nice curl, but I could have used a simpler tool and achieved the same look. Someone with more patience for hair styling might be able to get the hang of this and enjoy it more than I did.</li>
    <li> it wont dry sopping wet hair but it is amazing if you towel dry your hair first ! So much easier than a round brush and a hair dryer. I have thick wavy hair and i love this thing</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it everyday! Took a day or 2 to get used to using it but can&#x27;t imagine not having it now. I have chin length hair with a lot natural curl just in the back. I use this dryer to straighten the humps out in the back. Much easier than trying to use a round brush &amp; blow dryer!</li>
    <li> It saves me so much time when I wash my hair. I use turbie towels to dry hair. I use 1 then replace with another while I do stuff around the house. Then a lot of moisture is out of my hair and I use the styling rotating brush. It works great. Sometimes I follow with a curling iron but I really don&#x27;t need to for a sleeker look.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely frizzy, i bought this thinking it may help tame it. However, it needs my hair to be treated with a lot of products before it can deliver the results it promised. More over, with out those chemicals in my hair, using this styler made it even frizzier and dry. It is a good styler though. If you want to style your hair, it will help you do it in few minutes.  Buy it if you want a styler, not a frizz tamer.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, medium length hair. My hair typically air dries within 30 minutes. I found this did not dry it at all. The &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; component did absolutely nothing, it was not strong at all. So, I have to dry my hair will a normal hair dryer till it&#x27;s just barely all dry, and then use this. This also does not get hot at all, so it was just like using a round brush on my hair. It wouldn&#x27;t dry it and it didn&#x27;t curl the ends at all. Huge waste. The only thing it would do is snag my hair if it got too close to the edge and turn into a huge knot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had. I have thin hair and this really  lifts the hair and makes it look salon perfect .</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled with this hairstyler!  I was hesitant to pay the money that it cost but, wow, am I glad I did!  My hair is cut in a medium length angled bob. Before I bought this I would wash my hair then blow it dry. I&#x27;d try to use a round brush as I dried my hair but it wasn&#x27;t easy and I usually gave up. Then I&#x27;d use a curling iron or hot rollers to give my hair body and style it under at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;  Now all I use is this styler and it only takes me a few minutes.  You simply turn it on and hot air (medium or high heat, or cool) blows out through vents in the brush.  Lift up a section of your hair and hold the styler at your roots. Slowly pull the brush through to the ends of your hair as you push the &#x27;spin&#x27; button. Do this with each section and your finished.&lt;br /&gt; After just 7 or 8 minutes my hair is dry, styled, and full of body. If you&#x27;re trying to decide if you should buy this or not I recommend you do.  I could be happier.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love saving my wrist  from turning and turning a brush.  Wish it blew a little harder/warmer but love it thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not light but still not as heavy as my pistol grip 1500 watt VS dryer</li>
    <li> I was looking for a repalcement for the Revo brush I had bought a few years back from an infomercial. I saw the infinitpro at Kmart for more than $50. I looked on Amazon, saved $20 &amp; received free shipping. I love this styler! I have really thick wavy hair &amp; use the infinitipro along with my blow-dryer &amp; my hair is dry &amp; smooth in approximately 10 minutes. I have recommended this styler to firneds, who also have loved the results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it. It is way to use and adds great curl and fullness to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have a health problem that is making it difficult for me to style my hair, and I either needed to find a way to perform that task myself or continue taking the time and paying the money to get it washed and styled professionally.  When I happened across this drying, spinning brush on Amazon I thought it might be the solution to my problem, at least for now, and I am thrilled to say it is !  I have only used it a few times, so I cannot promise it will last forever, but I can use it NOW, and it lets me retain some independence as my disease progresses.  I dry my hair partially before using the brush, and then I use the heat to curl the hair sections, and I follow with cool air to set the soft curls.  I hope the inventor of this handy appliance gets rich from his/her invention!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest thing ever made,.  Wish I had bought the smaller brush size, but it&#x27;s still amazing.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It would be MUUUUUUUUUCH better if  the roller will be not that loud.</li>
    <li> Used it once, it&#x27;s very slow at drying for my needs (full time working mom). Ended up blow dry my hair and curl with iron, still faster.</li>
    <li> When I broke my right arm recently,  I couldn&#x27;t style my hair with the usual blowdryer and brush. I felt miserable until I discovered this rotating hair brush. With one hand I could dry and style my hair and the results were awesome. My arm is back to normal but I continue to use the brush. It has been a lifesaver :)</li>
    <li> to adjust to the direction and speed of rotation. So sometimes my hair is very quickly uncoiled or tightened on the rotating brush. I kept it thinking that i would learn how but ............</li>
    <li> This worked better than I imagined it would.  It was packaged nicely; however, didn&#x27;t include instructions but was easy to use.  I couldn&#x27;t wait so I washed my hair and left it damp and went for it!  It heated up nicely and dried my hair more quickly than I thought it would.  I have really thick hair and it grabbed it nicely and rotated without getting stuck.  There were only two things I would have preferred: its slightly heavy to hold with one hand for a period of time with it grabbing your hair; I found that I needed to use both at most times to hold it.  Also, you need to hold down a button for it to rotate, it would be helpful if you could click the button and it continued to rotate without holding the button down.  Overall, I love it, my hair feels smoother than normal with lots of volume!</li>
    <li> i have had brush dryers before. they had metal barrels and short bristles and didnt spin.&lt;br /&gt;this is different the barrel is ceramic and the bristles are long.&lt;br /&gt;it takes longer to blow dry my hair with a dryer and brush than it does with the spin air.&lt;br /&gt;the brush is huge and my hair is long. about 3 inches below my bra in the back.&lt;br /&gt;i got plenty of volume and lots of shine. my hubby noticed the shine right away. this is important because i have colored and highlighted hair and blonde doesnt always shine and sometimes look dry if it is or not.&lt;br /&gt;it takes getting used to but after the first time you will be a pro.&lt;br /&gt;almost a professional  blow out.</li>
    <li> Great brush for long hair. I have bottom of ear length hair in layers. That barrel  is very large. I had to return it to Amazon.  If they ever make it in smaller barrel I would order it again.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL DONT KNOW HOW I DONE WITH OUT IT</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, to offer it for somebody in Europe, and it is not every single one word in specifications for saying it is working in 110 V!</li>
    <li> Amazon had the best price. Have had a revo styler for years. If you have mastered a revo styled you will love this product much more. My hair is much softer and smoother. If you can style with two tools this is for you.  Great product I give it 10 stars!!!!  My hair is a little past shoulder length.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I have curly hair and wanted something to get it straight without any hassels. This product had my pressure up! The air blows luke warm, at best and I had to take too long on each section of my hair. The reason I bought this was because it alledgedly dried wet hair straight. Well, my hair did dry. It eventually air dried waiting on this lackluster machine. A major waste of money!</li>
    <li> Ok ladies, here it is.  I have natural wavy/curly hair, long and thick.  Blowouts at a SALON take at least 45 minutes for me, so I&#x27;m not an easy sell.  When I got this item I was hopeful yet dubious.  GLORY!  The thing works!!  I let my hair get almost 90% dry before using it.  This is key.  Then clip my hair up, pull out a section and move through my whole head.  Amazing results.  My hair is shiny, full-bodied and swingy after using it, even more than a salon blow-out.  The reverse motion really does prevent hair getting stuck or tangled.  I have not even once gotten stuck, and like I said I have thick LONG hair.  One hint:  I start the spinning right at the root and slowly move down to the ends, then let it curl all the way up to my head. This makes sure I have the smoothing effect all the way to the roots.  It&#x27;s great.  The cold shot function seems kind of pointless to me, but maybe it works for thinner hair.  My only complaint is I see no way to clean the bristles at some point down the road.  But I happily give this item 5 stars.  Give it go, long haired, wavy girls -- it works.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product mentioned in a magazine, I was intrigued.  After doing some investigating, sounded like the perfect product for me.  My hair is long and thick with a natural wave. Took me a few tries to get use to it.  However, once I got use to it, was very pleased with the results. This product made my hair straight with volume.  Before this product, I only got this look when I got my hair blow dried at the salon. I am terrible with a dryer/round brush and with my thick hair, it&#x27;d take me forever. Also, my mom tried my infinitipro and she loved it.  She has very fine hair and this product added body and volume to her hair. I just got this product for her christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I have spent decades trying to find a product that works as well as this one does. I am hopeless with a round brush and blow dryer. This really gives me the ability to get that salon look I could never accomplish with a non-rotating brush.  Its necessary to blow dry your hair until its almost dry first and then use this. The non-rotating brush always left me with  a kind of dated &#x27;page boy\\&quot; look. This brush gives me the ability for the first time to get shiny straight hair with just a hint of a bend in it. I can pull out my bangs with just the right amount of lift. It leaves my hair shiny and bouncy- unlike the non-rotating brush which always left my hair looking overstyled.  I love love this little device!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out from very short, and it&#x27;s now just below chin length.  This Spin Brush has saved my sanity more than once.  I&#x27;m not very handy with styling my hair (hence, the short cut), but this tool makes me look like a pro.  I no longer consider running for the scissors because of a bad hair day, because I haven&#x27;t had one since I&#x27;ve mastered this product!  It takes a little practice getting the spin to always go in the right direction, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very forgiving, and it only takes about 10-15 minutes to get from frumpy to fabulous.  I just air dry my hair, and when it&#x27;s almost dry just spritz on a heat protection spray and start with the Spin Brush.  Sometimes I section, and sometimes I don&#x27;t, and personally I don&#x27;t see that much difference in adding that extra step.  Give this Spin Brush a try...you&#x27;ll gain a lot of shiny (and Non frizzy!) results.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend. I am so glad he bought it I basically screamed when I unwrapped it.  I have been eyeing this brush for months. Now that I have used it, I can happily say that I really love it. The first time using it is a tough one, and I accidently rotated my hair too tight to my head, rotated the other way and got it stuck. However with a few days of practice, you should get the hang of it.  There are 3 settings, low, high and cool. It doesn&#x27;t rotate on cool which is disapointing because I would like to style my hair without heat since my fine thin hair that is prone to damage.   I also am not sure about the volumizing part, my hair was volumized but not like the after picture of the hair model, it looks more like the before.  But, my hair is super soft and shiny after I use it, and I love that it I can curl my hair under without the blow dryer and the round brush which to me was always so difficult. It weighs practically nothing and for that, I am even happier!</li>
    <li> this blow dryer has been my savior. its better than i could have ever expected. the frizz that ive struggled with all my life is basically non-existent now and my hair is smooth and healthy. only wish they invented this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have semi-thick mid length hair. I would usually air dry my hair then flat iron b/c i was too lazy to blowdry my hair. i have a great flat iron, but it very hard to get volume with just that. I love that i dont have to do much. Very easy to use. Get hot enough to dry my hair &amp; i never have that burning hair smell that you get when you get the hair dryer too close to your hair. My arms arent burning from holding up a heavy blow dryer &amp; rotating a brush. simple &amp; easy. The only reason i didnt give this a full 5 stars is because of the brush bristles. With my kind of hair &amp; usage (i use this about 2-3 times a week)i can already tell that im going to wear them out. I would def recommend this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d like this styler and was so pleasantly surprised at just how much I do like it.  My hair is long, wavy and a little on the dry side, so I wash it every other day.  I love this just as much for the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair because it adds a luster along with smoothing out the \\&quot;bed head\\&quot;.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about this, let me just say two things: the barrel is 2\\&quot; around, so if you have really short hair - you&#x27;ll probably need a smaller (skinnier) barrel (1\\&quot;)to get the full effects of this styling tool; and if your hair is thick and/or curly and wavy like mine, invest in some pelican or butterfly clips and start from the underside of your hair moving up piece by piece until you reach the top layer.  You&#x27;ll get smoother and straighter results that way and won&#x27;t overwork the top layer (where the damage shows the most).</li>
    <li> I love this styler!  I used to dry my hair with a blow dryer and a round brush which was very hard with the arthritis in my hands.  With Infinitipro Spin, it&#x27;s so much easier and faster.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great item for my daughters hair. The spin feature tangled up in her hair and it took 20 minutes for me to carefully get this out of her hair. No matter how much you stroke the brush down it quickly grabbed her hair and got stuck. This might be better for fine hair but not thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could travel with a carry on.  I didn&#x27;t include my hair dryer or my curling iron or my flat iron, just this.  It did what I needed.  I practiced with it for a few weeks prior and not only did I get a lot of compliments on my hair- a few people told me I looked skinnier too!  LOL!  You have to practice with it and work with it but it&#x27;s a neat concept and works well.  It does take more time to dry but when you are on vacation and have time, or are at home and can use a hair dryer to get your hair damp and then use this - you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  I do not regret this purchase in any way!</li>
    <li> Worked great for a little while before it broke!  Perhaps I used it a dozen times before it rendered itself useless.  The switch which controlls the spinning barrel broke, the Styler spins continuously and will not shut off.  Don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
    <li> Although I like the fast styling I gave it only two stars because there is no way to clean the brush! It means that it can quickly get dirty and you have to either live with it or throw it out! I used to have a brush called the revo styler that worked like this and was cordless with replaceable brushes and now I wish I could get one (they don&#x27;t make them anymore).  I would say don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s too expensive to just have for a short amount of time, especially if you have oily hair like me.  Plus in summer even if you wash your hair daily it gets dirty. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> For me this works much better than a model I purchased about a year ago from another company.  That one did not have  the dryer component, was much  more expensive, heavy and burned my hair and face.  I  got this one  at a good price by opening the amazon charge.  Good buy for me.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product, I did not realize that the brush will not rotate if the dryer is on high speed so I thought I had received a defective product. I was wrong. I love this dryer and have been looking for one since the one I purchased several years ago from a TV infomercial quickly died. This dryer does not tangle in my hair and did a excellent job of blow drying my style just the way I like it. I have a very difficult time drying my hair with a round brush and blow dryer but this product really did as promised. I have very thick hair and it only took a short time to style and dry my hair on the med setting. I will definitely buy this product again. I did not find it too heavy as I saw in another comment. I found it to be good quality and am glad someone finally made this product in a better quality than the others I have had.</li>
    <li> This rotating styler has its uses, but it isn&#x27;t for everyone. It&#x27;s probably best for hair that&#x27;s not too long and not too short. And you have to know that if you start with very wet hair, you&#x27;re in for a long session with your Infinitipro Spin Air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it&#x27;s pretty hard to tangle your hair with it. You do need some eye-hand coordination to make sure you&#x27;re spinning it in the right direction, and if you plan to end with dry hair, you&#x27;ll probably want to air-dry a while first or else start with a conventional dryer. The Infinitipro seems to leave hair shiny and it certainly adds volume to my hair, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here are some things I don&#x27;t understand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so big? It&#x27;s 13 inches long and the handle has a circumference of 7 inches. My bathroom is quite small and this thing takes up WAY more room than I can spare. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t they offer a smaller brush head? The brush is 6 inches around, and lots of people have hair shorter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an all-purpose hairdryer/styler, this probably won&#x27;t be the one. But if you&#x27;re in the market for its particular skills--and have room to store it--then you may be happy with it because what it does, it does well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Bulger, 2011</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but I just had to for this item! I think its perfect! It dries and styles my hair super fast. Best of all it feels like a massage to your head! It gives me lots of volume and smooths out my thick, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Better for people with longer hair!  works great but I have very short hair!  too big for me!  But great quality, would like a smaller roller for my haif!</li>
    <li> I have chin length curly kinky thick hair and I&#x27;m always straightening it. I thought I would try this because the two handed approach gets tiring and I give up before my hair is smooth. This does the smoothing AND cuts down time required. love love love it.  so glad I got it. I used to use an iron on my whole head after drying and now I only do the top to smooth the bangs. Great Product and very sturdy.  If it breaks (for some reason) I&#x27;ll get another one!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very hard to straighten and to smooth.  This Conair brush straightens my hair and smooths the cuticle while it is drying it.  That&#x27;s not all.  It also gives a great head massage while rolling and straightening the roots.  I love this brush.  It has reduced my drying time by half.  I used to use an ionic hairdryer and a round brush which took a long time because my hair does not dry nor straighten easily. I have a lot of hair. I also had to follow it with an airbrush to smooth the cuticle.  Not anymore.  I don&#x27;t dread washing my hair any longer because I look forward to using this brush; it&#x27;s faster and the soft bristles give a great massage. This is he best purchase I ever made for my hair.  To smooth and straighten the roots, be sure and push the brush while it is rolling against the scalp and up though the roots of the swath of hair that you are drying.  It works! I do follow it with a flat iron.  I always did that because my hair is too fluffy and curvy without it.  The flat iron gives a look that I like.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My hair looks SO much healthier since I have started using it. My split ends have vanished and my hair looks more volumous and shiny. My hair stays tame up to 2 days after using it. I have long hair (down to my mid-back), I let my hair air-dry for 10 minutes, then dried my roots with a normal hair dryer for about 5 minutes, and then spent about 30 minutes with the actual Spin Air Brush. It was time well spent!  Things you should know:  1. For best looking hair start by brushing through your hair, making sure there are no tangles, and applying a heat protectant/shine serum which will protect your hair from heat damage and tame the stray hairs, also add a mousse if you are looking for more volume/hold. I end by lightly spraying finishing spray (adds shine and light hold).  2. The air-flow is super weak. The air-flow on \\&quot;high\\&quot; is just enough to give it some shape- it will not dry your hair completely (or even close to completely). For best results, start with a regular hair dryer and work your fingers through your hair while you use it allowing your roots to dry completely. The rest of your hair can remain damp/slightly wet. Then section your hair and use the Spin Air Brush on one 2 inch section of hair at a time. It goes fairly quickly since your hair isn&#x27;t too wet, and this will keep it from getting tangled and provide the most volume.   3. The brush does not have to spin, although it works much better when it does in my opinion. If you want the volumous look you can spin your hair up around the brush, hold it in place for approximately 30 seconds- 1 minute, and then reverse roll to release your hair. This will create a loose curl. If you just let it spin without holding the hair in place it will still give you some added volume, and the ends of your hair will roll under/out, but you will not have the va-va-voom effect like the model in the ad (fair warning).  I definitely think that this product was worth the money. I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I started using it! The benefits go beyond just the day you use it too, it really seems to have \\&quot;healed\\&quot; my damaged hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair brush, it makes my hair shiny and gives it a great shape.&lt;br /&gt;It does not pull or yank hair out, and is easy to use. Saves so much wrist action and arm pain trying to get a style.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for shortish to longer hair. I have short bangs and sides in front and longer in back,&lt;br /&gt;and you will quickly learn how to engage the roller for each length.&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased I found something that actually IMPROVES the result and lightens a previous chore.&lt;br /&gt;It looks bigger than you think, but do not let it scare you, works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Note, it does not roll when choosing the cold air selection, use low or high warm for the mechanism to engage.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is well contructed, but it just does not dry my wet thick wavy long hair. The only way this item could work for me if if I were to dry my hair 90% with a blow dryer than used this to style it. Unfortunately that would defeat the point. Sending mine back. Probably will work very well on fine medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I bought it from amazon.com, the power of the motor is so low and it does not produce enough hot air, plus the rotation power is so low that makes it completely useless.  For returning you need to pay 16$ for shipping costs!  Just do not buy it, it is waste of your time and money!!!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance. It&#x27;s not at all difficult to use and I got good results on my first try. I do not find it heavy or hard to hold. It does a good job on my chin-length, fine hair, but I will agree that it would not work for shorter hair, and Like some other reviewers, I would prefer a smaller brush. I have to finish my style with my smaller brush and dryer to get the volume I want. Overall, this is a good product and leaves my hair very shiny. For longer hair it would be perfect. If the brush was smaller I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will leave your hair a static mess, then the Conair Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler is definitely the product for you.  If not, then don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this thing to be THE ANSWER to flat hair... Nope! The high heat setting didn&#x27;t do too much with my damp, almost dry hair; wasn&#x27;t as hot nor had enough blow dry power for my thin, straight hair. I give it 3 stars because it was over all an okay product and in the end, it did dry my hair but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair (shoulder length). I have tried many styling products, but nothing really worked well - usually leaving my hair a bit frizzy. Using a flat iron removed the curls but left my hair flat. This rotating styler works great. I have no problem with it tangling in my hair. My hair actually looks better after a few hours and still looks good the next day. It is very easy to use and it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to using the rotating brush. My daughter likes using it without rotating (she has much longer hair). With her longer hair, the rotating action tends to wind up her hair. But the styler works great on her hair without rotating. It give her smooth, full curls.  It does get a bit tiring when using it, but maybe that is because my hair is so thick. I have started drying my hair a bit more with the regular dryer before using the rotating styler. But the result is wonderful. My hair is much more smooth, with a fuller look. Not flat like with a flat iron.   This styler isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is alot better than any other drying tool I have used. It would be nicer if the handle was a bit smaller around and if there was one higher heat setting (it has 2 heat settings and 1 cool setting). But overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> so far I like it. I wish it had an interchanging brush so u could have an inch brush and 2 inch brush</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I expected it to be. The brush only spins when you have the button pushed down and it can go in either direction which is great. I have long hair and like to wear it straight most of the time this brush helps straighten and makes it silky and shiny. For me this was a great purchase. I prefer using this brush over my \\&quot;iron\\&quot;. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t work like it shows everywhere and the worst part is I have no where to return it.</li>
    <li> Great product works beautiful!!!!</li>
    <li> This rotating brush dries and styles my hair in one step.  Because the brush moves faster than I can move with a regular hair dryer and brush, it actually dries my hair faster.  Doesn&#x27;t really curl, but gives my shoulder length hair a nice bend.</li>
    <li> Have had this for almost three years now and works very well. It takes sometime to get used to it so, don&#x27;t be disappointed at the beginning. The only drawback is that if you do a large section of your hair, it&#x27;ll get stuck in between the rotating brush and stick on either ends of the brush and you basically have to cut the hair.</li>
    <li> So I came to Amazon and read all their reviews and ordered it.  I love this!  Holding you arms above your head for extended periods of time, gets harder as you get older.  And since my breast cancer.  Takes the same amount of time  as a good blow dry, but now you have style.  I intend to get one for my 40 yr old daughter, for her birthday.  I love Amazon, my go to for everything.</li>
    <li> Too weak of a blower and not enough heat for my thick, wavy hair.  I followed instructions perfectly but there was no way it was going to dry my hair.  Gave it to a friend with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical as many of you are , so I went on you tube and watch couple of videos and I thought I would give it a try ! and am so glad I did .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1- easy to use&lt;br /&gt; 2- works great for 2 tools in one( brush and hot air)&lt;br /&gt;3- air is as hot as dryer&lt;br /&gt;4- saves times once you get used to it&lt;br /&gt;5- I own it for 6 months so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have short hair this is not for you .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some reviewers complained  about the big handle but I actually found not a problem and didnt even notice it, the brush is kind of big but its the same size as my regular one so thats plus for me&lt;br /&gt;overall  i would buy another one if this stops working</li>
    <li> Nice to style your hair as you dry it but I have really tick hair and this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> ok let me first state that I have short, fine hair. I recently cut 7 inches off because my hairdresser promised it would be maintenance free.... hahaha (I fell for it again). I hate spending anytime with my hair and after (trying) to use round brushes and a blow-dryer I was ready to give up. I bought one thing that did not turn (just a brush that had air blowing out) and that was also too much work for me. Surprisingly, my male heterosexual coworker said- why not use that thing from tv. But I read the reviews and most were great from this so here we are. I guess I could see how your hair could get caught but I don&#x27;t have long hair......</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype about this product. It didn&#x27;t work correctly, or actually at all. It burned the hair, failed to straighten, and cost too much.&lt;br /&gt;Unimpressed.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Would defiantly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product at retail stores but not this brand! This is a better product.</li>
    <li> As soon as this dryer/styler arrived today I just had to try it.  I took a quick shower, then wrapped my hair up to get it mostly dry.  In less than 5 minutes, with practically no effort my hair is dry, shiny, and perfectly styled.  If it helps, my hair is about 7 inches long on top, with sides and back tapering to just the top of my neck...kind of like the old wedge cut.  This device is perfect for my style.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this spin brush for about a month and use it everyday.  I think it&#x27;s a great product as long as you understand what, I think, is it&#x27;s intended purpose.  First, I have very curly hair and there is no way this could replace my hair dryer.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intended to. I think the hot air is just enough to blow heat through the brush to style the hair. Second, I think it&#x27;s intended for medium to long hair.  Mine is a chin length, layered bob with medium length layers and it&#x27;s long enough, but the barrel is just too large for short hair or short layers.  I blow dry my hair first with my regular styling hair dryer which has a brush on it - in my case to staighten as I dry.  Then, I use the spin brush to add volume and lift which I could, only, get before with a round brush in one hand and the hair dryer in the other. I, always, felt like I needed a third hand.  The spin brush does this very well and much easier. The best part about it is it spins in both directions.  As you move from side to side or back to front, you don&#x27;t have to be a contourtionist. Simply, press the other button and it spins the other way. This is fabulous feature.  All in all, this is a great tool for adding lift, volume and slight curl to medium and long hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this had it for over a year. Hate blowing my hair out. This does it for me. All with one hand  Love it so much about to buy another one</li>
    <li> It is quite good, does everything it is suppose to do. You have to dry your hair before using this. My only problem is the size, it is bulky!</li>
    <li> It eliminates the need to have a dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. I bought it about a year ago and am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this brush but as soon as I opened it, it was not spinning very well.  I started trying it in a small section of my hair and it completely stopped spinning.  I unplugged it and waited a few minutes and tried it again and as soon as I pressed the spin button the motor started smelling.  Maybe I got a lemon, because it seems like such a good idea and I love how big the barrel is, but I wish I could give it no stars!!</li>
    <li> Holy WOW~!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked and amazed! I have crazy curly hair that is never managable.In under ten minutes my hair looks like i just had it professionally done. This is the best hair product I have ever used. My husband bought it for me as a gift when he saw I had it in my wish list and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works.  Thank you thank you thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, Best Hair Product I Have Ever Used. Ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my Hot Tools styling brush finally bit the dust (after two years of faithful service). [[ASIN:B0001YXXUY Hot Tools HT1074 Anti-Static Ionic Hot Air Brush with Ion Technology, 1000 Watts, 1 1/2 Inches]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Infinitipro styler is probably better for my hair, but it takes longer now to do may hair now and I feel like there isn&#x27;t quite enough air or heat coming out of the brush. I also felt like I had a little more control over the end result with the Hot Tools styling brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the rotating feature to be annoying. I wish it has a loc so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally activating the spinning action. Maybe I would find that a useful feature if my hair was longer (I currently have shoulder-length hair). And I have a feeling that I will like this brush even less when I cut my hair back to just-below-the-chin-length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this styler is WAY better than trying to use a hair dryer and round brush. That&#x27;s just a skill I will never master.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself with Christmas money.  I had read several reviews on this product and was intrigued.  It is fairly easy to use once you figure out which way to make the brush spin.  For me this saves time from having to dry my hair while using a round brush, or drying and then using a flat iron.  Fewer tools to work with, WOO HOO!  My six yr old daughter will actually let me use this on her hair too.  She runs away when she sees me using the flat iron.  The rotation actually tickles if you bump your ear, she is not afraid of being burnt by this.  After I use the air brush, my hair has body for most of the day.  I don&#x27;t have body very long if I use a flat iron.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if it actually helps smooth my hair, but a neighbor commented that it looked pretty smooth.  My only disappointment is that I am unable to make my hair flip up at the bottom, I have only been able to curl it under.  Just need to practice more though.  I asked my hairdresser what she thought of this product.  She told me that items like this are more gimmicky than anything...</li>
    <li> The idea of this product is exciting but there are several upgrades needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It overheats quickly-it would be nice to see a model that didn&#x27;t get so hot&lt;br /&gt;2. The drying time is frustrating for long hair&lt;br /&gt;3. The motor for the brush spinning is weak-unlike it&#x27;s competition, the Revo hairstyler.&lt;br /&gt;4. It tangles easily into your hair. I&#x27;ve used the Revo in the past so I believe I&#x27;ve acquired the skill for using this type of rotating brush but I still struggle with it tangling, especially with longer hair&lt;br /&gt;5. The bristles on the brush leave more to be desired. They&#x27;re a little coarser than I&#x27;m used to and it doesn&#x27;t give that sleek look that the boar hair does on the Revo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That about covers it. It&#x27;s still a good little brush for the money, but don&#x27;t expect miracles of shine or it saving you time.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would give me a little shine and lift. It is very large and awkward to use, but even once I got the hang of using it, it wouldn&#x27;t give my hair any shine or polished effect. I still felt I had to use a straightener afterwords. It did leave a little flip on the ends of my hair, but no real volume at the roots. My hair is below shoulder length with long layers. I don&#x27;t see a benefit in using the Infinitipro over a blow dryer and straightener.</li>
    <li> I have long surely hair and I alway use my straightening iron and it works. I wanted to try something else that will harm my hair less. I had one of these but another brand and it worked for me so I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone says it&#x27;s great and the ratings are high. But I didn&#x27;t experience what others did.&lt;br /&gt;Reasons for me not liking it:&lt;br /&gt;The heat is not hot enough. (It&#x27;s warm and if you have curly hair it is not enough heat)&lt;br /&gt;THe rotation is hard to get used to and you get your hair stuck in it a lot especially at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;It pulled out my hair and when I was done a hand full of my hair was stuck to the product.!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of time and when I was done after an hour my hair went back to curly!!&lt;br /&gt;It simply doesn&#x27;t work. It might work for those with shorter and straighter hair but if you have curly hair don&#x27;t think about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I need to start searching again for a better one.</li>
    <li> I viewed the videos and followed the instructions and it was working just fine.  After about 5 mins it stopped rotating counterclockwise.  I turned it off thinking maybe it was overheating, then tried again.  Nope, it stopped working.  I returned this, but it is a great idea (if it only worked longer than the 1st try).</li>
    <li> This thing is like magic. I&#x27;m completely disabled when it comes to doing my own hair, so I&#x27;ve always kept a really simple hair style that requires no maintenance in the morning besides washing and air drying. Recently I got a shorter cut that just didn&#x27;t look right when dried naturally, so I had to figure out a way to wear it until it grew out. My mom recommended this so I went to her house and tried it out, and immediately ordered my own. Rotates both ways with the touch of a button, high, low, and cool air settings, it&#x27;s perfect. Even now that my hair has grown out to a longer length, I decided to take a risk and had my hair cutter give me side bangs! I use this every morning after my shower just to style my bangs. It literally takes about 1 minute to get my bangs looking perfect, and then I am out the door.</li>
    <li> It helps speed up the drying/styling process. I have shoulder length hair that is layered. It can work well in some spots. Still need to use a smaller curling iron for bangs and some of hte other spots.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to get the 2 in barrell, fearing that it would not work well for my chin length hair.  I&#x27;m so glad I was wrong.  It works great for my hair.  I have thin, baby fine blond hair cut chin length with layers only up to an inch higher than my length.  It dries and styles my hair at the same time.  Have not gotten it tangeled in my hair or my daughter&#x27;s, who has butt length hair.  It gives volume, body and shine.  Some round brushes have made my ends like shaggy and frayed, no such issues here! I have gotten more compliments on how my hair looks recently than I have in my entire life time.  I wish I had found this hot air dryer sooner!  My only concern is for how long the brush will last.  It would be nice if Conair made this to have replacement brushes so you do not have to buy a whole new appliance when the brush is done.  But I have only had this a few weeks, so hopefully I don&#x27;t have to worry about that any time soon!  UPDATE: its not the brush I should have been worrying about, but the motor for the spin action giving out.  It still works, but one direction is much slower than the other.  I have tried to clear all the hair out of it to see if tangled hair is causing it to slow, but to no avail.</li>
    <li> I personally had trouble using this product. I would try to rotate the brush and pull outward like it said to, however my hair would get tangled and pulled into the brush. It was kind of painful. Of course, I might not have been using it appropriately, but I certainly couldn&#x27;t get it to work the way I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally get this.  In Walgreens they had this for $68 I could not believe that!  I spent $38 and got it in 3 days from Amazon!  This is very powerful.  At first glimpse I thought maybe it would tangle my hair or not provide enough air while blowing dry the hair but it works great!  Does not tangle and you can grab any section of the hair and just start rolling into the spin brush.  It does a nice job!  I have color treated hair (shoulder length blonde) so I was concerned with it getting wrapped up because my hair is a little on the dry side.  It does dry faster than I anticipated and maybe because I also have baby fine hair...lots of it but it&#x27;s baby fine and straight.  This I would def recommend if your looking for something to replace your roll brush and blowdryer!  This does the work for you:)  Very satisfied.  I will post later after maybe a month to explain how it&#x27;s holding up under normal wear and tear.</li>
    <li> Bought this a few months ago and let me tell you.... once you get used to it, it works like a dream. I have really problematic hair, frizzy, dry, a few split ends here and there.... most likely from all the years of flat ironing with a 430 degree flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, because my hair is borderline curly too, after washing, I dry my hair slightly, then I use this \\&quot;scalp master ceramic thermal hair straightener brush\\&quot;  ([[ASIN:B000NJE14E B000NJE14E]] a few minutes with my regular blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I section off my hair and use the infiniti pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sounds like a lot, but for those of you with nice healthy hair, you&#x27;d be able to skip a few steps and go straight to the infiniti pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really does give you a \\&quot;just walked out of the salon look\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post some before and after photos this weekend.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have very long hair and it can tangle,  if I&#x27;m not paying attention but it&#x27;s user error and not product defect.  It leaves my hair so silky and shiny-I&#x27;ve received many compliments!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a hair dryer that will simultaneously curl your hair this is not what that product does best, but if you have a lot of time to do that, and or your hair dries very quickly then that may work for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that is just above my shoulders. It is mostly straight, but in the back it goes wild. as a new mom I don&#x27;t have the time to mess with my hair, which was half down my back until my baby was about 3 months. I used to meticulously section my hair and round brush it. I bought this hoping to achieve the same look as round brushing while drying. I feel that it is a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to let your hair air dry as much as possible. It still will take as much time maybe 5 or so min less, to get the round brush effect, but you don&#x27;t have to break your wrists or worry about whether or not you are gathering the hair on the back of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I find that using a flat iron is quick but my hair greases up fast with that, and my hair really needs to be dry to do that. So that process is no bueno, but this product will give you tons of volume, and your hair will grease at the same rate as if you had only used a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt; I also don&#x27;t section my hair as much any more, I use like 4 clips instead of 8-12, Its not perfect, but I at least look like I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this and think it would make a great gift for any girl/woman in your life who you&#x27;ve ever seen wear her hair in more than one style in a week.</li>
    <li> I got my Infinitipro Spin Air Rotation Styler three days ago. I&#x27;m going to throw away my hair dryer and 60 different-sized round brushes, and then I&#x27;m going to go get a job as a hair model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I might be being a tad dramatic, but I am in love with my fancy new hair styler. Try though I might for 30 years or so, I could never master the whole round-brush-in-one-hand-and-hairdryer-in-another thing. Now I don&#x27;t have to. My haircut, which I hated because I couldn&#x27;t get it to look at all fluffy or decent in the back, now looks pretty dang good. As others have said, the effects of this device rival a salon blow out. Plus, it takes a fraction of the time that it took me to ineptly round brush my hair. I get out of the shower, dry my bangs immediately (cowlicks must be defeated when wet), and then go do my makeup, letting my hair mostly air dry. By the time I&#x27;m done with my makeup my hair is slightly damp but not soaking, perfect for using my new best friend. 10-15 minutes later, my hair is done. Woo Hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I have only had this three days. Maybe the motor will break next week or something, or it will set fire to my house. There are risks. For now, however, please hum Zip A Dee Doo Dah and visualize bluebirds flying around you. That&#x27;s how happy I feel about my purchase.</li>
    <li> This dried my hair so quickly &amp; nicely! I&#x27;m not one to fuss with my hair (at all) and normally allow it to dry naturally, but since cuting it short (chin length), it flips up, which I do not like at all. The spinning styler allowed me to quickly turn the flip up to curled under and added some body. I still need more practice, but got an acceptable look the very first time. I expected that my hair would get tangled up in the brush, but it didn&#x27;t at all.</li>
    <li> The Infinitipro styler has made my hair shiny and silky smooth!  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use (I have normal hair). After washing my hair, I dry it to about 80% - don&#x27;t use a brush, just my hand. Then I quickly run a brush through my hair to get remove any tangles. I then section off my hair and use the Infinitpro to dry and style. It took only a couple of tries to get the motion down....don&#x27;t grab too much hair, and pull away from your head when you start to feel resistance.  Not sure how it works, but by the time I&#x27;m done (takes about 10 minutes and I have shoulder length hair) my hair is incredibly shiny and smooth....no frizz whatsoever, even after I walk outside.....and I live in Florida! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of this product, as it promises to be some sort of magical device. I have thick wavy hair that can&#x27;t be blow dried at home because of the frizz factor. It&#x27;s very long, coming to below my shoulder blades. Using this tool creates style and tames the frizz, creating a smooth finished look. The best part is that it&#x27;s very easy to use, and takes about 15 minutes to finish off my already 80% air dried hair. This is such a lifesaver, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The spin brush works but not exactly as expected.  The spin brush when my hair is damp seems to rotate slow like it is struggling.  As claimed, I was hoping that the frizz would tame down a little but it seems to have made it worse.  I have fine Asian hair and after using this I have alf Alfa sprouts coming out everywhere.  It does help style my hair the way I want it and I am continuing to use it every morning.</li>
    <li> Love this hairstyler dryer! Wish it was a little more powerful Blow dryer, but it works fine. It rotates in both directions, or you can use the still setting... Though unless you push and hold the buttons , it won&#x27;t rotate. Cool invention by Conair. Helps add body, straighten, or even add curls!</li>
    <li> Loved it! I have fine, thin hair and it looks like I just came from the saloon in 5 min! So easy to use! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and thought this would be a great investment. Not at all!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair it might work great for you otherwise stay away from this.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m not that coordinated and it took me a few tries to get it right, but now I love it. Easier on my hair than regular hair dryers and better than a straightner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to hold a dryer on my right hand and comb on my left hand at the same time. That drives me crazy and busy. It saves the time to get a beautifrul hair style.</li>
    <li> Really makes my hair soft and nice.</li>
    <li> Works great and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe everything you see on TV.  When a product claims to be too good to be true, it usually is. That said, I went ahead and purchased this product yesterday at Target. Ever since the PA weather got warm and humid, I have been batteling with my hair trying to get it to behave.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and went to Target to check it out.  Target&#x27;s price ($59) was WAY more than Amazon, but I needed it \\&quot;NOW!\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t want to wait. I woke up 10 minutes earlier than usual this morning and after I allowed my chin length hair to dry a little, I tackled my head with the spin brush.  I was surprised that it hadn&#x27;t taken me long to figure out which direction to spin the brush.  If you are used to drying your hair with a round brush and a hand held dryer, this will be a snap for you to pick up.  My hair is smooth and shiny and I don&#x27;t have the flyaways that normally erupt. I was also able to tame down that natural dip/wave in the back of my head, something I couldn&#x27;t do with a round brush and blowdryer, no matter how hard I tried. All in all, I think this is a pretty great product that makes it easy to get salon results at home.  However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s claims of super volume ring true.  Maybe it&#x27;s the length of my hair or my lack of experience, but I don&#x27;t see the volume that I was expecting.  It&#x27;s been 2 hours since I did it and by now, I would be thinking of shaving my head.  Not so this morning. It&#x27;s still nice and neat and smooth. The only thing I wish it would have is a button to lock the brush in the spinning motion.  I could see how operating this would be difficult if you had arthritis or shoulder/back/neck problems.  You have to continuously hold the \\&quot;on\\&quot; button down with your thumb.  By the time my hair was styled, my hand was starting to ache.</li>
    <li> I received it today, have not used it, all because I cannot plug it in any of my power outlet in my home, really annoying, when I though I could use it immediately, I still cannot find a proper adaptor for it after a whole afternoon shopping, the strange power plug has one leg big and the other small, need to find it tomorrow, anyone has the same problem using it? I live in Australia, never find an electronic product with a 2 legs power plug, If I cannot find one for it, I have to return the item.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this for my hair!  My hair is shoulder length, naturally curly/ wavy, and thick.  I used to use a hair dryer, straightener, and curling iron.  I can now achieve the look I want with ONE tool.  It has saved me a lot of time.  It takes some practice to use it right, but once you get used to how much hair to section off each time, it&#x27;s pretty easy.  I would give it 5 stars if my hair never tangled, but it did snag a few strays until I got the hang of it.  For me, this product has been a countertop space saving time saver.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> When I came across this Conair product on Youtube I was intrigued. I watched reviews of so many people. Some of them loved it, some said it was so..so. Before this I owned Revo styler(I hope thats what it was called) &amp; my experience with it was bad, it tangled in my hair real bad. So when I saw Conair Infiniti-Pro Spin Air Brush, I was skeptical. But lots of reviews said, it won&#x27;t get tangled in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;So, finally after long time of thinking &amp; rethinking I purchased this from Amazon(as Conair is not available in India).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At First Glance:&lt;br /&gt;When I received my styler, the packaging was practical(company&#x27;s packaging I mean). Big enough to hold the machine as well as small manual, nothing exaggerate. Box was quite tightly packed, so no broken parts. Actual machine is quite sturdy, not at all flimsy. Plastic material used was also quite good along with the bristles which are soft. One thing I loved about this product is that it got pretty good plug with that tester. At first I was very scared to put the plug in socket,as in India we don&#x27;t use this kinda plug.But luckily, one plug point near my dressing table is suitable for this kind. Tester feature is also nice, I mean you won&#x27;t accidentally blow your house apart,if there is any problem with styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience with Styler:&lt;br /&gt;When I got the product, I gave it a test run before actually using it on full head. As I am righty, doing my left side of hair was easy. Bangs was easy too. I can see the volume immediately. But when I was doing my right side of hair section, the spinning rotation got out of hand &amp; the heated part of brush touched my skin just below my ear. It got burned, not really painful but anyone can see the scar. I am not going hold that against the styler as it was my first time with the product &amp; I learned my lesson well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day, I washed my hair &amp; according to instruction dried my hair 70-80% ,then put on some heat protectant &amp; sectioned off the hair to dry my hair spin air style(YAY!!). It was quite hot on low setting for me(I don&#x27;t use high heat on my hair ever &amp; its a start of summer here in India,so pretty hot already). Dried my hair nicely without any trouble from dryer part of the machine. But I can&#x27;t say the same for rotating part of the machine. It didn&#x27;t tangle, but spinning used to stop suddenly in between &amp; suddenly it started. At first I thought I am not pressing the spin button properly, but it wasn&#x27;t that. Spinning stopped whenever it felt like to. Kinda annoying. Otherwise, it was good. But I paid about $69(incl. shipping), so I expected much more better. But at least its not as bad as that Revo styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this product, Amazon said I&#x27;ll be getting this by 11th April(approximately 1 month after ordering). But it was a pleasant surprise when I got it on 31st March. Thumbs up for that. But I have to say, Amazon packed this in a way too big box. I mean, inside the box it was literally the machine in original packing on one side &amp; some air filled bags on the other side.At least they should have put the machine&#x27;s original box in the middle &amp; put those air filled bags around for safety of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:1. Good quality material&lt;br /&gt;2.Not much of a weight&lt;br /&gt;3.Heating is sufficient&lt;br /&gt;4.Nice plug with great testing feature&lt;br /&gt;5.No need to learn how to juggle with Hair dryer &amp; round hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.Spinning stops suddenly during styling&lt;br /&gt;2.Shipping is a quite nightmare for the pocket(for India)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to find the solution for this spinning problem I am facing as soon as possible. If I get it soon,I&#x27;ll update my review here as well as my blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really find any kind of an answer to my spinning problem,I even wrote to Conair directly,they said I should try one more time before seeking any refund or replacement. I did try with all the instructions followed to the last sentence. But still same issue. I am sending this back so that I can get a replacement for it. I like this product, its much better than traditional hair dryer &amp; round brush exercise that my arms get when I try to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon replaced it without much of a trouble. New one is quite good. Still stops,when fallen hair stands are stuck in the rotating part of the brush,but not as frequently as before. I increased a star because of that. I should increase one more for Amazon&#x27;s AMAZING service. But this is a product review,so I am not going to. But Good Work Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Spin Air rotating styler is as pictured. It is not powerful enough to really dry your hair (only 600 watts. But if you use it when hair is almost dry it does work easily. A little confusing at first as to which way the brush is rotating. Good thing is that hair does not get tangled badly. If hair is tangled it comes away from the brush easily. I would buy it again as my hair does get straighter faster than if I used just a blow dryer and brush. My hair type is semi thick and course with curls and/or waves and frizz.</li>
    <li> This styler works wonderfully.  I do dry my hair slightly before I use it or allow to air dry so my hair is not wet but damp.  This dryer does take a little longer to dry by hair (long - past my collar bones) but it is well worth it.  My hair is less frizzy, has more volumn and just looks better.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This styling brush didn&#x27;t work out for me because my hair is just below my chin.  I was trying to achieve body and smoothness.  My hair is too short for this brush because the brush is very large.  I think it would work great on long hair, though.</li>
    <li> Horrible product, barrel maybe 2 inches but with brush about 4-5 inches.  Gets tangled in your hair, dosen&#x27;t curl, or smooth your hair, even putting on high heat won&#x27;t help.  Very uncomfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a low-maintenance type of person, so I don&#x27;t like to spend much time on my hair. But I still want it to look good! I found that if I blow dry, I get volume + frizz. And if I flat iron, I get sleek hair + zero volume. So either way, I wasn&#x27;t getting what I want. This looked like a tool that would provide that sleek, round brushed look that I get at the salon. And it totally does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried using round brushes before, and I hated it! The results may look nice, but it was a full upper-body workout trying to use the brush in my long, thick hair. And it took friggin&#x27; forever! But using this tool gives my hair exactly what I want, a sleek look with volume. And it doesn&#x27;t make my arms feel like I just completed some kind of ironman triathalon the way using a regular round brush did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly talented or skilled when it comes to beauty products and tools, but this brush is super easy and fast to use. I just turn it on and pull the rotating brush through my hair, and the end results look like I have way more talent than I actually do. My hair is voluminous with lots of bounce and movement, and the texture is soft and sleek with no frizzy or frayed ends at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who styles their hair wanting a sleek look. Or anyone who has issues using a round brush. Or anyone who likes low-maintenance and quick styling. Or just anyone with hair, in general.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this and all I can say is that it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have shoulder length hair and thought this would be a good buy. The first one that arrived at my house broke within 3 minutes (I don&#x27;t know what went wrong there because I had watched the instructional videos and did exactly what they did) of using it and I was pretty disappointed however the seller was nice enough to let me send it back and exchange it for another one. Since the second one arrived it has worked beautifully. It does what it says it does and it curls the hair under. I really like it and think it was worth the money!</li>
    <li> I found it much to big to handle. I think more people would purchase it if it came in a smaller size 1\\&quot; or 1 1/2\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was scared to buy the product after reading some reviews, but i did it and is amazing. my hair is fine, dry, curly and frizzy after i used the product is so soft and smooth. i love this product!!</li>
    <li> I have medium to long straight-ish hair with some waves. This leaves my hair perfectly straight and shiny. Not as good as when a professional blow dries my hair, but much easier to use!! I use a hairdryer first until it&#x27;s almost dry but still slightly wet and then use this to make the process faster. Hair does not get stuck.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase of the brush. It is very handy and nice. Thank you so much. I rate this item with five stars.</li>
    <li> I got this styler for my wife,first she had some problm with using it but after  a few days she looks very happy with this styler.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this product! For me it is a game changer. I have long, thick, coarse hair that is cut in long layers. My hair has a tight curl underneath, by the nape of my neck, and gradually gets wavy towards the front. Very odd. My hair is prone to frizz and the Houston climate makes it worse. I have never been very good with a hairdryer (inept is the word)  and the only way for my hair to look great was by visiting the salon for a blow out. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Spin Brush has changed my life. I am now able to style my hair so that it looks soft and smooth with just the right amount of curl at the ends and tons of volume.&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have a learning curve. It took a few go&#x27;s before I was able to fully manipulate the brush without getting my hair stuck, as well as learning the buttons. By my 4th blow-dry I was doing well. My results are best when my hair is 85-90% dry and when I work in small-to medium sections. It took me a few tries to realize that the brush works better when my hair is more dry than damp. Initially my hair was getting stuck in the very top of the brush where 2 pieces of plastic meet, not in the brush itself. I realized that I was working with too large of sections of hair. The spin buttons also take some time to learn. If not for the learning curve, I would have given 5 stars. If I could, I would rate at 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Its a bold statement, but for my hair texture and style, the Conair Spin Brush has improved the quality of my life. It really is worth every penny. My hair now looks finished, it looks styled.  The blowout easily lasts 3 days (although the curls do fall).&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend for anyone who is looking for soft, smooth hair, with volume.</li>
    <li> Hard to use- very easy for your hair to get caught up in bristles as it rotates. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to - which button to press for the brush one way or another -- but once you get the hang of it, serves the purpose. I don&#x27;t use it to dry my hair; better just for adding volume, or for touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I have long hair with layers and it&#x27;s actually fairly straight and thick.  Unless you pull your hair VERY HARD, the v-shaped bristles don&#x27;t really allow your hair to touch the ceramic core.  So, it doesn&#x27;t curl very well.  However, if you have waves and would like to straighten and add shine to your hair, this is a wonderful tool.  Very easy to use, even though the barrel is thick.  My fingers don&#x27;t wrap around it all the way.  The air doesn&#x27;t get very hot either.  After using this tool for a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed it actually take LONGER to style than to use a brush and separate blow dryer.  But, the hair is sleeker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, the bristles seem to be very cheap.  There were several dozen that broke and fell out of the brush and ended up on my counter and bathroom floor.  Messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it doesn&#x27;t add the volume and end-curls to my hair like I hoped.  I want to return it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product, the selling features for this item are very exaggerated...  Awkward to use... Returned! Not worth the it...</li>
    <li> I bought this out of frustration with the whole dryer/round brush thing.  I could never make it work.  My options were always a straight iron or wash and go.  I have painful thumb joints and so I could rarely straighten my hair even though I prefer it to natural wavy.  I received this in the mail yesterday and was excited to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few false starts I found this very easy to use.  The key for me was dividing my hair into sections.  Occasionally I would accidentally start the brush rotating in the wrong direction and end up with some interesting snarls.  However, by the time I was done with my hair I felt like I had a pretty good hang of it, and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to only give it 4 stars because you have to hold the buttons down to get the barrel to rotate.  This was very frustrating to me.  Also, if my hands were any smaller, I would have found it very difficult to hold this dryer and push the buttons.  In my opinion that is a design flaw.</li>
    <li> Although I would be careful, do not use it on wet hair as it does pull.  Barrel has forward and backward button, considerable airflow to  dry.</li>
    <li> Bough it March 12.  Stopped spinning May 10. Used it maybe 10 times in that period.  Too late to return. The friend who initially recommended it to me eventually had the same experience.</li>
    <li> I still miss my old Conair with a brush attachment.  But, this styler really works!  My hair is think and a bit short right now so the styler makes my hair &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; than I would like but it eliminates the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife a few weeks ago. She is happy with it. Her only negative comment is that the motor seems weak. She had a Rowenta model that is not available in the US.</li>
    <li> the best product for my beauty needs, is practical, easy to use and leaves my hair as if a professional had combed</li>
    <li> The styler left my wife&#x27;s hair with more volume and glossier so she loved it. When our niece with very long hair tried it, she did not like it.  If it is what you are looking for it is very good for the price but like all styling products it depends on the user.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer/brush. It makes drying my hair so much easier.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, this is my second one. The first one I had for 4 years when it first came out so I had to a new one. The bristles are all smashed down on it after all most everyday use. Cant beat it. I do wish you could buy a new head for it but where that is not an option I had to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I have short hair (above neck, below ears) and even with the large brush it works fine. So much better than a standard drier and brush. Less work, more body to hair and smoother look. This is worth it</li>
    <li> using this caused more hair fall.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the INFINITIPRO SPIN AIR ROTATING STYLER may be the best styling tool ever!  The INFINITIPRO SPIN AIR ROTATING STYLER is a dryer, curler, and brush all in one.  The brush head rotates and heats up as hot air blows through the styler, creating silky smoothness, brilliant shine, and significant volume.  I have below chin length, very thick, wavy hair, and this little beauty gave me the soft, sleek, shiny look I have been craving.  And it really did increase my volume!  The INFINITIPRO SPIN AIR ROTATING STYLER also shortened my styling time and required very little product to finish off the look.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this little device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there are a few tricks to using the INFINITIPRO SPIN AIR ROTATING STYLER, but they only took about 10 minutes to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Read the instructions.  If you have long hair or thick hair (like mine), Conair recommends that you use your regular blow dryer first.  Get about 80% of the moisture out.  Then use this tool to finish the drying and add the style you want.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is not necessarily intuitive, but to get the rotation of the brush head correct, look at the position of your tool and how you are holding it.  If you want the brush to rotate and curl your hair under, use whatever button is on top.  If you want to curl your hair up, use the button that is on the bottom.  Note the button you want to use will change as use change your grip.  Just remember to curl under use the top, to curl up use the bottom.  This has worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure you start at the top of the hair and work down.  This gives you gorgeous volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about broken hairs:  personally, I have not seen any more that when I use a round brush and the blow dryer.  Don&#x27;t jerk or pull on your hair, and let the brush run through to the end.  I&#x27;ve used the device for several weeks now, and have had nary a tangle or a knot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely pleased with the INFINITIPRO SPIN AIR ROTATING STYLER.  My hair looks and feels great, it takes considerably less time to dry and style my hair, and keeps one hand free.  For a Kindergarten mom, the look, the time savings, and the convenience are all priceless.feels great, it takes considerably less time to dry and style my hair, and keeps one hand free.

    <li> Looked all over for rotating brush.  Bought many brands...they ended up in garbage....this one is real quality and so easy to use. None with my hair in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this hair blower!! It straightens your hair as you blow dry it with the brush attachment.  It takes a few times to work it without tangling your hair up, but eventually you get it to work correctly! I have semi-curly hair and this works great to get the curl out, but you need to use a serum for flyaways when you&#x27;re done.  I highly recommend this product if you already use a blow dryer then a flat iron...this takes the place of both those tools.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling, gives you volume.  Easy to use with one hand on the dryer and the other to help guide the hair.</li>
    <li> This is my third Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler. I purchased one for myself &amp; found it so much easier than using a blow dryer and a brush. I purchased a second one for my daughter who is also &amp;#34;styling challenged&amp;#34;. We use them daily and recently ordered a third just to have on hand. If you have a hair style that requires a round brush, this is the appliance for you.</li>
    <li> I have kinky curly hair, 10 inches all around. The infinitipro blow dries the length of my hair very well with the rotating barrel and the ends come out smooth sleek. The infinitipro is fairly easy to use, gets hair from damp to dry quickly. Took me 15 minutes to complete my entire head separated in 3 sections. I feel that the volumising brush provides a silky finish with lots of movement however it doesn&#x27;t get the roots as sleek as I&#x27;d like. I would&#x27;ve give it a 5 if it had done so. Final note, very satisfied with infinitipro spin air rotating styler, packaging of styler and delivery time. Would recommend for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately one month later it has stopped rotating. This is only the second time I have used it so I&#x27;m really upset. Especially as I&#x27;ve missed the exchanged n refund date by a few days. So 4 stars for performance 1 star for durability.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, fairly tight curls that frizz easily.  When I used this today for the first time I had beautiful, bouncy results.  I totally recommend this product.  Do beware that you need to practice so give yourself time to try it out.  If you don&#x27;t keep the extra hair you&#x27;re not focusing on away from the end it does get caught in the cap and pulls your hair out.  Even that was NOT painful.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how gentle it was.  I have been using a Hot Tools 1\\&quot; hot air brush to \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; my hair for a long time and I lose a lot of hair that way.  NOT with this one.  The bristles even feel good against your forehead when you do your bangs.  Another tip: since it rotates two directions, depending on which button you press, when you&#x27;re holding it up and getting ready to place your hair on the bristles, run the button you think is the correct direction against your other hand to see if it&#x27;s rotating the right way you want to go.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a mess.  This could even be good for kids hair, providing an adult does it.  It&#x27;s VERY GENTLE.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after I read some of the reviews, but was highly disappointed. Did not dry my hair at all and pulled it out. Wish I could give it a - star.</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday and it works like a charm.  My hair is frizzy and fine. This was easy to use and dried my hair in half the normal time, with great results!!!  If you need a touch up because your hair is frizzing up, just run this through your dry hair (5 minutes) and your hair will look like you just stepped out of the salon! Just get it!!!</li>
    <li> Since I have tendonitis &amp; carpal tunnel, this is a perfect solution to the constant turning of the round brush &amp; blow dryer I used to use on my long hair. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I wish the barrel was smaller. An improvement would be either adjustable barrel sizes or giving us smaller barrel options to purchase, as my hair works best with a 1&amp;#34; barrel (hint hint Infinitpro). As it is, I still need to use my curling iron to get my volume/curls back, but it does do a great job if you want stick straight blow out hair without making your wrist unusable for half a day.</li>
    <li> Altho a bit awkward to use, this handy tool is a good addition to one&#x27;s hair-care devices. Handle is very thick. Should have at least medium length hair to use this.</li>
    <li> By far, the best hair dryer I ever had. It is so easy to use (I have RA) that is incredible. The brush really grabs your hair and styles it in any way you want. The amazing thing is how shine the hair gets. It is not for short hair as the brush is large; perhaps Conair will come up with one with small brush for short hair soon. Well worth the price! Easier if you dry the excess water of your hair first then use this one...</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product because when the \\&quot; 1st generation\\&quot; spinning brush, revostylyer came out and i gave it a try, it did nothing for my hair but tangle it.  But since it had the built in spinning air and i don&#x27;t have to use a blow dryer to style with at the same time, i decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m asian and I have very dried, overprocessed hair from coloring it alot, especially my ends.  I like this product alot for styling.  I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than my blow dryer when it comes to drying, so your hair should be about 80% dry if you want less of a hassle when working with this. This brush makes my hair very shiny and bouncy, my ends look healthy. I like how i don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron b/c in the past when i did, it just made my ends look really dry and my hair frizzy. On top of that, it is great for styling bangs, something i always had trouble with b/c I can&#x27;t blowdry and use a brush at the same time.  OVerall, I LOVE this prodcut, it gives the wonderful convenience of wearing a new hair style everyday, you just have to experiment and practice. good luck ladies :)</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that tends to look frizzy and dry. Not so much anymore. I put my hair dryer on a stand and point it towards the area I&#x27;m working on, and use this brush on the higher setting that allows it to spin. I could never dry my hair with this but it&#x27;s a wonderful styling tool. If you&#x27;re good at spinning a round brush and handling a blow dryer, you probably don&#x27;t need this but I have problems with that.</li>
    <li> So, after reading several reviews and getting a \\&quot;gold box deal\\&quot;  I thought, I&#x27;ll take a chance and buy it. I am so glad I did.  Like other reviewers state, it does take some time to get the hang of it, but once you do, it is great.  I have long, thick, coarse, hair. I actually blow dried my hair for a few minutes(with a standard dryer) as hinted in the user manual, to aid in drying time for the spin brush.  This brush gives me a soft curl, that maintains its shape all day.  However if you dry your hair too much it may become frizzy, so blowdrying before hand should be kept to a minimum.  I do think that with the barrel size this is good for medium to long hair.  I cannot see how it would wind the hair with the large brush if you maintain a shorter style.  All in all I like this giving it four stars, taking off a star for ease of use.</li>
    <li> The Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler is a capable accessory with a stylish good looking design that doesn&#x27;t shame the owner by screaming \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I was unable to test the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler myself, due to both gender issues and a general lack of hair with which to try it out. Coping as best as I could with my personal deficiency, I sought out a qualified user, who had previously owned and used styling brushes, to enlist as a tester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After telling me that she was touched to receive such a gift, and confessing that a man had never given her a power styling brush before, my over qualified assistant reviewer used the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler for a couple of weeks and reported that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The Infinitipro&#x27;s bristles are softer than the less flexible bristles on other brands, but the brush is gentle on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Although the brush does not grip the hair as firmly as some other brushes it is more comfortable and delivers a nice smooth effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The rotating brush very is easy to use and the auto reverse feature on the brush helps with self styling long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The auto rotating feature also makes it very maneuverable and easier to use than many other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, even though it was a gift, it would be a purchase the next time another bush was needed. In short, it worked well, delivered pleasing results, is well made and is a buy. RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I never looked bater. This is a great brush, works well. Makes my hair shiny and manageable. Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> I use this instead of a hair dryer. I dries fast too and helps to shape the hair at the same time. It&#x27;s very easy to get to know how to use it. I got to handle it well after using it for 3 times. You will find your own way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself, and it just isn&#x27;t great on my short hair (which I kind of figured, given the size of the barrel and other reviews). So I gave this to my daughter and it works great on her longer hair. She really likes it for straightening her bangs - much easier than blow drying and then using the straightener. Really nice for soft curls, as well.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time.  Works well on medium to longer length hair with a natural kink or curl.  Love the salon feel and shine after use.  Would not recommend to anyone with really long hair as it would tangle or really curly hair as the style in my opinion would not last.</li>
    <li> Well well. This is an amazing tool. I have medium long wavy fine blonde hair. It&#x27;s cut in long layers. This is amazing. Tons of volume. Smooth and shiny. Super easy to use. You can use it for blow drying  works so well when hair is 80% dry). Just let hair air dry a while, then finish with this. It takes 10 minutes to do your whole head. Then the next day I spritz with dry shampoo and restyle with this and my hair is even better. I find this heats up very well. I disagree with other reviewers saying it doesn&#x27;t heat up. It does. And it takes 10 minutes the first time, to get used to the spin action. Easy !! If I had anything bad to say is it can pull on my long hair. But this hardly happens at all. Especially as I get more and more skilled. When I grab sections for the brush I never get that stray pull. Really. This it a must have for your toolbox. My Super Solano dryer has not been seeing much action !!! I do recommend this for medium to long hair. Short hair can&#x27;t wrap around the 2 inch barrel. But I promise you will LOVE the quality, results , ease of use !!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this brush.  It works well for straight styles that are not pin straight and flat like with a flat iron.  My only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t spin with cold air, the spin function only works with warm air.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my sister for christmas and she lked it very much. She used it on her hair which long as well thick and it did the job she wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> love it!&lt;br /&gt;it takes a few tries to get the hang of it, then it&#x27;s addictive.&lt;br /&gt;we&#x27;ve repurchased for gifts and forwarded the link to many friends</li>
    <li> Love this thin!! Moved to FL from the northeast.  My hair is shoulder length and this thing helps give my hair body and a great shape!!  It is far easier than wrangling a hair dryer and round brush.  I love this product and when it dies, I will repurchase.  A great value!</li>
    <li> I love this brush, can&#x27;t believe what a difference this makes in helping to style my hair. It only takes me a few minutes to use it nd my hair looks just the way I want too.</li>
    <li> Love that it made my hair smooth and silky, but it did not have enough power to actually dry it. It died after only 6 months of use (the brush stopped spinning). Replaced it with the $40 John Freida brush from CVS which works much better, dries and creates even more volume.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:cd76d03c6dc6fe225472b09c02c0c01d]]Let me start by saying when I bought this I never intended it to dry my hair. It&#x27;s 500 watts, that&#x27;s not a hair dryer. After reading the reviews and watching a bunch of videos I was torn between this and the Babyliss. In the end I bought both. After testing over a month I am glad I kept the Infiniti as I will not go back to drying with a roundbrush . It would earn 5 stars for more watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blond, curly, wavy, thick strand hair, thick hair. It was a grown out bob past my shoulders until I cut it again recently. I don&#x27;t want to say coarse, but it can be. I round brush my hair because it makes it smooth and soft. It gets real tiring and it seems like these days I fight with the brush more than I used to especially with the gel and rubber handles they add now. I have very babied healthy hair, I use Joico shampoo, conditioner, re-constructor, and I think the other one is moisture recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wrote my original review, not a lot has changed except I have been rotating back and forth between the two different products.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recall if both make the anti-static claim, but my initial experience was the exact opposite, but after a few uses I forgot all about the claim and my original annoyance. The 2&amp;#34; brush and the whole product in general is big. It is best that you watch the videos for a reference. It&#x27;s not heavy or annoying to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve and I can see how someone might suck their hair up in this as it has a pedal on the gas instead of the brake user malfunction. Also you can get your hair stuck between the end cap and barrel that I can best describe as flossing though there is no apparent gap there. It only happened once, but I was sidelined for a bit as I carefully rescued my hair. While mastering this product I initially sectioned my hair as when you work on one area it can pull hair from another twisting that piece around and around into a knot. Update: I have actually quit sectioning my hair and just drop a line down while pinning the rest up. I do get those twists, but am usually working too fast as I move across each section to cause any annoyance. I also tend to use my free hand as a guide similar like a shield over the rotating bristles and I &amp;#34;revisit&amp;#34; sections I have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t want to bore you with all my learning curves and what routine works for me. I more just wanted to share the video I am posting so you can form your own opinions.&lt;br /&gt;On the first couple of uses I got impatient and aided with with my blow dryer on low. But I found out if I towel dry my hair well then flip the towel over to wrap it while I do my makeup it is just about right when I am ready to use it. An occasional blow dryer blast if I&#x27;m impatient.&lt;br /&gt;Basically I like the feel of round brush blow dried hair as it feels softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I still do a quick sweep with the straight iron. I like the volume this provides, but still want my hair the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I cut my hair again I would like to add for others, if you have really short hair, then this brush will be likely be too big.&lt;br /&gt;If you have short fine hair, I do not think this product would work because I&#x27;m pretty sure it is the thickness of my strands allowing them to catch on the bristles. I think fine hair would slip through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations I have made about the Infinity and the Babyliss (see video)&lt;br /&gt;Appearance wise I don&#x27;t see a lot of differences as you can see in the pictures. To correct some older reviews in case they are out of date. They both have a metal barrel. The switch on the Babyliss has an indented switch with one notch, the Infinity has no indents and 3 notches. On the Babyliss the front bottom of the handle has a 3 dimensional design with its name and logo to the left side of the front handle and the Infiniti has its name and logo in the middle. The back bottom right of the Babyliss is printed with information about watts and volts and notably is stamped Glendale, AZ. The Infinity is blank. The bottom of both have a plastic grill, the Babyliss is chrome colored while the Infinity is black. On the left side of the bottom of the handle the Babyliss is blank, but the Infinity is printed with information about watts and volts and again like the Babyliss is stamped Glendale, AZ. The printing is not exact, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;Both have cool, low, high, and off settings. They do not rotate when setting is off or on cool. Both have a nice thick, long swivel cord. They have different plug styles. Each cord has a label with a barcode. The Babyliss says: 74108 27045 and the Infiniti says 74108 24635. I ran back to check because I had not tested sound etc. The Infinity sounds a tad higher in pitch. I think it might rotate a tad faster, but it may be the sound making my opinion biased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you made it this far. I know this review is a total yawn. Comment if you have any questions!ith information about watts and volts and notably is stamped Glendale, AZ. The Infinity is blank.

    <li> Love the purpose of it rolling the hair, but just not getting enough curl to make it worth while.  Probably need a small head on it and would give me more curl.</li>
    <li> i bought this for myself initially. i have very thick curly hair (im half african american half chinese), so sadly this product didnt work for my hair, but i did give it to my mom (who is chinese with fine hair) and it works great for her!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get this a long time ago! It makes my hair so soft, but the curl stays in! Love it. I used to get tendonitis in my elbow from a round brush and hairdryer, but not anymore :)</li>
    <li> Love this, I have alot of thick, wavy hair.  Reduces frizz also,  I can do my hair in 7-10 minutes!  So happy I found this.</li>
    <li> I should have bought a slightly smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s cool when you have short hair</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;d like to lose a bunch of hair each time you use this, go ahead and buy it. It works ok but with my fine hair that tangles easily I found it took out more of my hair than was healthy/necessary. Hair can get stuck in the groove between the bristles and the base and tear out. Painful!!! And it seemed to take forever to dry. I&#x27;m going to donate mine to a friend who has coarse hair that she needs to get thinned out, lol. Yikes, Conair. This one&#x27;s a loser.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, because I don&#x27; have to hold the brush in one hand and the hair dryer in another. It&#x27;s easy &amp; less painful.</li>
    <li> I bought this Air Rotating Styler because of the rave reviews and am so happy with my purchase. I blow dry my hair 80% dry and then use this to smooth and finish my short bob. and this styler helps control the frizzies (smoothing serum a must as well). My only complaint is cleaning the styler is difficult because the brush is not removable. I would recommend the option of a smaller brush for shorter hair. And speed of use without fatigue and time.</li>
    <li> I seem to be missing the hair-styling gene -- segmenting, curling, whatever -- just not good at styling.  So I tried this after reading these reviews &amp; InStyle magazine and watching the video demo.  I can actually style it as demonstrated! My almost-shoulder length hair is soft, smooth and I can control the volume and flip.  Smooth even on this terribly rainy day. I look and feel so much better. Will be perfect for travel. (I recommend the Conair carbon smooth brushes, too, for daily touch ups.)</li>
    <li> It is a very big barrel so you can only perform one style which is the one you see in the commericals.  Not very versatile and multifunctional which i do not like.  I do not need a bunch of different tech tools.  The spinning is great but you need to get use to it.  i purchased it thinking i can curl my hair but it is not the case. it really only smooths out your hair with some volume which is great if you are only aiming for that look. i returned it.</li>
    <li> NOT FOR SHORT HAIR, GAVE IT AWAY.  WOULD SEND IT BACK BUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE. SHOULD READ PROPERLY BEFORE PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> When I saw this Infinitipro Spin Air Brush on tv, I instantly wanted it. A way to round brush my hair without having to hold a blow dryer and a round brush WHILE rotating the round brush at the same time? Count me in! When I round brush my hair the traditional way, I love how much volume and bounce I get. Also, I love when I get that curl at the bottom of my hair. When I finally broke down and bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Brush I used it and was less than impressed. I used it while my hair was wet and it took just as long to dry my hair as normal round brushing. A plus was that it was a lot easier, but easier is not always better. One of the drawbacks was that I didn&#x27;t get volume. My hair was shinier and felt nice, but it was flat and limp even when using volumizing mousse. I then tried it on dry hair. It worked a bit better, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. If it got hotter it would curl the bottom of the hair. No volume, no curl at the bottom of my hair. So If you want volume and curl at the bottom, this product is not for you. If you just want your hair shinier and straight then you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
    <li> I thought that this Spin Dryer would be great for traveling. I have long hair and all it did was get tangled in my hair. I returned it  almost immediately.</li>
    <li> The one I got did not heat up, but Amazon provided an easy return with a refund.  Look for something else, even if your hair is fine like mine.</li>
    <li> The concept is great but the design isn&#x27;t so.  The brush itself should be a one-piece item with the rotating feature at the base of the brush into the barrel but the brush rotates around the base which is stationary at the top and bottom of the brush which gets hair caught in between.  And even on high heat, it&#x27;s not really that hot so it took a lot longer to style my hair.</li>
    <li> The heat is not strong enough to style thick and curly hair, so if you have a hard to style hair that can only be styled with hair dryer and flat iron, then don&#x27;t waste your money on this, it won&#x27;t style your hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;To me this thing is like a regular brush. Either way, I stopped using it. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am African American and I do not have a relaxer in my hair. This did not do a thing for me, I am going to stick with my blow dryer. I must say it did work well for the part of my hair that is relaxed, when I wear my upart wigs.</li>
    <li> This does NOT work as easily as shown; I tried so many times and just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.  Maybe someone that works with their hair a lot and are used to difference appliances can use this, I sure couldn&#x27;t.  I should have sent back; it now just sits at the bottom of the closet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase of the Conair Spin rotating styler, it works great with my medium length hair, definitely a recommended buy!  Good value for money too</li>
    <li> It broke just after the Amazon return policy ran out (I barely used it within that time)</li>
    <li> This gets rid of the frizz and styles your hair.  Like having a keratin treatment but a whole lot cheaper!  My hairstylist recommended it and my daughters and I  all have it.</li>
    <li> The metallic outer cylinder gets super hot and damages the hair</li>
    <li> Wife loves it; it is quite noisy, but with the ionizer and the rotating speed that can be adjusted, it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted. This was really an innovative hair styler/blowdryer. I loved the sleek hair that I had when I used it. However, the construction is cheap and the motor overheated then blew a fuse only after one month of 3ce/week use. I always made sure to keep it clean and use the cover provided, yet I am so disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last more than a month. I will have to go back to using my old-fashioned method of styling w/my brush and hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this yesterday and today I went in my bathroom and got rid of the rest of my styling appliances....I wont be needing them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to own a Conair stying brush that didnt rotate and went through 2 of them before that style was discontinued and I didnt like the one they replaced it with...the head was too small and the bristles too hard. I tried other styling appliances but I was never totally satisfied with them. I knew the first time I saw the InfinitiPro Rotating Styler that my problems were over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, its on the large size and yes, its not meant for really short hair. But I have medium length hair so its works fine. It does exactly what I expected it to do...dry my hair, gently shape it and do no damage. I don&#x27;t find it unwieldy, but maybe that&#x27;s because I am used to similar appliances. As for the cord, I don&#x27;t have a problem with the length. I do like the brush cover....great idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start out sitting on the toilet with my head upside down and start drying from underneath. I have been doing this for years and it helps to add fullness. The brush gets to my scalp and smooths the hair from end to end. Then when my hair is mostly damp, I right my head and, starting with the top, take sections and finish drying. Make sure not to do TOO much at a time...it can slow down the brush and might wear on the motor. It feels just like when my stylist uses a brush and blow dryer on my hair. I never could get that procedure down.....now I don&#x27;t have to. It didn&#x27;t take me long to get used to the unit and to the directions of the brush. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with my hair getting caught, either....just make sure before you put your hair against the brush that its moving in the right direction. My hair is smooth, shiny and feels great! The only thing I can think of that might be considered a downside is that you cant remove the brush to wash it. Still, I only use it on clean hair and its easy to remove the hair after I finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my styler on sale but I think its worth whatever you pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/23 - I bumped into my stylist while Christmas shopping today and she raved about how my hair looked. I had just washed it and used the InfinityPro to dry and style it. I figure if my stylist liked how it looked, the appliance must be doing the job. But, in any event, I am VERY satisfied with it....it really makes my hair look like I just left the salon. I hope it NEVER dies or, if it does, that Conair never stops making it! :D</li>
    <li> This item makes round brush drying much easier. Especially for people with long hair. It&#x27;s still not as good as a salon round brush blow dry from a stylist who can see the back of your head, but it certainly beats holding a brush in one hand and a blow dryer in the other!</li>
    <li> This works great! I used to have so much trouble trying to handle my round brush and the hair dryer and now I can do it all at once! I have very severe arthritis and this product makes it easy for me to style my hair!  It never tangles up in my hair, it has forward and backward action.  You can curl under over flip up!</li>
    <li> I have long and rather curly/frizzy hair and nothing has ever dried and straightened my hair in one swift move. NOTHING! I applied Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny product and when my hair had air dried just a little, I started to dry and style with this product and it was amazing! The best I&#x27;ve ever tried and the best part? My hair was dry in under 30 minutes AND styled AND sleek! My hair isn&#x27;t sleek, ever! This did it! Best product EVER!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.  It is too big for my short hair and not strong enough to handle long hair.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairstylist for 34 years. I recently had hand surgery and have had to manage my hair one-handed. Fortunately, I have some natural curl and was able to make my hair look somewhat presentable as long as I used a lot of hair product. After I saw the commercial for this product, I thought why not? I used it for the first time today and was able to make my hair smooth and full. I was thoroughly impressed. I&#x27;ve come across many tools and products over the years and this one is one of my new favorites. My daughter used it today also. She has chin-length, straight hair with some fringe. It turned out full instead of flat. She loves it too. I have layered chin-length hair. I was able to pull out the wave and give it the direction I wanted. I used a blow-out spray instead of heavy product, which made dry time much quicker. Can&#x27;t wait to use both hands!</li>
    <li> I tried my spin brush for the first time today and was very pleased.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, but decided to give it a try anyway... and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  I was able to dry and style my hair in literally about 4 minutes!!  Now I do have very fine hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it would dry with thicker hair, but for me I didn&#x27;t do any drying at all before grabbing the spin brush.  It was very easy to use, and seems to be impossible to tangle your hair.  You don&#x27;t even really have to spend any time gathering the section you want to work on... the brush naturally grabs it for you while it&#x27;s spinning.  I love that you can control the spin easily too.  You can spin either way with just a push of a button and you can stop and go as you please.  My hair is just above chin length and the brush size worked well for my purposes, which is to get more volume and smooth mostly.  It certainly didn&#x27;t make my hair curly, but that&#x27;s not what I was going for.  I really couldn&#x27;t be happier and this will save me so much time in the morning!!</li>
    <li> I have an inverted bob,short hair in the back to about 3\\&quot; below my chin in the front.  This brush is absolutely amazing.  I have thick hair and I can go from soaking wet to styled in 10 minutes.  The bristles are very soft which really stops any hair pulling.  This brush is a great combination of the Revo and the Revlon round brush hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush turns in high and low speed, it does not turn when the cool air is on.  The brush also turns in both directions.  Watch some of the videos on Youtube for some great tips for use.</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of money ever. I have relatively short hair (not long enough to get tangled) and I keep a \\&quot;good cut\\&quot;. Yes - the spinner dries; yes it spins; and yes it spins and dries. What is doesn&#x27;t do is give the volume and lift and style it advertises. I just ended up with fly-away hair that looked like I had had electric shock therapy. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I viewed both videos from this product page before my styler arrived so I knew the gist of how it worked; it was pretty simple to use. It does not take 10 mins to figure out as one reviewer wrote. I used it to dry my hair and it looked like I went to a salon to get a blow dry. When my husband came home he asked me if I went to a salon and got a haircut! LOL My hair felt really soft and had that nice light feeling that you get after you go to a salon. This is a great product! It&#x27;s not heavy like some people complained about and the bristles are super soft. My arm did get tired but it was from styling and lifting my arms above my head for some time. I have long, layered hair and it looks terrific! Almost like that model&#x27;s! LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Should have bought it a long time ago. I will get better using it but that will come with time. Altogether a very useful product. After 3 days of using it I fealt a great difference in my hair. My hair was smoother and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> Definitely is a very good choice ! Few minutes and your hair is in the best shape ! LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick wavy (often frizzy) hair.  Lazy about styling, I usually wash it, go to sleep with it wet, wake up to it still damp, put it in a bun and by the end of the day it will be dry and wavy in a less frizz/more controlled way...not great...but not terrible. I got this product on a whim.  I let my hair air dry for about an hour (it&#x27;s REALLY thick) and then couldn&#x27;t wait any more to try this gadget out.  All I can say is it is absolute magic.  My hair never dried so fast or styled so easily.  It is super smooth, shiny, and full of body.    I have to admit I was a bit panicked the first time the brush crept up to my scalp. I imagined it getting tangled and burning me.  But it&#x27;s really impossible to get your hair tangled. The brush is so soft that you can always just gently pull it out or use the button that spins the brush in the opposite direction. Super easy.  Don&#x27;t panic.  Also, my hair is so thick that I worried if these soft bristles could grab it but they do an excellent job.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
    <li> I am 81 yrs old and this Styler makes it so easy for me to both dry my hair and give it a lift at the same time.  Does it so quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this. I figured it would save me time by combining the blow drying AND styling.   This was a far bigger pain than it was worth in my opinion.   First, let me say that I have long, wavy, thick hair.   I started by washing my hair and letting it dry halfway (I knew if I did this when it was straight-out-of-the-shower-wet that I would be at it for hours)  The brush is big. A little bit cumbersome.   Getting used to the spins was a little tough for me. For those that say \\&quot;It can&#x27;t get tangled!\\&quot; are lying. You can DEFINITELY get your hair tangled in this if you aren&#x27;t paying attention.   For me, it was just ok. You can&#x27;t take big pieces, and you have to run the brush over the same spot many times. And you can&#x27;t always have it spinning (or you will tangle it)  I ended up returning it, it was just too much work. For the same amount of time, find yourself a really nice round brush.  I think this would probably be a good product for thinner, shoulder length and shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I bought one and liked the idea of this styler:  Hair dryer AND rotating styling brush in one tool. It&#x27;s great for people with arthritis in  their fingers. Please note that it does not work well on short, layered hair. My hair is cut in a layered bob that is long enough to barely cover my ears. The diameter of the brush was too large for my hair to curl around it, so the ends didn&#x27;t curl under; they stood straight out! I returned the one I bought because it made a tinny ringing sound and I was concerned it was defective. If Conair made this with a 1.25-1.5&amp;#34; barrel, or if they put a cover over the barrel to curl the hair around the barrel, it would be a great tool. If your hair is not layered and is cut below your chin, this styler should work fine for you. Conair, I hope you see this review and make a smaller rotating styler.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for a Christmas gift. I was so happy that I finaly got one. I loved my Revo, but it had stopped working and they discontinued the line of brushes. Anyway ive been looking for a replacement. I love the way it makes my hair feel after using it. My hair is always fizzy before using it. After smooth and silky. The only problem i have with it is that it pulls a lot of my hair out. I have long thick hair. If i put to much hair on the brush it will get stuck and pull it out. So i have to be careful not to put to much on the brush. It can be painful. Just wish it didn&#x27;t pull out my hair after every use. I have to be very careful that a strand doesn&#x27;t fall down below in to the grooves where it turns. It shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to use this.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it and it works for her.  You may have to use lower settings since it may pull your hair if you pull too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this after investing in bunch of hot rollers and irons. It is perfect somebody like me, two left hands. I could not blow dry to save my life and I am using this after everytime i wash my hair, works great. Very easy to style, does it by itself. I wish i bought it much sooner.  Handle is a bit large but, i dont mind it.</li>
    <li> I love my infinity pro, it&#x27;s very easy to use!!! and makes my hair shine!!! if you dont know if you will like it, i can say: buy it!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1E6T6SJ44T2BA]]Though the Infinitipro was easy to use, I feel that the airflow wasn&#x27;t hot enough or forceful enough to work with my thick, coarse hair.  The video shows that the side dried with the Infinitipro was bushy, as opposed to the nice, sleek look I get with the old Conair Dryer Brush.  Now if Conair would just make a brush dryer like the old style that would also spin, life would be great:-)</li>
    <li> Love this dryer/styler.  I would refer to it more as a styler.  I have shoulder length, fine but curly hair, also it is color treated.  The volume I get from this styler is wonderful and I can achieve a very smooth straight look with a moderate amount of curl, still with lots of volume.  I don&#x27;t think you would want to purchase this if your hair was much shorter than mine.  I still use a hand held dryer to get my hair to the point that it is damp-dry before I use this infiniti styler.  I would highly recommend that you practice styling with this as I did to achieve the look you want.  It takes some manipulating the controls to figure out which button to push to turn your hair under vs flipping your hair.  Be patient...it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this knowing that I was cutting my long hair to a chin length bob.  It has been the best tool I have ever used!  My hair is so fine and straight, I always have a problem getting volume but not with this, it is amazing.  I dry my hair about 80% with my head upside down and then I flip my head up and use the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler to style my hair the rest of the way.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I use it almost everyday. My only concern is that some of my hair gets stuck in areas I can&#x27;t clean. With that in mind, yes it will pull some of your hair our but my hair is very coarse and also, it&#x27;s not pulling out any more than my normal brush or comb would.</li>
    <li> I had one before, but kept the blue cap thingy on it, and removed it every time I was going to use it. I think all that action made the spin part break. Sadly, mine broke. I bought this replacement and it&#x27;s worked perfectly ever since. I don&#x27;t keep the purple guard thing on it, over the bristles. I recommend not using that.</li>
    <li> Love this styler. I bought it for the cool setting with no intention of using the rotation, but ended up using it every time.  so easy to fix my hair now!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as good as I would like. Still prefer to blow dry and fix some edges with the straightener.</li>
    <li> I just got this hoping it was what I needed to make me a few waves (half curls) for my thin straght hair but it did nothing! hardle any heat the buttons to have it to rotate was very confussing going the oppasite direction and it left the brush imprints in my hair looked crinkle not a good look for me i have to return it tommorro i am still going to look for a round curling rush and it was to BIG for my hair i have layers and one curl around it took all my hair thats one of the resons i think it didnt curl me hair</li>
    <li> It is a very good and pratical item.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work perfectly to smooth my hair. Works okay but with the barrel was smaller.</li>
    <li> I thought this would make an easier way for the wife to get ready in the morning.  It seems that she uses it more when she has more time especially when we go out.</li>
    <li> If you have short hair like me, you won&#x27;t be able to style it! Though, it may be good for hair to/below the shoulders.</li>
    <li> I have fine to medium hair (shoulder length) and I bought this styler because I cannot master the technique of using a round brush while blow drying. I dry my hair with my hairdryer first (about 80-90% dry) or let it air dry and then use the rotating styler to smooth out my hair, give it volume and curl the ends the way I want them. This product allows me to come the closest I ever have to achieving the look my stylist does with a round brush!  My hair does not get tangled in it (and if it does a little, it is easy to untangle) It takes a while to get \\&quot;the hang\\&quot; of using it and making the brush rotate the way you intend, but I really like the results and the ease of use. Other folks have said that they can get the same results with a curling iron, but I don&#x27;t think that for my hairstyle that I can. Also, I travel a lot and I can immediately pack this product after using it (which I can&#x27;t do with a hot curling iron).  I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it really isn&#x27;t powerful enough to dry your hair. And, I did find it more difficult to use with wet hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is worth every penny. I have tried cheaper brushes and that was a waste of money, when this one goes I will only buy this brand and this brush. It smooths the hair and eliminates one entire step, I can style and dry my hair at the same time and done. I didn&#x27;t think I would like the 2 in barrel, I do have shorter layers on top, but it works great and adds volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited about this product. I just bought it last night and can&#x27;t believe the great results. I&#x27;ve been wondering if there is something that can tame my wavy, coarse, thick, tending to be frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve never gotten good results blow drying and styling at home. My hair is a lot of work to tame and it seemed only the salon could smooth it out and make it look good after 40 minutes of blowing and round brushing. Well, I have to say, I think I&#x27;ve found the home hair styling tool I&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips: Semi-dry your hair so it&#x27;s not completely wet. And be sure to comb out any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started the rotating brush, it actually grabbed my hair and started to tangle and pull it! Yikes! But wait - I gave it a few more tries and figured out how it works. It just takes some practice. The brush rotates in two directions and you have to figure out which way to go. And I think it helps to hold it under the brush at the bottom and coax it along for creating a flip or curl under on the ends. And tension helps too as you pull it down your hair. I can see that the more I do it the better I will get. But the rotating brush makes all the difference. It really does help smooth out the hair shaft and my hair looks full with body but not frizzy and out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great tool to get that salon look at home. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I did not expected the Styler is so big. I have small hands and it is not very applicable for me.</li>
    <li> The product arrived defective...  Multi-directional spinning rotation does not work on the device. It only spins one way. I read many reviews before purchasing the product... and decided to go with this instead of the Babyiss rotating hair brush, to save the additional $17 bucks, but it was a big mistake! Would recommend any reader of this review to spend the additional amount on another rotating brush because mine arrived broken. Lost +$39 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon has great customer service. They refunded the product for me. Amazon is great and I will continue being a customer, however I will not purchase Conair items again.</li>
    <li> it works well on damp hair</li>
    <li> This Styler works very good, it does not tangle at all when using it which is nice if u&lt;br /&gt;have thick hair. I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;Make my hair so smooth&lt;br /&gt;Very good result&lt;br /&gt;I m very happy have it&lt;br /&gt;Very good&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> It was much wider then I thought it would be.  I thought it would be closer to my hair brush.  It is for very long hair.  Mine is short to medium length.</li>
    <li> I love the way I can style my hair so easily but when using it it makes a sound that makes me wonder if it is a product that will last very long. I have used my daughter&#x27;s who bought the exact same product from Amazon and hers does not make this news. Think I may send it back for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Thought a higher priced and better rated product would hold up longer, but this failed within six months. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I actually bought from Ulta beauty supply which was an impulse buy. But I love it so much I wanted to write a review since I often rely on user reviews when purchasing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I have shoulder length hair that is cut into an inverted bob that is pretty damaged from bleaching and heat styling. My hair is thick and dry but not coarse. Usually I style with a round brush and dryer and follow with a straightener where needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this pretty effective at drying my hair, completely. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that it&#x27;s not meant to completely dry your hair but I was able to go from semi-wet hair (I always let mine air dry to some extent to prevent too much heat damage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was pretty easy to use, the brush was able to sweep through my hair to smooth without getting tangled or pulling. I do wish the brush was a little smaller since I have shorter hair, or that there was an option to change out brush attachments. Also it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me that you cannot use the spin mode on the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting. It was a little tiring holding down the spin button but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my hair dried in about the same time but was significantly shinier and smoother and did not need a straightener. I definitely like using this over a round brush and dryer because it is easier, and was able to perfectly dry the back of my hair and my roots which was always a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with shoulder length hair or longer. I can&#x27;t see this product being effective for coarse/curly hair, or shorter hair.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever!!!! My hair is fluffy and shiny every time I use my brush, I makes my hair look like I just got it done by a professional hair styler. It makes my life so easy now that I have a short hair. I wish I had got it sooner!!!!</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this product I have yet to have a bad hair day, and for those uncoordinated people (like myself) its one of the best hairstyling products I have ever used to give an at home blowout. I have fine, straight, just-past shoulder length, layered hair that goes frizzy when normally just styled with a blow dryer because it is so fine and thin, even though I have a lot of it. And I live in the humid southeast. But since practicing with this tool, I have had a lot of people tell me what great hairdays I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here is my process learnt through elimination and experimentation:&lt;br /&gt;Towel dry, and then like other reviewers have mentioned comb it out straight. Then I put a volumizing mousse at the roots and give it a rough dry with an ionizing blowdryer. The spin brush is not as hot as a regular dryer so to use it on damp hair (rather than full wet) is a lot easier and faster.&lt;br /&gt;Then I take each section, spin it dry, wrap it around a velcro roller and duck clip it, working my way from the front to the back. It takes about 10 min. And finally when that is done, one final blast with super hot air from the blowdryer to set each roller. After removing the rollers, a quick spray with hairspray and viola! GREAT. HAIR. PERIOD. Shiny, not frizzy, super soft with lots of movement, and just plain fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bristles seem to flatten over time with use, and hair does get caught in the spinner if the section is too wide, so just watch out!</li>
    <li> Best new product for hair since the invention of conditioner. I loved it so much I bought one for each of my girlfriends for Christmas.</li>
    <li> How did I live all those years without it? Got one for all the girls in my family for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to having a salon style blowout. I do a better job with my round brush and blow dryer. I also feel like it is damaging the ends of my hair. Bummer, I was hoping it was all the reviews said it would be.</li>
    <li> Everyone said this brush dryer is so great -- but I am finding it hard to work with and very noisy !!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up well but the spin speed goes too fast -- I find it hard to control and it just grabs my hair .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In theory, this is a good idea.  I am not sure it works in reality.  I may have to return this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I bought for my wife as a mother&#x27;s day gift and she loved it. The only problem was the card,I wrote a lovely message for her signed by me, our daughter and our newborn son and when she received it was in the name of another person, so I guess Amazon was too busy and messed up with our message. Anyway product worth it and she definitely recommends. .</li>
    <li> This is the first time I write a review for anything because this is the first gadget I&#x27;ve ever used that truly delivers.  I have very, very, curly, dry, frizzy, coarse hair.  It normally takes me 45 minutes to an hour to dry my hair with a hair dryer and a round brush and when I am done, my arms are very tired.  With the Infiniti Pro, it took me less than 20 minutes and my hair looked and felt fantastic.  I may sound like a paid commercial, but trust me I did not get anything for this review.  I felt like I needed to really say, this one worked for me!!  It might also work for you. For the price I paid here, it was worth the risk.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It didn&#x27;t tangle my hair, made it smooth and pretty with a bit of a curl. But it only lasted a few months.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I purchased this product but I returned it within two weeks. Just so you know I have bone straight, long, fine hair. The idea is great but it did not measure up. No matter what I did, my hair would end up with lots of knots and it also made my hair have a lot of static. I wanted to love this product but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> You have to practice a few times before you get the hang of it. I suggest looking up YouTube videos for help! I like the way my hair feels after I use it. Very soft... however it can get a little frizzy so use the right product as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me shape my bangs. And it works perfectly for that. Overtime the engine kind of looses its power, though. But overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I  have  always had  difficulty with holding brush and blow dryer up to style hair. this  is so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;The  only thing I would  change is to allow the brush to rotate with cool air.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a round brush and hair dryer combo before but I always wanted to do it. I&#x27;m not that great at it yet...but so far it&#x27;s great. Makes my hair feel soft which I love. As for the volume part...it does give volume but then goes flat and it curls my hair awkwardly in all different directions. I just take that as my inexperience. Once I get the hang of it I&#x27;m sure it will be the best!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect international plug didn&#x27;t get shiney hair as stated not that easy to use quite disappointed with the product overall</li>
    <li> I did not realize this was a dryer with a brush attached.&lt;br /&gt;The size of brush is too big for my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more of a heat styling ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I return this item??&lt;br /&gt;There was no invoice included in the box</li>
    <li> I ordered this item a little over a year ago.  Now it is not working.  The motor bit the dust.  My friend has had the same one for 4 years and works great.  Now I am stuck with a defunct hair dryer and no recourse through Amazon.com to even replace it.  This should have lasted a lot longer especially since my friends is STILL working!!!! Very disappointed in Amazon...</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful styler and I&#x27;m really pleased with it!  Since I have curly hair it&#x27;s particularly nice having the rotating bristle brush when my hair is wet.  Just be careful not to get it too close to your scalp!  If by chance you do, and I have done so a few times, take your finger off the rotating bristle button right away!  Very uncomfortable!  Otherwise, super easy to use. This styler does a great job!</li>
    <li> Okay I admit I purchased due to Sharon a makeup artist on YouTube.  But I have to give her credit it is great.  It dries my hair quickly and gives me a professional looking result.  It is easy to use and of high quality.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best thing since pumpkin pie! My mom is in love with this product! It came on time, and in the condition stated.</li>
    <li> No more trying to manage a brush , roll the brush, and handle and aim the dryer.  this does it all for you!!  It is great...absolutely great!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this....over the years I have tried all sorts of flat irons, curling irons, you name it, and this one takes the cake. Easy to use and dries and smooths at the same time. My hair is very thick and wavy and I have such a hard time getting it smooth, but this does it....don&#x27;t need any other curling irons with this! Love it!</li>
    <li> Takes much lesser time to style your hair. I love it especially cuz it gives lovely curls. Good for shorter hair(shoulder length) Remember to let your hair dry almost completely before using it!</li>
    <li> I loved this Hot Air Spin Styler !&lt;br /&gt;I saw and tested it for the 1st time on a friend´s home, and decided that I must had to have one !&lt;br /&gt;So I went straight to Amazon and bought mine.  Was very happy when received it 2 days later and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend for those with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I made myself a &amp;#34;Farrah Fawcet&amp;#34; style :)</li>
    <li> I have shorter hair and use this each morning. It&#x27;s easier than breaking out the curling irons and other styling tools.</li>
    <li> I have never been good at trying to hold a round brush in one hand, the hair dryer in the other hand, and trying not to get the brush tangled in my hair all at the same time. This device combines the round brush and hair dryer all in one. It has three temperature settings: a low and high setting with heat and a cool setting.  It has a button at the top which controls the direction you want the Spin Styler to turn.  The bristles of the brush are anti-static which is really great for fine hair which tends to flyaway. This hair tool makes it much easier to achieve great-looking hair.</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer/spinning brush I have ever used.  Very reasonably priced and extremely easy to use.  It puts out enough heat to dry my hair quickly without burning my scalp.  Impossible to tangle hair as I tried to see if it would.  It has two separate buttons that spin in opposite directions that are located close together.  Works best on wet hair, but has several heat settings including cool.  Will work on 2 1/2 inch bangs is made for use on longer hair.  Leaves hair smooth and gets rid of the frizzies on my curly hair and if you get close to the scalp it will add a very noticeable amount of volume to your style.</li>
    <li> Product not good for curling or giving body.  If you just want to straighten it works great, but makes hair pretty limp.</li>
    <li> I watched a few YouTube reviews by women with hair as close to mine as I could find before I decided to try this product.  The ladies in the videos made it look so easy that I decided to give it a try and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, my hair is half way down my back, very thick and wavy.  The texture of my hair is coarse and tends to be frizzy before styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I am very pleased with the spin brush using it on fully wet hair.  However, when I followed the directions and air dried my hair 80 - 90% (as recommended) I got frizz and poofy hair that required a straightener to smooth down into a style that I felt was presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally it takes me an hour to style my hair after it air dries using my Chi Flat Iron and tons of product.  This was a one step process that took my hair from completely wet to styled in around 20 - 25 minutes which I found very impressive.  I used a few sprays of hair strengthener, a thermal protector and a drop of smoothing serum to assure that I got the best results on both the wet and mostly dry hair methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern is with the completely wet styling method.  Hair is at its weakest when wet and the styler could snap the hair off during styling and to be honest with you I did notice a few strands of hair in the spin brush after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had my spin brush a short time, and I love the time saving that the wet method allows me but would love to hear from someone who has used the styler long term about hair breakage and damage.</li>
    <li> I can not use this item, it is too large and will not grip my hair.  Indeed something just like it, only smaller.</li>
    <li> I watched the video a number of times and what looked so easy wasn&#x27;t in real life.  Every time I tried it my hair got tangled up around the brush. I should have sent it back fr a refund but got so frustrated after repeatedly trying to use it that I tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have short hair (layers, the longest part falls one inch below my ears) and this product works wonders! I had been using my straightener every day for the last 5 years. I always have to be presentable because of my job, so it took me pretty long to get ready in the morning, even with the short hair. No more. I am so glad I found this product. I compared it to the babyliss, and this actually has more power and works very well, so there is no need to pay more. In fact, many reviewers said you have to dry your hair first and then use this styler. In my case, the styler dries and styles my hair without pre-drying it. Just pat dry with your towel and work the magic.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful.</li>
    <li> I could never get that blown out look I get from salons until I bought this product. I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but for a beginner, I LOVE LOVE LOVE how easy this is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t fry out my hair. I don&#x27;t smell burning hair when I use it which is GREAT.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have tried blow dryers with brush attachments but they were terrible. They pulled and tangled my hair. This product actually works. It is easy to use and it leaves my hair shiny, full, and nicely curled under. My hair also dries in like half the time. It is so much easier than trying to juggle both a curling iron and a round brush separately. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife says it works very well on her medium hair. But I understand it won&#x27;t do much on long. For sure is a best product for short hair. She recommends the styler.</li>
    <li> I have never been one to use hair dryers and brushes to straighten my long curly hair, I never had patience, but with this brush 10 mins I have beautiful straight hair and some very nice balance.  my hair is below my shoulders and with this brush it looks like it was done by a hair dresser.  It takes practice and it isnt hard on my hands, I suffer from carpel tunnel.</li>
    <li> Good for medium length hair maybe, but not long hair, hair gets tangled by the handle toward the bottom of the brush.</li>
    <li> I do like this hair dryer. It makes my hair shine and takes out the frizzy ends, I think it will work better as my hair grows longer as the barrel is large and my hair is only shoulder length now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughters both like it too, they straighten their very curly hair and this straightens but leaves body and waves instead of the sharp edges left by the flat iron.</li>
    <li> works as I read in previous reviews.  Works better when my hair is longer (clearly shoulder length) than shorter (below ears) -- it does not blow as much heat as my usual hair dryer and does not dry as quickly, but better at helping with the long ends and giving a slight flip or curve under.</li>
    <li> I love this spinning brush!  Do play with it to familiarize yourself with the controls before needing to style your hair in a hurry!  It works very smoothly (spin-wise) and the air brown through the spinning brush is sufficient to do a good job, drying hair.  It&#x27;s great for thin, fine hair - makes the max of every precious hair!  Unlike many hot hair tools, it seems to actually be good to my hair, not damaging in any way.  And the tool does include a cool shot!  One more thing - although is seems rather large, it fits comfortably the hand and is Not heavy!  I only wish the Infinitipro Spin Air rotating Styler came in a smaller size as I just cut my hair short.  I still use it to add body, but the barrel is too large to be of much use for styling shorter locks.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it does make my hair nice and smooth. No Flyaways.  I gave it a 4 stars as I do not like the way it sometimes catches my hair at the seam at the top of the brush while rotating.  I also wished it has dual voltage as I travel a lot.  This particular brush cannot be used outside USA as per the instruction that we should NOT plug it into a converter.  Sigh!</li>
    <li> This spin air rotating styler has made my life easy. I am really low maintainance with my hair and hardly blow dry myself. This product is very simple to use when you get a hang of the right and left buttons. If you are used to blow drying your hair with a brush you might not be happy with this but if you like to simplify , this is it! I start using it when the hair is almost dry because the heat and air is not strong enough to dryyour hair completely.</li>
    <li> finally, after trying so many hair equipment i found a blow dryer that&#x27;s so fast &amp; easy to use. aside from this it will give you a really nice body. i was commended several times with my hair using this brand. after using it, i look like i just stepped of the salon. amazing product!</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work properly.  I gave it as a gift the end of October and the person tried it for the first time this weekend and the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate.  Amazon won&#x27;t take it back so I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer usually takes me 45 minutes to dry hair now about 20 to 25 minutes well worth every penny!</li>
    <li> the bristles of the brush are very soft, when I took off the protective cover, the brush cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> I have asian medium fine/oily hair. Currently my hair is shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) bring shine to your hair&lt;br /&gt;2) add volume&lt;br /&gt;3) create soft curls&lt;br /&gt;4) Easy to use. not hard to grip as some review said. and it&#x27;s not heavier than a normal hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Not very good for hair shorter than shoulder length becuase of the brush size.&lt;br /&gt;2) curls won&#x27;t hold up as using a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider before buying (not pros and cons, just personal consideration):&lt;br /&gt;1) it does NOT replace a hair dryer. which increases the usage time.&lt;br /&gt;2) I have oily hair (I wash my hair everyday) and I notice that it makes my hair look greasier at the end of the day. maybe of the shine it adds?!?!&lt;br /&gt;3) if your goal it&#x27;s to create curls, buy a curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline:&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to ladies with long fine normal hair. Who is looking for a styling tool to create soft curls.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad, but I don&#x27;t feel like it really gets hot enough. I also prefer the harder plastic bristle on this type of product rather than the brush style.  The spinning action can be a bit convenient once you get the hang of which side spins in which direction.  I had gotten a body wave and was hating it, so I started searching for products to help the blow out and styling process to make it smoother and wavy instead of frizzy.  Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush gets hot enough, has the bristle type I prefer, and works well, but it doesn&#x27;t blow, while the Conair Hot Air Curling combo has both type of bristle attachments and blows, but again, not really hot enough. If I could combine all three products into one I would be thrilled.</li>
    <li> I used to have slightly wavy hair before I got pregnant with my daughter. It was easy to smooth out with just brushing and heat. My hair came in extremely curly while pregnant and stayed that way. I wear it mostly curly, because it hangs in soft ringlets. Every now and then, I just want it straight and smooth without too much work. This product is perfect! I usually use a hair dryer before using this to save time. It does a pretty good job at making my hair really smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is for anyone who is blow dryer inept. I have never used a dryer before because I always ended with a giant friz ball, but this product has taught me the way. Now I can&#x27;t comment on how it works on long hair but for my short bob it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this. I have shoulder length fine hair and it works great. I used to have to blow dry and flat iron my hair which caused a lot of damage. I now only have to use this. It dries quick and give a lot of volume. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I was very disappointed.  Having read the reviews, I expected better performance.  However, I much prefer my Revlon hot air curling brush that is 1 1/2 inches.  It&#x27;s actually easier for me to maneuver than this brush and is MUCH faster! I kept hitting the button that sent this one in the wrong direction, which did tangle my hair!  And the brush part is really too soft to move efficiently through the hair.  My hair is only shoulder length, and it&#x27;s not thick, but I have a lot of it!  I&#x27;ll keep it for a backup, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again and would recommend the other hot air hair brushes over this rotating one.</li>
    <li> I have used a Babyliss version of this for many years but have not been able to take it on holiday with me due to the voltage difference. With this product I can now get the same great results on holiday as I can at home. Have recommended this product to my friends. One happy lady.</li>
    <li> This is fun to use and amazingly my long hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up in it.  It isn&#x27;t 100% but it is fast and makes my curly/frizzy hair presentable.  I have another hot air brush that works better but I have to work harder with it to get my hair done.  I think either a dab of hair oil or frizz preventer would make it work better than just to do it on dry hair.  Someone else said it needed to get hotter and that&#x27;s probably true.  It still works ok though and it&#x27;s fun to have that brush spinning in your hair without tearing your roots out.</li>
    <li> This is the GREATEST hair tool invented for people who hate to use the round brush and blow dryer like me!  It&#x27;s seriously a great way to get great body and lift for your hair.  I absolutely love this thing!</li>
    <li> To big. Not even what I was wanting</li>
    <li> I really liked the product, I recommend to everyone, because it facilitates the life and the resources that you want to get with him; Also, the price was very good;</li>
    <li> I bought two of those as a gift and they stopped working after three and eight times of by using them. DON&#x27;T BUY!!</li>
    <li> I have hair that hits right at the top of my shoulder, and the barrel is just too large.  It made my hair very flat and static; not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I had this product already here in Australia but due to frequent trips to the USA decided to get one just for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Great for anyone with layered, shoulder length or longer hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s amazing. It made my fine, straight, and long hair look like I&#x27;d just had a professional blow out for a fraction of the cost. Also it only took me about 20 minutes to do this at home. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, easy to hold and I love the look and colors of the styler. Definitely a professional level tool and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the bristles are not rigid enough to smooth my hair, but it is a nice dryer.</li>
    <li> I like this product for touchups to my bangs, etc. between hair washings. I don&#x27;t have the patience to style my entire head with it (instead prefer the old hot curler option for that), but it works well for touch ups. The spinning brush is not helpful to me, but I imagine that it would be great for some people. My only complaint is that the styler is so huge; but I could have figured it out from the product dimensions, I suppose. I have installed a hook behind a door on which to store and hide the device, because it&#x27;s too big and not working with my bathroom decor.</li>
    <li> It works, but if you have fine hair....it tangle...</li>
    <li> I admit to being hair style challenged..and as I&#x27;ve decided to allow my hair to grow out..I found no volumn for this child of the 80s a mis.  This tool has made it easy to style and given volumm to my otherwise flat and lifeless hair.  Used with a spray gel my hair turns out perfect every time.  Hope to never be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 other spinning styles .. forever ago. They were soo difficult to use I happily threw them out after they pulled my hair and became hopelessly tangled in my hair. This styler drier is easy to use and even until you get the hang of it easily releases your hair if it does become slightly tangled. It definitely polish&#x27;s hair as advertised. Surprisingly after using it for a couple of months my hair even seem smoother out of the shower before using it. I know that probably sounds odd but even when I wash it at night and retire without drying my hair the next morning it&#x27;s smooth and not frizzy. Just absolutely love this styler. I&#x27;m not all that handy but this product comes closer than anything to make my hair look like I just came from the salon.</li>
    <li> IT IS AMAZING, AND SURPRISED ME HOW QUICK IT DRIED YOU HAIR.  GOOD,NOT GREAT PRODUCT.  I AM GLAD I CHECKED YOUR PRICES, YOU WERE THE CHEAPEST BY FAR.</li>
    <li> Product does not work in the UAE or any middle eastern country where electricity supply is 220/240 v over 50 hertz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 500 W with a 110/120v requirement over 50 hertz. When I contacted conair, they told me I could NOT use it with an adapter, and also, a voltage converter would not fix the problem cause the cycles would differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check before you buy this product if you can use it in your residence country, as I found out only after I received the product.</li>
    <li> I love it! I read a lot of reviews before purchasing it, and i was afraid because some people said it didn&#x27;t work for them. My Personal Experience : It does EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!! I wanted a easy to use tool to blow dry the ends of my hair, and this is it! If you are looking for something to give your hair a little shape, must try!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product purchased on Amazon!!!!  I have used it for a month and absolutely LOVE it!!!  This is the easiest, yes the easiest way to dry and style your hair.  It took about two uses to learn how to get the hang of it.  Not only does it dry your hair, it makes the frizz go away and makes hair shiny.  I have bought more to give to family and  friends.  This works! I can now save money getting my hair done myself.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here, which I mostly&lt;br /&gt;do before buying anything on amazon &amp; some&lt;br /&gt;people write very candid &amp; sincere reviews which&lt;br /&gt;is a great plus of this site.  I have dry &amp; curly hair&lt;br /&gt;which become very curly after wash and as they&lt;br /&gt;dry out the curls begin to straiten.  I don&#x27;t mind&lt;br /&gt;having curly hair if they remain that way, but the&lt;br /&gt;problem is they start to straiten out and then become&lt;br /&gt;messy which I hate!  I was using blow dryer, but it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;too much work and I never could perfect the technique&lt;br /&gt;of a hairstylist...so I was trying to see if there is any&lt;br /&gt;alternative.  I saw the commercial on TV &amp; did my&lt;br /&gt;homework on Amazon &amp; decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy with the Infinitypro styler.&lt;br /&gt;It works great leaves my hair shiny, adds volume&lt;br /&gt;to my hair &amp; much less work.  Only thing I have to&lt;br /&gt;do is let my hair dry little bit before using it so it is&lt;br /&gt;even more easy to work with.  So if you are in a hurry&lt;br /&gt;after washing your hair towel dry them and do rest of the&lt;br /&gt;things like putting make-up, and rest of the getting ready&lt;br /&gt;stuff and do the hair last.  This way the hair gets more&lt;br /&gt;time to dry &amp; you spend less time doing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;By the time you are ready to leave you have freshly&lt;br /&gt;done nice shiny hair : )</li>
    <li> Got this a little over a year ago (Christmas 2012).  There is a bit of a learning curve on how best to use it (depending on long or short hair), but once you get it down it&#x27;s wonderful.  What I like best is this works as well on dry hair as wet hair.  In fact, I&#x27;ve been able to go longer between hair washings with this curler.  I&#x27;m so happy I got it and highly recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I feel this product is misrepresented.  It is very bulky and even after practicing with it the styler became no easier to handle.  Was completely unable to use this product and do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great for people who can&#x27;t do the brush in one hand and dryer in the other. It makes my hair nice and full. It takes a time or two to get a technique  but once you do it is a great timesaver.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This spin air rotating styler works exactly like it is supposed to.  It spins around while it blows warm air to dry your hair.  It does leave your hair smooth which is why I bought it.  (I have damaged hair and it can show a bit frizzy at times).  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t think to check out the size of the roller before I bought it so it is larger than I normally would have bought.</li>
    <li> This hair styling tool has changed the way I feel about styling my hair. My hair right now is shoulder length and is cut in the style that Jennifer Aniston wore in the TV sitcom, Friends. With this one tool I can achieve  beautifully styled hair in less than 10 minutes. I usually let my hair dry about 10 minutes then I put a dab of mousse in  it and a stylin&#x27; I go. My arms and hands are no longer tired from handling both a brush and a blow dryer which never gave me the effect I wanted anyway - now all I have to coordinate is this one tool. I wish I&#x27;d had this when I was in my twenties. Thank you so much Conair for making this fabulous tool.</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft doesn&#x27;t grab the hair, and it pulls the hair out so badly , the heat is not okay you have to work on each strand more than twenty times to make it dry , it&#x27;s not efficient for long hair ,  maybe it we&#x27;ll work for short hair , it dosnt curl the hair at all  ,</li>
    <li> This did nothing but tangle in my long hair.  Was a waste of time to try to use.</li>
    <li> I would never buy another one of these, it didn&#x27;t even work very well. It will only work on low.waste of money</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this thing.  Not only does it NOT make my bathroom as hot as my regular hair dryer, I think it has also saved me from developing carpal tunnel in my wrists from twisting my round brush a million times attempting to get my hair smooth.  My blow out lasts for days and even my hair stylist has said that it looks like a pro did my hair when I use it.  I will definitely purchase again or at least a viable replacement if it ever breaks!</li>
    <li> This styler is great for short to medium hair. It&#x27;s also great for bangs and short layers. gives a lot of volume. Not fantastic for those long strands though.</li>
    <li> Good product,  great price. Works great. Would recommend to anyone with medium to long hair. My daughter and granddaughter like to use it also.</li>
    <li> Great tool to tame frizz</li>
    <li> Someone else was cleaning for me and &amp;#34;somehow&amp;#34; it stopped rotating after, had to buy another cause I love it. I have bad neck and shoulders and this is the best thing ever to be able to use with just one hand/arm. Only wish I had known about it before I had shoulder surgery a few years ago.  I actually called the surgeons office to have them recommend it for other patients!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy because she feels good whith her hair.&lt;br /&gt;No more hours arround brushes!&lt;br /&gt;10 mim and she&#x27;s done whith it!</li>
    <li> No cool setting, pulls hair out if used when hair is too wet.  Adds body and texture.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  As a stroke victim, I have limited mobility on my left side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I cannot grasp anything at all with my left hand, so this styler is ideal for me to dry and style my hair at the same time with use of only my right hand and arm extensions It does a great job and I am thrilled with it so far.  I plan on using it  with both hands when I am recovered on my left side.  Actually it probably works best when using both hands for styling,  I wish I could , but for now I&#x27;m grateful for this styler. it&#x27;s a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;  Pat Jones</li>
    <li> I have used this styler with both long hair and short (very short bob) and it has worked wonders on both.  Overall I would say that it actually works better on my short hair, contradictory to what a few other reviews have stated, but it might just all depend on your hair.  Overall, this was one of the best stylers I have ever purchased and it has replaced both my blow dryer, straightener and curler for over half the time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  For the first time ever I can get my hair to look like it does after visiting the salon.  I have shoulder length hair with layers and this works so well.  I use it slightly damp and with my hair dry.  Works great both ways.  I am just so thrilled to have found this.  I even suggested it to my elderly mother who has thinning hair and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair and this works really great.  I have really frizzy hair and this gives my hair a nice shine and a lot of body in no time at all.  I&#x27;m really bad at doing my own hair and this is really easy for me.  I have three teenage daughters with long hair and this doesn&#x27;t work as great on their hair get&#x27;s tangled up easier but, does add body and shine. It is bulky but still easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this styler a lot. It works really well, especially for short hair.  I have also used it to blow out my hair when it was waist length and it came out straight, beautiful and full.  The only problem is it stops working after a couple months of daily use.  Althought it&#x27;s not cheap to replace, it is still cheaper than getting blow outs at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great hot air spinning brush I absolutely love it, I&#x27;m happy that I purchased this, this is a must have.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but great things to say about this Rotating Hot Air Styler because it takes all the hard work and need for multiple and different styles and blow dryers. I saw something similar to this product on TV several times but was never able to catch the info for ordering the INFINITPRO SPIN AIR BRUSH. I purchased this Hot Spin Air Brush to help cut down the need for multiple Styling Products like Blow- Dryers, Curling Iron, Straighteners as it gives you the task of doing your hair and keeping the bothersome needs for different styling products, and face it wouldn&#x27;t you prefer the ease of styling  your hair with one product versus 3-4 I do and the look you can get.with the same styles.as you would get with multiple products. I am tremendously satisfied with this great product of 1 product versus 3-4 of the others but another great feature is that it has 3 settings and the best part is the rotating  feature you can use for that beautiful  shine and polished look you expect from all your other hair care needs, so yes I recommend this INFINITPRO SPIN AIR BRUSH BY CONAIR, THE ONE GREAT COMPANY THAT GIVES YOU GREAT PRODUCTS TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY AND IS AFFORDABLE. I GIVE IT A 5 STARS AND YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
    <li> I like this. It is much easier to use than I expected it to be. The problem I have is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Me hair is very dry and highlighted, gave me a very smooth and shine look. Love it.</li>
    <li> Works great just as described</li>
    <li> Love this. Leaves hair silky and bouncy and with lots of volume. I use it with the styling serum (had several different types - all work). My hair is shoulder length and chemically treated , therefore are coarse and untamed. This tames them</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a similar product that my wife had used for about 20 years and loved. Well, she likes this one even more and she is extremely happy with it, and when shes happy I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> It makes my hairs very silky. Good for hairs which are easily to get tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work for shorter and thick hairs for volumizing .</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job and quickly, too.  Just bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this Spin Air!  I have been using this for a little more than a month.  I went to you tube to view how others were using it since the directions aren&#x27;t too explanatory.  I gave it a try and was really pleased with the results.  It does take a little time to get used to controlling it.&lt;br /&gt; I usually dry my roots some, with my hair dryer.  Then I let hair air dry till it is about 70% dry and then use the spin brush to finish drying and set the style. I separate my hair into sections with clips.  Using smaller sections, no wider than the brush helps, to maintain control of styling.&lt;br /&gt;I had shoulder length hair when I first bought this brush.  My hair is thinner, straighter on top and sides, but thicker, curlier in the back.  I was able to use this brush for a blowout, and was I ever ecstatic.  It was the first time I ever got a great blowout at home, that gave me the look I get from the hair salon.  I was so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Now, this past week, I had my hair cut an inch or so shorter, to barely at top of shoulder, so it&#x27;s more of a bob.  It does a great job, looks just like I went to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes my hair so shiny and soft.  I can style my hair in about 10 minutes.  Really great for doing a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;Now, because my hair is so thick in the back,  when I put this on low speed,  it sorta &#x27;drags&#x27; and doesn&#x27;t spin as well, but the higher speed does just fine.  Definitely very happy with this product.  Hope this helps anyone trying to make a decision.  And, I found Amazon to have the best price.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. No only does it reduce hair drying time by more than half but it is also a amazing styler that allows you to do different styles by simply rotating the brush!  No more arm cramps from holding the hair dryer in one hand and the hair brush in another!</li>
    <li> I have heavy thick hair and it tends to lay flat, this styler gives it lift and better body. I wish I had this back when I was young. I am already telling my friends and sister about it.</li>
    <li> Great for finishing thick, longer hair. Need to towel dry well or use a regular drier first to save time.</li>
    <li> This product works very well; it is definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little practice; but, well-worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels much healthier.</li>
    <li> Styling with one hand is always a challenge.  I love this styler.  Unlike older &amp;#34;versions&amp;#34; of this rotating wand, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck.  And it if does, the reverse motion makes it easy to untangle.  I love that it adds just the right amount of body and smoothness.  Honestly, it makes life easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m soooooo happy with my purchased!! Loved it ...thos brush really do the work for you...I use it every weekend</li>
    <li> This is my second spin dryer. My hair has not looked so healthy since I was in high school. The learning curve is a little tedious but so worth it if you can stay with it. My sister has frizzy hair and she loved it too. Great product and a permanent addition to my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> My hair comes out silky smooth and really shinny ,,,  I love it ,,,,  and my whole family always say how nice my hair looks !!!</li>
    <li> The product does dry and style.&lt;br /&gt;However, the spinning brush locks up often and make a winning noise when the spend cycle is used.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair. I was a little scare my hair would get tangled in the brush. But if that happens the hair is not pull out too hard…:-) I think if you dry your hair a little bit before hand it works better/faster. I have used it only twice. It is not magic. It will take you a little longer to style your hair, but the results are very good and last longer!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Took about 1 week yo get the hang of it.  Can&#x27;t use it on soaking wet hair so I just air dry for about 15 minutes.  I have curly, wavy hair.  Even after a pony tail it&#x27;s pretty straight!</li>
    <li> I ordered this so I could wear my hair straight, But if you hit the wrong button this will grab your hair and pull it or get tangled in your hair. You have to get the hang of it and move slowly with it. I have a lot of hair so it is time consuming. May work well for someone with less hair than me.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  She had to have it. She may have used it once so I commandeered it and I absolutely love it.  It makes my hair full with tons of body.  I love recycling gifts!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases ever made; it works great.  It worked for my chin length hair too!  It gives volume and shine.</li>
    <li> I was completely inept at trying to blow dry my hair with the big round brushes.  I hated trying to get my hair right.  I felt like I should have a few extra hands to hold brushes, dryers and mirrors.  This cured me.  Seriously, my hairdresser was amazed the first time I came in after I used this styler.  The frizz was gone and my hair has wonderful waves and body.  I just let the hair dry a little in a towel as I do my make up then blow it a little to get it to the slight dampness they recommend, then it goes SO FAST that it&#x27;s nearly amazing.  My hair is shoulder length.  So far I have NOT had any problems with the hair getting rolled up and stuck in it.  That was my biggest worry at first.  So, if you&#x27;re like me and feel like only an octopus could really get their hair right, TRY THIS.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve got to put in the time to make this second nature.  I thought I&#x27;d like it better then a styler with a non-rotating head, but I don&#x27;t.  Yes, this gives me a smoother finish, but I think it&#x27;s a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> awesome makes your hair shine cause of the repetitive brushing and mine is also finally growing. and  I stopped using my flat iron so my hair is healthier. love this product use it every  day.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look awesome&lt;br /&gt;You do have to split your into sections and then use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium long hair and it works :)&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair straighter, silky looking and volumized.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this for people with straight hair because they get less out of the product</li>
    <li> This is NOT a hairdryer.  It is a styling tool that you use after you have dried your hair about 80%. It has brush bristles instead of plastic , unlike some other stylers. I absolutely love my new styler.  It does have a large handle, but even though I have small hands it is still easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you watch the YOU Tube videos to learn the best way to use this styler.  It is a learning process.  You Tube has a video of this exact styler , and how to use it.  You do need to section the hair off, and then do as the videos tell you to.&lt;br /&gt;I am 75 years old, with shoulder length hair. My hair is still thick, and has always been very difficult to control.  Now using this styler I can have sleek hair.&lt;br /&gt;I made a careful selection of which styler to buy, and reviewed them all.  This is the very best styler for your money.  You do not need a more expensive styler.  This one will give you body, and nice sleek hair.  I do use Argan oil first,  before I style it to give my hair the moisture it needs, as my hair is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;You will not go wrong if you take time, and  learn how to use this styler.  I do not work for this company, so this review is a real one !</li>
    <li> Works really well, and the results are great!</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke. 500 watts is not enough to generate heat or air to dry your hair. I had to get out a regular 1875 watt hair dryer and dry my hair first. Then I used the spin styler. You need to section your hair into tiny portions. The bristles are flimsy so it just grabs the thinnest, bottom part of the hair. After 20 mins my arms got tired and I gave up. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> This contraption works as is says it will.  It&#x27;s quicker than using a blow drier with a round brush, it creates volume and smooth curved hair quickly so you can get out the door to work, I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product very often so I&#x27;d say it was a good buy. It makes my hair nice and soft. However I feel the bristles are a little apart and spare. They are also a little too soft but maybe that&#x27;s what make the hair soft. I do hope they are more in volume and thicker though.  Also when I put mine on the cool setting it can&#x27;t rotate so I kind of wish the brush could still spin when it is on the cool setting. The product is pretty big. The weight is alright. I wish the handle is a little smaller so easier to maneuver.</li>
    <li> I suck at drying my hair with a hair dryer and a hair brush lol but as soon as I saw this all in one brush and hair dryer I had to get it! So far I&#x27;m really enjoying it because it&#x27;s easy to hold and to use! For me it works! I have fine hair btw so I really don&#x27;t know how it will be for those with super thick hair ... it&#x27;s as powerful as a hotel hair dryer if you really want to know how powerful it is .. anyways will update as I go :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this styler AT ALL. The brush is too too soft and thin to grab the hair, the &amp;#34;brush hair&amp;#34; bends easily and disappear inside your hair while pulling it down to the hair ends! And you will end up trying to release your poor hair from the Devilish Brush&#x27;s Hands!!!!  Secondly, once you switch it on you will experience a horrible burnt-like smell which makes u feel that you would expect it to blow in your hand in any minute!!!  It is laying there in my drawer since the first use! I never went back to use it again. This is a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t worth a penny! NOT SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It is so nice to have the curler and blow dryer in one set up saves time and my bangs look great!</li>
    <li> I like this  electric styling brush. It took me a little time to get used to the rotating buttons that make the brush roll.  I have shoulder length hair so it works well. I do wish it came with a smaller brush also to do my  layered top of my hair. The brush that came with this is to big. If it came along with a smaller brush also I would have given this 5 stars</li>
    <li> Makes my hair frizzy &amp; staticy. Also was not happy with the supplier. They caused me a huge headache when I wanted to return it. Supplier was Kevin Kyle. Eventually they refunded me the money, but it was a disaster. I do not recommend this product nor the supplier.</li>
    <li> I just find it hard to use it in a way that my hair won&#x27;t get tangled around the brush while I&#x27;m using it. Maybe I just need more practice, when it comes to that part. But there is another thing that makes it harder for me keep on using it. You see, if I don&#x27;t pause every now and then while it brushes my hair, something seem to spark within the brush then it suddenly stops spinning. Even if I press the switches to either direction, it just won&#x27;t spin. So, I wait for a few seconds before it would spin again. And if I let it brush my hair for a bit longer again, without pausing, the same things happens. I&#x27;m worried that it might cause some short circuits or fire or whatever.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it worked great.  Much gentler on my medium length hair.  Have recommended to my daughter for her long hair</li>
    <li> The control switch is in a bad location.  Continually hitting the button while trying to fix my hair.  Gave product away</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t great. For thick hair it is completely worthless. For thin hair it works decently. Some people love it but I don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I loved it at first because it made saved me so much time, but after a while my hair felt dry. Perhaps  an ionic element would help with the dryness. Sad to say that I do not use it anymore</li>
    <li> It works as indicated.  Very easy to use but I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> I need to practice because it is super heavy. But it does dry fast, or maybe because i let my hair air dry for a bit  before I even turn this thing on. One thing to note, YOUR hair will NOT be like the girl in the commercial/print ads. Sorry</li>
    <li> Started on fire after r something broke inside</li>
    <li> I loved the Infiniti Pro Spin Air Rotating Brush. It takes a couple times to get used to the brush but it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is good for dry hair only.  It give nice curls.  Not strong enough to dry wet hair so what I do is I wash my hair let it air dry (or go to bed with wet hair) and in the morning I curled it.</li>
    <li> it dried my hair, faster than a normal blow drier, yet it left a bump around my head where the rotating styler endedon myhair line.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Makes life easier.  I saw my niece&#x27;s hair and we have same texture wavy frizzy.  She told me about this and I like it.  I would make one suggestion to manufacturer.  Make the barrel a little smaller so it is easier to turn, and the brush a little longer because if you take too much hair at one time it gets stuck in grooves.  It would be a lot faster if you didn&#x27;t have to take little sections, but it does do the job and looks like a professional blow out.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Highly recommend. My hair is not even shoulder length...but it styles it in minutes...I wake up with scrambled hair and style it so easily...can put off washing it for days...which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Works like when you come out of a salon. Frizzy hair gone too. Leaves hair smooth, and healthy looking. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality and item has broken after 4 month of usage. It just stopped working one day and it doesn&#x27;t switch on when I press on/off button. I have tried to return it but the brush can only be returned in US and conair can send a replacement to US address only so 3 years warranty is worthless if you live outside US. They said the voltage and hertz in the UK are not compatible with the requirements of this unit and may cause the unit to fail if used outside of north American current so be aware if you don&#x27;t live in US. However, the brush itself can help to make quite stylish look very quickly and the hair really shy afterwards.</li>
    <li> It was a pretty big surprise. She was looking all over for it. For the right price of course.. But for me. Looking how the way her hair turned out and how happy she was. WOW it was priceless to me.*</li>
    <li> the brush is very large and the spinning just kind of tangles my hair. Plus, and this is probably just me, invariably I push the wrong spin button, so it is spinning in the wrong direction.  I have just gone back to my non spinning brush dryer</li>
    <li> It is a good brush overall but it was very disappointing to me that it does not rotate at the cool air setting.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Fast dry and style. Barrel is a little too big for my length of hair (just below my ears). Wish there was a smaller one. Good price with Amazon. I compared prices elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and it took some practice to stop pulling it out with this brush, but overall its easy to use and I am happy with the way it styles my hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin, and the bristles are very hard and scratch your head.</li>
    <li> I have thin, very curly and frizzy hair. While it isn&#x27;t too hot and does a decent job, dust accumulates really quickly in the creases and I feel like it pulls on my hair a lot. I only use it occasionally now since it isn&#x27;t easy to clean</li>
    <li> I use  this most days.  I grabs my thin straight hair and gives it volume  My hair is very long so I do not get a lot of curl but I do get volume and it makes my hair very shiny.  No more fuzz!</li>
    <li> I love using this tool. I use it every day. It is not as harsh as a blow dryer and round bursh. I use it on dry hair not wet but my hair is very thick.</li>
    <li> I am not someone with the patience to style my hair with a blow dryer and when I put something that spins (or even a round brush for that matter) in my hands, I can only make it work on one side of my head. The other side I just go all spastic! But, since this brush actually spins both ways and the buttons to make it spin are very well placed for control with your thumb, I have found that I can use it. I am still very impatient and don’t use every day but when I want to take a little extra effort with my hair, this is now part of my styling routine.</li>
    <li> This is not easy to use, and does not work well with short or medium hair.  Handle is too large and hard to use the buttons.  Do not recommend,</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to a regular blowdryer that can tangle your hair especially mine since I have fine hair. makes it smooth</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair tool on my very long hair.  It gives body and shine because of the rotation and cannot get stuck in the hair ... it has a reverse roll button.  I use the forward and reverse on hair to smooth my curls.  Quite a nice invention!</li>
    <li> I am from Italy and my hair is super long, thick, frizzy and coarse. Before buying the InfnitiPro I had no choice but going to a salon where very few people have the skills required to blow dry such hair.  Fourty dollars almost every time for no satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can do my hair in no time with results that are amazing! My only regret is I did not discover this product earlier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies RUN don&#x27;t walk to buy this today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours in perfect Hair, Paola</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull hair too bad but it will pull if you twist too much hair.  It does release without a problem.  It gets a bit hotter than I expected, but after I burnt myself I learned not to touch it.  The bristles are a bit few and flimsy so they fall out sometimes, but it could be my long hair. Regardless I use it in place of my round brush and it works quite nice</li>
    <li> You need a little practice to get used to it, but I love it. I have long, fine hair and I bought the styler hoping to get some volume into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume wise, not so much. Or maybe I&#x27;m not getting the techniques right. I&#x27;ve seen some youtube instructional videos, it seems to work for them. Maybe if you add a little product, it would work better. I just don&#x27;t like putting stuff in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does give the soft, salon blown dry effect, unlike those of hair straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side: I followed the instructions and blow my hair to 80% dry before using it. But it still takes some time to get your hair styled.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle! ...This works so well....I have never had so many compliments on my hair before! I love this great product!</li>
    <li> I gave long layered hair and I kept getting other pieces of hair tangled in it.  I really believe this would have worked, but you need extra hands behind your head like a stylist.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase of this item except my sister steals it. My hair looks healthier when I use it.</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected. It takes way to much time to style the hair and it doesn&#x27;t even blow that much hot air so you have to first blow dry your hair and then use this rotating styler.</li>
    <li> OMG  It is wonderful and so much more than I was expecting.  Thank Goodness no more frizz and unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this 4 months ago. I have gone from really long, to shoulder length, and then chin length in those 4 months. The brush worked great for all three lengths.&lt;br /&gt;The shortest cut gets a nice blown out look, instead of waves or curls. Lots of volume &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product- it has cut down time to do my hair in half.  I taught myself how to use it by watching Youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Use is intuitive, I like that. I&#x27;m not a hair-do person, and don&#x27;t like investing much time creating a look. This device gives me a more finished appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Brush doesn&#x27;t spin on the cool setting, wish it did.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s more for styling than drying, but I would prefer a little more heat and power to the air current.&lt;br /&gt;Already lost the cover to the brush part, clumsy me. It would be nice if it had come with a travel pouch and a cleaning brush at this price point.</li>
    <li> it is not good, about one month this item don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t turn, don&#x27;t buy this product or this band.</li>
    <li> just have used it for the 1st time,though it&#x27;s not easy  to handle and get the advertising effect,at least not for me,i&#x27;m very happy with my natural curling and shining hair! love it!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s big,and i want to take it with me when i travel abroad next week!</li>
    <li> So I bought this for my wife as a birthday present.  She liked the idea of it being a brush that rotates and blows out hot and cold air.  Unfortunately it was to big to use on my wifes hair and didn&#x27;t rotate very well.  Also, my wife complained that it didn&#x27;t blow air very fast and would heat up then turn off automatically.  She decided she would only use it when she had extra time to get ready and then it broke completely.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair dries fast and the &amp;#34;polishing&amp;#34;b makes mt poor, old hair (82 us. young) like a 16 year old!,</li>
    <li> This looked like the best product ever. I waited and waited for this to be delivered  and finally tonight it was. I ripped open the package and used the styler as quickly as possibly. I hate it. It kept getting my hair all tangled. It was not what I wanted at all and will be returning it first thing in the morning!!! HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> I bit the bullet and purchased this product and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My hair is fine, thin and pin straight. I&#x27;ve used it so often that I forgot how crappy my hair looked when air dried. Air dried it the other night and quickly remembered! I wish they&#x27;d make a smaller barrel because my hair is shorter in the back and it doesn&#x27;t work for that area.</li>
    <li> I find this styler a little difficult to use, I prefer my salon purchased hot air brush for styling on a regular bases.</li>
    <li> The package was delivery quickly and exactly as explained.  I love this hot air brush.  This is the first one I have tried!  It works best on 80-90% dried hair.  I think being too wet just takes longer.  It leaves my hair with a bounce a slight curl.  I haven&#x27;t figured out if I can straighten it without curling it yet.  My hair hardly gets tangled in this brush, but if it does I just reverse the rotation and it falls right out.  I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer, it drys and gives my hair a loose curl all day. I have shoulder length hair, which is perfect for this type dryer. Just be careful when using with long hair, it can tangle up in it. Once you get it down you&#x27;ll love it....</li>
    <li> Wife loves this thing can&#x27;t stop raving about it everybody seems to like it good purchase</li>
    <li> My sister and my mother really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;it is easy to use and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tool. My hair is mid back length with the shortest layer at my chin and this gives my hair sooo much volume. It is so much easier than using a blow dryer and brush. It is also great to use for bangs, gives a nice volume and shine leaving your hair soft with that salon looking blow dry.</li>
    <li> Wife wanted something quick and easy to use. this is a well designed dryer/styler</li>
    <li> Not enough power to dry any hair</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works well.  The reverse rotation makes it easy to switch from one side of your head to the other, using the same hand,  with no strain on the wrist.  And, if your hair is as fine and straight as mine, it will dry your hair while styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen several reviewers complain because the &#x27;spin stopped working&#x27;.  There are three settings on the styler.  Instructions clearly state the item will not spin when set on &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know if that was their problem, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble using it daily since it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one who never learned those tricky moves required to style with a blow dryer and brush, this product is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.!</li>
    <li> This is a good tool for curling hair but does get some getting used to.  You need to blow dry your hair t 80% which is difficult to judge.  And the curler itself does take some practice.  I do like the finished product but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase, i can bliw dry and style my hair at the same time which is great. I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an ok item. May be my expectations where to high for it. I have fine, very curly (3B) hair, and a lot of it. I was hoping to use this styler to replace blow drying my hair, when I want to have them straightened. Well, this tool is not powerful enough for that. I guess, I can use it after I blow dry my hair, to create some volume and large waves.</li>
    <li> I just wish, sometimes, that it would have two sizes of brushes; one medium, so it would work better on short to medium hair.</li>
    <li> Even though it is a perfect styling tool, its not very durable and mine burnt up within a year&#x27;s time of being bought. I absolutely loved it and used it once a week and never really over used it, yet it gave up on me and I aint gonna buy a new one of this brand because i would rather buy something that lasts a couple of years!</li>
    <li> think main problem is lack of heat and power.cant recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the spin brush. Does not tangle hair and leaves it smooth and shinny.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in 1 1/2&amp;#34; size.</li>
    <li> I really liked the concept of this dryer/styler. The 2&amp;#34; brush was exactly what I was looking for to give volume to my  then medium length hair. I&#x27;m diagnosed with  fibromyalgia, and holding my hands above my head while juggling a brush and traditional dryer is difficult. Letting this styling tool do all the work seemed perfect. My problem came with the brush bristles. They just wouldn&#x27;t grab my fine hair. I have a similar tool with a smaller barrel that doesn&#x27;t rotate, and it has stiff wiry bristles that work perfectly. How I wish these were the same! The Infiniti&#x27;s are a soft plasticy and plush, and are spaced very closed together. They just glided over my hair. With a little manipulation, I could get it to grab a bit, but then my efforts often became a tangled mess. Sadly, I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months now and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I first thought when I opened it that the brush head would be too large for my hair. I don&#x27;t have super short hair but it&#x27;s not long either. It was perfect! I can dry my hair to curly and frizzy then use this and it smooths out my hair instantly! It&#x27;s so easy to use and never gets tangled in my hair. You can just roll it through your hair too without even picking up sections. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this styler. Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! Oh and I&#x27;m a retired hairstylist and would have loved to have had one of these to use on my clients!</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s easy works great on my hair. Love everything about it . Never going to go anywhere else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as magical as the video shows. If you don&#x27;t have long hair, maybe you should try other products</li>
    <li> It should not be sold to overseas customers. It overheats within 2 minutes in Australia</li>
    <li> Love it. Does the job quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s big a little heavy just like you will find in other comments from people. I think it will do the job but I still can&#x27;t make it work. My hair gets tangled and I do not see any volume effect. At least not more than I get with the dryer and the volumizing shampoo I use. At this moment is stored in a drawer :(. I need time to learn how to use it.</li>
    <li> I wish it also camr in a smaller barrel with auto spin...works great otherwise</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister because my hair is too short. It works very well on longer hair.  Wish they made one a bit smaller.</li>
    <li> it is the best product ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday! I have a short, stacked bob hairstyle, just above my neck and it works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> The spin brush is an excellent tool to smooth and style even the most stubborn frizzy, curly hair.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of the rotating feature ( which , by the way, rotates in both directions)  and I recommend styling in smaller sections to maximize results.  I watched a couple of videos online, as well, to get some more tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> It is okay if you have fine hair. I don&#x27;t use it to have curls coz you are not going to have them and if you do they won&#x27;t last. But good to dry your hair</li>
    <li> It works best on damp hair. Makes nice soft curls without drying out my hair. Sometimes this is the perfect tool for todays hairdo. Not difficult to coordinate, but I occasionally will hit the spin the wrong direction!</li>
    <li> Wife said that you should go to you-tube and few a few tutorial on this and how to use it properly. Daughter also loves it so very much.</li>
    <li> I bought my wife one of these about three years ago and she loved it.  But, the current one was getting old and not working properly so for her birthday I found this one and it was cheaper sent to my door than if I had purchased it at a store.  She loves this item</li>
    <li> Am still learning to use it and how to use it for my below the ear hair length. The twirling gives me a challenge to make sure I have the roller going in the right way up or under. Not sure about the cool marker since it&#x27;s still warm. Still like and my daughter ordered one immediately and girl friend wants me to order one for her so that&#x27;s to be done next week--I think. So yes, thus far I&#x27;m learning, but love it and the color. First new one I&#x27;ve owned in over 30 years. So here&#x27;s to new learning and beginnings.</li>
    <li> i i was exited to order it &amp; i ordered 3 for me &amp; for my sisters . when i received them i was very happy but i become disappointed as two of them stopped rotating from 2nd use.</li>
    <li> I have the worst hair ever and have tried every product to tame my mane. This hairdryer not only gave me sleek hair for my bob it lasted all day which is unheard of for my hair type. I usually can get nice looking hair once a week or so but by mid day it is frizzed or just looks like hell. After using this hairdryer my hair looked great all day. It was also really easy to use. I got mine at Walmart for 44 dollars so it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> My wife has naturally curly hair, but with this thing anyone can.  If you are looking for something to both dry you hair and curl it, look no further.  Faster and less &#x27;dangerous&#x27; than a flat iron, my wife cannot sing this thing&#x27;s praises enough.  The first time I saw her use it I was afraid it would pull her hair out, but alas my fears were unwarranted and this is, according to her, a life-changing hair accoutrement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really get the &#x27;wedding&#x27; type curls, really any type curls.  I&#x27;m not sure if there are instructions on different curling techniques, but I&#x27;m sure if you spend a few minutes experimenting you&#x27;ll discover a great style for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it is really not work at all for my hair. whats worse, it make hair more fluffy after using. i would not reccomend it.</li>
    <li> easy to use.  works very well.  if you have thick hair, just prepare to make lots of sections. worth buying</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair drying/styling fun and easy without tangling  in my hair, no matter which way it turns.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The voltage is not suitable for my country (i had to buy a converter to use it). But it works well</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great, best I&#x27;ve ever had. I used it with both long hair and short, my hair is pretty fine so also straight with a little wave. Anyway, to what you are probably wondering about, the problem is the wand just slowly died. Doesn&#x27;t work at all anymore. I have had it a long, but used it infrequently... Just think it should&#x27;ve lasted longer. Good thing it is a bit lower in price, because I am buying another :). The pros outweigh the cons.</li>
    <li> Fast, easy styling - volumizes and leaves hair shiny. A nice extra - attached cord tie. Warning - width of hair styled shouldn&#x27;t exceed brush width or hair will tangle.</li>
    <li> hair will get wrapped up and ripped out half the time</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s quick and way easier than using a hair dryer and a round brush. I would have rated it 5 stars only if it was a bit smaller ( too bulky to hold) and had a smaller brush. Otherwise does the job well!</li>
    <li> This is a little difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I already had a dryer with brush, and the spin option doesn&#x27;t add to the product. Not worth it. Plus, the brush is too big.</li>
    <li> Works great for short hair!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing, works like a champ.  Heats and rotates. Nice barrel size, love this. Recommend it to my friends, works on my son&#x27;s hair as well, without the crazy force of the blow dryer, dries the hair just as fast without torturing it. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and here is what I thought.. The 2 inch barrel is perfect to use on long hair.. The fun part to this is not taping the wrong way when spinning it, I thought my hair was caught in it and it was easy to get it out.. I have used other products like this on but it has been years, it will take practice to perfect it.. It dried my hair fast and styled it perfect, I loved that it has 2 choices for spinning and easy to use. not to mention the high and low heat also makes this a great product. Like I said though using this kind of dryer and styler takes practice, my hair did look awesome.  Besides the fact I need to get used to using it, style stay in too big plus.</li>
    <li> I Love You Infiniti Pro! Atnn:Ladies with fine hair&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thinning, shoulder length hair. The more I use it, the more I love it. Often I am very frustrated and depressed about how thin my hair is, I can never style it the way I want. With this tool, I dry it until it is damp and then I style. I let the brush run for about a min and then it is hot enough to style my hair. The longer it runs I find it gets a perfect temp to style my thin hair. It looks better than a salon blowout! The only thing is it is hard to give the top of my hair the height I prefer, but the more I play around with it, I am getting better at acheiving it.I do not know if this would be ideal for thicker hair, because it doesnt get super hot, but for your ladies that have my problem...this is awesome..highly recommend..please do not ever discontinue Conair!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this product after seeing an ad on TV VERY EARLY one morning.  I went ahead and ordered the product and I LOVE IT!  It is amazing what it does to your hair.  Does not tangle, just styles pretty much any way you want.  Yes it takes a bit longer that a regular dryer but the results are amazing.  I have thick hair and never hesitate to use this due to time involved.  I just love it and am going to buy another in case mine wears out.....Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have thick fuzzy unmanageable hair and this is just a dream!  So fantastic that I no longer need my straighteners and this spinning brush dries my hair far quicker and looks so professional too.  You do need to have some length in your hair as brush needs to get underneath to work.  Best invention for problem hair!</li>
    <li> the bristles were really soft.. i am a black female. my hair is soft and i had just finished blow drying it, but the styler pretty much did nothing for me. i thought it would be able to give my hair a smooth straight shine.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it is easy to use.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that I love it though.  I have really weird hair so you really have to pull on it to smooth it out and this just doesn&#x27;t grab my hair like I wish it did.  It works best if you use smaller amounts of hair (I have tons of hair) but my arms end of getting tired.  My hair does look nice when I use it and spend the time to do it</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful but my hair gets caught, and it really does not get hot enough to dry decently.  I have only used it 3x because it just doesn&#x27;t get my hair dry and provide the styling promised.  Wish I could return, but I&#x27;m out of the return window by 2 days.</li>
    <li> Well considering the box appeared to have been opened, the Styler itself seemed unharmed.  All the packaging was out of the box, just the Styler and some instructions were enclosed.  It took a time or two to get used to the directional spins, but now I&#x27;ve got it!  I expected it to make my hair smoother, as seen on the ads, but it was fluffy (lots of volume) and lots of frizz. Maybe I need to use an anti-frizz serum but I&#x27;ve never had to before. I do like the volume though. No more flat hair! I&#x27;ll keep it but won&#x27;t use it every time I style my hair. What I&#x27;d really like is a flat iron with small bristles covering each side.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It does the job right!  Will definitely look for a smaller roller brush if it&#x27;s available.  Will recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and love it! I couldn&#x27;t think what I&#x27;d go through without this hair styler. I am so happy I found it on Amazon and about half the price as in stores. Very very pleased!</li>
    <li> The commercials imply it does, but it doesn&#x27;t. I had fuzzy hair when I started and fuzzy hair when I finished. I returned this product. I did not give it a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; because it looks like it does work with hair that is less fuzzy than mine. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> the barrel is too big. they need to make one smaller for shorter hair.  you cant get it around the hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have an all in one solution like this. I don&#x27;t have really curly hair though just wavy but my hair is really thick and it works great on me.</li>
    <li> this works. it takes a few times to get used to using the rotating brush. I have very fine hair and this made it look more like a professional blow dry.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I do wish, however, that you made one with a small diameter barrell.  I have fairly short hair and a smaller circumferance would be perfect.  thank you</li>
    <li> This spin air rotating styler is worthless.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.  Very awkward to use.  Not a good buy even for the price.</li>
    <li> It takes way too much time to dry my hair and it is not for thick, long hair. If you need your hair to look bouncy, you are better off with a regular ionic dryer and a roller brush.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect im gonna like this brush. You can make your hair look like you are just from hair salon. It brings a volume and shine to your hair. I stopped using flat and/or curling iron. After washing hair I dry it till it just a bit damp and then only start blow dry with rotating brush. I have almost shoulder length hair, so this way its dry faster. Usually if I dont flatiron hair it looks fuzzy, with rotating brush I dont have this problem anymore. Addition to it, before I dry with rotating brush I put a little Coppola keratin treatment onto hair&#x27;s problem area and I can tell you the hair from this all drying process  comes out even more nicer. The only cons is its a bit heavy and bulky, I wish it could be a little smaller. Sometimes hair can be caught  between bristles and upper rotating part of the brush, but its not a big deal, just try to keep hair on the brush, take small strand at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall Im satisfied for now. Worth it to try.</li>
    <li> Sorry - Just happy with the tool - and my hair. Had a little trouble figuring out the rotating brush deal - the instructions had fallen out of the box. Finally got that sorted out. Look, I have naturally curly hair - a lot of it, but it&#x27;s fine. And I have a Medicare card so by now, my hair has its own way of doing things. The gray does this, the dark brown does that. In different directions at times. This little tool (and the best shampoo/conditioner combo from Aussie) helps keep me from looking like I just stuck a wet toe in a hot socket. Yeah, it&#x27;s big and a big clumsy at first but it works. Not sure how long it will last but it&#x27;s cheaper on the psyche than a bad hair day.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this hair styler.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments since I started using it.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it is thick, frizzy and wavy.  When I first got the Infinitopro last week, I used it a few times, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  I think my hair was too long and too big.  But this week, I got my hair cut to a medium-length bob, and the Infinitipro made such a huge difference in the way my hair looked.  It was shiny, sleek, bouncy, and it looked like I had gotten it blown out at the salon.  I can&#x27;t say I recommend it for anyone with long hair, but for medium length or even a short bob, I think it&#x27;s great.  I am tempted to buy another one just in case this one breaks in the future.  For medium length hair, I use it on high heat and it takes about 15-20 minutes.  I tried blow-drying it first (for a few minutes), but found that wasn&#x27;t really necessary for me since my hair was fine and it dried relatively quickly using just the brush.  The more I use it, the more comfortable I am getting, and now I am avoiding tangles and pulling.  It is not as scary as it looks.  I am also able to figure out which button to press to rotate it the correct direction, without even thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about trying this as some reviews weren&#x27;t great for above-shoulder-length hair. But, holy cow, I&#x27;m so glad I tried this wonderful tool! I have a lot of hair that falls into a bob well above the shoulder. I did dry my hair about 80% of the way with my regular hair dryer. Then, I let this puppy take it home. I am an avid roll brush and dryer girl. This is SO much easier and the style is much smoother. Using the traditional method, I&#x27;d wrestle with certain &amp;#34;kinky&amp;#34; areas and the back of head was always a challenge. But with this beauty, I can just keep running it in the same section to straighten and smooth. I sure hope this device lasts as I am already in love! :)</li>
    <li> I use this product to volumize and straighten and style my long, blonde, thick hair. The Infiniti takes the place of my brush, curling iron, dryer and flat iron when I used one, and with this product it is so easy to make my hair look just like I want it to by my self. I do not need any other hair products to style, comb or fix my hair.  I love the way it makes my hair shine and gives my hair a real silky look and feel. My long, thick, fine hair has always had a lot of static and been hard to manage. With the Infinitipro the static is gone and my hair stays in place. I love it and the price was right too.</li>
    <li> I love this brush but sent it back because it did not work for my chin length hair.  If I had long hair, it would be perfect for getting a blown out look.  I was disappointed and wish they made one with a smaller barrel.  I would definitely recommend it for ladies or guys with longer locks than mine.</li>
    <li> No tangles. Smooths and dries hair quickly. Actually works as advertised. Hopefully it proves to be durable, bc I plan to use it often.</li>
    <li> Great product as expected</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Always use it to curve my hair and it does give my hair very natural shape. Works perfect for the past 2 months.</li>
    <li> This works very well, it straightens my hair nicely, dries as it styles. Otherwise, I&#x27;d have to dry it with the hairdryer, and then, style.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and unable to get a good hold on my hair. I think would be great if you had longer hair.</li>
    <li> quick and easy styling, works great</li>
    <li> my hair is purple n got fried from bleaching it so i cant really do much heat and pulling yada yada. n if i dont.. its frizzy and dry looking.&lt;br /&gt;i did some research on youtube n decided to go with this. wow. im &amp;#34;blown&amp;#34; away :D greatest hair tool ever invented. i dont need my brush, hair dryer or a hot tool anymore.i prob only need to travel with this one thing. now with that being said. i didnt buy it from this seller cuz i saw some negative reviews about it being fake or stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought mine from target and its 37.99 on their website but 54.99 in the store. just pull up the item on your phone n show it to the cashier. they will do a price match for you n u dont have to worry about it being fake n you will have a door to knock on if u have problems :D</li>
    <li> DOES ALL THE WORK FOR ME LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this brush to be as awesome as is turned out to be! I have shoulder length straight hair with a lot of layers and this really helps to add some body and movement to my cut.  It really leaves my hair soft too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some adjusting to figuring out how to work this thing without getting my hair stuck in it, but once I figured it out it was really easy! I think the spin mechanism is well built. It seems like it was built to last. I also like that the cord swivels to help eliminate the dreaded cord twist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only docked it 1 star because I was expecting the air flow to be stronger, but it seems like you wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit much else into that machine because it&#x27;s already quite large as it is. I also attributed this to not needing as much heat/ flow if you&#x27;re doing a regular blow-out as opposed to just drying your hair.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea behind this but it could be my hair. I&#x27;ve got fine hair, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it short, and to my neck - the roller brush is pretty big so I think this does better with longer hair. Also, it takes a while to dry - so I wind up using a dryer to get my hair partially dry so it doesn&#x27;t take so long. I&#x27;m not sure yet but it does work.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life. I have been searching for the perfect hair tool to accentuate my natural curls and reduce my frizziniess. THIS is the tool!!!! I got it for xmas last year and I was super skeptical and had a little trouble getting the hang of it at first. So, once I successfully did it, I felt like I walked out of a blowdry bar!! I get salon results EVERY damn time. I will never straighten my hair again.</li>
    <li> This is a disaster. It caught in my hair and didn&#x27;t do anything it was advertised to do. I have short hair just above my shoulders. It caught in my hair and I had the hardest time getting it out. This is the second device that caught in my hair. I guess the good thing is that if this keeps up I won&#x27;t have any hair left to worry about straightening!</li>
    <li> This product is much bigger than I imagined, but useful, it can roll up your hair, although my hair is not too long.</li>
    <li> This item started out good, but as time went on, I found that my hair gets twisted up in the ends where the rolling barrel meets the stationery tip.  Not sure why this happens, but I get frustrated with it when it pulls on my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift. I have fine, medium length hair.  I had to guide my hair through the bristles because of the length, but the lift and fullness received was amazing.  My daughter tried it, and she has very long hair, and it is thick. Because if the thickness, the brush took much longer, but it did provide volume. It is doubtful she will use it everyday because of the time factor, but for events, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start by taking  2&amp;#34; to 3&amp;#34; sections of hair at a time. I use slow  brush strokes to distribute heat evenly, and repeat brush strokes to create fullness. Lift and scoop, brush up from the scalp and back from the face. I use it like a normal brush, not like a styling tool, and run through hair a few times. Very time consuming but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-30-14</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good spinning brush, however the spinning gets stopped or slowed a lot. I have really long hair, down to about the middle of my back. Because of this, the tension can get high, and when that happens it just stops spinning altogether, which defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t use the low setting at all for my long hair, it does nothing. Even without the spinning it’s pretty good though. It&#x27;s basically the ability to circularly brush your hair while blow drying, which is a plus in itself. So instead of trying to style your hair with a round brush in one hand, and a blow dryer in the other, you have it all in one hand simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a unique little idea, I just wished it worked better with the actual spinning. I am able to use it easily for the bangs because they are short. I would still recommend the product for the ability to style your hair as I mentioned above, but I would only give it 4 stars because it still needs some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infiniti Pro by Conair Hot Air Spin Styler, 2-Inch]]</li>
    <li> everytime i switch it on..it smells like something is burnt...</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and it just made my hair more flat.</li>
    <li> Meh. Wish I could return it. Works okay once you learn to use it but prefer a hair dryer and brush.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it, it works OK.  But I prefer brush and hair-dryer for better control -- this gadget can pull hair out if not used correctly...</li>
    <li> I live in the UK and I purchased this Infiniti Pro from the Amazon American site, I travel to the U.S. And the Carribean at least once a year and realised that the voltage on my UK brush wasn&#x27;t very good in these destinations, now having this Brush with the correct voltage to suit my travel pans means I will be able to style my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> the low speed is too low and bogs down.  the high speed is too much and it pulls my hair out at the junction of the rotating barrel.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like I have so much more broken hair now than before I started using this.  I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;also, it seems to make my hair very full of static electricity and fly away.  maybe it&#x27;s because of the winter dry air.  Unsure.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like it very much ... sorry.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s buried in the drawer until I justify throwing it away...or giving it away.</li>
    <li> This is like spending 2-3 times of time and effort for a 5% better result: It takes way more time to dry your hair than a regular blow dryer. When you spin it, your hair will be easily stuck (it hurts a lot when it happens, and you lost hair too). After 20-30 mins work, your hair won&#x27;t look much different than just using a blow dryer and around blush. I am returning it and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great but if you have natural hair (my curl pattern is 4a), make sure your hair is well detangle before using this product or your hair will tangle.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting!!!&lt;br /&gt;It work properly, and make my hair straight in minutes!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and in perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> The spin air styler works well.  CAUTION:  if you buy this or any other spinning brush, be careful.  Your hair will tangle and twist if it is not wrapped carefully around the brush.  It took me quite a while to get the tangle out.  Once it was out, I proceeded with caution.  Af</li>
    <li> I love the outcome of the hair styles, and don&#x27;t use no product in my hair. The soft curl does set when using a final cool air before releasing the curl.  It worked better than a tool 3 times the cost, and I needed hair product. I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use , makes my hair dry and full within 5 min. I love it! I can finally wear it down and look good.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to change my hair situation since I have carpal tunnel syndrome and hate to use both hands. But I have to blow dry my hair first the use this for the finish touches. But I still like this product.</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve to this tool, but once mastered, is wonderful.  I have a thick head of wavy hair and it is fine rather than coarse.  It tangles easily and takes forever to dry.  In the past, I would either air dry my hair or blow dry.  Then I would have to use the flat iron to get the crimpy waves smooth.  Then I would have to use my curling iron to create a curved do.  Well, now I air dry if time permits to about 20% damp, get out the infiniti pro and go to work.  In just a few minutes, my hair is dry, smooth, curved and shiny.  At first I got it tangled a lot and thought I would have to give up.  Then I discovered that holding the ends of the hair straight out from my head with my fingertips, use the IP on the underside of the hair strand, gradually moving down to the ends, it dries faster, smoother and painlessly with no tangles.  I really like this tool.</li>
    <li> Actually I did not try this purchase because I bought it thinking it was 220V....&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunally it is 110 V .</li>
    <li> Love it alot&lt;br /&gt;do wish the hand are would be slimmer but its a wouldful way to&lt;br /&gt; curl or make straight</li>
    <li> This hair product is such fun to use- no tangles- and really works well with my curly hair! Got one for my DIL too!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this.  When I use it I always receive compliments on my hair.  I can be do my hair in 10-15 minutes.  It took some playing with but even the first time was great.  The only issue I have is I don&#x27;t spend any time on my hair and I refuse to get up 15 minutes earlier than I have to so I only use it on the weekends. It is the first time in my life I will actually &#x27;do my hair&#x27;.  My hair does not tangle in it... If you are considering this - buy it, you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I will say is both my daughters used it, one has thin, very straight hair and it really did not do much for her (probably needed a better product).  The other has thick and slightly curly hair, she typically uses a flat iron to straighten and curl, she thought her way was easier.  I hate to disagree but I did because it takes her 15 minute just to dry her hair then another 10-15 for the flat iron.  I guess it is all in what you are use to.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews and watching the videos makes me feel like I&#x27;m now hair challenged.  Yes they make it look so easy, and some parts of the hair were.  But after using this in my hair, I&#x27;m surprised I even have hair left.  No matter what angel I&#x27;m holding the styler, My hair was getting caught in the top and wrapped around these little plastic ridges. After using it 5-6 times, I just threw it in the goodwill box.  Back to old fashion round brushing my hair</li>
    <li> This product was great! But it does NOT work on natural hair, please help me find a better product for short natural hair!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this came in the mail (amazon is really fast with delivery!). After I washed my hair, I dried 80% so it&#x27;s still damp. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think the product is that great. The commercial on tv makes it look like your hair will have extreme volume but it doesn&#x27;t (of course cuz it&#x27;s tv!). However, it gives you a nice shine but that&#x27;s pretty much it. My hair stays flat no matter how many times I spin. I went back to using my old fashion hair rollers to give my hair some volume.</li>
    <li> Does not work well for short hair.  Also, any volume achieved while drying/curling didn&#x27;t last.  I was disappointed with the results and returned the product.</li>
    <li> Gets caught in the hair very easily.  Mostly just gives body, if you can manage to use it without ripping your hair out,</li>
    <li> I love everything about this gadget, except it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough so it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as well as it could.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job grabbing the hair and holding on as it spins.  You have to use your other hand constantly pushing against the bristles to force the hair to stay around the barrel.  I ended up returning it because of these two issues. Other than that, is an awesome concept! Especially the multidirectional rotating barrel. I cannot find that feature in any other rotating barrel blow dryer, which means I&#x27;m stuck waiting until I find a design that does so before I repurchase one. FYI, I have short to medium hair.  The multidirectional barrel is critical because what happens if you don&#x27;t have this feature is it&#x27;s very awkward to use on both side of your head. Without the ability to switch directions, if you&#x27;re flipping the hair upward at the bottom of your hair on one side with the rotating barrel, when you switch to the other side, it curls the hair under instead of over.  make sense?  Therefore the multidirectional rotating barrel is the most critical feature on this type of gadget.  The first company, other than the Conair Infiniti, that comes up with this feature, that also grips hair well enough and gets hot enough, I&#x27;ll be the first person in line to buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has worked great so far. I&#x27;m a black woman with thick natural hair and not once has it gotten tangled or quick working. It dries fast and my hair is shinier and softer than using a regular hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Okay, here&#x27;s what you need to know about me to understand what a big deal this 5-star review is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I have crap hair.  Seriously.  I know women always say they have crap hair, but I really do.  My mom had baby-fine, very curly hair, and my dad had baby-fine very straight hair.  So I have baby-fine hair that is curly underneath and straight on top.  Even my stylist says that I have the most \\&quot;challenging\\&quot; hair she&#x27;s ever worked with. (\\&quot;Challenging\\&quot; is her nice way of not saying \\&quot;crappy\\&quot;.) Even my husband, who loves me very much, says he thinks I&#x27;m beautiful but he understands why I get frustrated with my hair. Seriously, it&#x27;s a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m 46 years old.  That means I&#x27;ve been dealing with this crappy hair with more than three decades.  I have tried everything: every product, every dryer, curler, straightener,  brush, every cut -- with bangs, without, long, short, etc.  You name it.  I&#x27;ve tried it to make my hair less crappy.  I have some skin in the game, and I&#x27;m no rookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) As much as I have struggled with my hair, I am lazy at heart, and I DREAM of having hair I don&#x27;t have to spend ridiculous amounts of time on just to make it look kind of normal.  What I want, more than anything, is something that will be easy, and make my hair look like it&#x27;s not a frizzy ball of crap.  Any successes I have had were minimal at best, barring a product or two that at least helped me tame the beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.  Now we come to the Infinitipro styler.  Oh. My. GOD, does my hair look fantastic right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this thing a couple of days ago, and I cannot believe how fantastic it is.  Friends, this is a revelation.  I seriously can&#x27;t believe it.  I was sure the bristles would be too soft and would make my hair flyaway and staticky.  Nope. I was sure that it would take forever to dry my hair with this thing.  Nope, it took me less time than my dryer and brush -- by a long shot.  Now, the one caveat is that I did use my blow dryer to blow most of the moisture out of my hair first. But barring that, the Infinitipro dried my hair in about half of the time that I generally take in the styling phase.  My hair looks glossy, it is doing what I want it to do, and I didn&#x27;t have to struggle with a dryer and a brush at the same time.  I haven&#x27;t used the spin function yet because I&#x27;ve wanted my hair straight, but I think I will probably try that this weekend for a look with more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Infinitipro to anyone with fine hair, especially someone with shoulder-length hair like mine.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I even canceled a haircut appointment I had for today because my hair looks so good right now that I&#x27;m able to think about growing it longer for the first time in years.  So, who knows, maybe it will even save me money on haircuts in the long run? :-)</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve, it sometimes catches a hair or two in the grooves at both ends of the rotating barrel, and a 1&amp;#34; or 1.5&amp;#34; barrel size might have been more suited to my needs, but it beats using 2-3 appliances to get your hair done. So i like it and i use it for convenience of styling. Works well with a good mousse.</li>
    <li> This is great. The only way I can blowdry my hair.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. I have a lot of hair, and he is long. I thought maybe not work well, but it worked.</li>
    <li> i thought you could use it when hair was wet but apparently you should only use it after your hair is 80% dry. also its really hard to control the spin. once you get the hang of it i guess its not bad but you def need to hold on to the ends of your hair and pull downwards and then use the spin and brush it, if not your hand can get tangled</li>
    <li> This product seems to do all the things it&#x27;s claims. My only problem is I have short hair and no where does it say it has a 2&amp;#34; barrell. Way to big for my short hair.</li>
    <li> I was actually excited to receive this item as I wanted to have some way to curl and dry hair at same time. Reviews were fantastic.  Got product, maybe was return from someone else as it was not even packaged as a new item.  It went in circles 3 times and bit the dust! So disappointed.  I will buy one locally and make sure it is brand new and working properly...oh well.</li>
    <li> Wife says that it was too large and bulky and she didn&#x27;t like the results on her hair. So, we returned the styler.</li>
    <li> Now, don&#x27;t get confused... Unless your hair is short or thin or way above the shoulder, you won&#x27;t be able to take it from wet to dry with this in less than an hour. Mine is mid-back, layered and I&#x27;ve been dying to have more volume/bouncyness without spending a lot of time with a hairdryer and a round brush. So here is my routine to get the shine, the bounce and minimize the damage. Wash no more than 2-3 times a week - there is no &amp;#34;eek&amp;#34; factor here, I promise... Read on... To get best results with your new Styler, start with a deep cleanse by adding 2-3 tbsp baking soda to your usual amount of shampoo. Mine is Shiseido Tsubaki Head Spa shampoo. After that, apply rich conditioner to ends only - nape to ends - Nexxus humectress ultimate moisture deep conditioning treatment or Giovanni Ultra Sleek Conditioner. Rinse, wrap your hair in a super absorbent microfiber towel. Once you feel enough moisture has been removed, unrap and apply a light mist of My Amazing Blow Dry Secret Quick Dry Shake &#x27;N Spray (yes, it will make you spend less time with your beloved hairdryer!). Blow dry your hair until almost dry. Add a very small drop of Kim Vo Perfect Polish Dry Serum (no greasies, I promise! $55 retail?! Don&#x27;t think so! Check your local TJ Maxx to score it for $9.99!) and go for it with the styler. I did not find the spin function super handy for my longer hair gets tangled up a bit, but it might work for shorter hair. The key is to wrap your hair around the brush and then hold it, just like you would with a a curling iron. Carefully release and repeat on other sections of the hair. Follow with a hairspray. Don&#x27;t get scared of the routine - remember, you only do it 2-3 times a week, because you just got your Styler! Here is the trick: next morning you may easily refresh your bouncy hairstyle by spraying your hair with some restyling mist - such as Shiseido Styling Mist (mine is in a blue-ish bottle, around $10) and go at it again with the Styler. Repeat every morning (about a 5 minute routine to refresh your hair!) until you feel the need to wash. Your hairstyle will be as good as new. Very pleased with my purchase. Damage reduced, my hair is bouncy, shiny, beautiful hair - wishing you the same! :)about a 5 minute routine to refresh your hair!) until you feel the need to wash. Your hairstyle will be as good as new. Very pleased with my purchase. Damage reduced, my hair is bouncy, shiny, beautiful hair - wishing you the same! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after reading many good reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;The first use was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;the second use it rotated slower than the first time.&lt;br /&gt;the third time just heating NO ROTATION!!</li>
    <li> I was going to by this at my local CVS Pharmacy, but at retail, it was 79.95. This product arrived quickly, and was packaged perfectly. I have seen the commercials for it, and it was also at a much higher price I am so glad that I did not call for it. I am very pleased with the price, as well as the shipping. EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I bought one for a friend!  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and it&#x27;s the best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever purchased hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because it&#x27;s such a hyped product, I bought the In-Styler tool as a comparison and to see if it was any better.  Umm, no.  It&#x27;s like a flat iron only with a round barrel.  How on earth the info-mercial people achieve all those hairstyles on TV is a mystery.  Maybe there&#x27;s a college course I can take (or get placed at Hogwarts for \\&quot;Magical Hairstyling 101) because that&#x27;s the only way I see me achieving the same results on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair product gives you soft shiny hair with a bounce - in literally 5 minutes flat!  Tip - start with 95 - 99% dried hair - unless your hair is really fine.  Mine is thick, so I dry it mostly before I start.  I&#x27;ve experienced almost no hair snagging in all the time I&#x27;ve been using the product.  When it did happen it happened when I tried it with mostly wet hair.  But, even when my hair did snag it was very minimal and easily undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run - don&#x27;t walk - to buy this product.  It does what your stylist does for no money thus it&#x27;s priceless!</li>
    <li> Love it! This makes my hair soft and shiny. Dries hair fast and does not feel hot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great Product, love it leaves hair so silky and smooth. Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever! Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it doesnt do what it promises.leaves my hair flat like i never used it. Doesnt give you the blow out look</li>
    <li> This moves ridiculously slow and has a very weak hair dryer. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair styling tool I have ever owned! Takes some practice at first, but your hair will have never looked better. Bought one for every girl in our family.</li>
    <li> My Mother has one of these and loves it. I wanted one of these for while but was waiting for a really good deal. I found it on here for about $20 less then in the stores. It works great. I was worried it might tangle easily as I have long hair but it doesn&#x27;t. Only took a couple of minutes to get a smooth rhythm going. Curls my hair while it dries giving it more body and making it really smooth and shiny at the same time.</li>
    <li> I really this. I recently cut my hair it was long and curly. Now it&#x27;s slightly shorter than shoulder length. It takes a while to dry with this styler alone, I usually will dry my hair until slightly damp, then I will use this to blow dry it straight. It&#x27;s really great on styling your hair once it&#x27;s dry. So much easier than using a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
    <li> the first time I used it it was stopping to spin or spinned very slowly. second time it worked flawlessly. and when it worked it did excellent job in styling my hair into shiny, frizz-free style. but 3rd and 4th time using it it span less and less even without any overheating - the first second I turned it on it did not spin!!! I returned it and now I am looking for some replacement.</li>
    <li> Not sure I will learn how to use it</li>
    <li> Brush is too soft and soft and does not get close enough to scalp to make the roots straight...i have mixed hair and does NOT work well at all, waste of my money for sure. Soo dissapointment in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this, it is a great tool! Sometimes it gets tangled in my hair, like when I am not paying attention or I need a haircut, but for the most part, it smooths my hair quite well and makes it very shiny without having to use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this.  A friend let me try hers and that convinced me to buy it.  I could never use a blow dryer and round brush at the same time.  With this, I blow dry my hair almost dry, then finish it with the Infiniti.  The only tricky part is learning which button to hold down.  One button rotates clockwise and one counter-clockwise.  If you rotate the wrong way your hair will get caught up and it feels like it is pulling your hair out.  It does get easier after the first few times, but I still occasionally get it going the wrong direction because you really can&#x27;t see the buttons when you are using the device.</li>
    <li> Great product for first 8 months. The motor seems to not spin fast anymore. I bought two one for me and one for my mom and they both have same problem. I think they have a warranty, so I am going to try to get replaced.</li>
    <li> I dont know how it works for others ? but I have slightly thicker hair and its slightly frizzy too, when I tried it..oh my it was very difficult to get the hair get rolled in this brush..added to that the bristles if this rotating styler was falling off in the very first use..i had to return it.</li>
    <li> TOO BIG FOR ME.  GAVE AWAY.</li>
    <li> I love this brush to finish after blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the way it works with my hair, but unfortunately the bristles of the brush start to fray out too soon and then it makes my hair look rough.  That&#x27;s the reason I had to buy a second one.  The price is too high for it to not last that long. Something the manufacturer might try to improve upon.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick wavy, frizzy, shoulder length hair which I usually blow dry, flat iron and then use a curling iron to lift the roots.  In all it&#x27;s about a 45 min process.  With this wonderful invention I&#x27;m done in about 15-20 minutes and it&#x27;s the closest to a salon blow dry I&#x27;ve ever managed on my own.    It smooths my hair so beautifully I am cutting back on my usual combination of 3 smoothing products. I&#x27;m changing to just one heat protective serum. It&#x27;s so easy to use I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews saying it is difficult. If you aren&#x27;t comfortable using styling tools, perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t review them...just sayin &#x3D;)    A few salient points:      1. I have thick, wavy hair so that&#x27;s all I can comment on.    2. Partially dry your hair before using this. It is best for styling and it will be much faster if you just turn your head upside down and either blow the roots for a couple of minutes or shake your hair out and let it air dry a bit.    3. Be sure and section your hair. Pin it up and start with the bottom sections first. Go all the way around your head drying 2 or 3 inch sections...this tool can handle a good bit of hair at once. Then pull down another row and so on until you get to the crown. I blow dry the crown up for volume. This sounds long but it goes really fast. High heat will get the job done in a couple of passes if your hair isn&#x27;t too wet.    4. You can finish with a flat iron but you probably won&#x27;t need to after a bit of practice. This is great!  Much healthier for your hair. I find this leaves me with a more natural bouncy style and not that weird overly straight look the flat iron can create.    5. This is not for short hair. It&#x27;s a really big round brush and if you wouldn&#x27;t use that size brush with a blow dryer it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to use this product.  Maybe they will come out with a smaller brush for shorter hair. But I&#x27;ve had short hair and it&#x27;s so easy to blow dry I don&#x27;t know why you need something like this.    6. If your hairis like mine, you are going to feel like the gods of small electronics are smiling on you (finally!) Modern technology tames Mother Nature! For my type of hair...this is the best product in decades!</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally curly, very thick hair. Doing my hair in the morning was taking entirely too long. Blow drying takes forever, and makes my hair frizzy and then I had to straighten or curl which took even longer. When I saw this I thought all my problems were going to be solved! I could not wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Points:&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair very soft! It added a good amount of volume to my hair and didn&#x27;t make hair frizzy or unhealthy.&lt;br /&gt;Bad Points&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I tried using it, my hair kept getting tangled and the rotate buttons are very touchy. Because my hair kept getting tangled, I had to do it in smaller sections which took a little longer than expected. I also had to keep taking breaks because it was hurting my arm. It really didn&#x27;t feel too heavy, until I got about 10 sections in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it took me a lot longer to get ready, and I don&#x27;t see myself using this in my daily routine. It will probably end up in the back of my bathroom cabinets and be forgotten.</li>
    <li> On their website, Conair states its InfinitiPro Spin Air Rotating Syler as uses ion technology and less heat to create shiny hair without frizz or damage. Bascially it&#x27;s a hair dryer with a round brush attached that spins. It can be used with or without the spin. It eliminates the need for using a  round brush when blow drying. I admit i was intimidated when I got it out of the box. It is big! It has settings for low, high, and cool. It also has 2 buttons to spin the brush while blow drying.    The first time I used it, I had a hard time figuring out which direction to spin the brush in to curl the hair lightly under. I used the low heat setting because I have fine hair.    I found it easiest to use if I clipped up section of my hair so I could focus on one section at at time. By the third time I used it, I felt confident and it gave me shiny, smooth hair with volume. I love how it reduced my fly aways.    If you are looking for a way to achieve a smooth blow out without the trouble of using a brush and blow dryer, try the Conair Spin Brush to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Love it and I am still using it.</li>
    <li> I had to give this a try as I&#x27;ve seen products similar to this on tv. I have short curly hair, but also tried it on my daughter who had long very curly hair. It didn&#x27;t work very well on my short hair and even though it has a \\&quot;reverse\\&quot; button on it to get you going in the right spinning direction, I was not able to control it very well and the size is too big around. It might better if they had different round sizes. It did not work very well on my daughter&#x27;s hair either as her hair is quite curly and you could hardly tell the difference, she is better off using a flat iron to get the frizz out. I have gone back to my small size round brush with blow dryer as I can get closer to the scalp to smooth the whole length of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a spin brush pro, but I was intrigued by this product.  My daughter has long hair, as do I, and I liked the idea of a brush that also dried the hair.  The problem for me was that it was quite hard to use.  It took me a while just to figure out how to make it spin, and when I did, I somehow didn&#x27;t have the hand movements down and it spun too quickly, rolling the hair around it.  My daughter did not care for that!  I did like the drying aspect, and it&#x27;s a nice quality brush, even if used non-electronically.  I can&#x27;t speak to the ion aspect, as I don&#x27;t really believe that does much, and can&#x27;t say if I was proven wrong or right, as I wound up not using the brush as a spin brush much.  It has the feel of a quality product, solidly made, and I am going to keep trying to use it for styling.  If you are more talented with that kind of thing than I am, I think you might get better results!</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair which frizzes easily especially in the summer so I thought I would give this a try since I struggle to use a brush with my regular dryer.  This works fairly well but I still have to end with a flat iron but it now takes me half the time to get ready.  And I&#x27;m not using the flat iron as much so this has to be better on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Have to use it in small sections or it tangles in your hair easily.  For me, I have to make sure I use it until my hair is totally dry other wise it just frizzes out.  Straighter frizz, than the curly frizz.  So it does take time to do because you aren&#x27;t getting as much heat or blow drying power as a blow dryer.  But way easier than holding a round brush in one hand and blow dryer in another.</li>
    <li> My hair is not long, maybe that is reason why I can&#x27;t got the curly hair looks like model&#x27;s. i used it like hair drier...</li>
    <li> Wonderful drying and styling tool a must for everyone. Purchased one for myself and daughter. Considering purchasing more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> The description of the barrel says...works for short  hair. There is no barrel size  mentioned . This barrel is too big for my hair cut. Plus the fact there was not a packing slip included with the  infinitipro styler. So how do I return it?</li>
    <li> I think the product might be good for someone with longer hair it just did not work for me. It seem to operate like it was suppose to I just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tool for about two years now. I still wonder sometimes how could live without it before. The reason I wanted to update my review today was because a tiny chunk of hair got so twirled up that I couldn&#x27;t comb it out and had to clip the knot off. First incident in two years as I was day-dreaming and not looking at what I was doing. I still love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review:&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers admitted, I also have very poor hair styling skills. However, with this tool I managed to come close to the look of a salon blow-out, like I have never before was able to on my own. And I was finished in less than 10 minutes. No other heat tools needed.&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: fine and wavy&lt;br /&gt;Hair amount: medium thickness&lt;br /&gt;Hair length: shoulder length&lt;br /&gt;I disagree with others who said you needed long hair for this tool to work right. I think it would even work for shorter than shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;For those who have trouble with the hair getting caught: small sections are key. Also, styling will be much easier and quicker if your hair is about 50-75% air-dried or blow-dried first.</li>
    <li> It worked great when it worked. I was just cleaning out my cabinet and hated throwing out this $39.00 piece of junk. It worked for less than three months. Who has the time to return and fill out paper work and call? Not me, I had hoped to at least get a year out of it.</li>
    <li> WORKS GOOD NICE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> A Very nice product. Its just like I expected. could be smaller to make it easier to carry on trips</li>
    <li> Works great.  Make sure you keep it clean and it takes care of you.  The cord does curl and turn... Doesn&#x27;t interfere with operation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for two years and feel really good about giving it a four-star review. Of course, this is based on my preferences (I hate doing my hair!) and hair type (long, thin hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer to dry my hair than with a blow dryer. It does not smooth my hair as well as the two-inch ceramic curling iron I&#x27;d use otherwise. HOWEVER, my hair looks smoother than with the dryer alone and it takes less effort (and perhaps less time) than both blow drying and curling/straightening. Since I am pretty lazy when it comes to my hair, this is a great middle-ground product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to this machine. But, read the directions and pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve been doing it long enough now that it&#x27;s very intuitive to me to switch the rotate button when I flip my wrist over or move to the other side of my head. I never get it tangled anymore but, if it starts to, I have no problem remembering to just LET GO of the button, hit the other direction quickly and problem solved. Easy enough if you allow yourself time to get used to it and don&#x27;t panic (I panicked the first few times, didn&#x27;t let go of the button, made it worse, cursed at the machine...when it was really all my fault for not paying attention!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you might have to find out how it works best for you and your hair type. I&#x27;m sure someone with very thick hair would have a different experience than I. For me, after I shower I put in any hair product I want and brush my hair straight. It air dries a bit while I do my makeup, pick out my clothes, put in my contacts, etc. My hair is the last thing that I do and it&#x27;s about 50% dry before I start with this appliance. Then, I flip my head upside down dry my hair with this (mostly from the backside, but also the front--remembering to switch directions when I move from one to the other!). When it feels pretty much dry I flip my hair back over and inevitably discover that the roots are a bit damp still. That&#x27;s perfect because I work in right at the roots without the brush rotating to finish off the last bit for a few seconds while adding a little lift at the roots. Then I use the rotating brush again to flip the ends under (or out, if I&#x27;m feeling spunky) and I&#x27;m all done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a five-star review if it could dry my hair just a little faster. I&#x27;m not sure how much oompf than can fit into the inside of a brush but if they came out with a model that promised a little more speed, I&#x27;d try it out.That&#x27;s perfect because I work in right at the roots without the brush rotating to finish off the last bit for a few seconds while adding a little lift at the roots.

    <li> I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to dry hair quickly. If you have medium to thin hair, this would be fantastic. But for medium to thick hair, be prepared for a longer experience. And long hair would take even longer!</li>
    <li> hard to get hair dry and tangles.</li>
    <li> Lifting a hair dryer can be a problem for me, especially with both shoulders injured. This Pro styler is great. I let my hair air dry and use it the next morning after spritzing my hair with water. The rotation is smooth and YES your hair will be more shiny and have no static. My hair is super straight and I can use it to make tight curls or mounds of smooth hair. Not having static makes all the difference in the world. I have tried it using hair products and without. Each way it works wonderful. The price at Amazon was so much less, I could afford to buy this for a friend.</li>
    <li> if you have curly hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry or really style your hair any better than a regular blow dryer.</li>
    <li> good. The more I use this product, the more I love it.This product worked very well as advertised. It is very good for brushing out long hair while partially drying it</li>
    <li> I ordered this one as a spare.  The original was purchased at Target.  Amazon&#x27;s price is much cheaper.  As for the product itself... I had been using a Helen of Troy hot air brush to style my shoulder length hair.  The Infiniti Pro is far superior.  I have noticed less breakage and the Infiniti Pro gives me a smooth, straight shiny style with minimal effort.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After seeing many videos on YouTube for this product, I decided to give it a try. I was sick of spending over an hour to style my hair with blow drying and then having to straighten it after. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work very well, but I was pleasantly surprised with the results. My hair is normally thin even with blow drying and straightening but with this tool, my hair had so much volume and was very shiny. I love how it puts a curl on the end of the hair to define all the layers. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does easily get stuck in the hair, but as long as you push the opposite direction button, it comes right out. This is my new favorite hair tool and will replace my straightener.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too hot and the handle is so big it&#x27;s very awkward to handle!  I would not recommmend this brand.&lt;br /&gt;SD&lt;br /&gt;Raleigh, NC</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer it is very gentle on my hair an my hair Drys looking straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use.  Not good for thick hair to dry or straighten. Cannot use the spinning brush on the cool cycle. If you have very thick and wavy hair, do not waste your money on this. Buy the Instyler.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I just had to. This makes my hair look like I just left the salon!!! I have thick hair but fine, shoulder length. I dry it 70% with hair dryer and finish off spinning brush. It is amazing!!!!! instead of spending time flat ironing or with curling iron, I do this and it lasts for days!!! I do section my hair and dry the ends first then move it up. It allows you to pull the back of your hair straight up and get that bodied blown out look. It took about 3 uses for me to be comfortable with it but now it is super easy!</li>
    <li> easy to use, quick, creates body and rounded bend on hair. gives a professional look without needing coordination for a brush and dryer. the ionic system smoothes hair too. I am a fan!</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x60;s perfect. Couldn&#x60;t find better price either.</li>
    <li> Might have been a good product, but did send it back because the voltage: 110V instead of 220V ((Europe) and the plug didn&#x27;t fit for the european socket. Sorry otherwise I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s a great product! The seller did not explained it in the prescription of  the product</li>
    <li> Very good, recomendable</li>
    <li> OMG this saves me so much time and makes my hair look aswesome, shinny and natural. I love it! My hair is wavy and I love the look I get.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and I love it!!! Can&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Works great on curly hair. Smooths and shines your hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, helps to get hair straighter in winter, won&#x27;t work during summer but nothing will with my curly hair</li>
    <li> Once I get the hang of this it will be a true time saver.</li>
    <li> Gift for my granddaughter.  She thinks it works very well in her medium length hair</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one that wore out.  I love this dryer.  It is perfect for people with curl and frizz as it smooths so easily without having to know how to use a round brush.  I divide my hair and dry in sections.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer for control and styling at the same time with out killing the arms. Great for Authorized, wrist and or arms. Also surgeries and others.  Seller packaged well and on time. Wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice idea; but the brush needs to be sturdier and it has almost no heat!</li>
    <li> Wow, just try to use this on long hair and then watch the fun as it tangles your hair so badly, that when you finally get it unwound from this instrument of torture, you&#x27;ll toss it straight in the garbage!</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing ever.  I have happy hair.  leaves such a healthy look and feel...no more flat irons or blow dryers.!!!!</li>
    <li> This was advertised for long hair - it&#x27;s not. My hair length is two inches below my waist and it&#x27;s straight and will not keep volume. I have reviewed multiple YouTube videos on how you use this product properly - and it seems very easy. Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but this product made my hair into a big tangled mess and it pulled out a lot of hair! And it did not give me any volume - except for the bottom because of all the knots.</li>
    <li> Very low power! It&#x27;s not even close to hot. I can never style my hair with such a cold blowout. Besides, it has poor quality body; almost every single time that I use it my hair got stuck in a crack of its side! UPDATE// It soon died, even though I was rarely using it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Takes a few times to get used to using but does a great job of drying hair with smoothness.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it....However, it would be nice if it also had a smaller brush cylinder in addition to the large one...like interchangeable.</li>
    <li> took a minute to figure out which way it needed to spend, but after i got the hang of it it works awesome</li>
    <li> I bought this because sometimes I wake up with &#x27;buzzing&#x27; wrists and fingers (c-p sufferers will know what I mean).  Add my inherent inability to hold a brush, and a hairdryer at the same time, and you have a recipe for really straight hair.  This rotating styler does EXACTLY what I want it to do - I dry my hair most of the way, then use this to curl and dry my hair the rest of the way.  It rotates all on its own and my hair looks like I know what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one, the first one lasted over a year (I think I taxed the motor by using too much hair at one time, getting some of my hair caught near the handle as it rotated).  I liked it so well I replaced it with the exact same thing.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old and have had VERY fine (\\&quot;baby\\&quot; fine), poker straight and thin hair my entire life.  No product (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all) was every able to make any difference.  Even when a professional dried my hair, it looked good (ish) for an hour max and then it just became limp and straight.  I recently changed hair stylist and the woman I now go to is great with color and cut and HER styling actually did give my hair some volume that DID last so I actually asked her if I could make an appointment and pay her to teach me how to get volume.  She said it wasn&#x27;t necessary and that I probably do what others with the same hair type as mine do.  And she was right.  I had thought that the only was to get volume was to flip my head over and dry it by pulling the hair away from the root and THEN trying to somehow maintain that volume.  She said that I needed to get a thicker brush (ironically a 2 inch one-same size as the one on this styler) and section my hair and rotate the brush while never pulling it from the root.  It had never occurred to me that sectioning it would make that much of a difference since I just don&#x27;t have enough TO section.  I also thought that while her suggestions made sense, I could never hold a hair dryer in one hand and use the other to continually rotate the brush but this styler solved that.  All I have to do is hold it at the root and let the automatic rotator do it&#x27;s job.  I can see (or imagine) that anyone with thick or curly hair might run the risk of having the brush tangle or grab at the hair but since mine is so fine, that hasn&#x27;t happened.  Others who are not pleased with it say it doesn&#x27;t dry it fast enough-not a problem with me at all.  My hair will dry on it&#x27;s own within 10 minutes.  And I don&#x27;t have a frizz problem-again not enough hair TO frizz and, again, my hair is just too fine to have ever had that be an issue.  Finally, some didn&#x27;t like it because they clearly have been using other styling devices that seem to do abetter job in their opinion.  Other than a hair dryer, I have never used another \\&quot;tool\\&quot;.  Part of that is because what would I use?  A flat iron?  That&#x27;s the last thing I need-straighter hair.  And frankly, I&#x27;m just not willing to spend anymore than 5-10 minutes on any styling technique.  My hair is already dry by then.  SO, it was kind of ironic that a week after my hairdresser had given me these tips, I actually found a device that would do the one thing I was unable to do-again, drying with one hand and continually rotate with the other and that&#x27;s the beauty of this for me.  I guess my hair type and newly learned tips make this the perfect styler for my type of hair.  The grass is always greener on the other side.  My 2 closest friends are both of Greek heritage and both have THICK curly hair that frizzes in humid weather and they spend huge amounts of time with flat irons and get semi-monthly keratin (is that what it is called?)- a chemical straightener.  While I don&#x27;t envy how much time they have to spend on their hair, I would kill for their curls and thick hair while they would love to spend far less time and money on theirs as I do on mine.  I am not going to make any claim that my hair has suddenly become so incredibly and vastly different in volume but this styler has given me more than anything I have ever used before.  It also makes getting the hair in the back much easier to style.  SO, if your hair is like mine here are the 2 most important things-keep the brush at the root the entire time and don&#x27;t pull it .  I literally smash it against my scalp and let the rotator do it&#x27;s think.  The second tip is that once you have finished with  the section, don&#x27;t pull the styler out at all to unwind your hair.  Let it cool for 15-30 seconds and then use your hands to unwind the \\&quot;curl\\&quot; and and just place it on your head. And THEN just spray the h_ll out of it!  UPDATE-In 2015, I bought the 1 and 1/2\\&quot; model that was not available when I first purchased this.  Andwhat a difference half an inch makes (speaking of hair stylers-don&#x27;t read anything more into that comment).  I&#x27;ve grown my hair longer since I purchased the 2\\&quot; model and it&#x27;s now shoulder length (maybe a little longer).  It&#x27;s still fine and straight but the 1 and 1/2\\&quot; one does a MUCH better job in styling it.  You can actually create somewhat of a curl although it doesn&#x27;t last all that long in my hair but in addition to being smaller in diameter, it&#x27;s also about an inch shorter in length (the brush from the top to the bottom) which makes it easier to section smaller...sections?  And then dry those.  I remember reading the other reviews when I bought the 2\\&quot; one and people who wanted to use it as a styler felt it didn&#x27;t do the job very well.  I think the smaller version will address that.</li>
    <li> Expensive tool for doing almost nothing. If you wish to spend long time into doing your hair and still not getting a good result go ahead and waste your time and money on this. I regret this purchase. If you have pretty short hair it might work for you.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything except tangle my hair. I use a round brush and my hair dryer, which seem to work much better than this &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; tool that just hurts my head.</li>
    <li> Not good for fine, medium length hair.  Used it once and put it in a drawer, never to be used again.</li>
    <li> This rotating styler is very easy to use.  After blow drying my shampooed hair to slightly damp, I use the rotating styler to add a slight curl and volume to my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I originally wanted the Babyliss one but Conair did a thorough job of keeping it out of the US. I figured Conair bought the company so the products should be similar. It takes much longer than a traditional hairdryer to dry my hair and you definitely need to brush everything through before you use the rotating option. I am not exactly impressed but it will do for now. I have naturally straight hair that keeps its shape therefore the styling properties of this rotating styler doesn&#x27;t do much for me. It does make the hair slightly shinier but then again, nothing impressive. Not sure how the brush cleaning will go in the future, it looks like one of those hard to clean ones. To be honest, I find this product quite bland. Would not recommend it unless you have fine &amp; relatively thin hair.</li>
    <li> I liked the styler very much, but for MY hair, the brush is too large.  It is more adaptable to longer hair,  It makes short hair too straight.  So I gave it to my granddaugter who wears her hair long.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft making it difficult to wrap your hair around the very, very large barrel. It does not have great drying power. I was disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I previously wrote a review on this hairstyler as I loved it when I first bought it and actully still loved it until it just stopped working one day. I was so bummed and really disappointed after I got about 12 inches of hair cut off and thought that this would be the perfect tool to style my new  hair. Well the first time I washed it after getting it cut I was so excited to try it and the darned brush would not spin! Granted I did buy it almost two years ago but I only used it about maybe 20 times as my hair was very long and I wore it up most of the time. Anyway if you dont mind replacing an almost $40 tool after only using it tweny times go for it. I&#x27;m not that wealthy.</li>
    <li> Well this was just terrible. this was useless. It got tangled up in my hair and would pull pieces of my hair out. I threw it out</li>
    <li> Not entirely what I was hoping for.  Bristles have no grab in longer, coarse hair, bulky body to it and slow drying.  It would probably work great for thin, fine, short hair, just not well on mine.  In fact, its waiting for me to return it as the spin function stopped working in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can rotate in both directions smoothens the hair. Would have loved it more if the product was smaller.</li>
    <li> I love this product so well, that I purchased an additional one to have at my vacation house....</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different hair products and been disappointed that I hesitated to make this purchase.  You do have to do small sections of hair but the end result looks like you just stepped out of the salon.  My hair is shoulder length and thick and I have struggled to hold a blow dryer in one hand and a hair brush in the other.  The Infiniti Pro solves this problem.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  Absolutely awesome!</li>
    <li> No, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is very slow, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Growing my hair for the first time at 46 !!! I am no good with a blow dryer and a brush - this has been a life saver</li>
    <li> I have carpal tunnel syndrome and I have never been able to use a round brush and hairdryer to style my hair like my stylist does.  This makes it SUPER easy!!!  I love it!!!  The buttons for forward and backward are very sensitive so I can just let the button lean on my thumb while it round brushes and dries my hair!!  I can not style my hair like my stylist with ease!!  I have fine, naturally curly hair and don&#x27;t even need to use a flat iron when I&#x27;m done!  This leaves me with smooth hair and volume I could never achieve myself!!</li>
    <li> This Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler is the best.  It dry&#x27;s my hair faster than a normal hair dryer. After I use it on a section of hair I put in a velcro roller for a few minutes. My hair is soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t see the damage that a regular hair dryer does to my  hair.</li>
    <li> Just rec&#x27;d this less than an hour ago and have already tried it!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!  Despite numerous hair products and styling tools for frizzy hair, I could never get that silky, shiny smooth hair like I just eft the salon.  This product WORKS!  I was a skeptic, but bought it anyway...and boy am I glad I did!!!! Try it with heat protectant and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It is very handy to use! The hair sets perfect after use. It gets hot when used continuously for long (5 mins).</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product. I bought it and the dryer broke down in the first 3 days of usage, which is ridiculous. This is not a quality product I would expect to purchase from Amazon and have it shipped all the way to Singapore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh!! everybody was making negative comments on my hair until i bought this product!! you cant believe... now the are constantly asking why I did with my hair that looks so good&lt;br /&gt;my hair is curly and dead... coz I dye my hair a lot..but after using this product... my confidence is increased .. i feel I look pretty</li>
    <li> Takes too much of your time and I couldnt figure out the spin part easily at all. And it is 2 inches in radius and 4 inches in diameter. So it was way too big.</li>
    <li> This product is so mediocre - don&#x27;t get it.  It doesn&#x27;t really do anything - it doesn&#x27;t curl your hair at all - its a rip off</li>
    <li> This makes my hair very shiny.  Easy to work with.  The heat is not that hot...........which might be a downside for some.  I usually let my hair air dry and once its slightly damp thats when I start to use the Infinitipro Spin on my hair.  Its a great little tool.  I would recommend.  Ive had it for about a month now and its made fixing my hair that much easier.  I use to hold a blowdryer and a hair brush, now I just need this tool.</li>
    <li> This styler takes some time to get used to. It really makes it easy to style my hair. I use it after washing my hair and also on other days to freshen my look. The only negative is that the roller is quite large. I actually let my hair grow longer to accommodate the size of the roller.  It would be great if they came out with a model that has a smaller roller to accommodate shorter hair. If they do, I will buy it and keep both on hand. .</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair. This product gives my hair body. My hair also looks healthy after I use it. With a blow dryer it still looks frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I bought one at Walgreens years ago when they were twice as much, and loved it. It&#x27;s almost impossible for me to use a round brush with one hand and blow-dry with the other. This does the job one-handed. My old one eventually slowed and then stopped turning at all, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for half the price. The new one spins very fast, but if my hair gets stuck in it, I just reverse the direction and it untangles. The only downsides are that they are prone to breaking, like anything with moving parts, and your hair will be smoother if the hot air is hitting it from above instead of below, so this might leave it frizzier than if you used a blow-dryer. I used my old one for four years, but since I work at home and am out of school, I don&#x27;t do my hair as often anymore, so it probably got about what would be two years&#x27; worth of use for most people. For that reason, I&#x27;m going to save up for a backup one for when the new one breaks, which I assume it will. I love it that much, that I&#x27;m willing to spend money on it a third time even though I know they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I liked it for its convenience but after using it 3 years, it just stopped rotating either direction.  I think I&#x27;d rather use the old fashion way of drying your hair -- with a hair dryer and a good brush.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.... but I am having a little difficulty using it.  I kind of gets away from me while spinning.  I have a lot of arthritis in my hands and wrists so it may be just me.  I probably just need to work with it a little more and it would be easier for me to use.</li>
    <li> I love this styler. I have thin and limp hair and my hair used to be very frizzy even after applying conditioner and I was looking for a tool which styles quickly and adds volume. This tool is the answer for all my worries, it takes very little time to dry, add volume and style my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, this dryer drys fast, it&#x27;s super easy to use and gives my hair bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would caution those with really long hair, I suspect these would become tangled in very long hair. Mine is shoulder length and more than once I&#x27;ve had to stop the roller to move the dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Please Conair,do not discontinue this product because now I can style my hair in under 10 minutes.My hair is fine,chin length and made the mistake of getting it permed but it was a disaster.My hair got so frizzy.I have so many products to control the frizz but they were all wasted products. I saw this product on TV and I thought maybe I should give it a try.It is bigger than any hair tool I have.Anyway , after several trials and errors on how to use this on my hair,I finally got it pat down.After I washed my hair and dry it, I spray my hair with a pureology hair product that my hairdresser recommended and a leave- in conditioner , I would  dry my hair with a regular blow dryer first , then use the conair rotating brush to style my hair.It took awhile to get used to what button to push to rotate the brush but now I&#x27;m so used to it that,like I said,I can do all the above in under 10 minutes now. And my hair stays styled inspite of getting sweaty,being wind blown.I just comb my hair and the style stays.. Just have to practice using it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is it&#x27;s too big.Hopefully,Conair will come up with something smaller that has the same features  and can be easily packed for when traveling.</li>
    <li> I am a busy mom, I rarely have time to stop to do a review but for this product I had to do.&lt;br /&gt;I have a thick, curly, unmanageable hair, for the first time ever I found a product that I can use by myself and finish styling my hair. The result is amazing! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does not work for me at all...about to return it.</li>
    <li> This styler isn&#x27;t the best but yet not the worst..it only works for certain type of hair and not everyone&#x27;s..it kinda broke my hair from all the pulling after washing it a few times but it worked well for my mother and she loves it so it all depends</li>
    <li> I recommend this seller! This product met my sister&#x27;s expectations. She is very satisfied. I certainly would buy again at this shop.</li>
    <li> the concept is awesome but it doesn&#x27;t work. It looks really nice after you spend quite some time to do your hair but then the style does not stay after couple hours because not enough heat go through the combs</li>
    <li> Read many of the reviews on this item and it sounded good for my fine hair.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, and I am pretty experienced, having started styling and even cutting my own hair in the sixties and doing the \\&quot;big hair\\&quot; styles in the eighties. As stated, it will not rotate on high setting.  The heat output on the low setting is fairly good, but it just didn&#x27;t lift my hair like I thought it would.  It was easier than expected to switch the rotation direction, and I was truly sorry that it did not meet my expectations.  Will go back to the 2-handed round brush and dryer method.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost two years ago and thought it was awesome! It was... for awhile... After using it semi-regularly (not even daily) for maybe three months, I first noticed that the bristles start to degenerate and loose shape BADLY, making it very difficult to keep your hair on the barrel at all. The hair slips off and starts getting caught in the void where it rotates and doesn&#x27;t come out without wrecking your hair. The seconds thing to go was the motor, and I was careful to always clean any lint from the vent. It just suddenly starts to overheat for no reason and the spin action slows to a crawl. It&#x27;s a great concept, but for $50 it should have a much better quality build. Now mine has gone the way of a yet another cheap hair dryer, and I didn&#x27;t even use it all that much. I&#x27;d be curious to know if all the fab reviews are from new owners. I&#x27;d bet cash anyone who has had theirs for any length of time might change their raving reviews... Too bad. I really liked it... :(</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was VERY skeptical but all I can say is WOW!! This dryer/brush is FANTASTIC. I thought there would be a learning curve but I got the hang of it on the first try. It was love at first try : )  RUN DON\\&quot;T WALK to your computer and purchase this dryer!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is really oversold in its advertisement. Difficult to maneuver for the average person and it often pulls out my hair when I am using it.  Doesn&#x27;t eliminate any steps because I often have to dry a little with my blow dryer in order to use.  Even if you section out hair, it doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair in even the smallest sections.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth finish either.  Overall, I feel its way too overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> Works great, did the job beautifully, just a little bulky.&lt;br /&gt;Be nice if there was a smaller version for travelling, with a dual-rated plug.</li>
    <li> I  ordered for my wife because she was frying her hair and it was falling out,,also because it took her 2 hours to do her hair.  now her hair look great and it only takes her 20 min to do her hair</li>
    <li> Best used on long hair. Really like it but wish it had a smaller brush to interchange for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look like I just left the salon.      Only one problem, sometimes my hair will get caught on the sides of the brush as it is turning (OUCH) and it will make a big snarl (sometimes hard to get out). You have to watch that.  Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> My hair looked like it was professionally done after I used this and it is sooo soft.  This is the best tool I have ever purchased in my life!!</li>
    <li> Love it for my longer hair. Not sure how it would work for shorter hair. Love it for curling the ends of my long layered hair. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews say that it too heavy, agree on that, thought it doesn&#x27;t really affect the usage.&lt;br /&gt;I could never get the results in the video. My hair just gets rolled up and put down with little drying effects and without any curling for sure. I partly blame my hair&#x27;s too hard for styling, but this styler doesn&#x27;t really do anything. Using curler rolls or just let dry could save me much time and energy than playing with this one.&lt;br /&gt;If you are just curious, and have really strong healthy thick hair, do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I love it so much, I bought a second one for my sister, and a second one for myself when a new puppy chewed through the cord.</li>
    <li> I have limited use of my arms and this is so handy because it brushes and drys at the same time.  I wish the handle was a bit narrower.  It would be easier to hold.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is very easy to use. Extremely happy with the smoothness and fullness it adds to my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is just okay.  I have coarse, frizzy, thin, hard to manage hair.  It&#x27;s not a miracle tool, but can be a nice adjunct to your current routine.  I agree with some of the other users who state it can be big, bulky and unwieldy.  However I am used to it by now.  It does help smooth my hair.  Depending on the look I am going for, I can eliminate my straightener.</li>
    <li> It took me forever to dry my hair with this. Honestly you would have to have let your hair air dry to almost 90% to see this rotating styler do its magic. I liked using this for bangs but other wise, not good for your go to blow dryer</li>
    <li> I LOVE this styler.  LOVE it!  I have never been coordinated enough to round-brush my hair dry (holding a round brush in one hand and a blow-dryer in the other) but have soft, fine, straight hair that requires a blow-dry to have any body or style.  I used a styler similar to this for probably 15 years, but it didn&#x27;t rotate.  I had to spin it by hand.  I can&#x27;t believe I did it that way for so many years - never again!  This styler is amazing.  It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to hold and maneuver, does not tangle in my hair, dries it quickly and efficiently, and makes it look so good.  The only complaint I have is that the cap on the brush end pops off occasionally.  Not a big deal.  5-star styler, for the quality and for a great price!</li>
    <li> Anytime I can reduce the number of tools needed to accomplish the task is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use; hair gets tangled up in rotating brush. I was very disappointed with this product. Could be greatly improved.</li>
    <li> hair drys 3 times faster. look like from the expensive salon. so smooth and healthy look. i threw away condition</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It makes my hair full and shine. Its easy to use too. Price is great too.</li>
    <li> Your hair gets caught which is annoying. Also leaves my hair feeling staticky and plasticky. It not a nice feeling. I prefer the light, bouncy feeling of a good round brush.</li>
    <li> I had been debating about whether or not to buy the spin brush because I already own another hot air brush that works pretty well.  I was intrigued by the reviews of the spin brush and decided to get it, and I am so glad I did!  It does everything it says it will!  It is a little heavier than my old hot air brush, but not as heavy as my hair drier so that is not an issue for me.  The spin brush gave my hair great body and shine, which is huge for me because my hair is somewhat dry and gets frizzy.  My hair looks even smoother and shinier than it does when I flat iron it.  It took me a few minutes to get the hang of it, but it is easy to use once you figure it out. Also, your hair needs to be mostly try to use it, but that&#x27;s the same with any other hot air brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been letting my hair grow longer and it&#x27;s almost shoulder length now. I can&#x27;t tell you how frustrating the frizz and cowlicks were--- I almost cut it several times. I bought the Infinity spin air rotating styler brush and am so glad I waited. This product is amazing. I used to have a Revo that was heavy and made clunking sounds when too much hair got caught in the brush. It broke and I found this brush on clearance at Walmart.   The Connair brush is lighter, quieter and easier to use, (cheaper too)  plus it dries as well!!!  I just dry my hair with my usual blow dryer and then finish drying and styling with the spin brush. I am amazed at how gentle and quiet it is. No tangles just smooth, shiny hair with lots of volume.  I feel like I went to a salon. I am hooked and am ordering another in case this product is discontinued. Plus notice it has a 3 year warranty. Well worth every penny- I really love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairstyler I&#x27;ve ever had so far.  It&#x27;s very easy to learn.  I use it everyday with [[ASIN:B00390MKOM Frizz Ease Heat Defeat Protective Styling Spray By John Frieda, 6 Ounce]], and my hair stays healthy and shiny as if I go to the salon everyday.  And best thing is, it only takes me less than 5 minutes everyday!</li>
    <li> This the best thing invented. I purchased one and the button lasted a year but its worth the re purchase, its a saving cost and trip to the salon! It looks like you just came out! Great for thin hair, if you have a lot of hair i had a friend tried it it didnt work so well but i believe it just takes longer of course.</li>
    <li> Fresh out of the box just a few days and I am already ordering a second for the office /gym. This is an improvement for anyone who is using a round brush and hair dryer to do their hair every day (or every few days). It is superior to the aforementioned both In terms of ease of use and resulting hair style. My hair is noticeably smoother as well. I do agree with other reviewers who said that it takes some practice to use, but overall, it is a pretty nifty gadget. I got it as an Amazon \\&quot;deal of the day\\&quot; but am paying full price for the second.</li>
    <li> Love this hair blower. Every time I come out from a salon, i can never blow my hair just like what my hair stylist did to me. This item is totally saving my time and I can do get my hair done quick. I have thin hair, this hair blower can give me the volume of my thin hair. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliment about my new hair style  people cant notice before).  I bought it to my mom&#x27;s house one time, she loves it as well so i gave mine to her. I&#x27;m getting a new one. Attention to girls who has thin hair like me and my mom. This is a must have product!!!! I&#x27;ve introduced this product to many of my girlfriends who has thin hair. We all think that it&#x27;s one of the best invention other than iphone. :)  One con about the product, please dont take big part of your hair when you are doing it. A small piece at a time, otherwise, you hair will stuck into the crack of you hair blower. It hurts to see some of your hair got pull off.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. I regularly get the Brazilian Blowout done but often my hair is not stick straight without using an iron which is too hot and damaging. I love the look my hairdresser gets with a blowout using a wide round brush. I was expecting this to be another hair tool that would leave me disappointed and end up in the closet like the others but I was sorely mistaken. Right away, without even using instructions, I was able to use this. It leaves my hair looking really good every day. like a professional blowout.  Even when I shower before going to bed and my hair gets messed up in the morning I just use this and it looks ready for work again!   I really cannot say enough about how much I love this item and the good deal it was on Amazon! I would definitely recommend this to ANYONE. Had I had this sooner I could have eliminated many bad hair days!   BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Wonderful speedy styling equipment! This one takes almost not more than ten minutes to do all my hair for a daily routine. Ten minutes and I am ready with smooth, not any more frizzy, manageable and more bouncy hair, which I can further style into a ponytail, a high bun or  simply leave the way they are with a hairband or hair clips! I generally apply moose before drying them up with conair to give my hair more professional look, which stays for the whole day with the moose. I&#x27;ve tried giving my hair a lift with conair without moose as well but it doesn&#x27;t stay for more than an hour or 2.  It has been rightly said about conair that the product is easy to clean after use. I use my tweezer to pull of all the entangled strands, and in a pull all are out! It takes 2-3 trials to get used to it, but once you are pro, believe me, you &#x27;ll never leave home for anything important without letting your hair not rolled under conair! I was apprehensive before buying seeing the mixed reviews, but I am totally in awe of it. This will find a place in my luggage always and will accompany me everywhere except my grave :)&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Tad easy to use, time effective, brush-dryer-curler all in one&lt;br /&gt;Con: Size seems a bit wide for hair. Had it been less wider (1 inch or so) it would be a great tool for styling into curled hair, the reason why I took one star off.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent buy for everyone who needs quick fix for frizzy, unmanaged, unevenly directed hair on daily basis. I would recon using moose or styling gel for longer lasting finish.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best styling tool I have ever used.  I was slightly concered it wouldn&#x27;t work for me after reading reviews from people with short hair, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  My hair is cut in an inverted bob with it going to my chin in the front and stacked in the back. And this tool makes it look AWESOME.  It has shortened my prep time significantly--about 50%.  I can have fabulous hair in only about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well for me is my bangs.  But I have a really small forehead, so they are pretty short.  I think that it would work much better on the bangs on a normal person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments stating it is no better than a hair dryer and round brush must know something I don&#x27;t.  The ability to have one hand dry and spin and the other free to section makes this so much easier for me.  I am not constantly putting the tools down to arrange things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair shiny and full of body.  I got the hang of using it pretty soon.  Now using the buttons is instinctual and I am able to spin the right way after switching hands. I have worried that impossible tangles might be occur to the hairs directly next to the section you are spinning because sometimes they can get caught and twisted.  While the twists look gnarly, the spin brush will smooth them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this on a lightning deal for $35 and I wish I would have bought 5.  I would give them to all of my girlfriends for Christmas if I could afford it!</li>
    <li> I just got mine last night and wish I did not have to go to work. It is the easiest  most wonderful hair tool. I have thin , long curly hair and it is so nice to be able  to straighten my hair so fast. I blew it with a regular dryer for about a minute,then spent about 5 minutes using the infitipro... this was worth every penny.  I would highly recommend it...  Also it gives me a ton of volume , making my thin  hair look much thicker.  12/29 After using this tool, for a  good month , I can say it really dries my hair out. Its very grabby like a vacuum. So what ever is in its path, like a fly away  hair, it sucks it up... I am not using it much , as it just damages my hair. If the  brush had a ceramic background, it would probaly be a great product... the idea  was great, but not what I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Bought this a gift for my daughter and added one for myself on my Christmas wish list.  We both love it.  We both have long hair and it gives a salon look.  I have lots of hair so I do a blow dry first just to get it damp and then use it to style.  Also have used it on dry hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The brush was too wide, but most importantly, too soft and it couldn&#x27;t grip the hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for xmas. She wanted it and in the store it was about $20 more in stores than what I got it for new.</li>
    <li> I received this in on Tuesday but did not get a chance to try it until today. First off, the reviews that state this is heavy I would love to know what they think is light. My hands didn&#x27;t hurt and neither did my wrists. You do not have to rotate it, the barrel does it for you. As for the size I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it. In fact the size made it easier to control. I have shoulder length hair and this worked great on it. I sectioned my hair and it did a better job then a hair dryer and flat iron. I threw my flat iron out after using this because my hair had volume to it unlike the flat iron which of course leaves your hair FLAT! I would throw the hair dryer out too but my husband uses it.  As one had already stated don&#x27;t be thrown by the soft bristles. They do work! The controls are easy to navigate. Once you start using it you become adapted to which button to push. As for the high and low setting, I had to use the high setting. I first tried the low but the bristles didn&#x27;t spin too good but I have thick hair. When I did my bangs I was able to use the low setting because my hair isn&#x27;t as thick in that area. What I noticed with this is that you don&#x27;t feel the heat too much until you have the bristles spinning and I am not talking about heat that will make you sweat using it. Then you feel the heat being distributed through out. The biggest pro for me was I did not see smoke one time from my hair!! Not once. Unlike the flat iron which I would see smoke a few times and I&#x27;m talking about using it on the low setting.   The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because at the top of the brush where the cap is (not the plastic cover that goes over it)there is a small gap that goes around it and a couple of times I felt a strand of hair get caught up in it. But all I had to do was push the other button to go in reverse and it came right out. The weren&#x27;t kidding when they said you can&#x27;t get your hair caught up in this. However, the end result was beautiful,smooth, silky hair with VOLUME.  Before I purchased this I had some serious doubts but then I remembered that if I didn&#x27;t like it I could send it back. And of course I bought it through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I love the idea but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  The rotating brush is awesome and easy to use but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to give me the results that my hair stylist gets with a brush and regular hair dryer.  I do have fine hair so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.  I still use it for the rotating brush function along with my regular hair dryer which takes a bit of coordination.  Even though it does not work for me as well as I&#x27;d hoped, it does give me a little more volume and I think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Let me star off by saying I am SO SO SO pleased with this new brush. It&#x27;s totally made my blow drying routine 100x easier. After reading tons of reviews people either hated it or loved it. You just have to know how to use it. It saves me so much time versus using a brush and normal blow drying. You can&#x27;t just throw it in your hair and expect it to perform magic. You need to section off your hair. The size is perfect (I have longer hair), it&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and I&#x27;m soooooooooooo happy I don&#x27;t have to sit and roll my hair with the brush at the ends (to get a curl). This brush does all the work for me. I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice concept. The blow dryer is the perfect temperature. The rotating brush helps with styling while drying and putting some volume in my hair, the ions make my hair very shiny and soft, and the brush helps get rid of some of the frizz in my hair (not all though). From the videos and reviews, I had higher expectations of the brush, but it just wasn&#x27;t AMAZING. It took me longer to style my hair rather than using a round brush and blow dryer, and sometimes my hair would get caught and it would snap my hair or pull strands out of my head; Makes me sad. Also, I have short hair and the barrel is just a little too big for short hair.  Maybe if there was an option for a smaller barrel or interchangeable heads, this product would be much better. But if you have time to sit down and play with your hair, or if you&#x27;re using it on someone else, then this is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use...works better than expected.  It&#x27;s like I have stepped out of a salon after I blow dry my hair.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I have never had much success stying my hair with a blow dryer or curling iron.  I&#x27;ve always had to use curlers.  I saw this item advertised on tv and thought it might work since the heat and brush are one.  It was better than what I expected!  I can now style my hair without waiting for curlers to dry.  I highly recommend this item to anyone but especially to those of you who have difficulty with the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I immediately threw this product in the garbage.  I have thick wavy hair.  It did not straighten my hair as well as a regular round brush and blow dryer.  Most importantly, IT PULLED OUT HUGE CHUNKS OF MY HAIR as it got stuck in the edges of the rotating barrel.  Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I think its a little less damage then using a flat iron but it still damaged my hair. My hair does not stay in the shape that I styled it for very long. It makes it look shinier though. I have to blow dry my hair a little bit prior to using this because its not very powerful and since I have thick hair it would take forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s both a hair dryer, styler and curler.  What&#x27;s most important is that my wife loves it.  I don&#x27;t have enough hair left to get any use out of any hair dryer.  Works as advertised but was not cheap.</li>
    <li> Love it and  It is easy to get used.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it everyday to give my hair the bounce and smooth shiney look. I recommend this to give as presents.</li>
    <li> Well, when I first got this rotating styler, I was so pleased.  My fine/frizzy &amp; wavy/curly hair looked so great and smooth after using it--like I had just stepped out of a salon. I would dry my hair with my normal hair dryer until it was 85% dry and then finish off with this rotating styler.  I loved it so much, I almost immediately bought one for my adult daughter (she has the same hair type as me).  After a few weeks of use, it didn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as it did initially.  After three weeks, I noticed my hair was looking a little rough &amp; it seemed like I was losing more hair than normal, so I took a break from using it.  Perhaps for people with strong healthy hair this dryer would not be an issue, but unfortunately for my thin/fragile hair, it was a big mistake. My hair looks AWFUL now--dried out, damaged and I&#x27;ve lost a fair amount due to breakage.  At my previous hair appointment, my hairdresser had remarked about how healthy my hair looked--that was about two weeks before I bought this styler.  At my next appointment, I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll be saying anything other than, \\&quot;What in the world happened?\\&quot; :(  I just hope it can be fixed.  So this is my warning advisory for this product:  If you have really healthy and strong hair, this dryer will probably be okay--you may even think it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful (I sure did at first).  However, if you have hair that is on the fragile side and prone to heat and styling damage, be VERY cautious about using this styler.  Don&#x27;t use it every single day--take a few days off in between and assess if your hair is getting damaged.  I am really upset at myself for trading two weeks of awesome looking hair for the damaged mess that is on top of my head now.  Absolutely not worth it.  :(</li>
    <li> After losing the use of my left arm due to a stroke, I needed a way to style my newly cut above the shoulder bob. This was perfect! I can dry and style my hair with just my right hand. You can easily change the direction the brush is turning with a press of your thumb. My hair has never tangled around the brush because as soon  as I feel a bit of resistance, I start turning it the opposite direction. I am extremely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Thank you very wonderful&lt;br /&gt;I loved her and I want to buy more from you</li>
    <li> Once you learn how to use you cannot live without it I would buy again and again</li>
    <li> This only works for people who has thin hair straight hair. If tangles my hair so much and it doesn&#x27;t not make my hair curly at all.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis, and, this is too heavy for me to use. So........I gave it to a friend. I told her that if she doesn&#x27;t like it, to pass it on to her daughter or granddaughters.</li>
    <li> This might work very well for a lot of people but it does not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Very long - past my rib cage&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Fairly dry/damaged as I&#x27;ve bleached it a lot in the past (I am blonde)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i need to take care of my hair &amp; baby it so it doesn&#x27;t all break off &amp; split on me.&lt;br /&gt;this unwieldy thing can be a bit of a challenge to use &amp; in the process you may damage your hair trying to learn how to use it. be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have naturally healthy &amp; strong hair, this product will probably help you a lot. But for me, it was really just a pain in the butt to use &amp; it further damaged my already damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you&#x27;re supposed to use this on 80% dry hair. Basically you still have to use your blow dryer to get it that way so the Conair Spin Air doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for that tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my hair is very long, it snagged a lot &amp; pulled and tangled - not a good thing when i&#x27;m trying to prevent more breakage. Seems like a flat iron is more gentle than this thing as you&#x27;re just gliding it through your hair, not pulling &amp; tugging &amp; yanking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL or wrist problems- this is not the tool for you. My wrist hurt really badly &amp; i had to put on my brace halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it as the Conair spin doesn&#x27;t get your hair completely dry unless you keep going over and over the same area, which is damaging, &amp; still doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for a blow dryer. and unless you go over &amp; over every section of your head with this thing a million times, it&#x27;s not going to completely dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also took a really really long time for me to do - 30 minutes. i coulda blow dried my hair &amp; curled it with a curling iron in that time :( it would have looked better too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mixed feelings about this thing. my results weren&#x27;t great. i&#x27;d say avoid it if your hair is any sort of damaged or if it&#x27;s long &amp; damaged. but go for it if it&#x27;s healthy &amp; short</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this as I&#x27;m a real clutz when it comes to doing anything like curling or drying hair and I can never get the back well. Others talked about drying hair first with a standard hair dryer and I took that advice, which was good. You do need to dry your hair, especially if it&#x27;s thick or coarse, and then use this styling product. It does take a few times to get used to the buttons and directions they move in but I did get it down and now can&#x27;t remember how I ever used to style my hair. This was a grand invention and I really love it now.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I could blow dry and curl my hair at the same time.  Had to use my regular blow dryer first and then finish with the product in question.</li>
    <li> LOVE it.  It is perfect for my hair. Just wish it had a slightly smaller bush with it as well as the large one.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get used to but in the end this works pretty well.  After adjusting to the way it functions it does what it claims.</li>
    <li> This styler is perfect for my fine, just below the ear hair. It&#x27;s easy to use, dries my hair quickly and adds body and shine.</li>
    <li> This  is my second and I love it!</li>
    <li> i have owned this hair styler for a couple years and used it only a few times. my hair is straight and this tool does not create any body or volume. It&#x27;s not easy to use and was a waste of money. Only thing is does is smooth out the hair when it&#x27;s rotating.</li>
    <li> It work like it should</li>
    <li> my second one.. I bought it just in case my first one stopped working, couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I have hair that comes to my mid back or a little less. I get it professionally colored/highlighted and/or lowlights. My hair is not thick. It has no volume and is oily on the top of my head. I recently got bangs and i have long layers. I have to wash it ever day. I&#x27;m just a regular girl (43 yrs old) that straightens her hair every day. Nothing fancy. Could never get the hang of the blow dryer and brush thing. Read lots of reviews from different sites and watched YouTube videos before purchasing. I told no one about my buying this product. On day one my friend at work commented about how healthy my hair looked. Day 2 she said my hair looked so shiny and sleek. I told her about the spin brush. I believe her hair is too short for it, unfortunately, but I was thrilled to get the compliments. I&#x27;m still getting used to using it. I put volumizing mousse in my hair then blow dry until it&#x27;s just damp then use the spin brush to curl under the ends and put volume at the crown. The volume at my crown isn&#x27;t as high as I would like but it&#x27;s not laying as flat. I&#x27;m sure I will find a product that will help that or just get better at using the tool. I&#x27;m happy that I bought it. Purchased at Ulta for $59.99, I believe. The color is Ombre.</li>
    <li> The rotation power is very weak.  The air flow is also weak and not very hot.  Definitely NOT for thick hair.  A waste of money for me</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  When I first read the reviews about having to dry your hair most of the way before using, that defeated my entire purpose for purchasing it.  When I go ti, the first few times I used it on wet hair, it made a tangled mess.  With a litthe practice and a steady hand, it works perfectly to style &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34; wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  Just keep in mind, it takes practice, but it works great.  I use it every morning.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool - within minutes I look like I had my hair done at a salon.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> With the Spin Styler I do better then with a hairdryer and brush, but the product is very large and I wish one would have the option to purchase it with a smaller brush. For my medium length hair it is too large and I still have to use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without my spin brush! I have short hair and it works perfectly for styling my hair and giving me lots of lasting volume. I have left it, on occasion, when going out of town and my hair looks terrible without it now because I cannot dry my hair with a hair dryer and brush at the same time since my hair is short. I usually dry my hair about 50% upside down with a regular blow dryer and then finish it with the spin brush. After all my hair is dry, I go over the top sections once more by holding it for 5-10 seconds on the cool setting and it really helps hold the volume and gives it remarkable shine! I seriously couldn&#x27;t do my hair without this thing! I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years and it&#x27;s still working great! My mom wants one now too so it&#x27;s not just me!</li>
    <li> i sent this as a gift.  so far have not heard any complaints about this styler.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t use this so i can&#x27;t give a review.</li>
    <li> I like it, it is easy to use. I just feel I got the bigger size as the diameter of the brush seems bigger for my hair.</li>
    <li> lo0o0o0o0ove i am soooooo happy</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use.  Makes my hair soft and shiny.  My hair is layered and above my shoulders.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> make my hair shine and smoothy!!but not that curly, just a really big wave at the end. The machine is huge!</li>
    <li> I have fine, chemically treated hair.  The styler keeps the hair smooth and full -looking.  I can even wash it every other day now!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S THE BEST PRODUCT I EVER USED. MY HAIR IS SO SMOOTH, SHINING AND BOUNCY. I&#x27;M A ASIAN GIRL. IT SUITS ME BETTER THAN BABYBLISS CURLING MACHINES.IT&#x27;S MORE NATURAL</li>
    <li> Outstanding! I have long naturally wavy, curly hair but it gets frizzy and out of control, but this brush makes my hair smooth, shiny and gorgeous. I get so many compliments! It&#x27;s my best beauty secret.</li>
    <li> My wife says this is the BEST Air Styler she has ever used. Works Exactly as described and she loves it.. Good for me too.. You know.. Happy Wife.. Happy life...</li>
    <li> The spin air styler drys your hair fast, but does stand up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Not for long hair, it rpiped my hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have had my current styler for several years and cannot be without it.  I bought a new one for backup.  Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be able to blow out my hair by myself. Especially with how smooth and sleek my hair gets. A must have for curly hair! Saves me time and money, I LOVE that.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair tool I have in my arsenal - and I am typically a sucker for these type of things.  For the price, I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly do what it says.  I had visions of my hair getting all tangled in it and having to cut may way out of it or something.  When the product arrived, I was initially concerned that holding the button the whole time would be cumbersome but it isn&#x27;t.  I have two instylers (the bigger one and the small one), several different flat irons, curling irons, round brushes, blow dryers, every sized barrel curling iron you can imagine and this one beats them all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is longer than shoulder length but doesn&#x27;t hit my back bra strap and it&#x27;s moderately frizzy/curly/straight with long layers and side swept bangs and this tool is AMAZING.  I look like I had a professional blow out every single morning.  People constantly ask me if I just had my hair done or if I curled it because it looks curled, smooth and holds all day.  I rarely review things but I had to rave about my favorite product.  I have had this for 6 months and I still love it - all of my other products are dusty because I literally never use anything else.  I cannot recommend this enough:)  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Just get it!!! Seriously! It arrived today and I was so stoked to try it. If you feel like a contortionist every time you have to blow out your hair with your dryer in one hand and round brush in the other...look no further. Some reviews said to dry your hair about 90% for best results or spray it with water- which is what I did just to dampen it. I think it took me 15 minutes total. The results were smooth, shiny, fresh from the salon blow out with body. No frizz! Easy to handle, it does all the work for you as you position it around your head and press the spin button. Fabulous product. Game changer! I have a mid neck length bob. My hair is almost always frizzy even after I blow dry it and use a straightening iron on it. These results were amazing! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase. 5 star product.</li>
    <li> This really works well on long hair. Can curl or dry straight.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look sleek and healthy. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to deal with frizzy hair anymore. I just wish it would rotate on cold air too.</li>
    <li> I loooove my conair spin brush!&lt;br /&gt;I look like I went to the salon when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Its best to first dry your roots a little, then blow it out while its towel dried.my best friend used it, and I found out its great for volume if you have thin hair. Mine is really thick and it helps me tame it and get rid of frizz. So its all around great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer with the hopes of taking less time to get my hair done in the morning.  I have long, thick hair, similar to the girl in the videos available for this product.  The power and heat does not blow enough to dry my hair fast enough.  You will notice in the videos the girl&#x27;s hair is dry already as they demo the product.  I also tried it on dry hair, but I did not get waves or bounce.  It did give my hair a nice straight style.  I will say the brush and spinning are fantastic.  I was afraid my hair would get tangled easily, but it didn&#x27;t.  The bristles are soft and the the reverse rotation prevents the hair from getting tangled.  I think this product would be great for someone with short and/or thin hair that tends to dry quickly.</li>
    <li> It does not have enough heat.The barrell spins and  rotates very slow which causes the hair to dry frizzy and dull.I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a trememdous offer (Amazon only) and product....Most stores sell this for $79.99, Amazon was about 1/2 of that for the same item.  It works beautifull on short or medium hair.  I use is as an &#x27;over under&#x27; drying tool....Curl with the Infinity brush and blow on top (same time) with your regular dryer.....it polishes your hair (as advertised) and takes about 1/2 the drying time...&lt;br /&gt;you gotta LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Conair Spinbrush for my girlfriend on October 21, 2013 and she loved it. She is a stay at home girlfriend, so since her hair is thick and half way down her back, she only used her Spinbrush 3 to 4 times per month. Last week she noticed her Spinbrush started making a strange sound and today it just died. She is not happy. Hopefully there is some sort of warranty.</li>
    <li> Creates knots in my my hair. (I followed instructions carefully.)&lt;br /&gt;I had more volume in my hair without using this.&lt;br /&gt;Poor product.</li>
    <li> This item works really well. Takes some getting used to, especially if you have long hair. But it seems like the more I use it, the faster I get at using it. It does create more volume. I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> I like several things about this hot air brush but two very important downfalls void all the likes:&lt;br /&gt;Likes &#x3D; large easy to hold handle, large barrel, multi-directional barrel rotation, cool set.&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes &#x3D; blow power too low, brush bristles are so limp and soft they are practically ineffective on anything other than very thin hair.</li>
    <li> No. Nope. Did nothing good for my hair. I have long, fairly straight, easy-to-work-with hair. I tried it a few times figuring there was a learning curve, but all this did was tangle it and frizz it out. And... kinda made my hair feel dirty, like I over hair-sprayed it. It might have been a user error, but I&#x27;ve been using Conair products for years and this was the first fail.</li>
    <li> It is too hard to press the button on the right side down continuously to use the brush clockwise.&lt;br /&gt;It continuously slips off and the brush goes counter clockwise.</li>
    <li> To start out, I&#x27;ll say that my hair is very fine, thin and shoulder length. I&#x27;ve always had problems with styling it since I have cowlicks (yeah, I have problems). This styler is a miracle worker!!!!! My hair has never looked softer, sleeker and has held it&#x27;s volume for so long. I see a lot of people in the reviews complain that it is too bulky to use. I won&#x27;t disagree. I could see older people not being able to use it because it does take some coordination. It took me quite a few tries to get it right, but it was so worth it. I would practice it during the day when I had no where to go. Once you get the positioning right and the forward/backward button, it works wonderfully! I always curl my hair under or somewhat straight. It takes only a few more minutes than it would if I was using my hairdryer and round brush. It works well with creating volume at the crown of your head as well.&lt;br /&gt;Please, don&#x27;t be turned off by all the negative reviews. Buy it and try it for yourself. With Amazon, you can always return it if you hate it. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try!!!!!</li>
    <li> the barrel is too large to make any curls. If you want to straighten your hair, it works fine. But don&#x27;t expect to curl it</li>
    <li> I have shin length hair and this is perfect. I thought it would be too big for my hair, so I was ready to return it if didn&#x27;t work. Well, to my delight it works beautifully. My hair is shinning and sleek salon like. It also gave body. I have to say that it just arrived and instead of washing my hair I just sprayed water in it before using this big helper. My hair is not difficult to dry. If you have a hair that takes a long time to dry, use the common dryer first. I&#x27;m completely in love. I have been looking for some month for the perfect hair dryer, I just found it after many trials.</li>
    <li> My daughter clued me in to this styler and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  For the first time my shoulder length hair looks just like it does when I go to the stylist!  I have a lot of body and even with the best dryer and a flat iron had some fuzzing and places where it erroneously curved or wouldn&#x27;t curve.  With this styler my hair is smooth, flowing, with just the curve at the bottom that I want.  A tip....watch the on line video on how to use.  Also, use a turban to get your hair fairly dry first.....it would take forever to dry really long wet hair.  After I put the turban on, I apply my make up and then my hair is the perfect dampness to style.  Also, I haven&#x27;t found the need to use any product with this....just a bit of spray at the end and not sure that is even necessary.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have bought hair styling products before that said they worked and they have ended up in the back of the closet but not the [[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]]. I got this last night and decided to give it a try this morning. All I can say is WOW!!!! It did exectly what it claimed. I finished styling my hair (which only took a few minutes) and I looked like I had just left the salon. I was amazed. My hair looked silky smooth like I had a professional blow out. The real boost came when I went over to the dentist and the receptionist asked if I just had my hair done. Then I knew it wasnt just me who thought it looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes, my hair is a few inches past my shoulder. I think you do need longer hair to use this as the brush head is pretty big. Also, I dried my hair with a regular hair dryer until it was about 80% dry as my hair hold onto a lot of water. However I did not run a brush through it prior to using the Spin Air (just a comb) as I wanted to see what the device could really do. It is very simple to use and you cant get your hair tangled even if you tried. All you have to do is rotate the brush the oposite way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is probably a good styler overall, but the diameter of the handle is way too large for a small woman&#x27;s hand to wrap around.</li>
    <li> I just used this product today.  My whole hair styling took 5 minutes and it looked better than many professional blow-outs I&#x27;ve had.  I have very fine sparse hair styled into a bob.  My hair never looked so silky, no additional products needed!  I am in love!</li>
    <li> I have the red one and it works great! The only complaint that I have is that it makes my hair feel a little weird. Thats why I gave it 4 stars. I can&#x27;t really tell you how it does but only when I have the brush going with my hair. But overall it makes my hair shiny and look healthy.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this product years ago! If you have fine, thin hair like me, it will give it great fullness and body.  So much easier than trying to use a hair dryer and round brush at the same time!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Handle is too big to hold it in one hand and set the hair.</li>
    <li> I have Wavy hair and this did not work for me. I tried it twice and results were terrible!! It made my poor hair frizzy and poofy!! I guess like one of the reviewers said, it&#x27;s good for people with normal straight hair.  I&#x27;m very sad but oh well I guess I&#x27;ll go back to using the straightener.</li>
    <li> My second spin brush.  I use it all the time.  I bought the second one because I bought my first  at least two years ago and now the bristles are worn.  Great price compared to drug store pricing.</li>
    <li> Well, my hair definitely did not look like model&#x27;s that Conair listed on the ad. Many reviewers mentioned that the Infiniti Pro only worked on 80% dry hair. I completely agree. I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it&#x27;s actually quite thick. This means that I have to blow dry my hair after I shower, THEN I have to section off pieces of my hair to run through the Infiniti Pro. I originally purchased the item to save some time from my normal blow dry-then-flat-iron routine, but unfortunately, it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro does not work well unless you have small sections of hair to work with. The time it takes to section off pieces of hair that could run through the bristles makes it too long of a process. It actually added time to my styling routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I also never got the hang of was how to roll the brush all the way to the root of my hair without getting it stuck. There were a few mornings where I was cussing because I would keep getting stuck! It&#x27;s not pleasant to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my mom the Infiniti Pro and she likes it. Her hair is a bit thinner than mine and it works better for her. Just beware if you have thicker hair!</li>
    <li> I like it,easy to stile my frizzy hair</li>
    <li> the BEST !!!!! I bought two, I have almost 2 years using the first one, my hear looks beautiful, this is the BEST!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this styler. i bought one for my sister because she loved the one i had and it&#x27;s the best thing for those people who don&#x27;t know how to blow dry hair with the round comb and a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It does not give more volume.  It straightens my hair with a little curl as the barrel is quite wide.  Also it does not get very hot so it will take a bit longer to style.  I&#x27;m glad I did not pay full price.</li>
    <li> It´s a fun way to style your hair.  Very nice, not expensive.  If you don&#x27;t align your hair very well it can make very bad tangles, enough that make you cut your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Spin Air! It doesn&#x27;t work well with really wet hair but after my hair was 80% dry I finished with my Spin Air and it curled my hair with out having to use my flat iron to tame the frizzies! It didn&#x27;t tangle even when I pushed the spin direction in the wrong direction!</li>
    <li> It is very good, I have fine hair and it works gently e make volumous. Maybe if it h&amp;aacute;s a smoller size, would be better becouse I have short hair.</li>
    <li> You have to be pretty patient with this thing. Ultimately, I don&#x27;t have this kind of time because my hair is SUPER thick. It&#x27;s been in the drawer for a year-- after two uses. I will say, though, that my hair looked gorgeous those two days :)</li>
    <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me $20) . Please dont trust Conair.</li>
    <li> already used this product,soI was very satisfied with it to order a second one.My hair never looked so good.</li>
    <li> This Conair spin brush is awesome I use this everyday, it works great.</li>
    <li> Fabulous tool for staying hair, very like the Babliss product I use in the UK.  Fast delivery, great product. I use a Wella spray to protect my hair before using this. Good results every time.</li>
    <li> It was alright...  I was not impress with it because the blow dry was not hot enough, it take too long to dry hair...</li>
    <li> It does work.Sadly I am terrible with my hair so it doesnt get much use.I wish there was a smaller size!</li>
    <li> I have medium textured relaxed hair that I recently cut short. This tool is great for drying and slightly styling my hair (my hair is currently to short to get full curl from the dryer) my spin brush routine: wash an condition my hair, apply a styling cream/heat protector and air dry until hair is 60% dry. Next (very important unless you want to snag or tangle your hair) i section my hair with clips an take small subsection being careful to not make sections longer than the dryer barrel. I place the barrel over the section as if to flip my hair out and spin to smooth my hair roots then place the brush under the section to straighten the full shaft of my hair. I continue around my head until its all dry and super shiny. I finish by applying a light frizz serum and wrap my hair to help lessen the volume (because my hair is chin length)&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product, it makes my hair soft and bouncy I also experience less hair breakage than flat ironing. I wish the barrel could be ordered smaller and I do experience shagging from time to time when rushing to finish my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have fine hair shoulder length or shorter. I bought it for my daughter who has long, thick hair &amp; it just took way to long to dry. It would be perfect for someone who&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t thick or long.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST item I have ever purchased for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, does all the work for you and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I received it yesterday and used it first thing this morning.&lt;br /&gt;I got done much quicker and looked much better.  It is like&lt;br /&gt;going to a salon and having your hair done for you. Sleek,Smooth&lt;br /&gt;and Silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is if you are petite and have small hands&lt;br /&gt;the rod is HUGE, I literally had to hold on to it with 2 hands.&lt;br /&gt;If they would make the rod thinner it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product for the Cost !!!!!  Highly Recommend !!!!</li>
    <li> Tangles were a frequent problem when using the product for the three months it lasted.  One day it just stopped rotating.  Too expensive for only three months use.  I did not buy it through Amazon.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product ever. I have thrown out all my other hair products. Wish I found this earlier. I do not need to see my hairdresser anymore for a blow out, this product makes my hair look  like I just came from the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly the way I expected.  It made my hair full and full of waves which is what i wanted.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok no big difference between this and dryer/round brush. Just as much work with same results. I have med length wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Before I got the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, I had no control overy my messy hair. Now it&#x27;s just a 5-10 minutes blow (depending on how awake I am that day), my hair is not neat &amp; nicely wavy. Just spray on some heat protectant spray before you blow and some spray to set the style and you are go to go. Make sure you do your weekly hair treatment if you plan on using this everyday like I did</li>
    <li> When I first got this I found it unwieldy and really frustrating to use. I lost a lot of hair during the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your hair needs to be 90% dry prior to using this, but the smoothness and bounce this product gives is awesome! My hair is slightly below my shoulders  and when I use this tool it looks like a salon blow out. You need to be patient and give yourself a few practice sessions before getting good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this styler and absolutely would but it again.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 3 days.  It has stopped ROTATING.  APPSOLUTELY USELESS, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  TO ANYONE WANTS TO BUY IT  -  DONT.</li>
    <li> This product for me did not save any time at all. There isn&#x27;t enough power in the hair dryer (I have thin, med length hair). Then I noticed on the instructions that they recommend you use a regular hair dryer first to get at least 80% of your hair dry - then switch to this one. Eliminating frizz is also a little white lie. The only thing this product did for me was thin it out my hair some more - as it was spinning and pulling the hair out of my head. I&#x27;m going back to my old dryer and curling iron.</li>
    <li> works perfect on my hair! makes wavy, straight, with or without volume! very versatile, with just a little practice you get to do what you want with your hair style, and the price is the best, thanks a lot !!</li>
    <li> muito facil de usar, pratica e boa rotatividade da escova, apenos o cabo eh muito curto. mas eu gostei.eh leve e pratica</li>
    <li> I read a review on Babybliss Rotating styler in a magazine but that was not availalbe in US. I bought this instead and my life is so much easier! This is very simple to use and it takes very little time to style my hair. I am used to washing my hair in the morning before going to work and pre-drying and styling takes max 20 minutes. If I wash my hair on a weekend and air dry, it takes 5 minutes (no exagerration!!) to style my hair and it comes out so beautiful and with volume. As I keep using it I am learning new techniques as well. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! just so upset why I didnt buy it before. I just wish it had little more power.</li>
    <li> Meet my fashion expectation .</li>
    <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it. This tool smooths hair but leaves it flat. Worst thing about it is that the hair catches at both ends of the barrels and pulls hair out all the way to the roots. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> This dryer-styler is so great, I bought two more for my cousins. We all love it. It&#x27;s great for every day and vacation trips.Thank you</li>
    <li> For me, this just didn&#x27;t work. I have shoulder length hair that is thick and fine. At the rate that the air was coming out of this thing, I would have had to get up 3 hours early to have my hair dry by the time I left for work. To demonstrate, pucker your lips and blow - that&#x27;s about as hard as the air comes out of this thing. Yes, it rotates but it&#x27;s really awkward and it pulled my hair. It took entirely too long to use this thing. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Do you have frizzy hair?&lt;br /&gt;Do you have thick, unmanageable hair?&lt;br /&gt;Do you wish your hair can look like the day it left the salon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then you NEED this product. I thought I was cursed with crappy frizzy and ridiculously thick hair for this lifetime but since discovering this product, my hair has looked pretty damn amazing! Yes, it does take practice and yes it does take a while to get it right but it&#x27;s so worth it once you invest some time and patience. I always get a ton of complements and it&#x27;s really all thanks to this hair product. This is the ONLY product that allows me to look like I had it professional blown from the salon. My hair looks shiny, healthy, and soft. It&#x27;s almost unreal! Do yourself a favor and buy this right now. Your hair will thank you!!</li>
    <li> WAS LOW, I THINK WAS BROKEN.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very coordinated  with the two hand drying hair and using a round brush.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all types of dryers and Spin Styler is the only one that achieves a professional blow dry look at home for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, medium to long length, and with long layers-a little bit of patience and practice is necessary.  Best results I&#x27;ve found is to clip hair and dry in sections.  Dryer does get hot, to prevent hair damage/breakage I&#x27;ll hold the curl with out rotating once hair section is close to dry.  If it&#x27;s hot and humid summertime I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;setting to set the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; to control frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My first Spin styler lasted 5 years and didn&#x27;t hesitate replacing it</li>
    <li> I like it, but I think that the handle should be smaller so anybody can use it easily.</li>
    <li> fast deiivery...great product!</li>
    <li> This worked just as well as the $100 product by that other company.  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I have in the past considered myself hair impaired and have resigned myself to just letting my wavy hair airdry, but with the infiniti pro I can actually blow dry my hair straight by myself! I just got this and I haven&#x27;t really gotten the spin part down. I think that will take some practice, but even without the spin you can use the hot brush. I was so amazed that I was able to achieve smooth, shiny hair straight hair my first try. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how wide the handle is, it just wasn&#x27;t comfortable for a petite lady&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to say that if you are comparing this to the babyliss model I did my research and conair owns both brands. I think this is the same, the brush is made out of metal just like the babyliss.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom about 6 month ago and she called me last week and said one time she tried to use it and did not turn on and smelled like when electric devices short circuit and spark! and that&#x27;s it, to the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, she really liked it and it did what it suppose to do, but it did not last very long.</li>
    <li> My second one. Read instructions! Do not expect this brush to dry and style sopping wet hair. It will wear out the motor. Does a great job of styling partially dry hair.</li>
    <li> Very good things.  recommended many friends to buy</li>
    <li> Love this! It is the ONLY way for me to dry my hair without it getting frizzy. You can make the brush turn one way to smooth the bottom of your hair, and another to use it to brush down the top. And it&#x27;s fast! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curling hair and this has been the best thing ever!!  It works great to dry and straighten my hair.  It adds body and is so easy to use. I even bought another in case this one breaks. I have had it over a year.  BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Wow...who knew my hair could look like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a world-class klutz with a hair dryer....so much so that for YEARS I let my hair air dry rather than fight with a hair dyer. I told myself that it was better for my hair, but what I ended up with was a frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylist finally convinced me to do a 1 month trial of blow drying my hair. I figured there was no way I could duplicate the shine and swing that she always managed.Frankly, I was trying, but juggling a brush and a hair dryer meant that the front of my hair looked okay but the back was still a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: my hair dryer died and when I went to find a new one, I stumbled across this. Everyone raved how their hair looked as good as a salon blowout. &amp;#34;Sure,&amp;#34; I thought. &amp;#34;But they probably already know how to use a hair dryer.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one anyway figuring I could return it if it was a total bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy...was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just ONE use, I am completely in love with my hair. Shiny, just enough curl on the end to keep it from being stick-straight. I might even stop in to show off to my stylist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the rotating part takes some getting used to...I still manage to get it going in the wrong direction most of the time, but my hair still looked great. Also be aware that you might want to use a regular hair dryer to take your hair from wet to damp. This puts out a good air flow but it&#x27;s 500 watts and doing the initial dry with a regular dryer speeded up the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will probably take a half-dozen times to get to the point where I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with the controls. Seems pretty intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I am loving my hair again.</li>
    <li> I might not be the most talented person when it comes to using a product, but I did feel this was difficult for me to use. I will hold on to it for awhile, but unlikely I will use it much. My hair gets tangled in it. I do have fine hair, so maybe it is not best for that hair type. The times I did use it, it did smooth the frizz, but did not do much for curls or waves. I have long hair, and just didn&#x27;t fit right for me.</li>
    <li> It grabs your hair at such speed that you feel it will pull it all out. I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I return it?</li>
    <li> Good product Much easier to use then combination of hairdryer and brush . Still need to practice , but even  using it the first time I was  able to impress my self  Would definitely recommend this product,  but not for short hair ( in my opinion ) because  the diameter of the brush&lt;br /&gt;Delivery as promised&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> just so you know, i&#x27;m very low maintenance with my hair. I like to be in and out quickly.  I am terrible at round brushing so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I didn&#x27;t like it because it easily tangled my hair and I felt that it pulled them out more too.  maybe it was just me, but this item had to go back.</li>
    <li> After doing my research and reading through the reviews, I wanted to love this styler, I really did. I have fine hair and have a hard time achieving a salon blow out at home. I was hoping this would be the miracle I was looking for. I read through the instructions and with practice, I started getting the hang of it. My hair however, was still flat and lifeless. I was convinced that I needed to find the right styling products to pair up with this tool. After spending a small fortune on products, my hair was still looking underwhelmed. I gave it a try for 30 days and ended up returning it. I&#x27;m going to try the InStyler next.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful. I have fine, chin length hair and the only day it ever looked good was after leaving the salon. I am all thumbs with a brush and hair drier. This product actual gave me the ability to recreate my salon look. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> gives great style an volume to my fine hair, i use it instead if my blowdryer an round brush, works great.my hair never gets tangled up as it spins, way cool.</li>
    <li> Several issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The rotation function is difficult to use. Its VERY easy to get your hair tangled. Which is dangerous. A few times my finger accidently pushed the rotation and started to tangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The hair dryer barely blows air on the high setting (and its not hot) and most of it is coming out of the tip.  I put my hand to the barrel and the heat is not evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The desciption says \\&quot;3 heat settings and 2 speeds for versatile styling\\&quot;. Dont be fooled. There are 2 settings Low, High, and a Cool function. The Low/High setting controls the flow of air and the rotating speed simultaneously.  I would have liked to use high air and slow rotation until I got used to using the rotation setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The brush bristles are soft, which makes it hard to grab the hair. I dont have thick hair at all. My hair is very soft and generally straight. I had to take very small sections of hair and help the brush grab the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the low air/heat and the small sections, it took forever to dry my hair! My arm was more tired than if I used a conventional dryer and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is great, but the execution is poor.</li>
    <li> Works great! It could heat up a little hotter for a faster drying time but other then that i love this product. I dont have any need to put serum in my hair anymore this product smooths it and shines it so well.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve tried so many things to get my hair smooth and it&#x27;s always a waste of money.  I read the other reviews and decided to purchase the Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler.  I LOVE IT!  I recently got my hair cut and re-layered.  I have thin hair and I would say it&#x27;s medium to long in length.  This product works!  It is so easy to use and you only need 2 hands (what a concept).  My hair is so smooth and has some body and style when I&#x27;m done using it.  It takes me a little longer to do my hair now, but I never dried it properly prior to using the Spin Air.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  I&#x27;m very happy I now own this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, thinner than it was years ago, color treated and straight.  With the Infiniti I get shine, shape, and curl and it dries all in one.  Not sure, but I hope because you are constantly moving the brush function up and down that my hair is not being overstressed with constant heat.  Occasionally I do have to stop and unroll the brush function when I get my hair caught in the brush. Happily that does not happen too often.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair.  I used to blow dry, then use a straightener or the instyler.  Both my instyler and blow dryer were probably on their last legs, so I purchased this.  The first time I used it, it only took me a couple minutes to figure this out.  My hair did not get caught in the rotating brush, which I was glad some of the other reviewers said didn&#x27;t happen, or I&#x27;d never have ordered this.  The brush rotates either way you want with the touch of a switch.  You can also stop the brush from rotating just by not pressing the switch at all.  This feature I just love, because I can roll up a section and hold it there while blowing dry.  My hair dries very quickly, and my hair is all styled when finished, no more two step process, just one.  You will really like this, I promise!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product I am disabled and receive compliments about my hair daily don&#x27;t know what I would do without it&lt;br /&gt;Makes doing my hair a breeze</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think there was any air coming through! Then as I spun it tangled my hair inside! Revo styler is still better, but not a bad replacement.</li>
    <li> I received this as a 2012 Christmas gift. I wear my hair in a sleek, smooth bob, so I was anxious try this product. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I used to just blow dry my hair willy-nilly and then use big electric hot curlers to smooth out any frizz or unwanted waves. This revolving blow dryer is just the thing I have been looking for. Although the handle is a bit bulkier (but not awkward) than I would prefer (I have smallish hands and I suppose they had to put the motor somewhere) I still consider it a winner. It&#x27;s easy to operate and doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair. The air (hot,cool and warm settings) comes out continuously, but you do have to hold down a button to make it spin and it is capable of going in either direction. Why it doesn&#x27;t tangle the hair is curious, but it hasn&#x27;t yet and I&#x27;ve used it several times now. My hair finishes sleek and smooth just the way I like it. I will continue to use this and I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> slides easily thru hair--no pulling or breakage of hair--gives great lift th thin hair -- would recomend  for anyone including my friends to use.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product but it might not work if you have very thick hair. My hair is very thick and messy so it takes time to get it done. Just play with it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this product for several weeks, reading reviews and finally decided to order it. I have waist length wavy hair of medium thickness.  normally use a flat iron because I don&#x27;t know how to blow out my hair just right. The first time I used it was a disaster. I could not figure out the rotation and thought I was going to make a mess. But once I got to using it, I figured out what works for my hair eventually. It grabs the hair nicely. It just takes a long time to get it dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few times of using it, I&#x27;m not loving it as much as I wanted to. I started piling all the hair that was snagging in it on one side, and realized by the time I was done, it was a lot!!! I have since gone back to my paddle brush, round brush routine. my hair breaks, it falls out and the dryer is not powerful enough. The hot setting does get hot, but the rotation is too fast for me. Changing my original review to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this thing!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have natural curly hair and it is best to start with my hair completely wet. It does take a long time but, the results are great. I don&#x27;t have to do another thing to my hair for the next 3 days.</li>
    <li> It came with an american plug on it and I am still unable to use it as I am having difficulty getting hold of and american to english adaptor. I cant understand why this was sent to an english address?? I hope I get a reply. Thankyouy</li>
    <li> this is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought.  had to replace my old one after several years of use.  love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great idea, but I discovered that pieces of my hair would get caught and pull it out.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Love it.</li>
    <li> not hot enough for my hair, returned</li>
    <li> I have long layered hair (to my bra strap) and it works PERFECT!  I do dry my hair upside down first about 90% of the way with a traditional dryer then section my hair (like the salon would) and start at the roots and make my way down for a sexy Victoria Secret Bombshell look.  I&#x27;m telling you this was one of the best buys - my hair always looks great.  It does take some getting used to but once you have it you&#x27;re good to go - I&#x27;d say 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. I highly recommend to anyone contemplating on purchasing. :)</li>
    <li> Love it and it came on time.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever leave a review, but I HAVE to on this product! This spin brush is awesome, exactly what I needed! I love the straight looks the girls get from straightening irons but is not flattering for my face. I have longish layered hair about 5 inches below my shoulder. I normally use hair dryer and then large hot rollers to smooth out and give my hair some body, but not curls or too wavy. I still get frizzies and sometimes \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; showing from where I attach the clips to the rollers. I just received this Spin Brush today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I used it on dry hair and it WORKS exactly the way I want it to! DOES NOT TANGLE! Has different heat settings. It give body to my hair and smoothed all the frizzies out without drying or frying my hair like a hot iron. I can&#x27;t wait to use it after a shower when my hair is a little damp. I smooths my hair, giving it body without curls or waves, but just enough curve to to my hair so it&#x27;s not so straight at the ends. Just what I wanted! I could not find rollers large enough to do the same. And it DOES NOT TANGLE! Easy to use and I don&#x27;t think it is too heavy like another reviewer mentioned. I used to use a brush and hair dryer before I put up in rollers and my arms got so tired. But I had not problem with this brush, seems so much easier, does what I want all at once. I can&#x27;t say any more about this product, worth the price! Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> not strong enough!!only 2 spped&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all is that I have to keep it  because I trow away the box,sucks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good,but not enough to use for whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this for my bang and works good.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that as I write this, my right hand is so sore and I can&#x27;t feel my pinky.....I saw the commercial for the spin air and thought \\&quot;there goes conair again with a good idea but likely a poorly constructed product.\\&quot; I have never been a fan of Conair products. The products have never worked on my hair. I&#x27;ve got VERY thick and long hair. I read other reviews and didnt&#x27;s see an absolute consensus so i felt it was one of those products i had to try for myself. Flat irons make my hair too flat with no body and blow drying takes forever, gets tiring and can burn my scalp. I bought this item today and gave it a whirl on VERY damp hair. The spin air spins to the left and right and has a separate button for each...pressing the correct one is going to take some practice before i instinctively know which is which. At first try, I found there is definitely a learning curve. My hair got stuck, was pulled by the rotator and I thought my head was going to pop off at one point. You can&#x27;t just let the piece of hair whirl onto the rotator and leave it there to make your hair gorgeous. I had to keep the spin air moving up and down, otherwise, my hair rolled up on the brush, and got stuck. On my VERY damp hair, this thing is not going to save me any time compared to blow drying. I waited for my hair to air dry, and gave this another go on dry hair...On my dry hair, things were better. The process went much faster. I didn&#x27;t find it went much faster than blow drying nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum this up:&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It is kind of a fun concept; The hottest setting on the spin air is just warm enough and doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp like the hottest setting on a typical blow dryer does; the spin air definitely added volume; the end result was no better or worst than using an old fashioned blow dryer and brush; a pro for traveling since the spin air might take up less space in a typical carryon bag then a blow dryer and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: not the easiest tool to use; the handle is thick and my hand felt very sore after use; this would not be the best tool for short hair; hair gets stuck, pulled and tangled and have to repeatedly go over the hair to fix the damage; it is an expensive product in my opinion; the cord is too short so i had to find an extension cord....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I don&#x27;t know yet if I will return this product based on its first performance, but I also dont think I would recommend it to a friend. If you have the money sitting around to shell out on this to try it out, then it might be worth trying and holding onto if the results are to your liking. This won&#x27;t forever replace my flat iron or blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bought this product about 3 years ago and after a few months of barely good results, I stopped using this product and dumped it in the back of my closet and about a year ago, I threw it in the garbage.handle is thick and my hand felt very sore after use; this would not be the best tool for short hair; hair gets stuck, pulled and tangled and have to repeatedly go over the hair to fix the damage; it is an expensive product in my opinion; the cord is too short so i had to find an extension cord....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I don&#x27;t know yet if I will return this product based on its first performance, but I also dont think I would recommend it to a friend.

    <li> I have extremely thin blonde hair. To top it off it is completely unmanageable. It is a wavy mess. Even when my hair is styled you can see my scalp. Especially on the top and the back. Some spots look bald. I&#x27;ve tried several styling products and treatments. Some things worked better than others but at the same time they make my hair feel terrible and still left my hair looking thin and balding. I like to play with my hair so I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t require a volumizing cream or gel. This is it! It hides all the bald looking spots and gives a ton of volume! It is a smidge time consuming. Since I have the wavy friz going on I have to blow dry, run a quick flat iron over it and then use the styler. BUT it is soooo worth it. When you hate your hair and you find something that actually works.. Its definitely not worth complaining about the extra 10 minutes. I hope they never stop making this product. PERFECT for very thin hair!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve never written a review for a product before, and trust me,  have made many an Amazon purchase.  I love this contraption.  I have fine hair (but tons of em...) that has absolutely NO body on its own.  If I blow out my hair, using a large, round brush, using the heat then cool method, I have body and bounce that lasts all day... otherwise, flat right away.  To do this, I have had to clip up sections of hair at a time, to keep the top hair off of the section I am working on, working my way to the top. It&#x27;s not easy to get the ends to stay around the brush, it takes forever, and it&#x27;s difficult to spin while drying.  Enter the Infiniti Spin Air Rotating Styler!  This thing does a fantastic job!  It takes a bit longer than a high power blow dryer does, but I must confess that most times I use both... which, in my opinion, is genius &#x3D;).  I hold the spinner in one hand, and my standard blow dryer in the other.  My hair dries extra quick, and allows me to set in my style with my blow dryer&#x27;s cool button.  My hair is full of bounce and shine, and holds its body all day long.  The ends are smooth, eliminating the need to use a straightener.  I noticed some complaints about this thing weighing a lot, but honestly, it weighs quite a bit less than my blow dryer... maybe I&#x27;m just tougher than some???  I would give it a full 5 star rating if the spinning feature worked on the cool setting...Anyway, I love, love, love this thing.  Would buy it again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> I am not absolutely positive how I feel about the Spin Air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was \\&quot;OMG it&#x27;s huge, awkward and is going to tangle my hair into a mess!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it definitely IS a huge device which if you need to use for a length of time (if you have really long or thick hair) it gets to be very awkward and your arm gets tired and achey, as well as your hands. It is very thick/fat and uncomfortable to use after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is really long (mine is past the bra strap) you have much greater tendency to tangle if you are not absolutely precise and accurate with your movements, positioning and control of the brush .. not to mention you have to precisely control the spinning by pressing/holding the button in. It is definitely a task and something to get used to. Getting the back of your hair without tangling or running into other issues, when it is long, is definitely a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, the results are pretty good (they&#x27;d better be for all the effort involved!!!) BUT I can get the same results with less hassle, in less time, just by using my regular brush and hair dryer. With the Spin air, you DO still get fly aways if you do not use the right styling products and techniques. This device is not a cure-all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spin Air takes longer to dry your hair as well. It did for me anyway, but again my hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I cannot justify it&#x27;s worthiness. I mean, it is a neat idea, but it is expensive as an added \\&quot;tool\\&quot; when we already use a hair dryer to begin with. This isn&#x27;t something I could/would use everyday in place of my dryer and brush .. it is not easier, it is not a time saver and it provides no better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the type of person who likes extra gadgets to use every now and then and you don&#x27;t mind spending this amount of money, then sure, go for it. But, if you&#x27;re looking for a total replacement to your dryer and brush, do not buy this... or at least not at full price. I think the Spin Air should be around the $20-30 price range at most. That is just my opinion, but I don&#x27;t see anything amazing in it&#x27;s ability or in it build quality to justify the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would never recommend this for anyone with shorter than chin length hair - the round brush head is just wayy too big to be useful.s... or at least not at full price.

    <li> I have an older Conair ceramic-barrel brush type dryer that doesn&#x27;t spin, and have used that for quite awhile. So I&#x27;m comparing the Infinitipro with that. This one wins, hands down.      My old one is heavier, hotter (think \\&quot;pain\\&quot;), and harder to use than this gadget. These can work without a tremendous amount of heat, so no more OUCH-ing here and less hair damage, plus the cool-down button is always a plus to set the curl. I&#x27;m also finding the added volume lasts longer... no idea why. Your hair should be just a little damp when you use this -- possibly a problem for people with thick hair, but you can always do a light regular blow-drying first. (I&#x27;ve never thought of these as my primary blow-dryer anyway -- merely styling tools. I can get away with towel- and air-drying for 15 minutes before using this.)      There&#x27;s no tangling hazard with this. The whole brush is quite soft, too -- no hard teeth poking out. It works like my older one EXCEPT you get that nice little tug when you press the Spin button that pulls the unit closer to your scalp (again, without burning it). I was pleased with the results at the very first use, after thinking it would take some getting used to. Also the placement of the air filter on the Infinitipro makes it less likely to be blocked by your hand, which is a hazard with my older one. And the brush section fits in a nice little sleeve that protects it from dust and crud.     (Even better is that I got $20 off this with a \\&quot;Beauty\\&quot; discount that came through my Kindle With Special Offers. That thing has practically paid for itself with the great discounts it gives.)</li>
    <li> My hair length is just above my shoulders and it&#x27;s amazing how well this styler works.  Not only do I get a quicker dry and the fact that it is much quieter than a regular dryer, it styles much easier than working with a dryer and a brush. Once the styling is completed my hair feels silky and smooth and a very light feeling.</li>
    <li> I just like it. I was looking for a 1000 W styler but 500 W it&#x27;s okay. The item came on time and it&#x27;s in a very good condition. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought the InfinitiPro Spin Rotating Styler a couple of months ago. I live in a climate where it gets very humid in the summer. I have natural curly hair which gets even curlier in the humidity but I love the look of smooth hair and large bouncy curls. I decided to try this after watching a video review here on Amanzon. It gives me alot of bounce and body to my shoulder length hair. My hair is medium textured but I have lots of it so its pretty thick looking. I get the best results if I section off my hair and style it a small section at a time. Generally I towel dry my hair after my shower, get dressed, do make-up and then style my hair. My hair is damp enough to use this Styler but not so wet that it takes long to dry. Keep in mind that this product is a STYLER and NOT a dryer. I probably use 10 to 15 minutes doing my hair with this product. I would recommend combing out the bristles after each use to keep them clean. It comes with a really long cord and a protective cover for the brush. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product. It works great for me!</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for this gadget for years, a constantly rotating brush with hair dryer capabilities. Years ago she had a rotating brush without heat and loved it.  The spinbrush greatly reduces the time to dry and style her hair without the problem of burning herself on a hot curling iron. She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I had too high of an expectation from this after reading the reviews, but it really did not live up. I suppose it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do, but I get WAY better results with my hair dryer and a good quality round brush. This takes more time and just doesn&#x27;t get the same volume. It is a tad bit easier due to the fact that it&#x27;s a dryer and brush in one, but I&#x27;m sending it back due to it not getting quite as good results as the old fashioned way. My hair is fine but think, about shoulder length, and I use a round brush that has vinyl and boar bristles, I highly recommend one of that style.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but it doesn&#x27;t replace a hairdryer. It&#x27;s practical since you use one hand to do all the job. The hair that is straightened by Infinitipro is shiny and with volume. However; it&#x27;s not good for thick curly hair. It needs more watts, harder brush and thinner handle.</li>
    <li> I love love love this thing! I have long very curly hair and have battled my whole life with what am I going to do with my hair today?? It takes me about an hour and a half normally to straighten it - so most of the time it&#x27;s in an up-do. Now I just wash my hair - brush it, let it air dry about 15- 20 min, then I use this new brush and voila! It gives me gorgeous super shiny straight hair that I can flip out or curl under. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair looked so healthy. No more round brush and blow dryer going at the same time using up both hands trying to reach the ends of my hair at the back!!! NOTE&gt;it does take some getting used to but I found my grove with it after about 10 minutes. You get used to where the buttons are.</li>
    <li> So I was really excited to receive this item. Was waiting all day just to be able to use it and was disappointed in the end. I read reviews that it wasn&#x27;t hot enough for dry frizzy curly hair like mine but I gave the brush the benefit of the doubt.. Plus I really wanted it to work because I cannot for the life of me use a blow dryer and round brush. I just don&#x27;t know how to style my own hair unless its getting an iron and flattening it. I actually have a Conair flat iron and it&#x27;s awesome but it always leaves me hair smelling burnt and I hate that. This brush worked on the bottom half of my hair. It came out great after I put a bit of serum in it.. But when it came to the top half it just looks horrible. I tried brushing it through several times and it just does not come out right at all. So yeah just like the other girls said.. If you have that dry frizzy hair it&#x27;s not worth buying. I just hope I am able to get my brothers money back for buying this. Just a little side note.. I have the typical Hispanic hair. Again it works.. but it does not work wonders for my hair. Which is why I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;m going to have to stick to my flat iron.. &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> This is a nice brush but I don&#x27;t use it....it is too thick for me to hold onto....It does everything it says it does but not for chin length hair.</li>
    <li> My hair type: a little below the chin in front, tapering up to a tight stack in the back. Very fine, wavy, &amp; colored.  With a predominant curl cowlick in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Even with a few minor flaws, it still deserves 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great volume&lt;br /&gt;Great shine&lt;br /&gt;Brushes as it styles saving time&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Love that it does the work, rotating&lt;br /&gt;Cord length is good&lt;br /&gt;Completely straightened my wavy hair (little difficult with the cowlick in back)&lt;br /&gt;Not too hot, that your scalp get over heated&lt;br /&gt;Minimal chance of burning yourself, much safer than a straigtening or curling iron&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t heat the room up too much, First time I didn&#x27;t really break a sweat styling my hair, I usually cook when using a blow dryer in an already steamy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Great for flipping ends in or out.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, much easier than a round brush and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used 1-handed, if needed, especially medium short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Frustration-free hair styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Needs more power to dry hair quicker (this will most likely not replace you blow drier). The \\&quot;high\\&quot; is more like a medium) I did use it to completely dry my towel dried hair, but it did seem to tale longer than it should, but not horrible. It was also definitely work to over come my cowlick in the back. I recommend hitting your hair with a regular blow dryer first, then when it&#x27;s almost dry going in with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best for really short (&lt;3-4\\&quot;) hair (had a little challenge with the bottom of my \\&quot;stack\\&quot; where the stylist went in the trimmer, the barrel is pretty big, but it is doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little lag, wants to get that one last spin in after you release the button to stop the rotation, this can cause it to over tighten, on short hair, the hair just slips, on longer hair it causes pulling, allowing your wrist to rotate, reduces the pulling, or just tap the reverse button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you over load it, hair may spill off the side and potentially tangle up, especially longer (greater than chin length) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;Does not rotate on cool&lt;br /&gt;The cap protects the bristles, but doesn&#x27;t cover the end. it snaps in place, but can can slip down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for:&lt;br /&gt;Short to medium hair lengths (haven&#x27;t tried long hair)&lt;br /&gt;Elderly or people with difficulty using styling tools due to arthritis, shoulder mobility, or needing to style with only 1 hand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this in store and was always curious to try it. Looked online for reviews for it and looked good. Bought on Amazon and saved 25 bucks compared to Wal-Mart. The only thing is do not use this when hair is totally wet!!! Use in towel tried hair (80% dry) otherwise it&#x27;s going to be a a tangled mess. Way easier than using regular round brush and hair dryer. Styles my hair in 20 minutes and I have long fine hair. It&#x27;s easy to use! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> It was used only once,maybe for 5 minutes altogether. Flashes and sparkles after it was turned on inside it , then the rotating part sopped altogether. tried  it few times more to see if it works again, but to my relation disappointing it did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I have paid more than the price of the good for the delivery to Sydney, so it really cost me  buying just over 2 of this so called rotating styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally disgusted and shameful that i bought such a good for Christmas present in particular for someone so far from U.K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not thing this item deserve even 0ne star. however the delivery deserves 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that i gave this only one star because i had no choice of giving it nothing, bur ,i don&#x27;t understand how it was given 4 star on my review.</li>
    <li> I previously went to get blow outs and no longer need to, due to this tool!  My hair is only chin length in the longest areas and this still works great.  I wish they made a version with a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my regular hairdryer. It helps get the frizziness out. I use Redken Smooth Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner then I use a small amount of the Redken leave-in conditioner &amp; go to work using the rotating styler &amp; my regular hairdryer. It smooths the hair out. It usually leave a slight curl at the ends of my hair. It looks very nice. If I want the complete straight look I use a flat iron afterwards. It takes one pass per section of hair of the flatiron on Medium Heat to acheive the super straight look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel with this &amp; don&#x27;t ever want to be without one! It comes w/a plastic cover to go over the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have fine hair that has really become curly as I have gotten older (go figure!). My hair is highlighted. I would classify myself as having slightly less than average as far as quantity of hair. My natural color is a dark, ash blond (aka dirty dishwater blond).</li>
    <li> Bought this brush.  I found it too hard to use.  For thick hair it just wasn&#x27;t styling or getting the waviness out of it.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic. I don&#x27;t believe in the Tooth Fairy, UFOs, or the Mayan Calendar -- and I certainly don&#x27;t believe it takes three licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop. That being said, I was pretty hesitant to try this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, my hair was in a rut and I&#x27;m single, so I needed to turn my bad-hair situation around quickly. I ordered the Conair Infiniti Pro and figured if I didn&#x27;t like the results, I would return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real Talk: This is the best blow dryer, excuse me, hair styler, that has ever touched my locks! My hair has never been smoother or more voluminous. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for over two months and it has not disappointed -- it&#x27;s easy, my hair drys quicker and it feels and looks like \\&quot;salon hair\\&quot; all day, every day. It makes hair drying fun, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sampling of compliments you&#x27;re sure to receive after using the Conair Infiniti Pro: \\&quot;OMG GIRL, your hair looks killer.\\&quot; \\&quot;Your hair looks so healthy and shiny! I want it.\\&quot; \\&quot;You look really pretty today. Is something different with your hair?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO SUM UP: definitely purchase. It can&#x27;t hurt to try!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly hair and I really like this product. I usually let my hair dry most of the way and then use the spin brush to finish it off. It makes my hair have big curls and makes it very soft and smooth. You do have to be careful not to get your hair all tangled in it, but I would recommend this product to anyone who wants big, bouncy curls.</li>
    <li> I had this rotating air brush when I was a kid and absolutely loved it. It was so easy to do my hair, but then something happened to it and I wasn&#x27;t able to find it again until now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!! Its just like it was 20+ years ago. It rotates and doesn&#x27;t get tangled on my hair, all the heat settings including a cool selection, plus the bristles are soft but they polish the hair to make it shiny. It takes me only 30 minutes to get my hair straight with body with the Conair rotating air brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a small learning curve to it, but once you get the hang on it, then you will be able to blow dry your hair with this is no time! This is a time saver for me, and I love how soft my hair comes out! Even the ends are silky smooth! Its amazing. This works on short and long hair. I would say no shorter than ear length though since the hair would not be able to wrap around the rotating barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with long hair, this will NOT get tangled in your hair, it will rotate around the air brush with no problems. My hair is about 2 inches below shoulder length, and I can wrap my hair in the rotating brush while it is on all the way to my scalp without my hair getting caught or tangled. That&#x27;s what I love about this product, its so amazing and versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this on damp hair, I am unsure how it works on wet hair. I would suggest reading the instructions in the box, and to atleast towel dry your hair first before using on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who wants a quick blowdry, silky bouncy hair, and healthy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars all the way!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It takes time to get used to it but once you have it down you end up with great hair! i usually use the Sexy Hair- Big Sexy Blow Dry Volume Gel and it gives me beautiful volume! the only downer is that most likely you&#x27;ll tend to get lazy and not use it as much...</li>
    <li> Because the styler brush is so large it doesn&#x27;t work well with shorter hair. I am impressed with how easy it is to use. Also impressed with the fact that hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or tangled as I used it.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this item for those with at least shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;I would like this item if there were interchangable brushes to accomodate my shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered on a Friday and got it on Monday! Once you get the hang of the brush it&#x27;s easy to use. It was faster than using a curling iron and left my hair shiny and bouncy. I&#x27;ve purchased three curling irons in the past few months it hopes of giving my once curly hair some lift but nothing worked until I used the Infinitipro. Great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> This for me is to good to be true!! I just cut my hair to my shoulders, its been a while since its been this short, so I forgot that when it is short it means you need to actually style it....well I&#x27;m a wash and go type of person..so anything that makes my hair easy makes me so happy!!! I also have arthritis in my hands and wrists so I was a little nervous about this product...everything is heavy to me...so I bought it a couple days ago and so far it is the best investment I&#x27;ve made in a while!! it works so well! I used to have to blow dry my hair then straighten it or curl it...now I blow dry it most of the way which doesn&#x27;t take long now that its short...then I use the spin brush, it makes my hair shiny, and doesn&#x27;t burn it....also I didn&#x27;t find it heavy at all...its a lot easier then trying to hold a brush and hair dryer at the same time!! my hair looks like it does when I leave the salon!! I feel like I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product for a long time and here it is!!! so happy about it! hope this helps someone else!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with serious trepidation, since I have spent so much money over a long lifetime on hair gadgets that disappointed.  So, I viewed the purchase as acknowledged gamble. (BTW- I gambled more than I needed to, since it was much more expensive in the store where I found it than on amazon, so buy on amazon.)  Also, I am extremely clumsy and uncoordinated, so any product that requires the least amount of mechanical understanding or physical dexterity usually confounds me.  I guess I am a good person to test these things, since if I can use them anyone can unless they have a specific physical disability challenge.  It really is fairly simple to use. I just needed to remember to first get brush roller around hair before pressing the twirling button.  Pushing the twirling directions before you use will show you which way you want to use it.  Most people should be set after that.  In my case, occasionally when I change sides or positions, I have to re-check to make sure it twirls in the right direction, but even when it I erred, it&#x27;s not a major setback, you just go to the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;I found I could dry my hair faster, and make it look more smooth, shiny, and styled than when i struggled with a blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. It also has more body, but in a smooth styled way, not just pumped up frizz.I have fairly fine hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for those of you blessed with thick hair and lots of natural body, but I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time worrying about you guys ;-).  If you have an excellent hair dresser, as I do, you probably won&#x27;t look as good as when you walk out of the salon, but you will look a lot closer to that than you did before. I feel as though i can now walk out of the house with hair that is actually styled, not simply blow dried.</li>
    <li> I bought this styler in the hopes that it would give my fine hair some body and style.  It really doesn&#x27;t do anything besides blow dry the hair.  I think it will be great for people with thick or curly hair, it seems to be gentle on the hair but, sadly, I think I feel misled by the commercials and reviews.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, but had to give it three stars since the on/off button sometimes sticks and I am unable to shut it off unless I completely unplug it from the wall.  This also seems to mess up it&#x27;s low/high setting, and I am only able to select one.</li>
    <li> It is definitely worth it&#x27;s money - easy to handle and great results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was younger my hair used to be very sleek, but over the years got frizzier and hard to control - to be honest I just don&#x27;t have the time and patience to deal with it ... therefore I wear a ponytail for most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However with the Infinitipro Spin Air styler - you can watch the process from fizzy to smooth - strand by strand... AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I had a Revo rotating hair brush for years when the battery finally died and the charger along with it. I bought this in hopes of replacing it. The handle is uncomfortably big and it has no power when it comes to rotating my hair. It seems they were more interested in the hair drying portion and not so much on the rotating part. I returned this product for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a Roto Styler hair brush (rotates but no air) that I am pleased with. It&#x27;s not as good as my Revo was but I got it at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;Revo $120&lt;br /&gt;Roto Styler $20&lt;br /&gt;At least those are the prices I found when I bought mine.</li>
    <li> I have medium/long hair that is very straight.  This product gives body to my hair, but no curl whatsoever.  It does not get hot, which is better for the hair, but not good for a quick styling fix.  I wish it would get hotter, and have a smaller brush.  The product is great and does exactly as promised.  I&#x27;m not going to stop using it, but I&#x27;m using a curling iron with it.</li>
    <li> Love it, better then I expected. It is very fast to dry and gives you a professional finish.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to it is the thickness of the handle that you have to hold.</li>
    <li> It made a klutz like me into a hairstylist!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these brushes, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t last longer than six seven months.The first one lasted from December till June, the second one from August till now. Now I am back to square one. It works well till it lasts but it does not last. The quality is simply not very high. The brush cannot be divided in two so that you can take out the motor part and see if it can be fixed. I found a much better quality one that I used in Europe (by Rowenta) but I cannot use it in the States because of the power difference. I would rather pay a higher price and have a product that lasts rather than keep having replacing them or going through the pain of calling the company or having to ship it back and, in the meantime, being without a tool I need. . I have a very busy life and I need quality products. Please offer more choices with these spinning brush.</li>
    <li> I wish I had never wasted money on this. I bought it elsewhere and actually paid more. I have shoulder-length wavy hair. I hoped this would save a step and let me stop using a straightener. Even on high, it takes too long. The air doesn&#x27;t blow very forcefully. Also, the bristles are so soft that they don&#x27;t grab the hair. The brush just rolls around, barely going into the section of hair. After one use, the bristles were were bent out of shape. They looked like a cheap toothbrush, splayed out in all directions. I thought this was an affordable version of the Instyler. It doesn&#x27;t have the hinged section that clamps the hair section against the bristles. It might have worked if it did.</li>
    <li> I bought this spin air rotating styler in Sept. 2011 and  wound up giving it to my daughter so she could use it  on my granddaughters hair which is very long, fine, curly, and tangles easily. This spin air rotating styler helps to smooth her hair turning her curls into more manageable softer curls without tugging and pulling, which means she will sit still long enough to let my daughter finish her hair. This will dry hair, but slowly. It works better if you use on slightly damp hair to finish styling, or as a quick fix to redo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the original one I bought left with the kids I bought myself another one  when I missed using my old one. I like how it allows you to roll all the way up to the roots to give height and fullness. You can curl your hair, brush it straight, and it&#x27;s easy enough to use one handed even if it is a bit bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a cold air setting that you can use to set your style. The brush doesn&#x27;t rotate when it&#x27;s on cool.  The brush will rotate both ways with a click of a button for smoothing down your hair or rolling up to curl. The settings are high, low, and cool. Under the brush head are the buttons to control which way you want the brush to spin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is very soft and grabs the hair easily for you to style. I usually brush down to smooth and pick up the hair, then while it&#x27;s spinning I click the button over and it will spin the other way wrapping my hair into a large curl from the bottom up. I then click the cool button to set the curl and then I&#x27;m ready for the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice rotating styling brush, works very well on my hair and I would buy another if this one ever breaks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, basic rotating hot air brush at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very thick and long hair possibly Calor Brush Active will suit you better.</li>
    <li> My daughter tablet stopped working after 4 months it won&#x27;t charge or come on</li>
    <li> Love this product. This is my second purchase because I wanted one to stay home and have one in my travel bag! I have baby fine hair and when used in combination with a little root product, I get the volume I need. Love the spin action especially since &amp;#34;coordination&amp;#34; is not my middle name. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bought this a birthday gift for my girlfriend. She loves this Blower/Brush. It works great and she uses it every day. She has owned it for 4 months now and she had not had a single problem with the Blower/Brush.</li>
    <li> We expected more from this product. Articles and advertisements led us to believe that it would make beautiful, shiny waves when used on damp hair. It was awkward to use and left our hair full of static. With additional product, we could get the hair into acceptable shape but what&#x27;s the point? Traditional blow dryer and a round brush will remain our style tools of choice.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this item just a little over a year ago.  It was a little difficult to use at first, but then once I had the hang of it, it worked very well.  Now, a year later, it will sometimes spin, will sometimes need a bit of a jump start to start spinning, and in the reverse, will not spin at all.  It is as though something is blocking it.  I try to keep the brush head clear of hair, so I don&#x27;t know if some strays have been caught in the turn mechanism or what, but it is currently unreliable.  I only use it about twice a week, but I honestly thought it would hold up better.  I gave it 4 stars, because when it works, it  works great!  My hair is shiny and soft, and looks more put together than what I could do with a round brush and separate blow dryer.  I laugh that I am \\&quot;styling impaired\\&quot; but it&#x27;s the truth.  Styling does not come naturally to me, so this product was a life saver.  If anyone else has had this problem and knows how to correct it, I would love to know.  I am not tossing it, as I can still get it to work on occasion.</li>
    <li> love the way this dryer styles your hair as it dries. only drawback is would like to see one with a smaller diameter.</li>
    <li> Due to a malfunction in the third day of use, unfortunately I feel This product is not good and that currently affect the reputation of the site</li>
    <li> The brush part is way too big.  I think it would be great for someone with longer hair but I was very disappointed.  I would send it back but the box was thrown out.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair volume and nice waves.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome, easy to use hair care product I have ever used. Being hair brush/hair dryer challenged I never had luck using the two to do my hair.  I travel a lot and it is a pain to take my rollers with me whenever I travel. I ran across this after getting my hair cut and thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed.  It took all the friz out of my hair and the rolling brush worked like a charm.  If you are thinking about getting a hairbrush/dryer this is the product you will want to check out.  My hair is medium length and I had no trouble getting the hair to wind around the brush. Thanks Infinitipro for just making my life easier and my suitcase a little lighter.</li>
    <li> Great device! One minus: the bristles. If the brush had boar hair, that would make this a prefect hair-styling/drying tool!</li>
    <li> This product is very good, but I returned it back, because I got it as a gift for my wife who lives in Oman (Middle East) and there we don&#x27;t have 110V AC support. All power inputs are 220V AC, therefore, this device can&#x27;t be used if you are traveling overseas. One recommendation, that to include power input support for such products in the description.</li>
    <li> this works great and the price cant be beat!  I got the hang of it pretty quick just be careful to hold the handle tight or it curls up quick to your head. This is great for body!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have thick naturally curly hair. So easy to use and gives hair so much body while straightening it out. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great idea but; It can be improved upon. My hair got caught in it and then resulted in knots and alot of breakage. The large barrel is designed for long hair. I thought it would give my medium length hair a look of more volume however; it only gave me broken hair. Purchase this product if you have thick, long hair and you are very careful not to get your hair tangled in the spinner.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I was hesitant because the bad reviews scared me.  One point I read regularly was about the difficulty that of use.  I believe it&#x27;s best to have a few practice sessions to get used to the brush.  Also, there are MANY videos demonstrating using this brush on youtube by normal, everyday people.  So watch the videos and do some practicing...both when your hair is dry and when your hair is wet.  Some complained it was heavy. I did not find that the case at all. I found it lighter than my hair dryer (and I have a small dryer).  I think the hardest part is getting used to the rotation buttons.  In the beginning it was confusing and easy to run the brush in the opposite direction that I wanted or got it gets tangled in my hair.  But this is truly not the brushes fault.  It&#x27;s just a matter of practice!!!  Another complaint is that this brush does not work well for short hair.  If your hair is super short I could see this being the case but there are also people doing youtube videos with short hair. During your practice sessions take time and go really slow so you can learn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve used this brush everyone asks me if I just got my hair done.  Here is how I use it.  First I blow dry my hair so it is maybe 60% dry.  (Practice different levels of wetness to see what works for you).  Then I use a hair clip and make the back of my hair one big section, clip the rest on the top of my head. Dry the back of my hair.  Next I do another section.  I pull the next layer to dry by creating a section starting at my temples and running my fingers around to the back.  So I clip the hair higher up closer to the crown of my head.  So I have the back hair dry and now I&#x27;m working with this middle section.  I like working with small sections at a time maybe 1-3 inches wide of hair on the brush.  The smaller the section, the easier to work with.  Then I unclip the rest of the hair at the top of my head and dry that.  Hope you found this review helpful. I think using really good shampoo and conditioner are key as well.  My hair gets tangled super easily so I use a detangler too.  Have not yet used the heat proof spray they recommend.</li>
    <li> This brush I bought to to take to the US at first used an adapter that didn&#x27;t make it work so thought it would have to go back .But now have found out how to use it properly .It is quite different to the british version .But I&#x27;m sure it will work well when I get to use it in America</li>
    <li> I love love love this. I have thick hair and this drys it in no time. My hair is shiny and has a better controlled volume! a little loud like a blow dryer . But soo worth it. Better then a round brush!!</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday and love it. Very easy to use and tames my hair at the same time.</li>
    <li> Awful experience. Almost had to cut some hair to get it off.</li>
    <li> I have fine chin length hair and was worried that the barrel of this styler might be too large but it&lt;br /&gt;is great.  It is important to work on small sections at a time because overloading the brush will cause some hair to&lt;br /&gt;fall off the sides of the brush and get terribly tangled.  I like that there is various settings including a cool mode.</li>
    <li> not that magic as showed in the video or maybe I need to practice more... and the plastic fur on it easily pull off.....</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot go anywhere with this.  My hair is long and wavy and I have lots of it.  It has changed the way I do my hair after washing.  I used to just air dry it but now I love styling my hair with this.  My hair still ends up wavy or with big curls, but it is not frizzy.  This helps prevent tangles especially when I wake up in the morning.  I travel every week and this is always in my carry on.  It takes up space because it is by no means compact, so I might buy one to keep at home and one to leave in my suitcase that I leave at the hotel.  Instead of at least 30 minutes of drying my hair with a big round brush, I&#x27;m finished in 15 minutes or less.  Keep in mind, I have a lot of hair, so this is a major improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is it doesn&#x27;t hurt my wrists at all.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, just give it a try, it is a very good product.  I cannot go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> Hair styling escapes me.  This has made it doable. I am so happy to have it. Reading other reviews for tips also helped.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Revo as seen on TV for over 20 years have gone through a couple of them and paid far more money. I have been thinking about this hair blower for awhile since my Revo has died.  I was hesitant, have purchased similar types of products with no luck.  This product is fabulous.  I blow dry my hair with a hair blower just to get it somewhat dry, then I use this product.  It is so soft on the hair no tangles, leaves your hair full and shiny.  It seems like the rotator is slow but do not get discouraged it does the job.  Only wish I had gotten this sooner,  it also comes with a protector for the bristles.</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars because it is amazing for all types of hair!  The only thing that made it not five stars was the fact that the brush cover was a little hard to get off and now I can&#x27;t get the cover back on to protect the brush bristles.  Hair is also hard to remove from the brush without destroying the bristles even more.  I would recommend this to anyone trying to save a few bucks and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time on their hands.  This is close to perfection as anyone is gonna get for their hair.</li>
    <li> This brush works Ok on damp hair.  It&#x27;s not powerful enough to completely dry hair.  It takes a little getting used to. if I had paid full price, I probably would have returned it.</li>
    <li> My hair is...we&#x27;ll say a \\&quot;layered bob\\&quot; (?). I have bangs, long sides that angle from long in the front to short in the back.  My hair is similar in length of the video reviewer except for the sides.  Layers run from 2½\\&quot; to 6\\&quot;.  When I first used it I just dried my whole head bone dry with the roller in constant rotation mode and it made my hair very shiny, but also very limp and straight.  I like my hair wavy, and flippy in the back.  So after experimenting, this is what I discovered works for my hair and makes it full, wavy and still nice and shiny:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I use it on towel dried hair (though I hear most say they recommend nearly dry hair - very damp works for me)&lt;br /&gt;-For the back flip, I hold the top layers up and start with the bottom layers and work up while using the next tip&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t keep it in \\&quot;roll/rotate mode\\&quot;.  I roll it so that it catches the hair and then let go of the button and just hold it (that seems to create curl instead of straightening this way)&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t do it until everything is bone dry, but nearly dry - it seems to allow for bounce and curl that way.&lt;br /&gt;-I also don&#x27;t use the brush on all my hair through and through, I just focus on areas that need attention, lift, and curl and my hair still comes out pretty evenly dry in the end - just not bone dry, still has some moisture...and I don&#x27;t find it loosing style as it dries fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes 5-15 minutes depending on how cooperative my hair it that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this device and am so glad I took the chance and bought it!  I only give it a four star because I do think that, even though this works for me, a 1½ barrel would be ideal.  Maybe other additional barrel sizes would be better for others, too.  I hope they&#x27;re listening!  :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is just okay.  I wish it got a little bit hotter and blew air out more forcefully because it takes awhile to dry your hair.  I also think this is best suited for somebody with short to mid-length hair.  My hair is long and the rotating brush can&#x27;t rotate properly when you try to dry the entire length of the hair shaft.  It dries the lower half of the hair great and leaves a nice curl pattern.  Good product, but I would advise it for people with shorter to mid-length hair.</li>
    <li> Practice using this it can be confusing.  I do not see any great results, maybe someone else can get it to work for them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and it is the best styling brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does a great job.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> At first, never denied that its very good and my hair very soft and looks volume. Well done the design.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, its spoilt on the 2nd month. Thought to return it back but thinking the cost of courier fees might expensive than/ or similar compare a new one. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> With age my hair has gotten dry, and the hairdryer makes it worse. But my current style cannot air dry. I researched heated styling brushes, and decided on this one because it was ionic and rotated. I chose the right one for my hair. I have between wavy and curly hair, medium length.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The rotating brush turns in either, depending on which button you push on the handle, and it easily styles your hair. On high setting it dries pretty quickly. It is easy to hod and handle. It has 3 settings. It can be used with or without rotating the brush. It heats up immediately, just like a hairdryer, not like a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The brush does not rotate when on cool setting, only when on low or high heat settings. It would be even better if the brush could be detached and had a thinner brush attachment to make tighter curls.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, however, after only a few days I love how my hair looks, and it maintains the look all day. Also, I am already noticing that it is not as dry as when I used the hairdryer.</li>
    <li> It was great at first, however the brushes wear out in a matter of weeks and you don&#x27;t get the same results you started with.  They need to have additional brush heads that are interchangeable for this hair styler.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH TWO AND I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I dont like it , its not for long hair&lt;br /&gt;Make my hair complicated and not smoothy&lt;br /&gt;I hate it and i give it to my friend by free</li>
    <li> I think i should get used to it... it is not very beginner friendly...not sure if I have to experiment on my hair (and spoil it) to get used to this tool or leave it and not use it.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this product for awhile and due to budget reasons waited for the right price to buy. I tried it on my 7-year-old daughter who has very fine and curly hair. When I usually blow dry her hair, it still comes out a bit frizzy no matter what products I use. The Infinitipro left my daughter&#x27;s hair nice and straight with a lot of body minus the frizz. I then tried it on my hair, having the same hair type...same results! Very impressed, best buy!</li>
    <li> Good product I would like more air flow but understand there is only so much you can put into this small package. I really wish they would put a built in timer in these things to prevent being left on. As far as I can tell no one does this and until they do I&#x27;ll keep giving them a 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> Good, solid product.&lt;br /&gt;Takes some getting used to, in order to prevent your hair from getting caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;No major complaints</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, who is NOT skilled in hair styling AT ALL. She LOVES it! She says its VERY easy to use and makes it fast and easy to make her look great!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I use it every day.  It is much easier on my wrist than and regular round brush and separate dryer and this device fluffs my hair up nicely.  I now have short hair (2-3 inches) so I prefer the 1.5&amp;#34; brush.  My only request to the manufacturer is that they make the cold setting with a rotation, rather than just static.  It is difficult to change between rotation and cool (to set the curl) while using the brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is a pity that the option of cold air brush rotation. But everything else is great. I love my brush ...</li>
    <li> I am so terrible at styling my hair, but this spin brush can help anyone style their hair like a pro. I look like I got a salon blow out every time. My one suggestion: Definitely follow the instructions. This spin brush is going to take forever to dry wet hair. Like the directions say, use it on damp/towel dry (I hit it with my regular hair dryer for a few minutes first) before using it.</li>
    <li> I used this styler this morning after I washed my hair and I have never had my hair come out as soft or shiny as it did this morning. The style has held through the day also. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works this summer.</li>
    <li> I am honestly surprised with the positive reviews here for this brush. It&#x27;s great if this product actually made some people so happy.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium long, curly hair and I can&#x27;t use this product. It looks like the quality is not very good as there are gaps between the components of the brush where hair gets stuck and then pulled out while using it, making the whole process of blow drying painful. Also, it doesn&#x27;t create enough heat, so I need to use a regular blow dryer in parallel to actually dry my hair. The end result is not great, the hair at the top end of the brush gets all twisted and tangled, and there is no volume. I bought a rotative brush in Europe and I couldn&#x27;t believe what a big difference it made. Of course I can&#x27;t use it here because of the voltage differences. Why the producers in US can&#x27;t come with a better product, hard to understand. Anyway, back to the old brush and dryer :( Unless you have thin, short hair (in which case the brushes would be too big) don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I  got product today...and i am very disapoined ...when i press buttons for spinning after few seconds they stop spining i mean they both have same problem...i have to pres button few times to start it again and again only few seconds spining...i was very excited to get it but when i saw that it have that problemgot very sad...i can show a video of it also ....pls i need help what can i do ??????forgot to say that when i press button for test it is not working too.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I wore the first one out.  This is great if you have arthritis because it does all the work that your wrist usually does.  I do wish they made a smaller barrel, but this one works good for medium hair.</li>
    <li> Compared to other devices I have used, this heat and air flow were very wimpy, and the barrel was really wide</li>
    <li> Every girl should get one because it makes my life easy and usually I spending about hour doing my hair now it takes a few mins!</li>
    <li> a lot bigger than I thought it would be. But it works fine.</li>
    <li> I had never used a product like this before and after my first try it did a pretty good job of ruining my hair.  My carefully tended Clairol-treated hair used to be shoulder length, but now only a small section of it is. The heat combined with the tight winding is deadly! The \\&quot;styler\\&quot; is really tricky to use at first and by the time you think you&#x27;ve mastered the technique the damage has been done.  I&#x27;d kick, scream and cry if i thought it would do any good.</li>
    <li> I like this hair brush combo dryer. It&#x27;s great for adding volume to your hair and softens hair too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walmart a year ago and LOVE IT. I have very fine, color treated, shoulder length hair.  I dont use this as a blow dryer, I still do that separately but I use the spin brush right after its dry.  My hands are no longer tired from trying to curl the back or get the right flip, I just let the  brush do all the work for me and I am done in just minutes with straight, full bodied hair.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> I like it it does work but not as good as I expected .. If u have a thick hair try another product .</li>
    <li> I am such a klutz, i can&#x27;t hold the hair dryer and brush ou at the same time.  i was afraid i would get my hair stuck in it, but it is very easy to use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say how much i LOVE this hair dryer!!  I have super curly/frizzy hair and when I use this my hair looks like i just had a blow out.  I would wait until your hair is fully dried...either towel, air or blow dried.  then use this to style it.  if your hair is wet it&#x27;ll take a lot longer.  i usually wash my hair at night...put in leave in condition and go to bed.  wake up and style with the dryer</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a similar product that died.  I do not use it to dry my hair but to style it.  It would not work to dry my hair which is fine but I have a lot of it.  However, I use it when my hair is dry or at least 80% dry and it makes it smooth but not flat like a flat iron does.  I love how it spins for you.  I have tendonitis in my hands and this feature is great, it does not tangle my  hair.  FYI - my hair is just past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I bought this hair bush. It is very innovative and effective in helping you create volume and gloss of your hair. I watched a youtube video and quickly learned to use the spin. I just wanted to spread the words so that more people can benefit from this tool!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!!! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I am new to thin curly frizzy hair, seriously it just happened in my mid 30&#x27;s. I have bought serums and sprays, I think I finally found my gold!  I sprayed my hair down with water and used the rotating brush.  My hair feels like silk and I have volume out the top which is thinning. I am going to love this.  Its a little bulky and havent tried straight up drying after showering, but after wetting my hair down, it definitely takes over half the time of my hair straitener.</li>
    <li> Only giving this 3 stars because it was a gift for my sister and I have not heard anything positive or negative from her about it yet; though I did notice she already has it out of the box and in use, so it must not be a bad item. Definitely like finding it for half price on here compared to the stores, though.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have fine, thin, shoulder length hair. I have been using this styler for about a week now.  I really like how shiny and healthy my hair looks when using this styler. My hair, however, doesnt look as full or have as much body after using this styler as it normally does with a simple blow dry and large barrel curling iron. I cant decide which is faster in the mornings. I will keep practicing- maybe there is more of a trick to it. Im still getting used to using it in my left hand to do the other side of my hair.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give volume my hair root. It can blow dry your damp hair but it&#x27;s just heavy tool to use as a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Simply it doesn&#x27;t work as a styler!</li>
    <li> I love it... I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time getting ready most days..... This works quickly and efficiently.... And my hair looks great in 10-15minutes..... Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it sucks! in the ad they say this product can make your hair smooth and curly, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all! it makes my hair even more awful, and still straight, not curly at all! if you&#x27;re looking for a hair curler, don&#x27;t buy this one</li>
    <li> This thing is great!  But you have to learn how to use it.  Don&#x27;t know how many times I pulled my own hair not being careful and taking time.</li>
    <li> I am an absolute novice at doing my hair, but once I got the keratin treatment I need to follow through and blow dry my hair for sufficient polish.  This brush does all the hard work.  My friends  have actually asked me where I get my hair done and wanted to touch it because it&#x27;s so shiny.</li>
    <li> So far, I am loving this product. It is easier to use than a round hair brush and hair dryer. It works great for my chin length hair. The result is a shiny and smooth style. The price was reasonable and the free shipping was a bonus!</li>
    <li> Not suitable for India. Additionally, stepdown transformer needed. Should have been inbuilt one...it stopped (failed) working after 6months....I was cheated.....the company lost its trust on customer.....very very bad product and service. Don&#x27;t even dream to buy this.....</li>
    <li> Did not like it.  It pulled on my fine hair and didn&#x27;t work well with it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this product.  The first one lasted a few years.  I really like the product but it only lasted two months.  The spinning was spinning in slow motion.  Conair does have a warranty but I had to send 7.00 for return shipping and I had to pay 10.99 to ship it to them.  That&#x27;s 17.99.  The item costs 37.99.  I&#x27;ll do it this one time, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> This thing does not get hot enough to help my hair, I used it on damp hair and it took forever to get it dry, the brush kept tangling my hair and it left it super frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this. I can use this one hair tool in place of a blow dryer, flat iron and curling iron!</li>
    <li> If you have very curly hair you can still use this for finishing and styling but not for blow drying straight. If you have a fine/ wavy hair you can use this only tool for blow drying, very easy to use and gives an awesome shine .</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I even bought it in a different voltage. I travel a lot to Europe and I bought one for travel. It take a little time and practice to get used to the spinning, in the beginning you can get your hair tangled up, but just push the reverse button and you&#x27;re good. It smoothens your hair, takes the frizz out and leaves it healthy and shiny even when the humidity is high. It feels like it polishes your hair. It doesn&#x27;t overheat your hair, it doesn&#x27;t heat up to a temperature that it becomes damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however pre-dry my hair a bit, because if you use this straight out of the shower, it takes forever. It has the best result, because you do every little hair when all of you hair is wet, but it just takes to long. So I quickly blow dry my hair with a regular blow dryer and style with the InfinityPro. It leaves you with wonderful bouncy hair, very glamourous.</li>
    <li> it works, but it takes forever to dry my hair I tried but eventually I got tired of it and got back to a regular blow dryer. For someone with short short hair and not a lot of hair this might work.</li>
    <li> I recently changed my hairstyle, from long and one length, to barely shoulder length and layered.  the hairdresser worked magic, but of course I just couldnt figure out how to get it looking as polished.  This dryer is perfect.  It gives my hair the exact amount of shine &amp; body, and if i feel like it I can still break out my curling iron after, but most times I don&#x27;t.  It brought me back to loving my new hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it would eliminate having to curl my hair but the brush barrel (2 inches) is too big for my hair which is of medium length.  It dries my hair but doesn&#x27;t put any amount of curl in it so I am still needing to use a curling iron.</li>
    <li> I am bald, but my wife is not. She absolutely loves this thing. It give her a &amp;#34;Just left the salon look&amp;#34; every time. What a brilliant idea. Hot air whilst rolling and shaping the hair. Perfect for bob style hair.</li>
    <li> this is a curling Iron and dryer in one, without burning your hair. this fluffs your hair, makes it look like you have lots of hair.(this is for woman like me who have thin, fine hair,) with a little boost and a air brush you can look like a beauty shop style daily</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this. I have straight flat hair that has gone totally silver. I need for it to turn under at the ends just below chin length all around. This not only gives it great volume all over, it mades my hair very shiny and turns the ends under and the heat setting let you choose if you are drying it while stying or if you are just redoing it the next day. It is so good, it will make your hair do exactly the same thing the next day and still look great. Amazing and so easy to use one handed. Greatly exceeded my expectations. Large barrel gives curves and stops frizz. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> I guess my hair is the right length, a bob just below the ears.  I love the rotating styler and the heat to give my hair the lift and shine that it gets from the Infinitipro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends and some have already purchased it and like it also.</li>
    <li> Returned it, maybe i just couldn&#x27;t get the hang of it, but didn&#x27;t seem to do much, not hot enough to dry or curl, so just an extra product i don&#x27;t need</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever!!  Leaves my hair smooth and silky, and hair drying goes so quickly with this thing!</li>
    <li> It requires blow drying first.  I only learned this after watching a few videos on you tube.  A professional instruction video would be helpful.  It does leave my thin, dry, curly hair shiny and straight.  This only happened after I found a few videos that demonstrated the process.</li>
    <li> Cut my drying, styling time in half. Smooths my normally wavy frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Woulr recommend for any one who bloy dries, flatirons &amp; styles everyday.&lt;br /&gt;The high setting could be a little more powerful, but I have thick coarse hari-- and still only takes 15-20 from start to finish.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use since the buttons to rotate in either directon are right at your index finger&lt;br /&gt;It also works well as a hair dryer</li>
    <li> Whenever I take my time and use the Spin Styler everyone thinks I&#x27;ve gone to the salon and had a professional blow out.  There is a learning curve but once you get a feel for it you can dry your hair rather quickly.  I have medium length thin hair and it takes less than 10 minutes, after a thorough towel dry, to get a great all day hairstyle with minimal product.  I admit that I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as other hairdryers, I don&#x27;t know if there is a reason behind it but it would seem to me that more heat would make drying your hair faster but it could be damaging etc. The only thing I would change is for it to get a little hotter.</li>
    <li> Push air is weak and it&#x27;s not suitable for drying hair.  I want to get 220 volts but I didn&#x27;t aware of the options.</li>
    <li> Ok, first I&#x27;d like to say this is not a bad product. I returned it because it is not really mention for long hair. And, you still have to pre-dry your hair a bit before you start. It does add volume. It is really not a time saver either.</li>
    <li> Good idea - but heavy.  It&#x27;s difficult to hold with one hand.  It would be great if there were a handle for the top (like corn cob holders 😉) so you could hold it well.</li>
    <li> Tangles your hair, makes it look frizzy too. Hard to get used to which side to rotate for the wanted style.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! I&#x27;ve used a cheaper similar styler, and it doesn&#x27;t compare! Was really impressed!</li>
    <li> I have shorter hair....this is a joke! Takes forever to dry your hair and the end result...terrible!</li>
    <li> Used this on my 8 year olds hair. It&#x27;s always frizzy! Smoothed it out quick and looked great all day</li>
    <li> Good  styler wish it was  smaller  I have short hair</li>
    <li> I have used it just once but the final look was really nice. It easy to use, but it just hair is not too long I would recommend the smaller one.</li>
    <li> works a expected but because i have a lot of hair it gets stuck and i have to use more sections than i normally would with a regular dryer and round brush. id say this would be best for those with fine/normal hair</li>
    <li> If they were metal bristles it would have worked on my hair.Bought it and don&#x27;t use it...very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not so sure about this product. I&#x27;m completely inept when it comes to blow drying my hair, and I hoped maybe this styler would help. My hair is super long and fine, but there&#x27;s lots of it. I made sure to have it almost completely dry before I started out, but it did tangle in my hair a bit. My biggest complaint is that the bristles are low quality and too soft. They&#x27;re not rigid enough to grip the hair, and they end up leaving little indent marks in my hair if I roll it all the way up. I think it probably works best on medium length to medium long hair. The brush is too big for short hair, and the bristles are too soft for extra long hair. I&#x27;m not ready to give up on it yet, and I might just need to get the right technique down.</li>
    <li> It will be perfect if I had my hair shoulder length but since is a little longer it takes a long time ti dry. It does leave your hair smooth and shinny.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, so I thought that I finally found an air brush that would work well with my thick, course, shoulder length hair. However, I was wrong. Unless I only brush very small strands at a time, it stops rotating. I have to constantly reset the switch. To use it with smaller strands of hair takes almost one hour, and I really don&#x27;t see much lift (big hair). After using this for a few weeks, I went back to my usual blow out and flat iron. I have talked to other women who have thin hair and they love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair appliance!  I have long, fine hair that does not look good if I let it air dry.  I normally blow dry with a round brush which takes a lot of time, is tiring and makes me feel like a sweaty mess.  I used the styler on wet hair even though a lot of reviews said not to; I figured why not?  While it did take at least twice as long to completely dry my hair with just the styler, my hair looked great.  It was also so much easier being able to do this with one hand instead of wrestling with 2 different things and constantly switching hands.  I loved how soft and shiny this made my hair look.  I didn&#x27;t get the volume that some people might have gotten but that&#x27;s probably because I used zero product.  I also loved that it didn&#x27;t break off little pieces of my hair while I used it.  The rotating part took some getting used to.  I didn&#x27;t realize that you have to apply some resistance or it will roll your hair right up to your scalp, my bad!  Like many other reviewers said, it&#x27;s impossible to tangle your hair up in this thing though.  My hair tangles just putting my jacket on so this was a welcome change.  My hair is very fine and I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it staying in the bristles.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product.  It may not be a time saver but it&#x27;s definitely a wrist saver and a healthier alternative to a blow dryer/round brush combo.</li>
    <li> My wife likes a hairdryer with an attached brush.  There aren&#x27;t many of these available.  The brush on this one is nice and soft.  She says that this hairdryer could use a little more power, but overall it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have a chin length layered bob with fine slightly wavy hair and this works great. I found that as long as I keep tension on my hair while the brush is rotating that my hair does not tangle. It take about 5-10 minutes to style my hair when it is moderately damp. I use it with root volumizer, mousse, and thickener. I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I normally have a little frizz in my hair and this smooths it out and transforms the frizz curl to body curls. Plus, it gives my hair a shiny, smooth appearance.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have about 20 inches of long, thick hair, and a full blowout takes me about 30 min and a lot of arm/wrist work. The Spin Air reduces the number of tools needed to 1, and once you figure out how to use it, it makes a great tool for on-the-fly touch ups.  This is one of my favorite purchases... I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift for my birthday and I love it. My hair is thin, curly and very wavy. It can take an hour and a half with other stylers to style my hair and they damage it (flat irons). This styler at first was difficult to use and scary because it was pulling my hair out and getting tangled. Hurt a bit too, but after a try or two I got used to it to using it and learned how to properly use it with no pain or hair pulling. Does make your hair shiny, and VERY smooth. So easy a 15 year old can use it (me).&lt;br /&gt;Does come with the cover for the bristles to protect them and the cord on the styler rotates (adjusts,moves,?) which is very useful; doesn&#x27;t bend or fold from angling it to style my hair. End result lasts for a good time and holds, not worried about sleeping on it and ruining it. Hair doesn&#x27;t smell damaged or burnt - bleh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t too expensive because it&#x27;s not a miracle brush or anything, lol, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It does smooth out my hair but I was hoping I could get better curls, but then again, my hair is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;Like the reviews I had read, it is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair or hurt your face (very soft bristles)</li>
    <li> This is great for blow-drying to eliminate frizz! It is a little time-consuming, but smoothes my hair out well! I scared myself once when I thought I tangled my hair, but luckily the spin setting is reversible!</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I have thick wavy hair. I followed the rules. I took small sections of hair at a time, hair damp  and if did not work.  I had to use my old hair dryer to get the job done. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. Horrible. Not worth it. Waste of money. I would give it no stars but to share info I had no choice.</li>
    <li> air power sucks and my hair gets tangled. definitely the worst purchase ive ever made from amazon! does not work well at all if your hair is thick, and the heat power sucks!</li>
    <li> Great hair styling tool that I use every morning and in just a few minutes my curly hair is smooth.</li>
    <li> I have medical problems which makes using my hands difficult.  I drop things alot...I was especially dropping my round brush hair dryer while trying to give some form of style to my hair.  As I cannot hold things for very long especially a blow dryer, I have learned to wash my hair the night before leaving it towel dried but wet and I put it in a pony tail on the top of my head...in the morning my hair is just damp enough when I take it down that I do not have to use a BLOW dryer on it but I am able to hold onto the spinning brush dryer MUCH better since I am not trying to use my wrists to get my hair onto the round spinning brush dryer.  It takes me a minimum amount of time, with a minimum amount of pain to my hands and wrists and if I can take it slow, I almost never drop the dryer anymore and I have success with my hair looking great...however...I did not like my hair the very first time after styling with this spinning brush....it took practice...and experimenting you might want to do when you may not be going out or somewhere important.  It would be helpful if the brush came if other sizes as well...and hopefully soon it will come in other sizes.  Using the above method...my hair never has been damaged by this spinning air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I did hate about this product and I do believe the designers could fix with almost no problem...you have to be careful when drying your hair with how much hair you allow on the spinning wheel.  If hair is too near the end of the spinning brush it will get caught in the edge of the endcap and pull and entangle your hair and this is also where if you allow too much hair on the spinning brush it will roll off the end twining(sp?) your hair into tangles.  At the other end of the spinning brush is an area where the spinning brush is attached to the handle... if you allow too much hair on the spinning brush and it get close to the bottom part of the spinning brush...your hair will get tangled and pulled alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for me because I have problems using my wrist and hands.  It DOES need a few tweeks in the design but it is allowing me to live a more normal life even with my medical problems and not have to have hair that looks like a frizzy mop.</li>
    <li> I really like this styler. I have fine mostly straight hair and when I use this it gives my hair a smooth shiny look. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t expecting is that I have to dry my hair with a regular blow dryer first unit its about 80% dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product to come out in the USA ever since I saw it in the UK and borrowed one from a friend. What a great idea! I have long, layered, highlighted hair that will frizz in places if I don&#x27;t blowdry carefully and/or use a large barrel curling iron or straightener. With this dryer I can leave it to airdry for a bit, then just finish it off piece by piece and it doesn&#x27;t get snarled up in the brush. Also, I can give it a quick re-dry the next day if I don&#x27;t need to wash it all over again. It is not a quick dryer, it is a styling tool, so you should not expect a fast flow of air as some others have commented although notice the UK version does actually have a stronger airflow,  but this is true of all 110v. hairdryers so I am not as disappointed as I might otherwise be. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t seem to impact the smoothing and volume-increasing impact of the styler.  4 stars! I&#x27;d give it 5 if the barrel was ceramic and the bristles were natural. Pretty good value for $40 and Prime shipping, though!</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work well with fine hair. And the heat can&#x27;t be adjusted. I felt it too hot.</li>
    <li> I love and recommend this hair brush to all my friends.  Everybody on my family has one and love it too.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this item a try after all the reviews. Let&#x27;s just say that this product isn&#x27;t for me. I have really wavy hair and was disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair which is difficult to style. I purchased this because a friend recommended it. At first it was a little awkward to use but after 2-3x I was a pro and my hair has never looked better!! It gives your hair that healthy, shiny look that you get when you leave the hair salon and a pro blows it out for you. Never would you think you could accomplish this on your own. This product is a MUST for anyone who wants their hair to look fantastic every day!! I LOVE IT! Will never use another blow dryer besides this again. It dries and styles together. Who could ask for anything more?</li>
    <li> I gave the product four stars because you can&#x27;t really use it if you&#x27;re hair is dry.  It presumably ( I have not tried) only works on damp hair.  When I did try it out the spin function worked fine and it blew hot hair (can blow cool hair too).  So I think this product will work better on hair that has been somewhat blow dried already and this is used as a finishing tool (think of blow outs at the salon).  If you&#x27;re well versed in using a round brush you may not need/like this but it&#x27;s good for those of us who cannot operate a round brush without getting it caught in our hair. Hope this helps others.</li>
    <li> Round brush + hair dryer.  I recently came into ownership of what is possibly one of the best inventions for hair styling in the last ten years.  All those years spent trying to round brush your own hair so you could look like you walked out of a salon?  Wasted once you try this gadget.  It does it for you!&lt;br /&gt;As a cosmetologist myself, I can vouch that round brush styling is a craft that takes a while to master.  Now, you don&#x27;t even have to try -- just partially dry your hair using your regular hair dryer.  Before it is completely dry, start using the spin dryer on sections of hair until you have finished your hair.  Easy peezi.  You may have seen this on TV before, and - yes - it works EXACTLY as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat is that because the barrel is equivalent to a 2&amp;#34; round brush (that&#x27;s a big one) it works best on medium to long hair.  I love it for my hair, which is just above shoulder length.  It doesn&#x27;t work for the back of my head, since I have an A-line cut with shorter layers in the back with longer length in the front.  That said, I use this tool every single time I dry my hair now.  It adds volume and curl that sticks around until the next shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This retails for $59.99, but you can find it on sale at Walgreens every now and then for $49.99 or at Amazon for around $39.99.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Conair, for coming up with this handy tool!  Now... if you can just make a smaller size in this, say... 1.25&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> After I get my hair cut its usually impossible to replicate what my hair stylist had done at the salon.  The whole blow dryer + round brush thing is impossible for me to do at home!  Its like I don&#x27;t have enough hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great replacement for that.  I blow dry my hair about half way and use this to finish.  Its easy enough to use that I can use it in either hand.  Its great that it rotates two ways.  It doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  I use it on high heat and it takes less than 10 minutes to finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this curler!!!!  It spins by itself so all you have to do is hold it while it smoothed all the frizzzzzz out of your hair!!!!  It&#x27;s light and easy to use!!!!</li>
    <li> It works best on partially dried hair. It does shine, straighten and add body, but a time saver it is not.  The size of the brush makes it useless on shorter hair and if it is thick, find something else.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> Love his product, it dried my hair faster and gave me lots of volume to my hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and tends to dry very frizzy.The Infitipro Spir Air Rotating Styler helps me to avoid the frizzies. It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my fingers or hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thisw the the best product ever....easy to use.  You are holding one item verus a hairdryer and a brush.  I take it with me on vacation.  I talk about with my friend and three have purchased this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product, a gift. It s doing its job and working good as well. Item arrived on time and happy</li>
    <li> I purchased this Conair styling brush at the Amazon sale price recently after my old faithful burned out after many years of use.  Easy to use, the brush can be used as a motorized spin which grabs the hair with no tangling after releasing the spin action button.  This product leaves your hair shiny and swing free after use.  My hair is shoulder length and thick and this brush styles my hair with no fuss and my hair feels light and smooth similar to a beauty shop visit.  I prefer to towel dry my hair before use as the brush runs through the hair with more ease.  I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who likes styling longer hair at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She says it is one of the best rotating dryer brush she has. It took her few times to learn to use it for styling and get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading a couple of reviews saying it was o.k. for short hair, what a waste of money,the barrel is far to large for hair shorter than your shoulders.</li>
    <li> If you have really short hair (i.e. hair that won&#x27;t entirely wrap around this brush) this might be for your...but why would one someone with really short hair buy this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a hair length that will wrap around this brush you&#x27;re in for a major tangle and then major hair loss trying to extricate your lovely locks out from this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed at your own risk.</li>
    <li> The Infinitipro is a great value for the money &amp; it does the job; blow dry&#x27;s &amp; smooths hair, all in one!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It&#x27;s honestly probably one of the best purchases that I&#x27;ve ever made, and it was so much cheaper than some of my other hair tools.  I have wasted so much on high-end blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons/wands, and none of them made my hair look as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat irons made my hair look unnaturally straight and lifeless, the curling irons left clamp marks, and the curling wand left me looking like I had been electrocuted.  I also just could never master using the blow dryer with a round brush, so I gave up on that pretty quickly.  I used all top-rated products, so I know this just shows how hopeless I am when it comes to styling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, someone on a forum suggested that I try a hot air brush.  I never knew such a thing existed, but I was definitely happy to try.  I figured that I would be one of those people writing about how their hair got all tangled up in it, and after I thought about it for awhile, I figured that it would probably end up being another useless purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, I was so wrong.  I almost cried when I saw how good this makes my hair look.  I&#x27;m finally getting the flipped-under ends that I&#x27;ve always wanted, and my hair is full of body and without frizz.  I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t know this existed...I could have been enjoying my hair so much more if I had known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also hoping that this will cause less damage over time than my flat iron did, since most stylists say that flat irons and curling irons tend to be worse for your hair.  I am a little bit worried about the rotating brush pulling some of my hair out over time, but I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence of that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this thing twice so I am by no means an expert yet, and I still get my hair caught up in it when I try to do too much hair at once.  If I don&#x27;t try to rush it and use smaller sections, it works beautifully and my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle in it at all.  Also, I am still getting just a little bit of frizz at my crown, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my lack of skill (I had the same problem with my flat irons, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I do pre-dry my hair with another blow dryer, and then I use this when my hair is about 80% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  I love this styling tool, and I wish that I had found it a lot sooner.  If I can use it without getting my hair in a huge knot, anyone can - because trust me, I&#x27;m a disaster when it comes to styling.  I actually bought my first one at Wal-Mart, but I bought two more here on Amazon to use as backups so that I will hopefully never have to be without one.ing just a little bit of frizz at my crown, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my lack of skill (I had the same problem with my flat irons, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I do pre-dry my hair with another blow dryer, and then I use this when my hair is about 80% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  I love this styling tool, and I wish that I had found it a lot sooner.

    <li> I have fine hair and the problem I find with this product is it tends to make my hair frizzy.  It does curl, but can tangle the hair if the wrong button is pressed in the opposite direction by mistake.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Wish I bought the one with the smaller barrel or that the barrels are interchangeable.  Not had a real problem with hair catching (every now and then a strand or two will get caught up but not bad).</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry your hair. Ceramic technology and ionic conditioning? It gave me split ends every time I used it! Doesn&#x27;t give any curl, bounce, or lift. Pretty weak! Best for people with little to no hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have long hair and my arms always get tire by the time I&#x27;m blowing drying the top back of my head. Arms ache as I&#x27;m trying to pull my round brush all the way down the tip of my hair in order to fluff it and curl it. Now I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore!! This spin styler solve my achy arm problem. And the ion technology REALLY does make a difference. I don&#x27;t understand the science behind it, I just know that it DOES make my hair smoother. The heat setting is not very hot, so it take a few minutes longer to dry than your normal hair dryer. I suppose that&#x27;s part of keeping your hair healthy by not over heating it. I haven&#x27;t had any issues tangling my hair in it. It&#x27;s a really terrific spin air brush and I love it. It does what it advertises to do!</li>
    <li> Love this item!&lt;br /&gt;Works great with shorter hair. No tangling. Dries and mildly styles.</li>
    <li> You will want this rotating styler. It works so well! It&#x27;s so practical</li>
    <li> I have had two of these. The first one isn&#x27;t burned out, but is getting slower so I got a second one.  I used it probably three times a week for 14 months before I replaced with the new one so I was happy with that.  I have wavy hair that tends to be frizzy.  I use this and Fekkai  Brilliant Glossing and my hair is wonderful - full of body, no frizz, like a advertisement.  I never thought I say that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, long and layered.  I try to get a lot of water out of it with microfiber towels, dry my roots with a hair dryer and then blow it till it is just damp, then I section my hair, and use this for the final drying and smoothing.  I usually dry a little more with my hair dryer after.  This has cut down on my time considerably and given me better results than anything I have tried - and that is almost every hair tool ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it and will make sure I always have an extra in case they stop making it.</li>
    <li> The spinner works intermittently, and sometimes even starts spinning&lt;br /&gt;by itself without the weird button pushed.  The handle is WAY too big&lt;br /&gt;for my hand.  I can&#x27;t imagine who invented this, but it was not a woman.&lt;br /&gt;The idea was great; the execution was poor.  Also it does not blow hard&lt;br /&gt;enough to dry my hair, and I have thin, fine hair.  Like I said, it was one&lt;br /&gt;of those great ideas that might work if the right person went to work on&lt;br /&gt;a redesign with a smaller handle that fits a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
    <li> Like the product, convenient to use and give me curves I want. But have to learn/practice how to use</li>
    <li> My frizzy hair is now silky and shiny thanks to this miracle device! I&#x27;ve wanted this hair since 1963 and I FINALLY got it!  I have a couple of tips for users. Before I use the Spin Air Styler, I do a quick and rough blow dry on my hair with a regular blow dryer to the barely damp stage. This dries it much faster than the Spin Air Styler.  But the great thing is, the pre-blow-dry doesn&#x27;t take more than about 90 seconds because I blow dry it WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER TO SMOOTH IT OR STYLE IT. I don&#x27;t even use a hairbrush. At that stage my barely damp hair looks frizzy and wild, but the Spin Air Styler takes out EVERY BIT of that, and leaves my hair silky and smooth, with plenty of body and turned under at the ends. My hair is shoulder length and is layered. I also discovered that since this device doesn&#x27;t grab or tangle your hair, I don&#x27;t have to section it off and style one clump at a time. I just start with the device underneath my hair and against the base of my skull and keep moving it up, letting it work in one position for a count of about 15 before moving it up to the next position. The whole process takes only 12 to 15 minutes.  At the end, I allow the last clump of hair I did to cool for about 15 seconds before I touch it.  After that, I don&#x27;t even brush it with my hairbrush. I just run my fingers through it and it falls right into place and looks soft and natural and young.  Oops - I&#x27;m 58!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and have never had any static cling in my hair -- I assume the ionization thing prevents that.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest hair stying tool I have ever owned. I normally have very short hair, but I am growing my hair out for my wedding. The longer my hair gets, the harder it is to style with a hairdryer and have it actually stay the way I styled it. This little tool cut my prep time in half and my hair looks better than when it takes me a long, long time. I won&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t lose a couple strands of hair while getting used to it, but my hair tangled far less than it does in a regular brush, which is just unheard of. It&#x27;s so easy to use, especially for people who are brush and hairdryer incapable!</li>
    <li> First off, a little background: I have short, straight, baby-fine hair.  Every time I go to the salon, my hair-guy tries to teach me to use a round brush to get my hair to flip this way and make it look fabulous.  I try for about a week and finally give up until next time.  Let&#x27;s boil it down to this: I fail at being a girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this today and, knowing my hair is due for a hair cut, I decided to try it out.  I mean, how bad can I make it look?  Worse comes to worst, it goes back in the pony tail and headband.  HOLY CROW!  IT WORKED!  I DID IT!  In 15-20 minutes on low heat (suggested temperature by the manufacturer for fine hair) I had my hair flipping the way my hair-guy does and made it look FABULOUS!  ON THE FIRST TRY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need one hand to operate this lightweight blowdryer/round brush combo tool. It has high/low/cool settings (that you can&#x27;t accidentally switch between) and easy-to-master buttons to rotate the brush.  The motor doesn&#x27;t seem overly powerful for rotation and I was afraid of burning the motor out or getting my hair caught in the rotating brush.  But the motor is appropriately powerful so you don&#x27;t rip your hair out and I couldn&#x27;t get my hair caught or tangled.  I would recommend this to anyone who has fine, short hair and my skill level.  I can&#x27;t speak to other hair types, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical because I really don&#x27;t believe in \\&quot;As seen on TV\\&quot; products but this item is a must have!!  My hair is curly and little damaged from sun, coloring, and etc. but after styling with this my hair actually looks shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever!! Not only does it cut drying time, but it adds volume to my fine, flat hair. And the volume lasts all day. It&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products and love how they style my short bob.  This intrigued me because of how they insist it is better for your hair.  It takes patience and practice; the hair on the ends of the brush can twirl into a big old knot easily (like in the back of your head where you can&#x27;t exactly see what you&#x27;re doing).  I will say the barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my conair which is nice.  Having black buttons on a black handle is pretty inane.  It is sometimes hard to find them much less use them.  Using dryers like this take the styling challenge out of things but it does add drying time.  Overall, I&#x27;m not sure this is all they rave it to be but it is good.  I think it is marked down to $40 which is much more in line as to what its worth.</li>
    <li> I have had too many different kinds of hair stylers and so far this product is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly hair but with just 20 minutes of using this product my hair looks amazingly shiny,silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not loud,the spinning option is wonderful,also your hair doesn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s abit tiring to hold it in your hand for a few minutes.But I switched from right hand to left hand and it was all fine...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very excited about this product and recommend it to anyone with curly hair tired of crappy similar products...</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this product because my hair is so thin. I even watched some video reviews from people who had purchased and used the product and seemed to like it. I myself tried it and it did nothing. It did not put more body in my hair...it just barely curled the ends. It did dry my hair well however but I would not recommend this product for putting more body in hair.  5/4/15:  Once I started using this item, I got used to it and I use it quite often now.</li>
    <li> Works well on my fine hair but I don&#x27;t think it would be hot enough for course or very textured hair.  Also, I find it works better not to use the spin function too close to the head if hair is a little longer. The longer hair wraps on itself and will bog or stop.  Using the spin near the middle and through the ends works very well.  My hair came out soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Got this gift for my sister and I just recently asked her how she likes it and she loves it so far!</li>
    <li> My wife only got to use the Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler a few times before it completely stopped working, and fails to spin. When it did work, she it did a decent job except for the fact it took longer to dry her hair. I checked the other reviews on here and it seems that this styler has a high failure rate. I see many others with the same exact issue. I suggest you save your money and look elsewhere for a more reliable styler/dryer.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m the type who just takes a shower, towel dry hair, comb/brush hair then head out... sometimes with still dripping wet hair... even in the winter time.  uses blow dry and round brush on occasion (if i had to). have a very fine, straight, long hair. found out about this product from my cousin whom highly recommended it. i got sold right away and when i got it i put it to use right away. it is so easy to use. no hair will get tangled or get stuck due to the rotating clockwise/counter clockwise feature. a lot more better than using 2 separate items (brush and blow dryer)  i also find it faster drying time.  now my other blow dryer is handed down to my husband (who blow dries his hair more than I).  I got it 3 days before the estimated arrival time. perfect time for the special occasion i want to use it for.</li>
    <li> I just bought this as a gift for my mother, but she didn&#x27;t like the rotating part and I was going to return it....but I was curious to see how it would do in drying my hair. I have long and SUPER thick hair, very course and can be frizzy, wavy, straight, and curly all in one.  I usually use the Conair Hair dryer that has a brush attachment to blowdry my hair and then I follow up with the Chi flatiron or the Instyler if i want a little softer curl. I was skeptical that this would work for my type of hair because I usually need a brush with very stiff bristles to pull the hair straight and this brush has soft bendable bristles. There is a learning curve to using the rotating part, but I figured it out quickly and it became very easy after that. What I really loved is that it saves your wrists and there is minimal arm movement, which is wonderful for me since I have alot of shoulder and wrist pain.  I find it works best if you have damp hair, NOT wet hair.  And drying it in thinner sections will help too. I was concerned that it wasn&#x27;t drying the roots of my hair so I figured out that if I run the dryer through the length of my hair and then rotate the section of hair to my roots and then hold it there for a few seconds and then pull back out straight it works really well. The heat of the dyer, even on the high setting is a low wattage, so holding it to your roots for 10 seconds or more won&#x27;t feel super hot and is enough to dry the roots without feeling like your burning your head. It definitely provides volume and curl and movement which I really love! And I noticed that my hair felt really light, like it was bouncy and had really nice movement, this is great since my hair always has a heavy feeling to it since it&#x27;s so thick and it never feels light and bouncy when I dry it with my other hair dryer. I did have to take off a star since the drying time was like 15+ min more than my normal styling time, I think because the wattage is so much lower, my other hair dryer is1875 watts and this is I believe only 500, but it definitely provides that salon blow out bouncy moveable hair look, so if you don&#x27;t mind the extra time then go for it!!!</li>
    <li> it is a good tool for long hair my hair to short for size of styler had to return</li>
    <li> I gave this product 2 stars not because it isn&#x27;t a good product but because it doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have long, thick hair and I bought this to get some volume in my hair. It just didn&#x27;t work out at all. I was thoroughly disappointed because my hair always got caught into the thin space between the barrel and the handle- regardless of the size of the section of hair I used. I sincerely believe that though this is an easy alternative to blowdrying your hair with a round brush, after my experience I will go with the latter because the result is SO much better. My hair dryer is really old so I will be getting a new one from amazon and a good, thick round brush to get some volume.&lt;br /&gt;ON A SIDENOTE: This worked out great for my mom who has thick, frizzy, wavy hair. However, it took a long time and mom said she would rather use a straightener or a blowdryer for the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly guys, don&#x27;t get this if you have thick, long, wavy/straight hair like I do. It looks good for a second but once you brush it out a little bit you will find that the volume comes from these little tangles in your hair caused by the failure of these pathetic bristles to grab your hair.</li>
    <li> I so enjoy product it does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.  The only thing is that 4wks after I purchased the item the price dropped $20 that was a bit upsetting.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s really comfortable to use. But only one warning: it&#x27;s not dual voltage! I don&#x27;t live in the US and I had to buy a voltage transformer that cost me more than 100 dollars!!</li>
    <li> Its brush is not fine, and the head doesn&#x27;t seperated from the body, its high power is not high.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Makes my frizzy curly hair smooth n wavy.. Totally love it. Must have tool for every girl</li>
    <li> I really like the concept of this product but do wish that it actually spins a little faster than it does. Overall it is not a bad product at all.</li>
    <li> What a great product! This has made my hair so much easier to manage. it curls really nice and it&#x27;s not causing my hair to be frizzy</li>
    <li> Dries and styles my hair and I keep receiving compliments every time I set my hair using it!.  Plus it has saved me trips to the beauty salon!</li>
    <li> I thought this would make the drying of my hair go a lot faster but the air/heat is not strong enough.  It&#x27;s not helping with the frizzies with my recently permed hair.  I think I need a smaller sized barrel.  I bought and returned a similar product because it had two sizes of barrels but there was no hot air coming out of it.  The thing I did like about this product was the option for the barrel to turn in either direction.  But it takes practice and getting used to.</li>
    <li> You might not be able to handle that very well, but you will used to it very very soon. and it is very useful for thin hair people</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. I bought two of these, thinking the first one wasnt working right.  But dont waste your time or money.  It doesnt do a good job as its flimsy and doesnt smoothe out your hair. I have medium length fine hair and this product cant handle it&lt;br /&gt;It gets hair tangled into a mess on the brush.  The beuah doesnt spin fast enough and sometimes it gets stuck.  Piece of junk compared to the revo styler that really smoothed out my hair</li>
    <li> I found this product to be excellent in styling and straightening the hair.  Once you get the hang of how to use it you can do a lot of amazing stuff!  I have thick curly hair and wish a product like this existed when I was younger.  It takes me much less time to straighten my hair compared to using iron and regular blow dryer with brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t blame the seller but the product itself is a piece of s***.</li>
    <li> This is a must if you have fine hair.  I am trying to grow out an inverted bob and this thing really curls my hair under in the back where my hair is growing out funky.  It also smooths my hair and gives it awesome volume.</li>
    <li> If you know how to work with a little hair product and have even basic blow-drying skills, you will love this piece.  It took a few times to figure out how to use it right but now I think I do a better job than many professional stylists that have worked with my hair.  I have fine hair and when I use good styling products (my favorites are Bumble and Bumble or Moroccan Oil)with this unit I get a good volume and shine that lasts all day.  Stylists don&#x27;t always have the patience to achieve this result with my hair and I now can get it done with this unit.  I start it from the root and pull it through to the end while it is spinning for the straightening but always after putting on a protective styling liquid.</li>
    <li> A little hard for my 13 yr to handle and will wind your hair to the scalp in a millisecond. Thank goodness for the reverse button. Once you get the hang of it, it does OK. If you have thick hair it will take forever to dry it though.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s a miracle worker. It adds so much volume to your hair. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I have long, wavy-curly, thick hair that is a pain if I want to style it with a regular brush and blow dryer. I never did it because it takes so long and it&#x27;s so hard to do, so I have been just blow drying my hair on winter. However, my hair looked all dried up after(doll hair look). I used this brush yesterday for the first time and it really does the job. It took me about an hour to do my whole hair, and I had to blow dry it first for about 5min, so it wasn&#x27;t soaking wet. It&#x27;s really great, but you have to work on your technique. I had to find a way to not only style the tips of my hair, but all the way up, because my hair is long and tends to get frizzy on the top. My tip is to get a section of hair, style the tips first, and when it&#x27;s dry on the bottom, hold the section, hold the brush close to the root and spin in until the middle, and then stop spinning. This way, you make the root straighter too. Don&#x27;t spin the brush from the root all the way until the end, it will just make a mess and wont work. I still have to find ways to make it better, but for a first time, it was def worth it. This brush gives a shiny and soft look to the hair, which doesn&#x27;t happen if you just blow dry it (if you have curly/wavy hair). It looks so artificial when I blow dry it, but this brush just makes it look smooth and shiny. Definitely worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Great product. Ladies should get this product-it really works. You can style your hair anyway you want too. Leaves your hair soft and curly if you want or straight.</li>
    <li> Love this beauty tool. Gives my hair lots of volume and shine. Also makes my hair bouncy and soft.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one of these I have purchased. I have RA in my hands and this makes it soooo much easier to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased I bought this brush. It leaves my hair shiny and with the finished look I get at the stylist.The warm massage of my scalp is a pretty good perk too.It took me a bit moving from one side of my head to the other to consistently push the right button to maintain the direction I wanted to be styling my hair, but that was corrected with use. Love it and have recommended this to friends.</li>
    <li> hair gets stuck in the top n bottom shafts and the rotation slows down drastically.&lt;br /&gt;Might think of returning...as it has a 2 yr warrenty i think.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and does a great job.  I have medium length fine hair, and was wanting something that wouldn&#x27;t cause a lot of frizz. Far exceeded my expectations!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This item works very nicely.  It would be most effective on medium to long hair.  Smooths hair, works very well.  It is not meant to dry hair, but to help with styling.  I have a large barrel curling iron, and prefer the revolving brush.</li>
    <li> I use it every single day i thinks that this is an awesome product works perfectly&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful because the silver part it&#x27;s really hot</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I bought this, thinking I would kill 2 birds with one stone; no more dryer then straightener... but it doesn&#x27;t really work like that. I have since stored this and went back to my old routine... it was just a bit of a hassle to use. I would rotate the brush in the wrong direction &amp; get my long hair all tangled... I guess I would pull it out from time to time if I wanted to add some volume to my do, but I won&#x27;t be using it everyday.</li>
    <li> At the start of this year, I decided to get my hair cut short! For the first time, since I was a child, I had chin-length hair. It was a great change but I had no idea what to do with it! I asked the hair styler who cut my hair what I should do, and he said to use a metallic brush and blow dryer to dry and seal the hair. I just nodded along but there&#x27;s no way I can hold a hair dryer AND spin a round-brush at the same time!! Any of you ladies have this problem too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did my research... and thank god I stumbled upon this product. After watching what seems every youtube video demo and review I absolutely HAD to have it. When I first used it, I was ecstatic. If you ask my boyfriend, he&#x27;ll tell you that I was squealing with every section that I dried and styled, because I was LOVING how it turned out. I looked like I had a beautiful salon BLOW-OUT in only 20 Mins. After having used this tool for a month, this is what I&#x27;ve learned about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not very loud. Now, I&#x27;m aware that \\&quot;loud\\&quot; is a relative term, but I know it&#x27;s not that loud, because my boyfriend just needs to raise the volume on the tv by a few notches to hear over it. Unlike my hair dryer, he just has to suffer for a few minutes and get an apology after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a cool option to seal the hair! Note: The head does not swivel on this option, but I don&#x27;t think it needs to in order to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The swiveling brush really is TANGLE-FREE. At least, I know it is for me (AND MANY of the women who have demo&#x27;d the dryer on youtube.) However, your hair can get tangled if you don&#x27;t use it properly, and I will elaborate more on this in the CONS section below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The item includes a nifty cover for the brush-head. It&#x27;s made out of durable plastic and really protects the bristles from bending or scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use! In the past month, I have learned to use this thing with my eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It has a Ceramic plate! I am a firm believer in the power of negative ions to protect hair follicles and seal in moisture. If you haven&#x27;t learned about the science, I urge you to look it up. You&#x27;ll appreciate this tool even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although, the bristle head brush IS tangle-free, if used improperly your hair can get tangled! If you try grab too much hair on the swiveling brush, then the &#x27;overflow&#x27; of hair can get twisted around and get stuck. It took me a little while to figure out why this kept happening, but once I learned about that issue, the rest was GRAVY. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The tool itself is pretty big. DO NOT be alarmed at how large this tool is. I don&#x27;t believe the technology exists that can make this dryer work as well as it does with a turning brush. At least, not for the current price of this tool. Even though, it&#x27;s a long and big, it&#x27;s surprisingly NOT heavy at all and will be really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ FINAL THOUGHTS ]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this tool! It may sound corny and over-the-top, but it really has changed my lifestyle for the better. I mean... In LESS THAN HALF the time it would take for me to TRY and use a dryer and brush, I can have a salon-style, blow-out with lifted roots and bouncy volume and shine. The price may seem pretty hefty, but my new look is PRICELESS. .... And the time you&#x27;ll save will be priceless too.ate!

    <li> Practically eliminates a need for a flat iron on my frizzy fine wavy hair! This is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I loved this rotary brush, have thick hair and it works well, though to smooth the roots of the hair is not the best option but rather helps shine and shape to the ends of the hair.</li>
    <li> Not very impressive so that I didn&#x27;t use it a lot...</li>
    <li> I love this sooooo much! Very easy to use! My hair is thin and fine. By using this, I can finish drying and styling my hair within 10mins in the morning!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for shorter hair.  With longer hair you must be VERY careful at the crown of your head as it tends to break it or pull it out. OUCH</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!! SOOOOO much easier than using a round brush and blow dryer. I only got tangled a few times and rotating it in the opposite direction freed it immediately. I have super thick hair, usually takes around an hour to fully blow dry and round brush my hair. Before I bought it the reviews said that if you have thick hair it needs to be almost completely dry, so i let mine air dry for a bit but it was still pretty saturated the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those girls that&#x27;s really bad at being a girly girl. I can&#x27;t curl my hair, perfect my makeup and blowdrying my hair always leads to a frizzy mess since the round brush and I never grew to like each other.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a girl at the gym using once of these bad boys a while ago and honestly thought &amp;#34;what the hell is THAT?&amp;#34; but never thought about it again, until my awesome MIL gifted this for me for my birthday. I was really excited! I tried and I love. Getting the hang of it is pretty easy too!&lt;br /&gt;On the reviews I checked out, some said that it was best to blow dry your hair a bit prior to using it since the motor isn&#x27;t that strong, so I did, even though my hair is fine and on the shorter side. I figured out quickly that I don&#x27;t have the hair type that makes that necessary so I won&#x27;t try that again since it just lead to my hair drying too quickly and frizz coming out of the woodwork like usual, but any other time i&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s been great! Even my guy noticed it and said my hair seemed smoother and shinier! I love this thing. It was a great gift and i&#x27;d recommend it for my styling-challenged ladies out there.</li>
    <li> This does everything it said it would. Easy to use and your hair isn&#x27;t easily tangled in the brush. It takes a small amount of practice to use, but that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend you use this when your hair is mostly dry!</li>
    <li> A friend raved about this for the last year.  I now can see why.  Words aren&#x27;t going to do it justice, but I will say that when I use the rotating styler my hair looks and feels just as good as when the professional stylist does her thing.  I have NO idea why it makes my hair softer and thicker and shinier, but it does.  I would easily spend four times the cost of this styler.  Easy to use.  I am going to purchase another one just to have on hand when this eventually gets worn out.  LOVE LOVE it!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  I have really curly hair and am horrible at straightening it myself.  I&#x27;ve never perfected the flat iron and can not do the round brush and blow dry, so every time I&#x27;ve wanted a nice down look I had to dish out money for a blow out... Not anymore!  I made up the cost first use! With practice this is only going to get easier and my hair better :) So happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I never review anything, but this product impressed me so much that I felt the need to share my thoughts.  I have very thin and limp hair.  In the past I would constantly fight with a round brush and blowdyer trying to get the look I knew was possible when I left the salon, but to no avail.  This product is amazing!  I am able to add body and shape to my hair with results which rival those I get when I am at the salon.  I wish I knew about this years ago.  So easy to use.  (I have a chin length bob.  I may buy a second unit just in case they decide to stop selling this in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, she&#x27;s always wanted one.  She tells me it gets the job done, but could be a little stonger.</li>
    <li> I do love this brush and it&#x27;s concept of adding more body and shine but I gave it a 4 star because while the barrel is turning you have to make sure it doesn&#x27;t roll in the cracks and pull your hair. The first time I used it my hair got caught in the slit and it took some hair with but as I got use to watching and making sure my hair didn&#x27;t go past the point where the handle and the barrel connect I perfected it and now I love the way my hair looks after I finish it.</li>
    <li> Easy to get great hair. Best when use with almost dry hair. Great for morning touch ups, even on dry hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used a regular hot air brush, you just have to remember not to roll the brush yourself because it will do that for you. Also you need to keep it at a position where you can readily access the buttons that rotate the barrel with your finger.  It really does save you a lot of effort and time. The only thing I would like to change is the handle&#x27;s size, if it were smaller and lighter it would make it even easier to use. But other than that, it definitely works, if you want natural looking body for your hair, this is the tool to use. Ideal for medium to long hair due to the 2 inch barrel.</li>
    <li> I used this product yesterday and it does work well, but still not as well as a blow dryer and round brush since my hair is medium length. I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I wish the handle was smaller (maybe my hands are too small?).  My hand that holds the handle was hurting after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally it takes about 20 minutes to style my hair with a blow dryer and round brush so the Infinitipro doesn&#x27;t save much time as it took the same amount of time.  But I was hoping that at least my hand wouldn&#x27;t hurt. Using a blowdryer/round brush bothers my hand that holds the brush after a while but in this case it&#x27;s the hand that holds the handle of the Infinitipro since it&#x27;s so big. Oh well.  Still a fun product to use.  I do like the rolling action and the more I used it the better I became at utilizing the rolling feature.  So perhaps in the future, it will take a shorter time to do my hair with the Infinitipro and my hand won&#x27;t hurt as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think it would be a better product if we can change the brush size to accommodate varying hair lengths.</li>
    <li> First of all, read the review by Dominique W (dated March, 2011).  Her review is right on the money.  Only difference for me is that I do &#x27;pre-dry&#x27; my hair, especially the roots.  My hair is very fine and I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron.  Honestly, when I opened the box, my first thought was, &#x27;Uh-oh, big mistake&#x27;. The brush itself is huge, and the bristles are SO soft.  My hair is barely shoulder length with shorter layers. I didn&#x27;t think there was any possible way the large brush would be able to wrap around my fairly short hair.  Bottom line, it works exactly as advertised.  I was able to get lots of volume at the roots, and the rest of my hair was smooth as silk.  The rotating brush takes a little getting used to, but even if you push the wrong button, it just unwinds from your hair.  I&#x27;ve never even come close to getting it tangled.  This is, in my opinion, a gigantic leap forward in self-styling your hair.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I actually enjoy working with my hair (a task I have always dreaded). Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> as per my wife this is the best rotating styler she got and worth every penny. so happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic! I have very long, naturally kept hair that usually gets put into a braid or updo because I&#x27;m not sure what else to do with it. It can hold a flat ironing or blowout for a few days, but those usually resulted in tangles I had to snip out or limpness. This accomplishes the silkiness of a flat iron with the volume of a blowout. I wash my hair the evening before, towel dry lightly, and put my hair into a topknot so I can use this in the AM. It leaves my waist-length strands smooth, shiny, and styled. Would recommend for anyone with thick, wavy hair looking for a way to keep it in check with minimal heat.</li>
    <li> easy to use, great reuslts</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s second one. She uses it every day until the brush is gone.</li>
    <li> C&lt;br /&gt;Tangles if your not careful has pulled hair right out of my head.  Makes a nice Bob though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders. I&#x27;ve desperately needed help with my hair.  I&#x27;m just now learning how to use this product, however, it seems like its easy to use and manageable. It&#x27;s bigger than I thought, but not too heavy.  If you&#x27;ve experienced rotator cuff damage, the other products would be front opening bras.</li>
    <li> I totally loved this product, as it provided a gorgeous shine and healthy volume/bounce to my dry &amp; colored shoulder length hair.  However, the motor broke after using 25 times.  The price has since gone up to around $50, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Too bad because it&#x27;s an otherwise great product!</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me and my hair, I gave away.</li>
    <li> Excellent style brush. Takes a bit to get used to the brush turning but is worth the effort. Good for med long to long hair.</li>
    <li> I really like the spin air dryer, it dries well and I can do it with one hand if I need to..  I do wish it came in different brush sizes,  I could use just a size smaller.</li>
    <li> It HURT! It pulled &amp; pulled &amp; pulled very roughly. It got tangled easily &amp; was very problematic to figure out. I have a Revlon blow dryer brush now that works much better. I got sucked into the hype &amp; wish I hadn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading both good and mediocre reviews. I figured, eh, it&#x27;s not super expensive - I&#x27;ll give it a whirl. SOOOO GLAD I DID! Omg. Volume! Totally gives you that BAM just-walked-out-of-the-salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal facts: I have very thick hair that&#x27;s somewhere between medium to coarse and it&#x27;s in a chin length bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you need to know before buying: If you think of this as a tool to replace your flat iron and NOT a tool to replace your hair dryer then you will be pleasantly satisfied. I usually towel dry my hair, run some serum through it (Bed Head blow dry lotion) and flip my hair upside down and give it a few minutes of blow time with my hair dryer until it&#x27;s not quite all the way dry. THEN I bust out the conair inifiniti pro, section my hair into lower level, mid level and upper level and do my thing. It is phenomenal! It does not give me that limp, lifeless look that my flat iron is notorious for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that complained about the drying, the size of the handle, the power of the blow, etc. I feel like it&#x27;s like complaining about your fridge not also being a dishwasher or giving your smartphone a bad rating because it doesn&#x27;t also make your coffee. It gives you way more volume than an iron, takes the frustration of using both hands to manage a round brush and a dryer simultaneously, and is incredibly easy to use! Best $30 I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
    <li> At first it was OK. It at least smoothed my hair a little. I kept practicing and over time it kept spinning faster, until eventually it began pulling my hair out!  I tried 2-3 more times and the thing was just getting crazy fast and I couldn&#x27;t control it.  It would spin through, painfully ripping clumps of hair out.  I realized it wasn&#x27;t me, something was wrong with it. Even though I know I most likely got a bad one, but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!  My hair is damaged from it after just a few uses.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s gracious return policy.</li>
    <li> Works really well but you can accidentally get your hair wound and snagged around the barrell. This was caused by a lack of attention while using it (did not use a mirror). It only happened once as the lesson was learned the hard way. Don&#x27;t text while using it !! Hahahahahaha, just joking on the texting thing. Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> It is really easy to use, but unfortunately I have long thick hair. It would take me about 5 hours to blow dry my hair with this thing. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything for me. I love the idea of it and have used it to &amp;#34;touch up &amp;#34; my hair after it was dried or slept on, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that tangles way too easily so I was really excited about this product, however it takes some getting used too. It is great for my bangs. When it comes to the rest of my hair though I am still working out the kinks. The rotation is one speed and if my hair is still pretty wet it struggles to rotate, once it&#x27;s dry it tangles and breaks my hair or it gets caught in the brush. The barrel of the dryer has vents (obviously) so when I wrap my hair around it and hold to style curls it creates ridges in my hair. I have used it mostly without the rotation, but it isn&#x27;t strong enough to dry moderately wet hair. For use I suggest small sections of towel dried hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used the styler a few times....still learning. I like it except where the rotatory buttons are....I have accidentally hit them a few times and found it a little annoying.</li>
    <li> The heat is not hot enough and doesn&#x27;t spin on the cold air option!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to believe this isn&#x27;t a original conair product.</li>
    <li> This item was an excellent present on Mothers&#x27; Day.&lt;br /&gt;The price, quality, timing and packaging were all very good.&lt;br /&gt;Keep on showing similar items.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this item to some relatives.</li>
    <li> I had the non rotating version of this (from another brand) in my shopping cart for a long time but just never quite clicked that CHECK OUT button - it just felt too gimmicky.  But recently, having had it with my blah flat straight hair to the point where I was contemplating hara-kiri of the hairy-kind SPIRAL PERM(!), I decided to finally try this as a last ditch attempt.  Known for OCD like last minute re-checking of other reviews right before buying a heavily researched item, I upped the ante with the switcheroo to add  &#x27;self rotating&#x27;  to the blow dry brush gimmick.  Going for broke here, what&#x27;s the worse thing that could happen right? (Conjures &#x27;Exorcist&#x27;-like head spinning image from the powerful rotating action)&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of said product was that is was too big, like an instrument of torture, like it can&#x27;t be held with one hand comfortably (I say &#x27;like&#x27; a lot)...and that it reminded me of ...ehem.  Aanyhoo, upon first examination I felt dubious that its rotating bristles won&#x27;t rip apart every single hair follicle that I am (at this stage in life) desperately trying to save like some endangered specie.  Then to add to my chagrin, the first time I turned it on and pressed rotate button - it did not.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, reading the instructions (duh) revealed that the cool setting disabled the rotate feature.  I was intrigued why so, but I guess it didn&#x27;t feel the need to divulge the catastrophic repercussions of allowing rotate while in cool mode.  Sure enough, changing setting to the warm activated the rotating brush. Whew!  I know at this point you&#x27;re wondering,  &#x27;when will she tell us if the product actually works or not?!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Patience, this is definitely a product that you don&#x27;t want to use on your hair the first time you turn it on.  You have to keep it a safe distance from your or another person&#x27;s hair (... or a hairy pet/person) the first time you experiment with its various  settings since you don&#x27;t know if the heat  will be comfortable foryou and that you can control the rotation first.  Its common sense really, but they don&#x27;t have these &#x27;Too Dumb to live Darwin Awards&#x27; for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short - IT WORKS end of review...&lt;br /&gt;Haha, I kid! Long story long, once I mastered the gumption to actually use said product on my hair (90% dry), the bristle that I though should&#x27;ve had those ball tips thingy actually didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all - it was very soft.  My first use actually yielded the result I wanted - which was noticeable body and shine, and it was easy to style my hair Jennifer Aniston-ish (without the ex-hubby baggage/angst weighing it down).&lt;br /&gt;It takes getting used to picking the right rotation direction when using on the back of your head (like trying to write on glass window so person on the other side can read it correctly - its just annoying that it just doesn&#x27;t read your mind and know which way to rotate, you actually have to think a little in the beginning)&lt;br /&gt;It does pull the hair a little (and sometimes I tend to press it harder when I want it to stop instead of releasing - but that may just be a user lack-of-coordination defect.)  It doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair but just remember to not panic when it start getting tight which means you have to release the rotate button ( and not do like I do &amp;#62;_&amp;#60;).  I also find it helpful to put my other hand on top of my hair as it&#x27;s being rotated kind of like as a guide, it may just be a psychological thing on my part ...and definitely use the cool setting to finish for that shiny salon blow dried look.&lt;br /&gt;For my hair type for sure I can say it will replace my hair straightener, it&#x27;d something I can use everyday provided I allocate ample time for hair prep.  Like another reviewer said, it doesn&#x27;t shorten the prep time much, just makes it easier to get that salon blow dried look with less products and tools.</li>
    <li> Was afraid I&#x27;d get all tangled up in the spin. It&#x27;s fairly easy to master, but doesn&#x27;t dry very well. You still need to blow dry before you use it, and when you do spin your hair, the bristles get so soft  they can&#x27;t shape the hair very tight. But overall, it does beat the manual brush.</li>
    <li> I had used a friend&#x27;s Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler while on a recent trip and loved it.  As soon as I returned home I checked Amazon and ordered one for myself.  It is great.  The rotating brush / dryer dries my hair so my faster than the old &amp;#34;hair dryer in one hand brush in the other&amp;#34; method.....and, my arms are far less tired when I&#x27;m done.  The rotation, also, untangles my fine hair as I&#x27;m drying.....a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends....in fact, I have.</li>
    <li> I used this a lot when I first purchased it, but the volume of the air flow is just not enough for me.  It was a bit tricky getting used to the rotation of the roller, but it&#x27;s a unique feature which I was eager to try.  Unfortunately, this styler just doesn&#x27;t have the power that I need.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 1/14:I put this away for a long time and didn&#x27;t use it - but when I pulled it out and started using it again, it came easy this time.  My hair is different, much shorter and thinner(though still below my ears), and it works beautifully to help volumize as it now thin after an illness.  I am updating my original review to five stars - keep using it if you have trouble at first.  best used on medium length hair imho.</li>
    <li> great article ,it is very helpful for me and my phone,itt help me to be using my phone thanks a lot</li>
    <li> I baught this to help me get rid of of the fizziness of my hair I basically just use it to dry my hair it takes forever for it to give my hair a style!</li>
    <li> I have never used a hot air brush in my life. I just assumed I was only able to have the salon quality blow out when I had my hair done or if I blow dried my hair then curled it. I just don&#x27;t have the skill to use a round brush and hair dryer as I end up with the weird waves around the roots. I know other ladies know what I&#x27;m talking about. I stumbled across this Conair hot air brush as well as the [[ASIN:B0056GDG90 John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush, 1.5 inch]]. Being that both were ranked as #1 and #2, I was torn which one to get. I ended up trying both side by side but first I&#x27;ll start with the pros/cons of this one. I literally did one side of my head with the Conair and one with the John Freida cuz I&#x27;m crazy like that. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Rotating brush takes the wrist-work out of the curling process&lt;br /&gt;- The High blow dry setting works very well and dries hair...but is very difficult to use the rotation on this setting&lt;br /&gt;- Large barrel for long hair&lt;br /&gt;- Cool to touch&lt;br /&gt;- The concept is very cool and might be a 5 star product on different hair but it was hugely disappointing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- If using the rotating brush on High it easily gets out of control. My hair didn&#x27;t tangle but it spins so darn fast that you can&#x27;t just let it rotate as the hair is brushed over it instead of getting wound up around itself.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeping it on low with the rotating is really the only way to be able to manage it.&lt;br /&gt;- Curls don&#x27;t hold&lt;br /&gt;- The blow dryer part of this is not that great, compounded with only *really* being able to use and style on the low setting- it would be faster for me to blow dry with a real hair dryer then curl or flat iron. That just defeats the purpose&lt;br /&gt;- I have just past shoulder length hair that is sort of fine but very thick (if that makes sense). It&#x27;s naturally wavy (not curly) but the bristles just couldn&#x27;t really get through to lower layers. They were soft but almost too soft- when I&#x27;d get the curl I wanted,it would pretty much get brushed back out. I couldn&#x27;t define the layers how I felt I should be able to.&lt;br /&gt;- To take different sections of hair, I had to put the whole contraption down so my hair was carefully sectioned off so as not to have lower layers get tangled. This was a giant pain in the rear considering this should be a one-handed operation.&lt;br /&gt;- I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get the back of my head. I tried rotating the brush both ways and even without rotating. I finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t truly smooth my hair the way I was expecting. I even had my fancy Bumble &amp; Bumble products so this should have been a given but it really just ended up looking like a bad blow out with only the ends curled instead of the layers that I actually have. I tried both directions on the rotating brush and it just didn&#x27;t look right.&lt;br /&gt;- I tried on two separate occasions to use this before work and gave up because it was taking so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict between the two brushes is the John Frieda. I will write a separate review on the appropriate page but the summary of it:&lt;br /&gt;- Even though the John Frieda brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, it gets hot enough to provide the true salon quality curls/waves of a traditional blow out.&lt;br /&gt;- The JF brush truly eliminated frizz as well as those weird waves from bad drying.&lt;br /&gt;- The hair dryer part of this actually works. Easily half the time of the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is a little more rigid on the JF so it doesn&#x27;t brush your curls out and it allows you to have better defined curls and layers.&lt;br /&gt;- After trying for 30+ minutes on one side of my head to get the Conair to work (or master how it&#x27;s supposed to work), I ended up going back over it and fixing it with the JF Brush. Thankfully, it was salvageable. lol</li>
    <li> It takes all of 5 minutes for me to style my hair with this device--ingenious!  So glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I used this item once, it worked great.  The next time I tried to use it about a week later it was as dead as a door nail.  Trashed it!</li>
    <li> I bought it expecting it would help me to take less time blowing out my hair and it doesn&#x27;t . I have a long hair and a lot so it continue easier for me using the rounded comb and hair dryer. The spin air rotating styler is a good product for people with hair no longer than the shoulder.</li>
    <li> I have the rotostyler and love love LOVE it, so I thought this would be an equally great idea for less damage on the hair and good for taking on trips.  WRONG.  I have shoulder length fine hair and it kept getting twisted in my hair and I came out looking like Little Orphan Annie instead of a sleek Anjolina.  Hate it hate it HATE it.  Save your time and money and use a regular blow dryer and the infinity rotostyler instead.</li>
    <li> great on my hair.. easy to use it.. it does a very good job and it got me a shiny hair. love it!</li>
    <li> This is a complete waste of time for anyone with curly hair...it is so puny and pathetic...it has absolutely nothing on my old 1000 watt 455 degree jilibre brush...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why cant any of these resaerch companies who invent this stuff come up with a spin brush that can reach 460 degrees, atleast 1.5 inches, maybe even 2 inches??? and be everything a curly haired girl would need, and not just dream about....seriously?&lt;br /&gt;Is it that hard? Haven&#x27;t you wasted enough of our money on crap and advertisements for crap?? what a waste....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for a bad hair day..... on my way back to return this...</li>
    <li> Faster and easier than anything else I have ever used.  Classy look too.  Other comments criticized that it rolls both ways -- that isn&#x27;t a big deal in my experience.  I just switch to the other button without moving the device and it picks up the hair just fine.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Creates a fabulous salon-like finish and volume that I was never able to achieve with a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use - it takes me about 20 minutes to style my shoulder-length hair.  With a hairdryer and big brush it would have taken twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;Good weight - my arms do not get tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally when using the spin it will tangle my hair and yank it at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The spinning stops when you use the cool air flow - it would be better to have the option to continue spinning on cool.&lt;br /&gt;Being able to swap the size of the brush would be great - a smaller brush head could create tighter curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after hair straighteners, this is the best hair styling appliance I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Absolutely easy to use and leaves hair nice and sleek. It takes me 10mins to do my whole head and i have thick long hair. It lasts all day- something that a straightening iron isn&#x27;t able to do. with a straightening iron my hair gets very frizzy and stays straight for maybe 2-3 hrs if i&#x27;m lucky. with this styler, there are no frizz and i can go all day with perfectly coiffed hair. Word of advice- its always good to use a heat spray when using anything hot on hair.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I love how my hair looks from the salon.  But I could never achieve that look when at home.  Why?  Because I don&#x27;t have an extra arm coming out of my back using the techniques that my hairdresser uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at my local drugstore.  It seemed that this was what I would need to keep the frizzies down and give my hair the lift and body achieved at the salon.  I came home and read the reviews on Amazon.  For the most part, they were favorable, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has made a huge difference in styling my hair.  I cannot believe how much body and lift I achieve.  For the record, I have color-treated hair that goes a bit past my shoulders.  I used to blow dry it, and then use a flat-iron to &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; it.  Well, the flat iron flattens hair, and I could never get the poofiness and lift that the salon gives me.  I also worried about the damage done to my hair with the intense heat from the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spin styler does not take much learning how to use.  You can make it go in two different directions, so you are in charge.  My hair has gotten tangled a couple of times, but you just take your finger off the spin button and gently release it.  It is especially really nice to be able to do the back of my hair.  You put your styling products into your hair when towel-dryed and then just start.  It takes a while to finish all of my hair, but I figure it is less than my previous regimen of blow-drying and flat ironing.  And it looks a whole heck of a lot better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have RSD in my right arm, and I have to say that this styler allows me to work on my hair quickly so that I don&#x27;t have to keep my arm up too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this styler to anyone who needs to keep down on the frizzies and wants some good lift in their hair.</li>
    <li> i love this its easy and fast it straightens a lot better and faster than a straightener it give volume</li>
    <li> I WISH someone would make a quality spin brush for thick hair ! OK, so you can take the tiniest section of hair and style it but it would literally take hours to finish my hair this way. I even blowdried my entire head all the way before using this styling tool. I&#x27;m sure it would be great for women with fine &amp; straight hair. I am still on the look for a spin brush with a decent-sized motor for hair like mine.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter, she loves it. The word maximum on this is rediculous.  Don&#x27;t feel like ever filling these out again</li>
    <li> I have the European version from the UK by another manufacturer and bought this one hoping it would be the same but noticeably lacks the power and heat of my UK version and my UK version has 3 heat settings while this one only has 2 plus cool....it works but takes longer than what I was used to and hoping for</li>
    <li> fantastic.  Haven&#x27;t loved a hair appliance this much since I got my first set of hot rollers in 1975.  I have very thick hair.  I dried it to about 80% dry using a regular blow dryer - sort of haphazardly head upside down just to get 80% dry without any styling at all(as instructions suggest) -- then just used this thing for the last 20% drying and I look like just stepped out of salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it lasts.  It felt a little like my thick hair was sometimes too much for the twirling thing.  Maybe I should use smaller sections -- but for this first effort I just used big fat sections and hardly even looked at what I was doing in the mirror.  worked out fine.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does not work like I thought it would or how add said.  I would never buy again. Lessen learned for sure..</li>
    <li> this product is great if you have fine hair, i have thick and long hair so it is not strong enough to dry my roots , for somebody that has a lot of hair like me i would recomend the conair 1975 wich does a great job !</li>
    <li> I am so regret now that I should have listened to the other 1 star reviews. I only had the styler for less than 2 weeks. The left and right spin buttons stopped working all of a sudden(while I was styling my hair)and rolled all of my hair in. I kept pressing the button to make the spin stop but none of the buttons worked, not even the cool-high-low-off button. It was so painful and gladly the outlet was really close and I was able to unplug it. I had no one at home that time and I couldn&#x27;t get any help! I just can&#x27;t image if I didn&#x27;t unplug the styler what will happen to me! The idea of this product is great, but the quality is just so disappointing and hurting! I have been using Amazon for almost ten years and this is the first time I am so furious about a product. It could have killed all my hair if I didn&#x27;t unplug it! I also bought another one for my friend right after I received my style, I am just praying now same thing won&#x27;t happen on her! DO NOT BUY IF YOU STILL WANT YOUR HAIR!</li>
    <li> Before buying this sprain brush I did my research on similar products and found this one to be the most popular and also had the best reviews. My first time using it I was somewhat puzzled  on how to really work it. I read the instructions and even watched youtube videos on how to get a full explanation on how to properly use the product. I did manage to tangle my hair up the first couple of times but after trying many different ways to reach my comfort level I got the hang of it. So far I have managed to use it everyday and have not yet gotten bored of it. I ultimately love this product because it leaves my hair full of volume and does not leave it flat out straight like a flat iron. The only thing that I would complain about it that you have to really get the hang of it without getting your hair all tangled up But if you do just turn it off and un-wind your hair from it. Overall I really enjoy this product and would recommend it to anyone who has thick wavy hair like mine. It really makes a difference from a traditional flat iron.</li>
    <li> Drys my hair fast, makes my hair shiny and gives it soft silky body. Have it for over a year and still love this tool.</li>
    <li> This was the absolute best tool that I have ever used.  I bought this as a spare, because my other one is so old and I could not live without it.  It is so quick to use and the results are great.  My hair is so smooth and moves when I shake my head. People have come up to me and say how good my hair looks. I do wish they would make different size brushes.</li>
    <li> Only reason that I am giving 4 stars is that this product is definitely not \\&quot;new\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Box looks so old all the corners are worn out and wrinkled everywhere. Plus, clear tapes are here and there. haha.&lt;br /&gt;even purple protection cap has multiple noticeable scratches on it. (and many finger prints on its body, of course)&lt;br /&gt;But I paid $38 including tax and shipping which is incredible deal compare to others (above $60 at some local stores)  and I&#x27;m satisfied with this product so I don&#x27;t care as long as the previous owner doesn&#x27;t have any head lice problem. (god forbid!!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Product works perfectly and very easy to use. I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;It works for my curly,uncontrollable,chest length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus!&lt;br /&gt;Superfast delivery that is true Awesomeness!  I ordered on wednesday and received it on friday. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a miracle tool for hair.  My hair is long and had no body but just hung straight before I bought this rotating styler---now it has body and curl and I look like I just walked out of the hair salon after I use it.  Just couldn&#x27;t live without it now!  My routine is to towel dry my hair, blow dry it just until it is damp wet, then start using the rotating styler.  I do use a hair oil and a heat protectent before I blow dry.  It only takes me about 10 minutes from start to finish with the styler and it gives me soft, natural looking wavy curls---just the way I like to wear my hair.  It takes a couple of times to get the hang of it with the brush rotating in both directions, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to realize how much better your hair looks using this styling tool.  Can&#x27;t imagine anyone not liking this whether they have long or medium hair---not sure about short hair---the brush may be too big for short hair.  Even though it is a bit pricey, it is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Like it but I think I would do a better styling job is the barrels had been 1 1/2&amp;#34; instead of 2&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have loved this hairdryer, twice. But it breaks. Its rotating mechanism fails to turn. I have bought two in the past six months, and have finally given up on it. Such a shame, because when it works, it gives fabulous volume. I wish Conair could fix it.</li>
    <li> The spin brush looks cool in the commercial but doesn&#x27;t work very well in the real world. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The roller was too large and it takes a long time to dry the hair.  A bit expensive but a good idea.  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the packaging to return it.</li>
    <li> My hair is fairly thick and just above the shoulders. I can style my hair with this in about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the videos you watch online. This brush will not spin that much and will not last long at all! I had it for less than a year and the brush is just not spinning any more.&lt;br /&gt;Just to give you an idea - my hair is pretty fine and of medium length (so they are not long and not thick) and this brush couldn&#x27;t even handle it... So sad, $50 just thrown in the trash</li>
    <li> Although with practice it might work, it is a bit tricky for me--the brushes spin in all directions and my fingers keep on pushing the wrong button while frantically trying to get the thing out of my hair.  I do think that for straight hair it would work nicely.</li>
    <li> It is a really cool idea! But I&#x27;m not sure how functional it is. I was looking for a super fast way to dry/style, but in reality it still takes a while (especially for thick hair). Plus it rips my hair out. The video makes it looks so easy!</li>
    <li> seems to work very well, I do have short thin hair. It does get tangled a bit, but not too bad. Downside is my arms get tired from holding it.</li>
    <li> I had to send it back, I did not care for how this worked. It did barely anything to dry my hair. I was upset because the reviews for this item were pretty good. Oh well, not everyone has the same hair type, so it may work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I saw something like this on an infomercial on TV and thought it would be a great way to get some body in my hair quickly.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.  I wish it were a little smaller, but that might not work for other people.</li>
    <li> This one was a gift I bought for my sister-in-law after she used mine and loved it like I do!  Great device!</li>
    <li> I love this, it makes my hair so nice, dries it as it styles it.</li>
    <li> My process: I use my favorite sleek serum and comb into my towel dried wet hair. I section off my hair at the crown and then begin with the sides.  I have chin length layered hair that is very thick and curly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I have only used this three times, but each time it has dried my hair and left me with a &amp;#34;Salon Blow-Out&amp;#34; with amazing volume and sleek finish. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;The bristels are soft and feel great on my head. I suffer from Occipital Neuralgia, so this is a big deal for me. My styling time has been cut in half and lasts for a few days. My hair routine used to be 45 minutes.  (I actually love using it so much I drag it out on purpose).&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The rotation takes some getting used to. I&#x27;m glad I do have short hair I think I would have wrapped it around the brush! (I&#x27;m a little slow on the coordination).&lt;br /&gt; I was not expecting much from this product since it sounded like a &amp;#34;Too good to be true&amp;#34; product. I was wrong! I just pray the motor doesn&#x27;t burn out like a similar product I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> After reading these reviews, I had to try this styling brush.  I have medium length, curly (in areas), over processed, fragile hair.  Let me first say, I bought a new curling iron about 2 months ago( to try to get the &#x27;beachy&#x27; curls&#x27;.  This iron got hotter than my previous irons and was not ceramic coated and it SCORCHED the ends of my hair.  So after a trim and repeated massive conditioning, it&#x27;s beginning to recover.  I saw this styling brush and thought if I could cut out curling irons and flat irons, it would be great for my hair.  After I got this styling tool, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  The first time I used it, I did as suggested in the reviews and dried my hair about 90% with my regular blow dryer.  Then I finished it with the Infinity Pro.  Just as the previous reviews stated, it took some getting use to.  I&#x27;m fairly good with hair, but I hit the wrong direction repeatedly, got it tangled a few times, but I could see that with some practice, this could be the drying tool that could just what I needed and it was DEFINITELY easier than using the traditional blow dryer and round brush and less tiring on your arms.  I&#x27;ve used it about four times now and each time I use it, it gets easier and the results get better.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but I&#x27;ve found that my hair needs to be much more damp (than the recommended  90  % dry) in order to get the curls blown  from the roots out.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this item and would recommend to a friend.  Just be patient and work with it until you get used to the correct procedure for your hair type.  The brush is very large (2 full inches) and I don&#x27;t see that it could work on short hair or very long hair.  If you are totally uncoordinated, this may not be the styling tool for you.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Infinity Pro.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this styler. Wonderful on short hair and very easy to use. So little effort to dry and style your hair all the same time.</li>
    <li> It is  probably good for very long hair.  It also does not get hot enough.  My hair is over 1 1/2 below my ears.  So basically I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this concept.  It has a very large barrel and a cover for it.  I love the spin feature, easy to use. It is difficult for me to hold my arms over my head for long time periods.  This does the trick.  Very pleased with the heat setting.  Not so hot that it will burn your hair, but hot enough.</li>
    <li> I love how it does to my hair!</li>
    <li> I just got this today and used it to dry and style my hair. It did a great job. It does take a little practice to get the hang of it and it can be a little heavy but for the results it&#x27;s fantastic!! It has several heat settings and two way rotation.the heat produced is also good. You have to section your hair to dry each part but that is the normal routine either way when drying your hair. I&#x27;ve never been really good at drying my long hair , but this product makes it so much easier.</li>
    <li> Wow does this ever give your hair a boost.  Nice body.  Dries hair fast.  I do recommend using a regular blow dryer or letting hair air dry for awhile before using the Styler.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She has mentioned how she loves it every time she uses it.  Had it about 1 month</li>
    <li> First day I used this, I went to the beauty supply to pick up shampoo - the professionals thought I just came from the salon!!  Enough said!</li>
    <li> Very good for eveyday, and hair stays shine and soft. I use it everyday and love it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use those curling brushes (the ones with the bristles all the way around), but I can use this so easily!  Gives you nicely curled-under ends without any hassle!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair that is 4 inches long with layers and this product works Great!!!  It gives body along with the perfect curl.</li>
    <li> This styler is pretty easy to use, if a little on the heavy side. Sometimes my wrists hurt for a bit after I use it. But it&#x27;s so easy. I usually let my hair air-dry or blow it out a bit, and then switch to this styler. It makes styling my hair straight with a nice little bounce to it a snap. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty curly hair and I would not recommend buying this product. It took longer for me to do my hair with this product than just blow drying and straightening it. It also is awful at getting your roots. If you have curly hair the ends will look great but your roots will just look frizzy and undone. I also think it is hard to use. It works fine for the ends of your hair but if you put it too high up on your hair it will just start sucking it up and getting it all caught. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is awesome. I used the Revo rotating hairbrush with my hairdryer for the last 12 years until it finally started to die. I did some research and found the Infinitipro. I like that the hairdryer is built into the brush unlike the Revo, allowing me to use both hands while styling. There is a learning curve which I have an advantage on since I used the Revo. Don&#x27;t give up too soon it took me a few weeks to get the Revo down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just below my shoulders with layers and frames my face. The infinitipro works great and gives my hair a nice shine. FYI Your hair can not be too wet. After showering I use the hairdryer concentrating on drying my scalp and tip my head downwards to dry underneath (I have a lot of hair). I let my hair air dry while I get dressed and put on make-up. I style my hair last with the infintipro.</li>
    <li> I just received it an hour ago and Im already in love with it. Usually it took me more than hour to brush my hair and I get lots of pain in my hand but with this its not only 20minutes. Plus it&#x27;s so light and easy to work it . It&#x27;s a must have</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and I blow most of my hair dry first and then use this to get that round brush look.  I really like it.  It does make my hair look a lot shinier and healthier.  I am not one to round brush b/c it takes a lot of time and I&#x27;m not good at it!  This I can do though!</li>
    <li> This works best if your hair is mostly dry(if you have long hair-mine is about 2&amp;#34; below my shoulders) I was hoping it would dry my hair faster but I still love it.  You can dry your hair, add volume, curl and smooth your hair-all with this!</li>
    <li> It did everything except curl hair.  Dislike the fact that you said it will curl, but didn&#x27;t, below expectation to recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I believe it is probably better for long hair.  My own hair being layered in medium length limits the good use for myself but still gives it shine and better than using a regular hair dryer.  I should have bought the smaller diameter, however.  My fault, not the seller&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work, looks new from the box but the rotating function did not work</li>
    <li> Easy, one handed operation to style hard to control hair. The rotating brush with gentle blowing heat does the trick. Smoothes frizzies and adds body. Makes your hair feel great in short order.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I am on the fence with this product. I definitely think it does what it is intended to do.  The dryer works well, the brush rotates.  It does take some getting used to in terms of which button to push to make the brush rotate different ways, but that&#x27;s not difficult once you get the hang of it.  I do think that it works well on straightening and smoothing my hair - which is about an inch or two past my shoulders and lightly layered.  I wish the brush size was a little smaller.  I&#x27;ve used a one inch blow dry brush for years and really like the size of that - but it doesn&#x27;t have the rotating functionality.  I wish I could get this product in a slightly smaller size so that I could use the rotation, but get a little more bend/curl out of the finished product.  As it works now, I do get a nice, fairly straight blow-out.  I do think the bristles cause a little frizz.  I use a little finishing cream, so it&#x27;s not a huge problem for me.  I also wonder if I were to spray the brush/bristles with a little hair spray before using if that would help?</li>
    <li> When I received the item, I could tell that the box was already opened before. When I got the item in my hand, I could see there was some hair already in the brush, plus the brush was already had some used traces.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is unacceptable, and I feel disgusted to use it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, does give you the volume, but not frizz free. The best part of this brush is that you don&#x27;t have to use a separate brush to give you that volume, but most of the time, I&#x27;ll just use my blow dryer</li>
    <li> The results with this thing are amazing - better than I expected.  My hair is smooth, shiny, and gorgeous.  I don&#x27;t know about the volume claims that this product makes.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for for hair that looks like you just walked out of the salon, you have to try this.  An added bonus is the fact that this is a blow dryer and brush in one.  I only have to pack this styler in my suitcase &#x3D; super convenient for travel!</li>
    <li> Long lasting, not loud, not heavy, good quality. I bought this a couple years ago and it still works as if it were new! It works just as advertised and the controls are easy to use once you get the hang of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will NOT tame frizzy hair though but it does a fair job of at least flattening curly hair, making it easier and faster to straighten it later.</li>
    <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;I never expect that it will be so easy to have your hair looking so good.</li>
    <li> I stood at the store for a good 20 minutes debating between this product and the InStyler (which is what I was originally planning to get). After seeing the mostly glowing reviews here, I decided to give the Conair a try. Bonus: it was half the price too. I have thick, wavy hair cut into long layers with the overall length just past my shoulders. Every time I get it cut I always say that I can&#x27;t ever get it to look that good again. Just blow drying it makes it big and poofy. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m terrible with styling tools. I don&#x27;t have the dexterity to handle a round brush with a dryer so getting my hair to lay down and look smooth is almost impossible. Enter the Conair Spin Air. I was a little scared at first with the rotating brush. I was imagining having to cut it out of my hair. I used it on dry hair as a means of smoothing and straightening. It. was. AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of practice and patience to get the hang of the rotation buttons and changing brush direction as you switch hands/angles and getting used to the automatic pull of the brush. My hair never came close to getting tangled though. In fact, as the tension between the hair and brush increases, the rotation slows and will actually stop if it has to pull too hard. A nice little safety feature that made me comfortable that my hair would not get caught. My hair came out looking soft, shiny, and not poofy! I have yet to use it on damp hair, but I can&#x27;t wait to see if it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: this thing gets hot so using a heat protecting product is not a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy with this dryer/brush. With more practice, I&#x27;m sure it will take me no time to style my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this styler about a year ago and have been using it ever since. It works great but if it ever stops working I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair that I wear turned under.  This styler is everything they say it is.  My initial reluctance to try this styler was fear my hair would get tangled up.  I can say without a doubt it does not.  Now if Conair would make this with a smaller diameter brush I feel they would have a whole new market of consumers.  Alas, Conair says they have no plans to create a smaller brush for shorter hair.  Guess I won&#x27;t be cutting my hair anytime soon!  All I can say is try it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if your hair is long enough for this size barrell.</li>
    <li> Perfect my wife loves it</li>
    <li> I brought this and received it 3 days ago was excited to use it, so went about styling my hair. I plugged it in and checked the settings on it with in the first 5min my fire alarm had gone of.... At first I though it a new product and sometime they need a bit of working - I turned my fan on and product seemed to work ok. 2day later I went to use it and I began to get really hot to the point it would burn me and this was on low setting as I got not even half way through I stopped as it was becoming clear it wasn&#x27;t working well and I started see the barrel start burning up so pulled out the plug and the barrel was smoking and the smell of burning was come from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed and so dangerous.</li>
    <li> Not much to write about here. Product does about nothing for smooth silky hair at least if you are looking for body or curl. It is not even good at drying your hair. Don&#x27;t bother in my opinion waste of hard earned money.</li>
    <li> its pretty good but I have a medium bob which comes under my neck. ( my hair is styled like Barbara streisands) anyway ths works well. give it body... and I like it. but I find that the $15  bm20 Conair non rotating brush works well too.- it has 2 brush attachments 1 1/2\\&quot; and 1\\&quot;- smaller than this infiniti 2\\&quot; rotating brush.. the other bmx20 doestn rotate and for my hair lght I have more control... it comes out more flipped under at the ends whereas this infiniti Conair rotating brush makes it more of body style and a slight like wave under.  I like them both and will use them both depending on what my mood is and how I want my hair done for the day.. ! thanks..</li>
    <li> If you have kinky (nappy) hair it will work to a point. Just use a flat iron to tame it when you&#x27;re through. Other than that the Infiniti Pro works just fine</li>
    <li> This came on time and was at a great price! I do really like the result when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily... at least 5 days out of the week. It gives you a &amp;#34;Catherine, Dutchess of Cambridge&amp;#34; quality blow-out. I&#x27;m not even kidding. It&#x27;s that good. If/When this one burns out, I&#x27;ll be buying another!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  It works so well with my shoulder length, long-layered, curly hair!  It makes my hair shine and have soft curls.</li>
    <li> No satisfaction at all!!&lt;br /&gt;Powerless! Very disappointed, cause lot of goods reviews and that why I chose it&lt;br /&gt;I returned this item</li>
    <li> Reasonable priced, Works well and it&#x27;s easy to use. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love it perfect i have curly hair and this is  wonderful to straighten my hair in minutes</li>
    <li> Although in concept it is a great tool and I was able to maneuver it rather quickly and easily, the 500 watts was not sufficient for my taste.  I have curly hair and found that it did not provide the style I was looking for.  Your hair must be damp and when using the styler I found that it did not blow my hair out as a standard blower would.  Maybe I don’t understand its use, but for my taste I would prefer it if it was made to replace my blower.  I would imagine it would work well with fine, straight hair.</li>
    <li> Good product. Drying hair is slow.; but still good</li>
    <li> The styler does not work as well as the first day. The spin function is slower because hair is caught. I have been unable to clean it completely, and unsure how to clean. The styler is easier to bring on vacations and works when I need to quickly blow-dry my hair. However, I wish that I could use smaller brush size, as I recently cut my hair short.</li>
    <li> Working well. Fest shiping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this.  Her hair loves it also.</li>
    <li> Motor crapped out after one year. I used it once a week, tops. Bristles are soft and don&#x27;t grab the hair enough. I just bought the Frieda 1.5 inch hot air brush and it&#x27;s FAR superior to this one. The rotating feature on here is useless (for me, anyway). I compared them both when I chose this one last year, and I clearly made the wrong decision. Wish I had purchased the Frieda first.</li>
    <li> Not very strong its good for short hair not long hair</li>
    <li> really makes styling easy</li>
    <li> Tangles hair very easy and hard to msnage</li>
    <li> Great purchase..easy to manage..</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this brush, but it disappointed me. The plastic roller has spaces in it that tears your hair out as it spins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are weak. You cannot have thick hair if you use this spin air styler as it will not grab your hair at all and by all means don&#x27;t try it with wet or damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spin it&#x27;s self is slow. I would not recommend this brush</li>
    <li> Not for me. Incredibly frustrating. I tried and tried and tried. I tried several times over three weeks then gave it away.&lt;br /&gt;Too much work, too much time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my problem, most likely.&lt;br /&gt;I find it very awkward to hold, my wrist gets very painful.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold my hair in tight enough, I have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect, like many things, it&#x27;s a matter of getting used to a new tool, so I don&#x27;t know if I can really blame this thing.</li>
    <li> I love this styler. it&#x27;s easier on my hands and quicker</li>
    <li> I have been using the Infinitypro Spin Air Rotating styler for several years.  I find the Infinitypro easy to use and my hair is shiny after each use.  One needs to be careful not to allow medium length hair to get tangled while the brush is rotating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had the opportunity to purchase the John Frieda JFHA5 at a discount.  After using the JFHA5 once (note: this styler does not rotate), my hair frizzed.  I believe this is due to the ionic setting of the brush which cannot be turned off.  I promptly returned the JFHA5 back to the store.  I would not recommend purchasing the JFHA5 and would definitely recommend purchasing the Infinitypro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the Infinitypro came in a smaller 1 1/2 inch barrel and that replaceable brush heads for the styler could be purchased as the bristles can become matted down.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the way this spin styler works. The bristles are softer and the spin not so fast that it tears the hair. I have fine hair and after getting the worst hair cut of my life along with an &#x27;organic&#x27; hair color that I had an allergic reaction to, this brush styler has been a life saver. It lifts the hair and helps to blend the many cow licks that are now apparent all over my head. The brush can easily be spun in either direction and I found it works best learning to use it with both hands. The handle is wider, but I don&#x27;t find this brush heavy or cumbersome to use and the spin direction buttons are easy to access with the thumb. Hopefully, time will heal this hair disaster and meanwhile, I have a great tool to help me deal with it. :)</li>
    <li> Great tool! I cannot figure out how to style my hair with blow dryer and round brush. This Styler is exactly what I was looking for. Does not tangles my hair; it is not too heavy; very easy to operate; hair is smooth and not static; styles and dries hair very fast. Hair style looks like it is done in a hair salon. I love it!</li>
    <li> great product;  steep learning curve;  gentle on hair;  more difficult to master with shorter hair; easy to get men to help with styling! believe it or not.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of mixed reviews about this and decided to be optimistic.  I have average-thick (caucasian brown) shoulder length hair with loose curls.  The handle IS big, but i haven&#x27;t found that to be a problem.  If you style your hair a lot, especially with a round brush, you get the hang of this quickly but the different spin directions are a little confusing.  I can get straighter hair with a brush and blow dry, but this gives a smoother shinier finish with bouncy waves that lasts longer.  it&#x27;s better if you rough dry with the blow dryer first, then section it off. Spin each section both ways--under and flipped--for best results.  I like it with the Aquage straightening products.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-wish the bristles were a bit stiffer.  Also, sometimes hair gets caught in the space between the handle and the spinning part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 mos later: As my hair gets longer, just past shoulders now, this gets harder to use.  The bristles just aren&#x27;t stiff enough to mimic a blow out.  They just curl the ends.  Not changing original rating, though, because it worked so well on my hair when it was shorter.</li>
    <li> The world needs to know....... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! This is my new best friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am definitely in love with this multifuction miracle of technology!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one (first one eventually developed some gearing issues with the rotating bit).  I will no doubt buy a 3rd one when my second one finally dies.  Great product... don&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I was never able to get my hair to look this great using a blowdryer and a brush and now my hair looks like I just left a salon.&lt;br /&gt;It could be a little easier to use though, I&#x27;m still getting used to it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of new hair growth and the brush does tame most of it.  The air is not too hot on high, which I like.  If you make a mistake on the rotation, just hit the opposite button and it will untangle the brush from your hair.  I have medium length hair and I have to hold my hair out as not to get stuck in the rotating brush.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the massive workout you get by holding the brush while styling. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair dryer.  Makes drying hair so easy and gives your hair wonderful body and shine.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really thought this was my answer to styling my hair. I was disappointed right away. If you have fine hair, this makes it even harder to style. No matter what you put on your hair to help the styler makes the hair completely limp.</li>
    <li> So it dries my hair very nicely but my hair is long that it took forever to do so and it actually frizzes my hair. Didn&#x27;t turn out as I like.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Infinitpro Spin Air Rotating Styler!  It is the best!  It&#x27;s so much easier than struggling with a round brush and blow dryer.  I spend a lot of time in high-humidity locations and this wonder tool has simplified my life (and kept me from taking another shower after sweltering away trying to style my hair).  Instead of planning my outings around a professinal blow dry - I just whip out my Infiniti Pro.  Now of course that isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s a good as going to a pro but - wow!  I just rough dry my hair to about 90% dry (this tool isn&#x27;t a blow dryer - it&#x27;s a styling tool)and run it through my hair.  Watch Jonathan&#x27;s video to get an idea of how to use it.  The brush spins in both directions so you can&#x27;t get it stuck in your hair!  Separate your hair into small sections - I have fine hair and lots of it - so about 2 inch sections max and spin away! It&#x27;s light enough that you don&#x27;t need a carpenter&#x27;s forearms to use it!  My hair is just past my shoulders and it takes me about 10-15 minutes to style it.  You can also use it to smooth your hair - you don&#x27;t need to use the spinner if you just want to \\&quot;calm down\\&quot; your hair.  Use the cold button and you get even more curl... I&#x27;m telliing you - this thing is the best! One problem - the second one I bought - yes - I have two - quit spinning after one use.  I&#x27;m not sure what happened but I returned it and ordered another one!  All I can say is - if you want to save time and look great - GET ONE!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this styler while it worked, but it only lasted ten months. It still turns on, but it&#x27;s much weaker and the brush barely turns. I never dropped it or mishandled it, just took it out to use it one day and it had stopped working properly. I didn&#x27;t even use it frequently, only occasionally when I wanted a different look from my usual curly hair. For the price, I would have expected to be able to use it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> This is my third hot air styling brush, and I was very excited by the spin feature hoping it would give an effect similar to hot rollers. As other reviewers have noted, the wattage (and thus air pressure) is lacking. Definitely doesn&#x27;t dry the hair -- hair needs to be almost entirely dry before using this brush. And when using the spin feature, I can only use it on the lower half of my shoulder-length hair to avoid tangles (which prevent the brush from spinning at all). Because I&#x27;m not able to use the brush at the scalp while spinning, it does not volumize as I&#x27;d hoped. If you have chin length hair or shorter, I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three star rating is for it&#x27;s smoothing ability -- my hair is quite a bit softer with less frizz after I use the brush, and does look like a salon blow out in that respect (just without the bounce and volume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net net: I would have returned this product had my cleaner not accidentally disposed of the packaging...</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for the Infinity Pro - after a friend of mine recommended I get one to ease the pain of growing out my hair. I have a low forehead and I need volume - especially as my hair is getting longer now. As soon as I tried it one of the spin buttons seemed a bit sticky and it did not spin nearly as fast as in the tutorials - however I persevered and thought it might just need some warming up. My hair looked great! It was very good at adding shine and volume - I good heaps of comments at my seeming profession blow-dry job. It really helped when shaping the back of the hair, and curling the tips inward. On the second go however the spinning was more temperamental and by the third had completely stopped! I could see no reason for this happening (completely clean and free of hair). Desperate for my hair to look nice I then tried to use it without the spin function. Spurting and crackling sounds started and then a part within looked to be glowing red and alight accompanied by the smell of burning plastic. This was really scary as it was so close to my face. Thank goodness I was not electrocuted or burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sending it back for a replacement  - fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So Amazon sent me a replacement and I didn&#x27;t even need to send back the faulty item, which I was really impressed by. At first I was so happy- the brush instantly spun much quicker than the first brush did - but alas halfway through styling my hair the brush completely stopped spinning. Hopefully I can get a full refund. I am really disappointed! Obviously very poor quality- why have I been sent 2 faulty items??</li>
    <li> This is perfect for me. The air is very hot and not that much, but Im not a pro. I find it, very easy to use.  The longer the hair, the harder to use (at the beginning) with the rotating form, but with practice, this is a great tool for styling.</li>
    <li> First one didn&#x27;t work and the replacement had hair in it (gross) and didn&#x27;t work either. No wonder they try to sell it on TVC</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, but I have very short hair so it was not practical for me.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Does everything they say.  I have the bounciest hair ever with it, just like the days that I walk out of the beauty shop.</li>
    <li> Helps to smooth your hair between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I used the cordless RevoStyler for years until the battery wore out. If I could purchase it again at a reasonable price I would. It was made very well, although it didn&#x27;t heat up. But because it was cordless it was a lot lighter than the Infinitipro, and I didn&#x27;t mind using a blower with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I love the Infinitipro because it does heat up. Of course I use a blower with it as well because the blower isn&#x27;t very strong. I&#x27;m fine with that. But I do have the sense that it won&#x27;t be very durable. It&#x27;s not made as solidly as I would have hoped. Also, eveven if it lasts awhile, the brush is kind of flimsy and doesn&#x27;t seem replaceable. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we shall see.</li>
    <li> 2 months and no more working...</li>
    <li> when I first bought it I used it 2 or 3 times and the spinner would not work any longer. I sent it back and they sent me a new one and I&#x27;m hoping this one last me for a lot longer since I was careful when I use them.</li>
    <li> It comes with a cover to keep the brush firm.  It is of high quality, professional handle, and keeps hair fluffy and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this styler. It adds volume, wave, and body to my hair. I love the fact that the brush rotates both ways. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my long hair getting tangled in it.</li>
    <li> This was horrible. I got my hair tangled everytime I used it. It was horrible. I have fine hair as long as my middle back, it did the job with drying my hair but it kept tangling it. I tried everything. So I had to return it. I wanted it to work. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that my 12 yr old daughter could use on her own without taking so much time with the blow dryer, then flattener.  I showed her a couple times how to use it and she&#x27;s a pro....love the way it leaves the hair looking, silky straight and shiny!  Worth the money....not for short hair tho.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other brush I have used. No need for Blow drying. It dry&#x27;s and styles. Great for people with natural curly hair that want to tame the curl. I would highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use hair styler.  But, it is not a hair dryer.  It does a great joy of smoothing and styling on damp hair, but it is not useful on wet hair right after washing.  If you are willing to use a regular hair dryer to get your hair to the damp stage and then switch to the Spin Air Styler you should be very pleased.  It easily glides through medium length hair with no tangling and leaves your hair shiny and smooth.  After a few uses it becomes instinctive as to which way to spin the brush with the rocker switch.  I would have given this 5 stars if the drying function was stronger.</li>
    <li> Daughter has one and I liked so purchased one for myself. Drys hair nicely, and would recommend to others to try.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair Rotating Styler.  Used my first one for several years and then it wasn&#x27;t drying my hair like it should.  Might of been dropped a few times to many.  Could hear something rattling inside.  It still did spin but didn&#x27;t dry as it should.  So I got my second one.  Easy to use.  The spin button might be confusing at first as it spins both ways.  Just use the button that is closest to your head to get it spinning in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Hello, I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  While visiting many months later I asked how she liked it. She said it didn&#x27;t work that well.  I looked at it and it was disappointing to her because it didn&#x27;t rotate.  She didn&#x27;t understand it was supposed to.  Any way to send faulty one back for replacement?</li>
    <li> I returned this item because of the size.  It is way too large to do anything but straighten and dry your hair.  I wanted a little curl.  Maybe for someone with longer hair.</li>
    <li> This instrument is hair puller. Does not matter if hair is dry or wet, get ready for yanks. Ouch!!! Find something else to buy!!</li>
    <li> When I used this drier, I did feel as if my hair wasn&#x27;t being damaged. The downfall is that the drying time took longer. If you have then straight hair, this will work well. It&#x27;s not really meant for people with thick or curly hair.</li>
    <li> Oh My Gosh!!! I just received this product yesterday. Washed my hair today and used it for the first time. It is amazing! My hair looks just like it does when I come from the salon! I have a chin length bob with bangs (very thin fine hair) and It gives my hair smoothness yet it has body.&lt;br /&gt;I do admit the rotation is a bit tricky but I&#x27;m already figuring that out. I would recommend this to anyone with hair like mine. Not sure for anyone else, but it is definitely worth a try and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can see is the handle is thick and could be a little difficult to hold on to. Also it needs a small extension on the brush end to hold with the other hand. One reviewer said it was heavy. I don&#x27;t think so. Light weight to me. And even with these small negatives, I would still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this few weeks ago and I use it every single day , a bit heavy but gives good result</li>
    <li> It is okay for a quick lift, but doesn&#x27;t dry sufficiently. Brush is very soft. I still need to use my traditional hairdryer.</li>
    <li> its good quality; but for my type of hair is not easy to use. but is a very good product!</li>
    <li> I liked a lot, arrived on time, good method of shipement. I recommend it. My hair looks great... thank you very much</li>
    <li> I just got and tested my spin brusher I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair shiny and pretty in a really short time.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy for me to use and style my hair. I totally recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The $37 dollars I paid were totally worthy it!</li>
    <li> Gostoei Very good product, this congratulation.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like my stylist uses (which was a Conair) but this was not it! I returned it.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I cannot say enough for this product.  I am handicapped with Ataxia - no control over my L/dryer hand-and learned about the product, as I was describing how I kept hitting myself in my poor messed up skull (after three brain surgeries!).  Get ready for the most shiny &amp; beautiful hair!  REALLY!</li>
    <li> Really great way to do hair  Just  .like  getting a great blow ou in a salon but at at home.  Plus it has  a brush attached .all in one.  Just separate your hair up in clips and starting in back bottom layer work around to top last.....really like a salon  blow out.  awesome.</li>
    <li> I have very thick naturally wavy hair that tends to be quite frizzy. I have been in search of something that can tame the frizz and still leave the body and shine. This spin rotating styler does it! I love it! I will say it takes some time to dry my full hair, but when I am in a hurry I take the blow dryer to it for a minute or two and then finish with the brush. It never tangles.</li>
    <li> I must not be very coordinated because I&#x27;ve never been able to create the \\&quot;just got back from the salon\\&quot; look with just a blowdryer and round brush. My hair would always get frizzy because it would take me forever to dry it. Not to mention all the pulling I would have to do to try and get the waves out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Spin Styler really does all the work for you in one device. It smooths, dries, and styles your hair all in one. It did take a little getting used to, but there are plenty of YouTube videos that explain how to use the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing bad I can say about the styler is that if I&#x27;m not being careful, my hair can get stuck on the brush if I&#x27;m not wary of the spinning. That really isn&#x27;t a huge issue because if your hair ever gets caught, you can always spin the brush the other way to untangle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great tool!</li>
    <li> It does work to straighten hair, but the bristles we&#x27;re already starting to beND when I received it.  Bent bristles on a brush are more damaging to the hair.  I had read that the brushes don&#x27;t  hold up well, and I definitely agree that the brush is inferior in quality, which is why I returned it.  The power of the unit on the other hand was very good.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in November for a Christmas gift.  The product has alreay broken with only a few uses.  The return time has expired and now they are stuck with it.  The rotating brush just stopped.  Very disappointed with the purchase of this product.  My advice is not to even try it.</li>
    <li> This product was sent as a gift - my wife already had one and when my sister came to visit she tried and liked the product a lot - two hair thickness here one thick the other fine and this unit works well for both - my sister then received our gft</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know my wife use&#x27;s it but on complains</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 months of use</li>
    <li> Really difficult to use and get the expected results - gave it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> I use a curling brush similar to this already but it does not rotate.  I saw this on TV and thought it would be so much better to have a brush that rotates.  Well, it is not. I tried it out and it kept wrapping itself up in my hair.  It says in the advertisement that you can \\&quot;reverse\\&quot; the brush in case it gets wrapped up in your hair, but apparently it gets tangled alot.  I think I will stick to my non-rotating curling brush.</li>
    <li> This is such a wonderful product.....I have very fine/thin naturally wavy hair....it spins it it straight!  It&#x27;s more then I had expected!</li>
    <li> I might have been expecting a lot from this product considering all of the videos I watched about it..but it is honestly difficult to use. I still haven&#x27;t been able to get the hang of it and the only thing it really helps me with is controlling the frizziness of my hair in the morning. I recommend this product if you have fine hair that is easy to style. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product if you have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I donot know how to use.i watched the video,but  how to use to nice for my hair?also don&#x27;t know.ORZ.this is my mistake .</li>
    <li> I like this a lot!  It does work better on hair that has air dried a bit, but I&#x27;ve used it right out of the shower too, just takes a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Exccellent! I love it,very,very nice. If you want one, buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I want one more,because my hair stay ever beautiful.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to hate this thing because I was hesitant about spending $40+ on hair thing and hoping I could return it. BUT I LOVE IT!!. First of all let me say I am a 35yr old with thinning hair especially toward the bottom of my hair. Shorter in length I would say to the bottom of my neck. Somewhat naturally curly and frizzy especially after a color. I just got my hair colored the other day and ended up with frizzy bottoms. I came home and thought my hair was cute after my hair dresser styled it. My hubby said what happened to your hair? I was mad. I was going to buy a flat iron when I stumbled across this. Let me say I have absolutely no coordination or styling techniques when it comes to hair. Pony tails in my daughters&#x27; hair are a struggle for me. I read reviews about people ripping their hair out and thought oh no I don&#x27;t have any to spare. But I gave it a go and was impressed after my first attempt. Gave me volume around the roots. The hair lost I believe is the same as when you brush it. Hubby came home and said OH your hair looks nice. WOW I thought. It&#x27;s getting easier and easier to use every time. I spray on Got2B guardian angel flat iron balm while my hair is wet, let my hair dry slightly and then proceed with the Infiniti Pro.  Also Amazon has the best price but I bought it locally ONLY because I wanted it this weekend so I could practice before Monday.</li>
    <li> I have just past shoulder length layered hair and this styler makes my hair gorgeous with so little effort.  I dry the areas closest to my scalp with a regular blow dryer and then dry the rest with the styler.  It creates a beautiful curl without tangling and it&#x27;s so much faster than using a curling iron.  Makes a more natural curl than a curling iron does, too.  There is a learning curve but it&#x27;s fun, too!  The packaging is a paper box so you could try it out and return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Finally found a styling tool that&#x27;s not just hype and can actually tame my thick curly hair. Here&#x27;s what works for me:  apply a smoothing lotion all over and a leave-in conditioner on the ends, let hair dry approx. 80% before using the Infinitpro Spin to style (in a hurry use a blow dryer). No need to pin up sections and style a little at a time. I  have used the styler to completely dry/style but it does take a longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I just stepped out of the salon. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but want to see how well it holds up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the lack of heat that comes from this product. It&#x27;s more of a styler than a styler and a dryer combo, So I think it&#x27;s a little Missleading.</li>
    <li> My hair  is fine and thin so it does not give alot of body. The barrel is to big.  Gives alot of shine but leaves my limp.</li>
    <li> For someone who cannot quite handle a ROUND brush while drying, this is perfect! It takes about 10 minutes longer to dry my hair, but when I&#x27;m all done it has SO MUCH body to it. It gives a lot of lift at the root.  When I use a regular brush there is not much body, and then none after using the flat iron.  With this, I can use my flat iron just in the front around my face.  So when I compare the time it took before using this, to now, it would be about the same, since I don&#x27;t need to flat iron my whole head. Doesn&#x27;t tangle either when using the spin feature. I have recommended this item to others.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I did alot of research on rotating spin stylers and this one by far is the best ladies. Did I say incredibly easy to use? This styler does everything except putting your styling product in your hair. I have fine long hair that&#x27;s easily tangled and I can tell you I didn&#x27;t get one tangle which is a big plus. Once you get familiar with the spin button it takes no time at all to dry and style your hair. Your hair comes out smooth and shiny. It&#x27;s a large styler but don&#x27;t be put off by that it&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;m not one for taking time to style my hair but I was so impressed how little time it did take, only 25mins. For long hair that&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this product to give me a salon quailty blow-out everyday! Thank you Conair, this is a great idea!</li>
    <li> This is the first product thal allowed me to blow dry and style my haIr at the same time.  I can honestly say that this tool makes it possible for me to style my hair as well as a professional.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this product after my Revlon brush styler gave out. I have thick hair and what I least liked about this was the heat settings. The highest setting on this felt like the medium setting on my Revlon. Also, I don&#x27;t know if it was because it was my first time using it, my hair would sometimes get caught between the edges of the brush when rotation. Other than that I did get a shinny salon style blowout hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I have short, thick hair, and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to blow dry and flat iron every morning. I didn&#x27;t think this product would work, given my hair type, but it dries pretty well. Now I don&#x27;t need to burn the crap out of my hair (and sometimes neck, ears, and fingers) all the time with the flat iron! It takes the same amount of time, but it&#x27;s far more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other buyers complain about it being bulky and the buttons being hard to use... I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. It was all pretty ergonomic and intuitive for me.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a rotating brush that will include the blow dryer. While this has both aspects the blow dryer power leaves a lot to be desired. I have taken to using it along with an additional blow dryer to actually get the job done. It has barely any power in the rotation and or the dryer. I hope they continue to work on the product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunatelly the cold air doesn´t work as expected, and the ceramic part is not detachable but is a good product</li>
    <li> The product arrived super fast. Once you get a hang of how the brush spins and what style you want, it&#x27;s really easy to use. I was done with my whole head in about 20mins (and it was my first time using the brush, so i took a little longer because I was getting used to how the brush works), compared to the 1hr it would take to blow out my extremely curly hair with a dryer. It leaves my hair super shining, soft and filled with volume and style and saves me lots of time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  It&#x27;s easy to use once you get the hang of it.  It works really well on damp to almost dry hair, and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot so I never burn myself.  I bought the Instyler when it first came out and liked it.  This product is different- the brush/barrel is much larger so you get a lot of body, and it can spin either way which is very helpful.  You choose which way it spins by pushing a button.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone who uses a large round brush and blow dryer to style their hair.  It&#x27;s much less work, and you get the same results! Great value!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were a little hotter on the high heat setting, and cooler on the cool setting.</li>
    <li> I like this thing when I have the time to use it properly, but I often don&#x27;t have the time and patience it takes.  It takes a long time because you need to first blow-dry a bit to remove excess water, then dry thoroughly with the styler using small sections at a time.  If you leave any dampness, the hair falls flat again. Another thing to note is if you have colored hair, the direct heat can fade it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I like the results.  It straightens my hair and leaves it with a nice curl at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch some tutorials on Youtube to help get an idea of how to use it, if you&#x27;re having trouble.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because I had read a review that stated it didn&#x27;t work that well on long hair and may I just say that review was WRONG. I have really long hair that goes down to the middle of my back in length and this Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler works miracles!!! My husband loves my hair straight and I have struggled with using different shampoos, conditioners and styling products that claim to leave your hair straight and frizz free. I hoped that by buying this I could achieve that straight frizz free look and I was able to do just that effortlessly! I didn&#x27;t have to add any product prior to using, I just used my everyday normal shampoo/conditioner (VO5 Brand) in the shower then dried my hair with blow dryer until about 90% dry as it states on the box. I then used the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler and it did take some getting use to with the way it rotates, but I mastered it within a day or two and now I can get my hair done in 10 minutes. Let me explain how life changing this product can be, I literally almost cut my hair prior to buying this product because I didn&#x27;t think I could achieve the look I was going for (ultra sleek and smooth long hair) but then I took a chance and I am so thankful I did!!! I get so many compliments on my hair and everyone thinks I am using a flat iron WRONG AGAIN, I am using this which I have used now for almost 3 weeks and I have ZERO damage to my hair. It is worth every penny and much cheaper here on AMAZON then at other retailers such as Wal-Mart where I was yesterday and priced it at around $50 plus for exact same product. If you are stuck on whether to give this product a try, I hope that you will give it a chance as I did and see how amazing it can make your hair look and feel!!! THANK YOU CONAIR FOR MAKING MY HAIR MORE BEAUTIFUL THEN I EVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE!!!</li>
    <li> This product was just horrible for my hair. I have very curly, frizzy, color treated hair. It doesnt straighten well or maintain shape at all. I used this on my moms, brothers, and grandmothers hair and it worked beautifully for them. They all have thin, unfrizzy, color treated hair. My hair is fairly thick and has a lot of split ends. I even used serum to calm my hair down, but it just wouldnt do. I recommend this to anyone who has thin hair that responds well to styling tools or has thin hair and is looking for a quick way to blow dry their hair and style it with ease.</li>
    <li> Chose this hair styler/drier because it curled while rotating. I really like the concept particularly for freshening up hair style between shampoos. However the roller is way too big except for Rapunzel. This product would be better if the roller head was interchangeable with medium and small sizes. If I get a hair cut it becomes useless.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brushing hoping for a high shine, less frizzy, and more silkier hairstyle after washing my hair.  So far, it&#x27;s producing more of a voluminous hairstyle with medium-high shine.  It takes some practice to get use to the rotating forward/backward buttons that spin the bristles and I&#x27;ve lost quite a bit of hair in the process.  I naturally have thick hair so adding extra volume into my hair isn&#x27;t quite the look I&#x27;m going for.  Nevertheless, my hair looks shinier than if I were to just blowdry it so this brush is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool (for a very reasonable price).  I have straight, fine hair in a layered bob and this tool - especially if I take the time - is like having my hairstylist right there doing the work.  I can create lots of volume and accomplish things I am too lazy to do with just my round brush.  I use my traditional dryer to get out the initial dampness and switch to this to finish the process and really set the style.  I can honestly say I have not had one bad hair day since using it.  I do not necessarily agree it saves time, but it makes consistently achieving the style I want much easier.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly frizzy hair and this spin brush styler is amazing. I can completely dry and style my hair in about 30 minutes. My hair comes out very soft and smooth. Only wish it could lock out moisture because if it&#x27;s humid outside my hair frizzes.  Would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love the way it works but for my hair the brush needs to be about half the circumference. This product would be greal for very long,thick hair. Mine is not quite shoulder length and quite thin and fine so I need one with a smaller circumference. Does this product come with a smaller brush?</li>
    <li> I was reallly excited abut this but when it came it was in a shabby box and half of the bristles were already distorted I was soo disappointed! Didnt even bother turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;Then I emailed DealYard and they gladly sent me a replacement but it was second hand and ahd loads of hair stuck in it!! GROSS! Is this a joke? They should ahve atleast taken the hair out!&lt;br /&gt;The porduct itself is 3stars not everything it claims to be. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Adds volume but does not dry your hair very well nor does it straighten them nicely.</li>
    <li> Over rated gets stuck in your hair and does not dry hair .i am a Latina and my hair doesn&#x27;t air dry so i was hoping i found something to make my hair drying easier so i didnt need a flat iron or blow dryer.not the case it may work for those with thinner hair and shorter hair but anyone with thick or long hair dont buy it.it also doesnt curl well</li>
    <li> I saw someone using this on youtube and had to give it a try. it&#x27;s always been a struggle for me to replicate a blowout like my hair stylist (Hold and rotating the brush while using the hair dryer), but with this, it looks perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that I might not get the same shine as with a hair dryer since this doesn&#x27;t blow very hot, but the end result was just as smooth (and probably better for my hair since it wasn&#x27;t as hot). It takes maybe a little longer than with my hair dryer and brush (although with more practice, I&#x27;ll probably get faster), but its so easy and foolproof.</li>
    <li> I stand by my orginal reveiw but please be sure to see my updated comments at the bottom!&lt;br /&gt;I will begin this review by mentioning that I am a licensed cosmetologist with over 25 years experience styling hair and an unabashed hair appliance junky. When I walk through a store that sells blow dryers, flat irons, hot rollers I always peruse them. I have at least a dozen flat irons, ten curling irons, 4 sets of hot rollers, hooded dryers both hard top and bonnet style. This does not include the dozens of things I&#x27;ve given away over the years or the things I&#x27;ve bought and didn&#x27;t like so I returned. The bottom line is there is not a type of hair appliance on the planet I haven&#x27;t tried and I have never been more impressed by the performance of a hair appliance than I am with this Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler. I&#x27;ve used products similar to this many times but this is far superior to anything I&#x27;ve ever used. That ridiculous waste of money InStyler, which I returned, doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I colored my hair dark blond for many year and last year I got carried away making it lighter and lighter platinum until I finally fried it to the point of no return. So last January had no choice but to cut off my beautiful long thick wavy hair and what little hair was left was still extremely damaged. I brought my color back to the medium/dark brown I was born with but it was still damaged and so short I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with it. I began slicking it back in a French twist and wearing clip on hair pieces. This has worked well because my hair always looks good and it&#x27;s so easy to do, but I missed being able to style my own hair. Using a blow-dryer and flat iron was so much work and the results were always disappointing. When I saw a commercial for this and became curious. I was dubious that the large 2 inch barrel would not work well in my short hair, while my length is nearly to my shoulders because of the damage I had to layer my hair, so it is about five inches around. Also because of the layers my hair has become very curly and gets knotted and frizzy. Not very attractive! In a review I read a when I was thinking about buying this a woman complained about having to still dry her hair most of the way before using this. The fact is your hair should always be about 80% dry before you start to style it. When I&#x27;m blow drying a clients hair I use the blow-dryer to take out most of the moisture before I pick up a brush. For my own hair I usually let it air dry. So with my hair damp and I started using  the Infinitipro first at the bottom and it easily starts to glide through my hair, no tangles or knotting, just effortlessly gliding. Plus even though the bristles are soft it is easily picking up my hair. I&#x27;m psyched but this is the longest part of my hair so I go to the top and that is when I discover you can easily switch directions, I never read the instructions, so now I&#x27;m getting really excited because it is light and easy to hold and I don&#x27;t have to twist my arms in to odd ways to hold he Infinitipro where I need it. Then the most amazing thing happened, as I&#x27;m holding it at the top of my Occipital bone the brush starts to pick up hair from below buts it isn&#x27;t knotting. It&#x27;s just gliding. If I hold my hand steady it doesn&#x27;t do this but so If I want to add fullness to one spot, but that gliding and picking up hair is great for smoothing. I was finished in about ten minutes and my hair looked amazing for the first time in a year. I used my flat iron just to make it a bit straighter, it took about three minutes because it was alreasy nice and smooth and it looked fantastic. I almost began to cry with joy that my hair actually looked good for the first time in a year!I went to cosmetology school in high school and in the twenty five years I have done this professionally I have used at least a hundred different hair appliances. I&#x27;ve tried every sold on TV gimmicky product, every type of professional product and every type of drug store product. This product is unique and exceptional so buy it with confidence. Make sure you dry your hair about 80% before using it and be AMAZED at the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Update December 2, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I still love this product and still give it 5 stars but a recent question Amazon asked me to answer about using this is African American hair made me want to update my review. I have moderately thick hair with a loose natural curl but the texture is not coarse. I don&#x27;t think this product will work well in hair that is coarse in texture, very thick or with extremely tight curl. The bristles are very soft and I find I need to take small sections and on the top I need to softly cup the brush so it will pick up my hair. They probably make the bristles so soft so they don&#x27;t tangle the hair but I think they could make them a bit firmer without that happening. I also think it would help if they made out a 1 ½ inch brush. For thicker coarse hair I recommend the Conair 2-in-1 Hot Air Brush which I also own and like a lot. I never had any use for the regular bristle brush but the 1 ½ inch brush with the plastic bristles works really well. IMPORTANT NOTE: There are several models of this brush make sure you get the one with at least 1000 watts of power or it won&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth your hair. It doesn&#x27;t spin on its own but it&#x27;s still easy to use if you work section by section and spin the appliance yourself. Take about a one inch section and starting at the scalp pull the brush down the section, then roll the section up let it heat up well, and then pull it down again. Repeat this on the section until you get the smooth result you&#x27;re looking for. This will give the hair some flip so if you&#x27;re looking for straight you&#x27;ll need to finish with a flat iron, but it will only take a quick pass or two.  This is also true of your hair is very coarse, you may get better result and have them last longer with a quick pass of a flat iron. I still think it is a good product and does what it says it will do. Once again both of these items are styling products so you need to dry your hair about 80% before using it or it will not work well. Good Luck! One last suggestion, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on cheap flat irons, buy a Chi, Rusk, Bayless, anything that normally retails for at least $150, you can find them much cheaper on Amazon or even at TJ Maxx or Marshalls. Cheap flat irons don&#x27;t work nearly as well or as quickly.</li>
    <li> I got this because my inverted bob is growing out.  My stylist put in layers and styled it awesome with a blow dryer and round brush however its hard to get the same style doing it myself.  I bought this and it works like a dream!</li>
    <li> I have wanted to get an Instyler but settled for this because it&#x27;s cheaper and looked like it had the same results. Boy, I was wrong! I got my hair straightened the first time I used an Instyler (my cousin&#x27;s) and finished in 10mins or so. For this Infiniti Pro, my hair was awful even after spending a full 30mins doing it!!! And to think I only straighten the upper layer of my hair, not all of it! Some reviews say it takes practice. Well I didnt buy a product to see results after a month and expect to go out with awful hair that long! And, they didn&#x27;t specify that this uses a US 110v polarized plug. As I&#x27;m not from the US, I had to buy a power converter which cost me the same amount as the Infiniti Pro. With the total I spent, I should have just bought an Instyler from Australia.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the Infinitipro Spin air brush.  To be honest I am usually a little disappointed with hair appliances.  I have relatively short, thick, fine, and curly hair.  In the warm months of summer it is just easier to let it curl naturally but in the fall and winter I like a smoother look.  I am thrilled with this item.  I have always had trouble using a hair dryer and a brush to dry my hair.  Rollers are just too time consuming.  The spin brush is easy to use especially after using it a couple of times.  It gives my hair a lot of volume and also, according to my teenage niece, makes my hair look really shiny.  I am almost tempted to buy another one as a back up!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to when you use it as directed.  I have only gotten my hair tangled a few times, and unwinding in the opposit direction has taken care of the snarls.  You can only use it for drying slightly damp hair, so I just let mine air dry for a bit while I finish getting ready and then do my hair.  It saves me from trying to work a round brush and the hair dryer to style my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered that dryer 6 month before, since that moment I am not dissapointed. Instead, I highly recommend this product to anyone. I already present few of those to my mom, sister, friend.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Instyler rotation iron over 3 years ago and never liked it. I ended up giving it away. It never did my hair any better than a regular blow dryer with a round brush.  I was hesitant to purchase this spin dryer because of my previous experience with the Instyler but I was desperate to lose the frizz and get some body without constantly frying my hair with my straight iron. What a completely different experience this time around!  I love this spin brush.  I have medium length, fine and frizzy hair that hangs limply. This rotating spin brush has given my hair body, style and makes it almost frizz free.  I can even go without using my straightening iron! It is so much easier to use than a blowdryer!  My hair isn&#x27;t completely frizz free, but almost and with how much fuller it is, I&#x27;ll take the almost!  Awesome styling product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime devotee of hot air brushes and even though I already have a regular one, I am glad I bought this one.  The spinning action helps smooth the hair and curl the hair in or out very quickly.  Using this is much easier than wrangling a round brush and a blow dryer with thick hair.  I had an easy time learning to use this, even without reading the instructions, and it smoothed my hair so quickly.  This would be perfect for smoothing and defining layered hair that is longer than chin length (the barrel is too big for anything shorter than that). Another nice thing about this brush is that it comes with a cover, which is nice for travel and storage. All of my other air brushes have not had covers, so they either snag clothes or get their bristles bent during travel.  Overall, I love this brush and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the barrel is large, about 2&amp;#34;, so it gives you a really big curl, which can be limiting for shorter hair (a flip out could look weirdly disproportionate). Also, it does pull out some hair when you spin the brush, but this is no more than if you styled it with a round brush and blow dryer.  Finally, if you are using this on your ends, you could only flip it in or out, not just have the ends hang straight down.  The styling video says you can use this to add volume at the roots, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  I also don&#x27;t think you could use this to curl the entire length of your hair.  Finally, don&#x27;t expect this to replace your blow dryer-- this is only for styling once your hair is damp or dry.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this out. It doesn&#x27;t work las advertised. I have no problem curling my hair with a curling iron or curlers, or with straightening with a flat iron. However, this wouldn&#x27;t curl or straighten. It wouldn&#x27;t even curl my ends under or flip them out. My hair just fell limp. The only good thing I can say about it is it seemed to make my hair shiny. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Very noisy, broke after first use (stopped spinning), not so ergonomic and handy as it might see.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gif for my sister and it blew away in couple of hours :(. I will not recommended to it for gift s</li>
    <li> I was afraid that my hair would tangle with the spinning brush...it does not.  It does give my hair lift and shine.  The only problem that I have found is that it does create static in my hair.  Takes a lot of \\&quot;product\\&quot; to keep the static down.  I think this is easy to use.  I usually dry my hair with a blow dryer until it is just damp and then use the Infinitpro Spin Air Rotating Styler.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Perfect for those of us who want to blow-out our hair that are not hairstyle savvy in using a separate hairdryer and round brush.  I have one problem--the 2\\&quot; barrel does not work on all hair types.  I have super straight, thin, fine hair with layers and the large round brush does not grab my hair to create a bend or curl to produce volume my hair so needs and I so desire.  I don&#x27;t understand why the company cannot produce this product with interchangeable round brush sizes such as 2\\&quot;, 1-1/2&#x27;, and 1\\&quot; sizes or offer different size barrels.  Not all hair types are the same and this product will work well only with long, thick hair.  Unfortunately, I will have to return this product only because of the brush size.  I will keep watching to see if Conair will make this same product with different brush sizes that will work with my hair type.  I will certainly buy the product and be able to use it.  I hope they do!</li>
    <li> For years I had problem for styling my hair using round combs and hair dryers, for handling both of them at the same time and I was never satisfied with the results, I usually spent a lot of time and at the end my hair was not shiny and straight enough! I even sometimes ended in burning my hairs due to a close contact of the hair dryer with my hair :[&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome, I have used it twice since I bought it (last week!) and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the result!&lt;br /&gt;The Brush is soft enough so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair (a problem that I had with many round combs). You are the one who is controlling the rotating part, so you can stop it when ever you want with releasing a button or change the rotation direction. The warm blow is warm and not hot, so you will have problem if you want to use it for drying wet hairs but with damp hairs it acts perfect and you are sure you won&#x27;t burn your hairs with this close contact.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is with the connection of the rotating part and the top part, some times my hairs get stuck there and get off, they could have designed this part better.&lt;br /&gt;But in total, Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler has become my hair saloon at home!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this styler.  I have long thin straight hair.  I tried everything to try and achieve the full body style that I get when the hair dresser blows out my hair.  Hot curlers or a large curling iron work a little, but the style goes flat in a few hours.  When I style my damp hair with the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, my hair has a nice wave, lots of body, and the look lasts until the next time I wash my hair.  The styler is really easy to use.  I dry my hair part way with the regular dryer, section my hair into small sections, and dry it the rest of the way with the styler.  It only takes me 15 minutes from start to finish.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product, while it does a great job of a quick fix to your hair in smoothing it out and styling it, the hair is terribly damaged by its use.  My hairdresser had to treat my hair with several conditioning sessions due to the damage. And I did not even use it that often.  Sadly, the price you pay for lovely styled hair eventually is damaged, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.  I did not return it because it really does work, it just soon burns your hair.</li>
    <li> I have like this brush and wish they will make attachments with differant size of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Master stylist.&lt;br /&gt;at *** Inspired Design Hair Studio ***</li>
    <li> IT MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO SOMEONE WITH WAVY OR CURLY HAIR.  NO NOTICEABLE VOLUME ADDED&lt;br /&gt;TO MY FINE HAIR.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it!  I get compliments EVERY time I take the time to dry my hair using this amazing dryer.  Takes a little getting used to, but even I have learned how to put some great waves in my hair!  Highly recommend to everyone who wants to look their best!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair. It&#x27;s just below my shoulders and I love the round brushed look my stylist achieves after each visit with her. I was struggling to do the technique with just my blow drier and my round brush so I began investigating my options. I had read that this styler was hard to use and that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough for someone with coarse hair, but decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t love it the first time I used it. My hair didn&#x27;t dry completely as I was styling and it got frizzy even before I finished. So the next time I used it I let my hair air dry until it was about 50% dry, then I sectioned my hair out just like my stylist does and from the nape of my neck began by taking very small sections and went very slowly moving up along my head. I had to take frequent breaks because my arms did get tired and overall it took me about an hour to achieve the lovely curvy blowout I was going for. It does work, you just have to go slowly, use product that is designed for the look that you want and make sure your hair isn&#x27;t super wet when you start. I definitely recommend this styling product, but it&#x27;s not going to be a quick blow and go-it does take a little work and a little time.</li>
    <li> This is my second one, I love this spin brush</li>
    <li> I am not very handy when it comes to styling my hair.  The Infiniti Pro works wonders on my hair.  I had one and was concerned about what I would do if it no longer worked.  I recently purchased two more.  If you ever plan to discontinue this item, please let me know and I will buy a dozen!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get something straight, people. And I&#x27;m not just talking about your hair. I have tried just about every single product out there, from 450 degree flat irons that literally fry my hair (and face sometimes), to crazy contraption blow dryers, to weird-looking bristle brushes. If you have long, wavy hair that (on most days) just doesn&#x27;t want to behave, just buy this brush and do yourself a favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to get the hang of it, but once I figured out how to best work the brush, it was GENIUS. I let my hair dry about 80% and then separated it into sections, turned the heat on high (which you&#x27;d be surprised at how hot it gets), and then lowered the heat to finish styling. BAM.</li>
    <li> I have a curly hair. So, I do relax it every two or three month. I do almost dryer my hair every day to go to work. I use the Infiniti Pro by Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler after I dryer my hair to add volume. It works for me.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and love it. This product works just as described.</li>
    <li> It is not dual voltage...it needs an adapter..</li>
    <li> it dosnt get hot enough</li>
    <li> This product really sucked because it does not get hot enough to dry your hair- and I have short baby fine hair so if you have a full head of hair that&#x27;s thick, forget it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for any hair type.</li>
    <li> This works very well on my shoulder-length hair. I don&#x27;t use it on wet hair, waiting until it&#x27;s only slightly damp. I especially like using it when our high humidity causes my dry hair to frizz out. It smooths it, and I can do a quick flip at the ends.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I have very curly hair and I blow dry my hair almost every day. In the past it was a painful, lenghty and tiring process. After a while my arms got tired from moving the brush and moving the hair dryer, pulling the hair... Then I found the Infiniti! WOW. I separate the hair, which does not take long. Then I take a part and roll it in the brush and I remain still while THE BRUSH does ALL the work, not me! Styles while drying and meanwhile I can even check my email or send text with my other hand on my phone. Awesome! Totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that is quite heavy, as I have a lot of it. Sadly, I have never been able to properly work a round brush--my hair just won&#x27;t hold a \\&quot;bend\\&quot; like when the salons do it. Thankfully, this tool makes up for my massive styling deficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I haven&#x27;t found that it gives my roots much volume (though this could be user error...), it is terrific for smoothing my hair, which is fairly straight but with many wavy kinks. The best part is that it gives my ends some shape and bounce, making my hair look so much more polished than when I blow-dry it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users have said, your hair should be mostly dry, as it would take a long time to dry it with this tool alone. However, if you are looking for that salon blow-out look without much effort, this is a fantastic solution.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and works good for a quick hair do every morning. It gives nice volume to my hair and adds shine.</li>
    <li> It is not a hair dryer and I will have to use it a few times before I give my full review. I used it only once  and it seems okay.</li>
    <li> What a fun and functional dryer. I have pretty curly hair and love how I can curl and style my hair in one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure your hair is about 75% dry before using or your arm might get pretty tired!</li>
    <li> I could not use this product as it was too clumsy to hold on to. I would not recommend this for anyone with any mechanical challenge like arthritis.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have very long layered naturally wavy hair. It does take a long time to dry (helps to get most of the dampness out by using a blow dryer or air dry before using styler. Every time I use it I get compliments on my hair for a couple days (I only wash every 3 days). I touch up with the styler every morning on a non-wash day. I get beautiful fullness and a cute flip at the end of each layer. Much easier to use this styler than hold a roll brush with one hand and a blow dryer with the other. You have more control and the results are beautiful, smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s tricky at first, but once you get used to the speed of the roller, it&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the days that I wear my hear curly, I wet my long bangs and us the styler to smooth them out and keep the back wavy. Great beach look.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my beloved Revo Styler died and found out they weren&#x27;t available anymore. The barrel of the brush is not as large as the Revo. It is about the size of a jumbo sized roller. The bristles are soft plastic, the more you use it, the softer the feel - it will be interesting to see how long they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this is how much it saves on arm/wrist strain when blowing out your hair. I&#x27;ve got naturally fine, curly hair and this does a great job of styling it into big waves. If I want to go totally straight, I follow with a straightener. The hot air that flows through it is also nice and cuts down on drying time when you use another blow dryer (for me, with diffuser) as you get air flow from the inside and out. It is probably best to section out your hair to dry. You don&#x27;t need to, but when you don&#x27;t, hair at the end of the brush can get picked up by the bristles and twisted. So far I haven&#x27;t had any painful accidents, but it does cause more curl in your hair if you don&#x27;t then go back and brush/roll it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is large and easy to grasp and the rotation buttons (one for either direction) don&#x27;t cause much strain in your grip. The cool setting is nice, although I wish it would continue to rotate - the rotation does not work in cool mode and it is a bit cumbersome to change from hot to cool while the brush is rotating in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, so far I&#x27;m glad to have another rotating brush that saves me time and energy when getting ready in the morning!</li>
    <li> Love it! I have thick hair so I quickly use a traditional hairdryer first until my hair is damp, then I use the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler to style my hair. It&#x27;s easy and quick. Best hair tool ever!</li>
    <li> It works ok but its not the greatest product but better then most  doesnt make my hair bounce aremuch volume!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my other hot styler fizzled out.&lt;br /&gt;This one takes some getting used to - but after 2-3 times, you understand the function and flow of the buttons.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint would be the size. It&#x27;s huge. It takes up a lot of space.&lt;br /&gt;My old styler could pop apart (top from the bottom) and it would store easily or travel easily.&lt;br /&gt;I need to make sure I have plenty of luggage space for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bright side: I do see great body and a great shine when I use it.  Just different than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product. It pulls my hair out sometimes when it gets caught between the rotating and stationary part. The bristles are too soft so it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair well. I also own the John Frieda hot air brush and it doesn&#x27;t rotate but it has soft and stiff bristles and grips my hair much better. This brush is 2&amp;#34; and the John Frieda one is 1 1/2&amp;#34; (I believe)... I prefer my John Frieda since it does not pull my hair out. If I could combine these two products, I would have the perfect brush....until then, I just alternate between the two.</li>
    <li> This is realyl fun to use.  For my hair tho, I would like one with a barrel 1/2&amp;#34; smaller in diameter.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and fast without any tangle hair. Best recommend to have one. Will not regret. Worth it</li>
    <li> Was a great tool but did not last long bought this in Sept 2012 then it died on me that is not very long.</li>
    <li> I got a used item with someone elses hair in it!!!!!!!  I&#x27;m so disgusted!!  Not only was it used, it was broken.  where is the inventory control??!!  Very disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is great, it works better than I expected and cheaper than in the stores, sorry still need to write five more words</li>
    <li> when i saw this product online..i was so excited since i&#x27; have very limp hair...i immediately ordered it...but when it arrived..i was greatly disappointed...it&#x27;s too bulky , unportable, but above all this it&#x27;s made of a very cheap quality material...it dint show any problem in first two uses but after the third use...its spinning head started subluxating and had difficulty spinning...it stopped spinning altogether...bristles are fragile and gives way after few uses...all in all...a great concept for hair..but i wish it was of better quality for the price ...</li>
    <li> It is powerful and light and you can hold it easily. I love it more than all of the other ones that I had.</li>
    <li> I  was afraid I would not be able to use it - but on the first try I managed to get the look I was aiming for!  I have short fine hair and I was afraid it was too big at 2&amp;#34; round - but with a little practice it did great!!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting this product but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. The bristles are too soft, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair and it&#x27;s not powerful enough for my type of hair (just 500 watts). I have long curly hair and  before using it I used a regular blow drier until it was about 80 to 90% dry as recomended by manufacturer and what a mess. It made my hair soooo frizzy. I think it&#x27;s still a good product but for people who have thin straight hair that just want to add some volume as opposed to having it all flat. After doing some research I found out that for my type of hair I needed a more powerful hot hair brush and that&#x27;s why I decided to give the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot air brush a chance. I haven&#x27;t done my full hair with it but wanted to test out the frequent complaints I saw such as weight and noise and  love it so far. It&#x27;s not heavy at all and not too loud for having 1200 watts.</li>
    <li> I hope they sell replacement heads for this because I plan on using this a lot! This is the fastest I&#x27;ve ever done my hair and it looks amazing. The price point you can&#x27;t beat!</li>
    <li> I just love this spinbrush styler - it is fabulous and definitely worth purchasing!  I have never been able to blow dry my hair with a traditional blowdryer and separate brush and get the salon look.  With the Infiniti Pro Rotating Styler, my hair which is just below shoulder length and fine in texture, looks like I just walked out of the salon!  It is silky and shiny - so happy I found this styler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 31, 2014 - Further to my review on April 25, 2014, just after I purchased the Infiniti Pro Conair Spin Air Rotating Styler, I feel the need to update my review.  After only just over 7 weeks of twice a week use, the bristles on this styler, which are very soft, are not standing up at all - they are no longer straight but now bend in all different directions so this styler no longer works the way it did at first - twice a week does not equate to overuse so I am very disappointed that this styler will need to be replaced soon given the bristles do not last.</li>
    <li> I have short, thick hair that stays straight no matter what. I used mousse and the spin air rotating styler and managed to give my short bob some life. It gets rid of my cowlick, which no other products I&#x27;ve used could do. My style holds up all day, even through the gym. It can be used when your hair is damp or dry (not dripping wet though because the air current isn&#x27;t strong enough for that). It takes me less than 10 minutes to do my hair. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using it. I have recommended this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Cheap product , stopped working within 2 months of purchases , Started to smoke thankfully did not burn the hair - What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Makes my hair full and shiny...Love it.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 chances. Sent the defected product back to the seller twice, and on the third try again, the product just did not work. I got to use it 3 times. The times that it did work, it was great. But I didn&#x27;t get more than one use from each different product. It was just a waste of 40$. Don&#x27;t invest</li>
    <li> Easily tangles hair. Does what advertised but is not  easy to use. Hair cannot be too wavy or too straight for best results.</li>
    <li> I bought for a friend because she felt in love wen she tried the one I had already bought for myself!!</li>
    <li> Great turn around from order to receipt. Best styling tool I&#x27;ve ever bought. Cuts prep time into half. Really love how soft my hair feels after  using it.</li>
    <li> I like it...but only if my hair length is at my shoulders. Any longer and it is just so much easier to use a round brush &amp; hair dryer. Really cool idea and maybe they&#x27;ll make larger sizes some day.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I wanted. Barrel is very large. Doesn&#x27;t give much body but maybe I need to use it more. Little tricky learning how.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair tool ever! Works great on long or short hair. Much easier to use than an individual round brush &amp; hair dryer. I would HIGHLY recommend this to all !</li>
    <li> Despite a lot of practice, this simply does not produce a smooth and straight finish for coarse, loosly curly bangs.  I thought I could replace my tried and true blowdryer &amp; roundbrush routine with this all in one styler.  The directions say to practice and so I did....now it is too late to return the item!</li>
    <li> This a great styler. Helps to smooth hair and eliminate frizz. The brush, however, could be a little smaller to use with short hair.</li>
    <li> Honestly love this thing. It&#x27;s a bit bulky but it does so much for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine short hair and it makes styling a breeze.  It saves time and is easy to use on damp or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the equivalent, Babyliss Big Hair in the UK. I was visiting my daughter in Texas for a month so I thought I would gift it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it is fine whilst just hot air but as soon as you make the brush revolve it trips the electrical system. It is possible it is the house electrics but it is a new well built house and I had no problems with an ordinary hair drier on the same socket.</li>
    <li> I love this styler.  It automatically rotates so that you do not need 2 hands to fumble through the process of drying with a round brush to create volume.  This creates volume with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> A LIFE SAVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not that difficult to operate and it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;It did not damage my hair!</li>
    <li> This is my second Infinitipro Spin Air Brush. The first one I bought stopped rotating after only a few uses so I sent it back in hopes that the new one was going to be better. Unfortunately I must say even thought I find it somewhat useful there&#x27;s a lot of space for improvement. I have long wavy hair. This brush has not shorten the time it takes me to blow dry my hair straight, it is more a styling tool than anything else. I can not use it when my hair is very wet or completely dry as it will not do anything for it. The brush only works for 80% dry hair like it is stated in the instructions. I don&#x27;t think is hard to use at all but I surely wish it had more power. The air that comes out of it is not very warm or strong and it could rotate a bit faster too (maybe the second one I got is also defective?). Also, it is a big and heavy, nothing i can&#x27;t handle but a little too big. I&#x27;ve also notice there&#x27;s a lot of hairs on the brush once I&#x27;m done. I must say though that my hair looks shiny and nicely styled when I finish.</li>
    <li> Very good! It really does give your hair that shine and volume. It works much better on damp hair, and it does the job real quick! I love how soft my hair feels, and its movable, not all stiff and dry, like a flat iron leaves your hair,! Its great. I had purshased one at walgreens, because it was on sale! When I saw how good it was I ordered one on Amazon, and gave it as a gift for my mother! She loves it too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would do much for my naturally curly hair (sorry, I don&#x27;t know the internet hair lingo but I am a black woman with soft curly hair). I have a funky haircut that I can easily wear both curly and straight (think mohawk with the back shaved as well) and wanted something convenient to blow dry my hair before flat-ironing it. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair on my own very much because it&#x27;s usually exhausting, frustrating and I end up burning myself in the process. I have the Instyler and, even though it was somewhat effective, I would still have to flat iron my hair afterwards. By that time, I was already worried about the amount of heat I was exposing it to and I would have trouble reaching all parts of my hair. Plus, I was concerned about using the Instyler while my hair was still damp, even though the manufacturer says it is safe. I needed something to take me safely from wet hair to the flat-iron stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this not expecting much and it surpassed my expectations! It is easy to use. The brush is soft yet effective. It does a good job of blow drying my hair so that I don&#x27;t have to do too much flat-ironing afterwards. Also, I don&#x27;t have to do anything but lightly towel dry my hair beforehand so no need to worry if your hair is thick. I think they just say that to cover their asses. Plus, I got it when the price dropped so I&#x27;m quite satisfied with what I paid for it. It actually makes me want to grow my hair long again just to wear it straight. As a curly girl, I can honestly say this makes me want to wear my hair straight more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that I will probably have to replace it sooner than I would like mainly because the bristles of the brush seem to be wearing out quickly. Also, I have noticed that a lot of my hair seems to get left behind in the barrel. I do wish it would get a wee bit hotter but overall, I would recommend it to my friends and I will repurchase when this one breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used to have to go to the salon to get my hair straightened well but now I just use this and my flat-iron. I&#x27;m about to donate the Instyler to someone who can use that frustrating piece of crap!</li>
    <li> blow out in a box! its amazing. hands down the best tool to use before going out</li>
    <li> I Truely love this hair dried . It does everything it sas it will do. Wish they had smaller hair brsuch for shorter hair but other than that great quick and easy to use leaves hair feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews I bought one. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and cut down some of my time blow drying + flat ironing my long voluminous hair. Oh well, that never happened. I got my Infinipro dryer as promised, but the bristles are too soft and doesn&#x27;t grab the amount of hair it needs to really style my hair. I tried dividing my hair into sections but it took forever and still didn&#x27;t do the job. The only good thing is that if I blow dry my hair with a round brush all the way and then use the Infinitipro, I can manage better my bangs and style my hair more like Charlie&#x27;s Angels (in a good way), which I couldn&#x27;t do before. Also my hair is too long for this dryer, if I try to get the brush closer to my scalp my hair gets tangled and I have to rotate it the other way.</li>
    <li> It is not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably owned about 10-12 hair dryers, one or two of which had some sort of brush. None worked as well as this in giving me smooth, straight hair with body. Great product!</li>
    <li> When I received it, the brush was wrapped like it was just put back in the box and when I opened it, there was hair on the brush. DIRTY!  I had this shipped to my mom&#x27;s address for a special occasion event so I needed it. I cleaned the brushes and then when I went to use it, the brush spin was not very powerful and I have thin hair. I had used my sister in laws exact same brush and model and it worked great?? Remanufactured???</li>
    <li> I watched the youtube videos before I purchased and it honestly does work if you follow the directions. You still need a regular blow dryer since you can&#x27;t use it on wet hair. Hair must only be damp.</li>
    <li> I have slightly wavy Asian hair that is long and layered.  My hair sometimes would get caught where the plastic connects at the top (not the bristle area).  To try to avoid this I work on a smaller section of hair at a time, but am not always successful.  It takes a while to straighten my hair, and it&#x27;s not very effective at curling the ends.  I have to dry my hair with a blowdryer till almost dry before using the Styler. Overall the product works to an extent and is easier than holding a brush in the other hand, but it takes more time because I think it doesn&#x27;t blow hard and hot enough in the right direction.  I&#x27;ve had this Styler for about a month.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing!!!</li>
    <li> i did not like this because it dose not deliver as it suppose to do for long hair , i have to dry my hair first then use this product for styling , for short hair is ok . i don&#x27;t recommend it for long hair.</li>
    <li> This item needs to be taken off the shelves. It doesn&#x27;t curl good for one thing and it is so easy to hit the spin switches, located right next each other and go on if your finger slips a little, wrapping your hair tight to the scalp and then it is hard to get it turned off.  It wraps so fast when this happens that you don&#x27;t even know what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to put the spin switch somewhere else and make it so you have to turn it on forward or reverse like you do a drill.  As long as you don&#x27;t accidentally hit the switches, which you can handle avoid doing, it does straighten hair well and will put a little curl at the very bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this item very dangerous especially if used by someone other than a hair stylist.</li>
    <li> This was way too big for me... The brush is way to big!!</li>
    <li> A bit heavy but not unmanageable.  Takes alittle practice but worth the effort. Would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like to use a regular blower to &amp;#34;damp dry&amp;#34; my hair and then use this but really no need too.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has really, thick, long hair and doesn&#x27;t bother she just uses this and gets nice results.</li>
    <li> I received the Infinitipro spin air in short order.  It took a while to get used to using it, that is, pushing the button one way for clockwise spin and the other way for counterclockwise.  I have very thick, curly hair and it does a fair job, but it&#x27;s a lot more work to get it smooth than I anticipated.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it could offer a little more air for the hair drying part of it.</li>
    <li> This styler is amazing!  Works perfect for long haif or short hair.  I had long haif before and then cut it to my chin, works wonders for unruly hair!</li>
    <li> the bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t penetrate your hair and the rotation tangles up your hair too easily. worthless for me</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Produces smooth, smooth hair :)&lt;br /&gt;Great for quick styling&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The spinning feature does not work while on the cool setting</li>
    <li> Probably doesn&#x27;t work as well on Afro-American hair.</li>
    <li> Does not dry hair, makes it quite puffy.  I have thick, long Latina curls, but I guess if you have enough time it might work better</li>
    <li> Excellent service. It really does what it says. My hair feel shiny and healthier. It gives lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend this product. Great thanks&lt;br /&gt;Veni&lt;br /&gt;Netherlands</li>
    <li> I am an independent, very right handed individual. Recently, I required surgery on my right shoulder that left my arm in a sling for three weeks. Brushing my teeth with my left hand was difficult and brushing my hair was IMPOSSIBLE. After purchasing this product, I can now brush my own hair. My hair is about shoulder length and does not get tangled in the brush. Then cold setting lets you set curls or you can use this to just brush the hair. Can&#x27;t wait to see what I can do with two hands!</li>
    <li> takes forever to dry if you&#x27;re hair is a little wet</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one!!!  I wore the first one out using daily for 2 years.</li>
    <li> I love this styler!  It has a much larger barrel than I imagined it would, but I love what it does to my hair.  It makes it soft and shiney and gives it nice lift.</li>
    <li> The Infiniti Pro is quieter than a regular blow dryer, not as hot, and dries my hair in half the time. It took a little practice to figure out the spinning brush, and I&#x27;m not sure how it would work with long hair, but now that I know how to use it, I can skip the flat iron and curling iron completely. It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and bouncy. I love, love, love this product!!</li>
    <li> Ordered this item after a friend told me she had ordered one and thought I might be interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a busy mom of three boys. I regularly tame my naturally curly, thick hair with Coppola Keratin treatments. Even using the keratin straightening, I still round brush my hair dry and flat iron. With my hair length falling between my shoulders and waist, blow drying my hair tend to heat up the bathroom. So I thought I would try this product to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush helps with drying, but can be awkward to hold. I hope I will be able to get used to that. However, if you have any issues with your wrists or hands-carpal tunnel or arthritis, this is NOT a product for you. It does help make the hair fuller and fluffier. I still have to use the hair dryer and round brush when I get close to the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating buttons take some getting use to, and it does pull and tangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All  in all I rated it a 3 as it didn&#x27;t replace my round brush and dryer completely. It does help with drying the hair without heating up the bathroom, so I will be keeping it. Just know that if you are like me, it WILL NOT completely replace these tools for you.</li>
    <li> It dries surprisingly well. I have chemically straightened hair so I have to follow it up with a flat-iron but that&#x27;s just because of the way my hair responds to the blowdry. It&#x27;s relatively easy to handle and the exterior casing doesn&#x27;t heat up to an obscene temperature so it&#x27;ll be pretty hard to burn yourself when handling it. You have to get used to pressing the right rotation buttons and some of my clipped up hair kept getting caught in the rotation of another piece of hair but I think I&#x27;m just gonna have to adjust the way in which I separate my hair while I&#x27;m doing. I found that even if  just glided the brush down against my hair like any other brush it still did the job of drying my hair, which is really thick. So, overall, pretty good.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail today and I tried it after I took a shower. GREAT GREAT GREAT product! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Pros on the spin brush it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and it does the work so you don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;Cons your hair gets caught in the tip of it at the bottom of the brush :)</li>
    <li> WOW.  I hemmed and hawed over this purchase for more than a year.  There was no way this nifty little \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; could handle my long, thick, curly hair.  Needless to say, I was wrong.  I was getting tired of that flat, stuck to my head look I was getting with the flat irons.  This tool makes my hair gorgeous, in about 15-20 minutes...lots of volume, slightly curled ends, and SO much shine.  I don&#x27;t need a single product.  I took the advice from other reviews, and I use it on my hair in sections, from bottom to top, with the hair about 90% dry. If you are familiar with the DevaCurl curly hair system, you will know what I mean when I say my hair is a tight Botticelli.  It was no match for the Infinitipro.  Now, my only fear is that this product could get discontinued some day.  Maybe I should stock up!</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product and I was skeptical but really wanted this to work.  I took the plunge and ordered it to take on a recent trip. There was a bit of a learning curve, but it really is easy to use &amp; saves me a lot of time drying &amp; styling my hair. I have used hot air brushes in the past and this spinning brush is a huge improvement.  I&#x27;m not too coordinated and have never mastered the round brush and hair dryer trick.  I love this !</li>
    <li> I have owner the Revo curling brush for over 10 years.  I am a die-hard Revo fan and when mine died I was devastated!  But, I finally decided to give this product a shot.  The problem is though that the brush is different - there aren&#x27;t as many bristles, the heat is practically pointless - there is just not enough and - the biggest problem of all - the barrel is just too small.  I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair that is crazy fizzy and unkempt when left to naturally dry.  When I used to use the Revo, the brush bristles were PERFECT for it.  The brush tamed every strand and left my hair feeling shiny, soft and smooth.  I would get so many complements on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, there is just not enough bristles and I do find I get my hair tangled in it somehow?!  No idea as there aren&#x27;t many bristles.  I did find if I kept cleaning the thin layer of hair that built up on the bristles, it would grab my hair better, but not by much.  Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t slide through the bristles like with my Revo.  As for the hair dryer part of it - COMPLETELY worthless!  I found my hair can be no less than 90% dry for me to use this brush on it and even then it takes FOREVER to dry.  With my Revo, I would be done ini 10 minutes.  With this thing, it&#x27;s more like 20 minutes and the brush STILL can&#x27;t dry it enough - I can tell it still feels damp which is your worst nightmare for those of you that have hair like mine.  As it dries on my way to work, it ends up curling up.  By the time I get to work 20-30 minutes later, my hair is crazy curly.  Now if you wanted curly hair, this is your brush.  I do not tough.  With my Revo, the brush was really fat and it left my hair in these large slight waves.  It would be straight but not sickly anemic straight like with a CHI.  The Infinitipro needs to be just a bit bigger so your hair doesn&#x27;t end up curling up on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally hate it.  Now, I&#x27;m not going to have to shell out the hundred bucks to get a new Revo.</li>
    <li> There are days when my arms hurt so bad I can&#x27;t hold them up to style my hair.  Dry a section, put them down, dry another section, put them down.  Holding and turning the round brush was a killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this product on and infomercial ages ago, when I had short spiky hair, and didn&#x27;t think much of it.  Now that I am growing my hair out and using a round brush all the time, it came back to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hallelujah! I can round brush my hair without being in pain. It is easy to hold and does the brushing and drying for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few times to figure out how to best use it for your hair and style.  I discovered I have to mostly dry my hair, then style it with the styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair Infiniti Pro 3 days ago and I&#x27;m in love! My hair is about chin length and is naturally curly, yet thin. I have a horrible double-crown issue in the back and my hair always looks like I have a hole in my head. I used to leave it curly and try to use a flat iron to curl the hair over the \\&quot;hole\\&quot;. I also had to use massive amounts of hairspray and numerous other products to tame it. This tool is now the only thing I use, plus a little hairspray afterwards. The rotating brush is perfect for creating volume at the crown and curling the ends under. I stopped straightening my hair years ago because my hair was breaking from using the flat iron and hair dryer every day. This tool does not make my hair come out when I&#x27;m using it like a flat iron always has. It leaves my hair soft, smooth, shiny and with lots of volume which I&#x27;ve never achieved with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two things I would change about this product. It would be more versatile for shorter hairstyles if it had interchangeable heads with different brush sizes. Also, the rotating function does not work in the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, which I would like for it to do. But overall, this product is wonderful for me!</li>
    <li> The person who invented this should be canonized a saint.  This hairstyling tool is the best thing I have ever used on my hair.  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, so its on the thicker side - but this brush does not really do much for me. It definitely saves my wrists from having to do the rolling action - but I would not recommend paying $40 for it. Not worth it - does not feel like it will last long at all.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I purchased this Infinitipro.  My hair is fine and medium length.  I do not have to dry it first before using this styler.  The only problem is that is almost makes my too shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this. It did take awhile to dry my hair so I might try drying it half way with a blow dryer. I love the volume it gives and how you can flip your hair out or under. It is very easy to use and does not get tangled in your hair. This is my new favorite product and would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> It adds volume and smooths my hair. I find it best to blow dry your hair for a few minutes first and use this as a styling tool.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I am not good at blowing out my own hair, but I love how it looks blown out.  I bought this hoping I could do it myself.  While a stylist can get it just a bit better than I do, I achieve the look I want in just minutes.  The fact that the brush rotates in either direction makes a huge difference!  If your on the fence about this, I recommend you get it.</li>
    <li> It is good but it takes 2 hours to dry long hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush..awesome!</li>
    <li> Great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it, and her hair really looks different when she uses.&lt;br /&gt;She also saw some youtube videos explaining techniques on how to use it, which can really lead to salon results.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works great on my semi thick hair.  Price cannot be beat.  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> it is too big too big which makes it hard to handle,the rotation gets to crazy level fast and your hair gets tangled in the brush, and the worst of all , the bristles are too soft to hold the hair,...not happy at all</li>
    <li> This is the best hair styler!  I use it daily whether in conjunction with my hair dryer or alone on dry hair that needs a bit of a help.  Easy to use and does not tangled my hair.  Even in the midst of summer my fine, frizzy hair was shiny and full of body.  I am giving it to a couple of friends for Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the great hair!</li>
    <li> I never review products, but I felt I had to for this one. I have medium-length, fine, partially curly, frizzy hair. Sounds complicated. It is. Usually, I use a round brush, hair dryer, flat iron or curing iron. With this thing, I only use this. I do let it partially air dry while I pack lunches, make breakfast, etc. Then I go back and I do my hair and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE this for touchup later in the day. I use it after a work out, or to give a bit more shine and volume later in the day if I am going out again and I&#x27;ve had my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Naysayers...&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes too long: Nope, not if you hair is partially dry like the directions state.&lt;br /&gt;2. The handle is too big: It&#x27;s no any bigger than a standard hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;3. It won&#x27;t grip hair: You NEED to use the rotator for it to grip your hair. You don&#x27;t need to run it the whole time, but in order to get a good grip, you need to run it for a small bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice, read the directions and watch a few videos before you use it. Practice on dry hair. Then you should be set to go!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, wife has one at home and one at camp.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product for the first month or so, But then it started to spin slower and slower.&lt;br /&gt;Now it hardly spins at all. I would like to return it, but, alas, lost my receipt.&lt;br /&gt;So for the first 2 months a definite 5 stars, for longevity 0 stars&lt;br /&gt;Keep your receipt. ! ! !</li>
    <li> hair feels alive and full of life. easy to use</li>
    <li> It is not easy to make curly hair</li>
    <li> This only worked properly for 5 minutes. It doesnt even rotate at all. I have been ripped off</li>
    <li> this dryer brush is awesome! This one I bought for my daughter and grand daughter who is 8. She loves it. the reversing auto roller brush function makes styling so easy.</li>
    <li> I purchased in June was so excited but when I got it the box was old like second hand!!And after one use the rotation bottom wasn&#x27;t working but I didn&#x27;t make big issue ,aftet 4 times of use the whole item stop working !!I feel like I have been cheated I wanna complain and get at least my money back. I&#x27;m very disappointed with amazon</li>
    <li> Loved . The brush is Larga and great for styling your hair . Use with almost dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this as the best hair styling tool I&#x27;ve ever had! Do wish it did have an option for a smaller brush too especially since I had my layers cut a little shorter. Gives a lot of fullness and it makes drying/styling so much quicker.</li>
    <li> This brush has just made it easy to wear my hair down every day! No frizzies and my hair stays looking beautiful all day long:) I do put in styling balm after I&#x27;m done to smooth it out. So easy to use. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great as this was a gift to my daughter and she loves lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I used to have trouble doing the back of my head. I have very long and very thick hair and they wave to top it off. My arm and wrist used to get tired trying to turn the brush and get that shinny smooth hair my hairdresser usually gives me. But this brush gives me exactly the same quality style. It&#x27;s simply fantastic. What I do is pre-dry my hair until it&#x27;s humid to almost dry. That takes less than 5 minutes. I actually timed the rest of the brushing. It takes me 12 minutes to get my hole hair dry and styled. And no need to worry about hair getting tangled in the brush. It just won&#x27;t happen. It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
    <li> This has been a godsend for my thin, limp hair!  It gives it so much body, and takes so much less coordination than trying to round brush with one hand, and blow dry with the other.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect buy for someone who is totally hair incompetent like myself. I cut my long locks for a tamer look, but my problem is that I hate styling and maintaining. This tool makes it easy and quick. It gives me the soft, smooth, rounded look that I like. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The diameter of the brush is huge, so I couldn&#x27;t use it.  The description of the item does not give the dimensions.</li>
    <li> 1. First of all, my hair strand is medium to coarse but it&#x27;s not full by any means and it&#x27;s shoulder length so I didn&#x27;t have any problem and it wasn&#x27;t time consuming for me but I can see people with full long hair have a little problem with the spinning feature since it really slows down when it&#x27;s in my hair so you have to go on little by little and as many people mentioned it can be too much work. 2. It has a cool setting which is cooler than the other two settings for sure, but it&#x27;s not cool at all! It doesn&#x27;t bother me though. 3. I took out bunch of my hair out of it after I was done, mostly baby hair that means it can really get close to your roots. 4. This is not a flatting or curling iron replacement. It only makes your life easier if you were going to use hair dryer in one hand and round brush in the other. I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star because it makes my life easier, I can get ready faster in the morning without any hard work and sweating plus the result is way better than any other dryer. I&#x27;ve read somewhere in reviews that the spinning feature would stop working after a short period, if that happened I&#x27;m gonna buy another one of these &amp;#34;spinning brush type of dryers&amp;#34;, maybe not this particular brand, but it&#x27;s a must have for sure.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this item at Target and paid three times the price.  It worked well for about a year and then just stopped rotating one day.  I really liked how it defrizzed and gave me volume so when I saw it on Amazon for such a great  price I jumped on it.  I am again very happy with it, I hope it lasts more than a year this time.</li>
    <li> I needed to do it a few times before I got the hang of it,now I can&#x27;t be with out it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. My hair is really thick and I don&#x27;t feel the power of the styler was strong enough to take care of my hair. Unfortunate because I really wanted to like it as I like it&#x27;s sister &amp;#34;Infiniti Pro 3-in-1 styler.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am brush hairdryer challenged. It looks so easy but I just cannot coordinate them. Therefore, this dryer is my saving grace. It is so easy to use and I can style my hair like a pro. Thank you Conair.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool, but not as powerful as I had hoped. I bought this exact model (baby lysis)  in Europe about 5 years ago and sadly had to leave it behind when I moved back to Canada. It was much more powerful and dried and styled my  hair very effectively. This one is good but not as hot and its a bit noisy. I don&#x27;t mind the noise but it sounds a bit laboured, as if it might overheat or break down at any minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a styling tool, it is good, it just takes a little longer than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping it would be the product of my dreams, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I have medium-thick curly, Spanish-type hair.  I found that the product did not actually work well unless my hair was practically dry and it took me about a half hour longer to finish than it does with the brush and dryer.  The dryer portion of the product just isn&#x27;t strong enough.  I did give it to my sister whose hair is just wavy and fine (it takes me about 10-15 min to blow dry her hair straight from wet).  She always had trouble doing her own hair and she LOVED this product.  She said it allowed her to do her hair easily.</li>
    <li> I have fine, medium length hair.  This styler not only dries my hair but adds volume and shine!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and this doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair at all. The brush doesn&#x27;t grip short hair enough to style and the longer hair takes so long to dry it isn&#x27;t worth the effort. You have to use a regular dryer most of the way and then switch over to this one and it still takes forever. I used to have a Revo Styling brush and this one is nowhere near the performance. This product was a waste of money and just takes up room in my bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t spin with &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; setting.</li>
    <li> My curly hair gets tangled in this tool, and I have to be especially careful to keep the other hair not being spun out of the way.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I get hair salon blow outs at home every time I use it. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This rotating hairdryer and brush all-in-one is fantastic. I find it easy to use (it took a couple tries to get my styling right, though) and it&#x27;s very effective. I have medium-length hair that is angled longer towards my chin with some longish pieces hanging down around my ears... kind of like a cool shaggy angled and stacked bob. The way I use the brush is I first comb my hair after a shower and the finger-comb mousse throughout. I then rub an anti-frizz serum through. I use two hairclips to pin the top and front section up while I progressively dry (while curling under) my hair, pulling down a higher layer of wet hair after each layer is done. The section at the top of my head I then use the brush to lift and curl straight back. The front section gets lifted and curled under my chin (my part finds itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a great hair person and I always had difficulty styling with a blowdryer and round brush. This product makes it so much easier for me and my hair looks great! I am super happy with the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share pictures but I guess Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow that. Oh well!</li>
    <li> My hair looks so much better with this spinbrush! I use it almost everyday, and love the result! Easy to use, this makes your layers simply beautiful!</li>
    <li> **Update** I DID like it, until recently it just stopped working. Didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and my straightner was damaging my hair pretty bad so my stylist recommended that I just blow dry with a roller brush. Unfortunately, that is just too hard to do on my own and it never looks as good as when I come out of the salon. But then I came across this beauty and it does all the work for you! I love it. You kinda have to find your own way of learning what works best for you. I personally let my hair air dry 80% before I use this because when my hair is too wet this thing can get stuck in my hair and tangle it. But when my hair is mostly dry, it turns out really nice and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> First time i tried this tool, it scared me because my hair got stuck. After much practice, it worked like a charm and left my hair shiny and bouncy. The rotator stops for few seconds before you can use it again, i think this is a safety precaution so hair wont get stuck by endless scrolling. I would recommend this to people who have the patience/skill to master this tool.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair-just needed something to give my hair some &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; after washing it.  I don&#x27;t use this as my main way of drying my hair-I either let it air dry or blow dry it (till slightly damp) and then use this dryer to put the &amp;#34;finishing touches&amp;#34; on my hair. Works well!  The only draw back is that the end of the curler gets hot and I tend to hold onto that area while using it.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise-I like the produuct and use it almost daily.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! the only cons are its big and if u do a section of hair too big it can tangle at the end if the barrel. When I first tried this product I was startled by how fast it rotates and I got my hair tangled. switch to the cool setting to lock in ur style like hair spray. this thing is PERFECT for volume. Btw I have medium thin frizzy hair. the infinitIpro smooths out frizzy hair. I still had a little at the top but nothing hair spray can&#x27;t fix. it really is like getting ur hair done at the salon. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.,GREAT for styling your ponytail.</li>
    <li> I used very similar styler before but I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore so I did my search on Amazon and I found one,  and even better.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and little curly. After washing, I blow dry my hair for about 2 min and when the hair is not that wet,  I use this brush to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It works well for me, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Using good blow dryer and this brush, I am able to style my hair within 7-10min, I love it!</li>
    <li> love it so so so so so much! The style it makes is so perfect! Although I cannot use it expertly now, I believe that I can make perfectly one day! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> About my hair:&lt;br /&gt;I have owned and used this product for about three months. I style my straight, moderately thick hair in a shoulder length bob. I have used both a hair dryer/round brush combo and a standard hot air curling brush to style my hair. Both methods produced satisfactory results, but my wrists became sore from rotating the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Infiniti Pro:&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro is a hot air curling brush. Key features include a 500-watt motor, ionic technology, removable air filter, and a bidirectional rotating brush head. Users may choose from cool, low or high heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- The large, 2-inch barrel gives my hair lift and body. It gently curves the ends of my hair under without curling them. I can achieve more volume by using the rotating brush near the roots. If you want to curl your hair, this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The rotating brush saves my wrists. The brush will rotate in either direction, or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The protective brush cover prevents the soft bristles from becoming smashed an unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;m not crazy about:&lt;br /&gt;- The rotating brush occasionally picks up an adjacent section of hair and twists it into a tangled rope. If I don&#x27;t catch it in time, I am left with a knotted mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The air flow is a little wimpy compared to other hot air brushes I&#x27;ve used. It will eventually dry slightly damp hair, but I&#x27;d like a little more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;tangle-free antistatic\\&quot; brush bristles are intended to leave hair smooth and shiny, but that has not been my experience. The bristles are so soft that they bend and do not penetrate the layer of hair. Instead, they smooth the bottom of the hair and leave the top a little frizzy. This requires me to smooth the top layer with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;This hot air brush works, but I&#x27;m not bowled over. I would probably replace it if I hadn&#x27;t spent so much money on it. Even though this is not the perfect styler for me, it may work better with other styles or hair types.ot the perfect styler for me, it may work better with other styles or hair types.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair and this brush makes it perfect.  I blow dry for a couple of minutes and then style with this brush and I am done.  Much quicker than using 2 hands with blow dryer and a brush.  Its all in one and makes my life easier, I am all about making my life easier!  The first time I had a bit of trouble but, just stuck a sticker on the button I would normally use and it was great.  The best is that I can tangle up in these types of implements but, even I did not tget tangled and I am sure this is much better for hair than a curling iron or straightener and I cannot burn myself</li>
    <li> I do think this is a very good styling tool BUT it takes time to get the technique down. It is most definitely NOT able to be used with hair that is only towel dried. I must let my hair air dry for awhile or use my old blow dryer as this doesnt have the capacity to spin effectively through my long thick hair when wet. It spins much easier and smoother when almost dry. It does deliver shine and body. Ill happily keep using it. It does save the wrist (not having to use round brush and dryer) I feel that the heat is just enough to get the style done (as I have hair that likes to curl) PS make sure you are sectioning off your hair precisely and only use about 2\\&quot; wide sections (leaving exposed bristles on either side) or when hair dries and expands the stragglers will tangle around and be ripped out. It save me time by 1-allowing me to style faster since im not hurting my wrist. 2- It spins faster than I can with a round brush (Brush Spins are more effective) and 3- Straightens and curls under ends at once. UPDATE* As i do not wash my hair all that often (3xweek) I have had very lil practice with this and already )after 2x use) i am getting very comfortable with it. I can see when i am prolly gonna have a tug on my hair and can stop it before it happens. the trick is (for long hair) to use smaller sections. You might think that this would add to the time it takes to dry and style but it doesn&#x27;t. without tangling, untangling and brushing again, I can just use smaller sections and save myself that time. Tonight I was to meet a girlfriend for dinner and almost didnt want to wash my hair (even tho it needed it) bc I thought it may take too long to dry and style. Again very long/thick hair and I was washed, dryed, styled and gone in UNDER 30 MINS!!! thats a record for me! When I got to the restaurant sHE said, \\&quot; I just came from the gym, I told you not to get too cute\\&quot; I told her it was this hot brush. And that I had just gotten out of the shower 30 mins ago!!! If you want apro blow out, have hair you are too lazy to style but dont want to chop-BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> Its bern my hair and the moving brush part have a space between the brush and the fan when the brush spend the hair get inside it and bern the edges and pull the hair from the root it was painful worses day</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars in search of the perfect product to make my hair smooth. Regardless of the product or time I took to blow dry my hair I always had to pull out the straightener to get rid of fly aways and frizziness. No more!!! Using the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler my hair is as smooth and shiny as it is when I leave the salon. I do, for the sake of time, blow dry my hair until damp before using the Infinitipro. It only took one time to feel like a pro using the rotating brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars. I really like it more than a flat iron because its combing through your hair as it is drying and styling it at the same time. Also when I use this it gives my hair more body as to a flat iron it gets no body. The only thing I was a little disappointed at was that it rotates slower than I would like. It came earlier than expected. Overall I really like it!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money better to get regular hair dryer or other hot brush dryer this product will not dry your hair and I hate the spin brush I tried few times to get used to it but is difficult plus their is no heat hardly even when my hair is almost dry it doesn&#x27;t do what it supposed to do and amazon will not accept returns once it&#x27;s open better to buy stuff like this at local store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my package came it looked new but had one hair on brush how that happened I don&#x27;t know and is not my hair. It says for all hair type that&#x27;s is not true I have long curly hair so it should at least dry it I&#x27;m not expecting straight hair from this I just though hair dryer with brush would be easer then using dryer plus brush seperate but it still hurts my hand. And is huge to hold it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as babybliss</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have long curly hair and I was tired of using my round brush to straighten it (and yes I know a flat brush is easier and faster to use, but it leaves your hair looking like hay and unpolished). This brush does not grip very well into the hair so it doesn&#x27;t give you the pull you need for that polished shiny look. I&#x27;m sure it works better for shorter naturally straighter hair.</li>
    <li> Good but I wish it was hotter.</li>
    <li> If you want that blown out look this will be your best friend. I also pair it with my CHI keratin spray and it smooths out my frizz!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for those quick fixes in the AM if I am running late to work!</li>
    <li> Perfect for all hair type, quick styling and perfect detangled and hair curler.</li>
    <li> I was most disappointend in this brush.  It simply was not for me or my hair.  It may work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair that falls below my shoulders.  I am used to using a blow dryer and then hot rollers to get my hair to look pretty and not flat or frizzy.  This product works wonderfully.  I can retire my hot rollers and just let my hair dry with a towel, comb out and then use the tool.  It never tangles, is easy to operate and not too bulky.  The curls are NOT like hot rollers, but more of a straight finish with a bounce at the bottom.  And there is a way to create hight at the top - a necessity for me because my hair is so fine.  I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Whoever came up with this idea is awesome... I always wanted to blow dry my hair, but it&#x27;s pretty long and thick. After I bleached it to death, I grew it out and vowed never to use heat on my hair. So I&#x27;ve been air drying it for years, using products to tone down the frizz. What I like about this is I can still pretty much air dry my hair and use it right before my hair is completely dry. For me it took about 15 minutes to get the look I wanted, but it was so easy! I thought there would be tangles everywhere (and it happens) but if you do it piece by piece then you should be fine. And if you do get tangles, just reverse the spin brush and comb it out carefully. I did my hair 8 hours ago and even though it doesn&#x27;t look how it did when I first finished it, it still looks awesome. So glad I bought this on Amazon instead of in-store, I saved ten bucks!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I used the Conair  Infinity pro curl and love it. So I figured why not try this since it&#x27;s made by the same  company.  My hair is fairly course and thick and midway down my back and all my life I never bother to use a blow dryer. I don&#x27;t like to do too much to my hair because of the upkeep. However I always liked the look of my hair after coming from the hair dresser but never had the skill/desire  to attempt to use a brush and dryer combo. This machine makes it so easy for me. It took me a few tries to get the hang of it but now that I have, I can&#x27;t go without it. I&#x27;m even getting used to the weight/size of the handle. I bought mine at Walmart which has 3 other attachments.one so you can use it as a regular dryer, one thinner brush and one....actually not really sure what  it&#x27;s for! I recommend this for anyone who wants that fresh from the salon look/feel.</li>
    <li> This is as close I will get to my stylist blowdry, it just takes a really long time to dry.  I like the reverse spin of the brush, once you get it, it&#x27;s easy.  I don&#x27;t need a flat iron after.  My arms get so tired so this blower needs a lot more power to speed up the process.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical to buy the Con Air Spin Brush ( i have thick wavy brown hair that has been treated with keratin) so I asked my sister to get it for me for christmas. Needless to say I love it!! It dries my hair so much smoother and straighter than my hair dryer. I do not use my hair dryer anymore, I mainly use the spin brush and my straightener to straighten out the ends. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it gives me a bit mor volume and curl than I&#x27;d like (which is why I use my straightener to finish) , but overall great product!</li>
    <li> Really pleased worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I have fine, wavy/curly, blonde hair that I have never managed to straighten with a brush and blow dryer alone.  I always ended up with slightly frizzy hair, so I&#x27;ve had to style my hair with my natural curl.  No more.  This product has allowed me to easily create a beautiful straight style myself with no frizz for the first time ever.  It even looks better, I think, than the salon blow outs I&#x27;ve gotten, because the product gives my hair some body as well as straights it.  I have received many compliments on my new straight hair, and I&#x27;m loving it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti pro does have a large handle, but I have had no problem using it (and I am on the petite side).  I watched some online tutorials before I tried it, and this helped me get the hang of it right from the first go.  I am terrible at just about everything to do with hair and makeup, and I can style my hair with this with ease.  It&#x27;s also a pretty safe product.  The bristles are soft, so your hair doesn&#x27;t tangle easily in it, and it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, so you can&#x27;t really burn yourself (unlike a flat iron or a curling iron).  I also think it&#x27;s more gentle on my hair, since it doesn&#x27;t get super hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many people have mentioned, this product is a *styler* and not a hair dryer, so it&#x27;s best to quickly blow dry your hair to about 80% dry first, and then use the Infiniti pro to style your hair.  Using this method, I can do my collarbone-length hair in about 15 minutes from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this product a try.  It really is the best thing that ever happened to my hair!</li>
    <li> Vidal sasson sectioning clips are very practical, and the Infiniti pro by Conair is excellent. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> takes longer to dry your hair.</li>
    <li> They were stiff and it gave me a shoe bite on the back of my heel. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair dryer as well as a curling brush.  It was okay for the brush, but did not dry my hair and was not useful.  Looking for something that does both.</li>
    <li> Practical and easy, it works very well. It would be nicer if the brush could rotate when in cold temperature mode too.</li>
    <li> Works well on my fine hair - has held up well so far</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have fought with it all my life. Typically I will use a large curling iron to smooth it. This brush, smooths quickly and I use it every day. I did have to get used to holding my other hand open on the end as it twirls the hair into it, to keep the hair from twisting at the end of the brush. Once I got that down I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan, Payson, AZ</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair. An I loved getting my hair done by my hairdresser cuz she would blow dry my hair. I don&#x27;t ever try to tackle my hair.. I usually just straighten it. But this was the best. I wish they sold the brush part separately because it easily gets worn an I would love the option of just replacing that. But it does a beautiful job. Go on YouTube if your iffy about the purchase</li>
    <li> My bf purchased this for me and I do like using it a lot. At first you do have to get used to how the brush spins how much hair you can brush at a time. I have thicker hair so I thought it was going to be more of a struggle but it&#x27;s not too bad. It does still take me about&lt;br /&gt;30-45min to do my hair. But I love the end result! Your hair is nice and bouncy and you can curl your ends a bit in or out and it really gives that salon look. I personally have never been able to do my hair with a round brush and hair dryer, so this is a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the dryer had maybe a little bit more power, but then again maybe if it did it might just blow your hair away. And you need to make sure your hair is &amp;#34;80% dry&amp;#34; as the instructions said. Sometimes halfway through my hair some of my ends are too dry so I find having a spray bottle w/ water nearby is helpful. I normally don&#x27;t have time during the week to do my hair with this device I normally only use it on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great tool to have. I wish I had time to use it more. You do have to mess with it and get used to it for your desired look. It&#x27;s not too difficult to figure out though. I think right now I have not perfected the technique but when I do this may take me less time to do my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS TOOL!  One handed styling is possible!</li>
    <li> I was scared of this thing even though I watched all the how-to videos I could find on YouTube. I am happy to report it&#x27;s not scary at all. I&#x27;ve just received it recently and used it only a few times, but so far so good. My hair has more volume, slightly curls at the end. I really need some sort of heat to smooth my hair after blow drying and this gives me a great new option besides my straightener which I&#x27;m not quite ready to get rid of yet, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s pretty easy to get the hang of. It&#x27;s also way easier and much faster than a brush in one hand and the blow dryer in the other. My hair is bouncy and silky after using this. The brush is soft, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4/5 stars because 1) the grooves for the cover on the top of the brush sometimes catch and tangle my hair, and B) more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot. I need more heat. If my hair is wet, I have to blow it with my regular dryer first, then finish it w this product. It&#x27;d be cool if I could use this dryer on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool feature is a nice touch, also.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t rotate on cool setting.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product for the price and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the product.  What I understood a &amp;#34;2 inch&amp;#34; brush ended up being HUGE from what I expected it to be so i returned it and found a smaller one elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! This brush exceeded my expectations! Easy to operate and lightweight. I really loved it and recomend this item.</li>
    <li> I should not even give 1 star for this. It did nothing to frizzy hair neither it gave salon look.!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it did not tangle my hair. It did straighten and gave shiny silky look but only for max 10 minutes and then same dry tangled look with flyways as if I have had electric shock. Mine is naturally mild curly thin fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to return. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Spin Brush for a few months now and I really like it! I have long, (falls below my shoulders) fine hair and I wanted something to achieve volume without having to juggle a large round brush and a hair dryer. This product is just the thing! Traditionally, I have also used a large barrel curling iron when I&#x27;m done drying, but this product often eliminates the need to use a curling iron because the rotating brush smooths out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I divide my hair into sections and make sure to dry the lower layers first. I start by using the spin brush at the roots without having it spin, and then start the spin as I pull it towards the ends. It takes a few times and  then I move on to another section of hair. I get great volume and my shoulders don&#x27;t ache anymore from holding up the dryer and large round brush while drying towards the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it is a few minutes quicker than using both a dryer and a brush, once you get the hang of it. There is a  learning curve involved, and I often pushed the spin button the wrong way at first. You hold down one of 2 buttons depending on which way you want the brush to spin. You can either wrap the ends around the brush or just pull it through your hair as you would a large round brush. If you have the heat on high, it spins faster than if you have heat on low. I have gotten my hair tangled, but reversing the spin loosened it up and it&#x27;s not ever been awfully tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, be prepared for the learning curve and be patient at first. You&#x27;ll be spinning without thinkling about it no time! You might even eliminate the curling iron step!</li>
    <li> this product was amazing and it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of hair you have, I have coarse, it works !</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing several advertisements about it. I then read the reviews and decided to purchase it...BEST idea ever! I absolutely love this product. After watching some of the tutorials, I gave it a shot on my own hair. It was very easy to use, and it added tons of volume and shine to my hair. I have fairly thin hair and it hits my shoulders, and this airbrush was absolutely perfect. I also LOVE that it rotates in both directions. I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this. I highly recommend this. It gives a fantastic blow-out. FYI: IT does work best on slightly damp hair not soaking wet hair. I also use a mousse to help hold the volume.</li>
    <li> I really like, still experimenting with it.</li>
    <li> I was leary at first, but friend recommended it.. Does not tangle hair!!!! I dry hair part way and then dry/style with  this tool..</li>
    <li> You guy should buy this for your mothers day, my is so happy she call me every time she is going to use it lol.</li>
    <li> Firstly, some background.  I am a baby boomer, so you can figure out what stage of life my hair is in.  I have been coloring my hair for decades with one or another product (mostly fairly benign and natural products) so my very fine, fairly abundant, middle aged hair is very dry.  At one time I had a lot of this very fine, very dry hair and when I let it dry naturally (without blow-drying) could achieve a great deal of volume, even when it was very long, especially in humid weather.  I was able to blow it straight and keep it that way or let it be curly and voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this time I have bought every hair device known to woman: hot rollers of every type, cold rollers (used jumbos and wrapped my hair in college), curling irons, straightening irons (ceramic expensive ones), bobby pins, sponges, self-gripping and dozens of brushes and blow dryers of every type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, it has been harder and harder to keep my dry, fine hair from either being frizzy or flyaway.  My sister-in-law raved about a Conair Infiniti ionic brush blow dryer for thicker, coarser hair.  Looking at it, I realized that for my fine, medium length (to my shoulders) hair, it would be far too heavy and cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw those spinning hot irons with the brush on tv and thought I might try one but I have a straightening device and did not want to spend money on another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating styler,  ah!  The best of all choices:  wide brush, rotating or non-rotating, different heat settings, a simple, one handed wand and not too strong or hot.  Perfect.  It arrived virtually overnight (thanks Amazon, as always) and I liked it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price, length, weight, thickness, quality - all great.  I have small hands and perhaps a smaller device would be better, but it is light enough that I can manipulate it.  I love the fact that it can be cleaned easily, comes in a sturdy box for storage and has a great protective cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any drawbacks, they are that the cord is a bit stiff and the plug kept coming out of the socket until I adjusted my handling of the unit to avoid it.  The other thing is that the buttons that activate rotation of the brush are very easily triggered, so you have to be careful, if you don&#x27;t want them rotating at just a glance of your fingers near them.  When they do rotate the brush really grabs hair strongly.  If your hair is fine like mine, you need to adjust your grip to avoid it pulling on the hair too much and winding it up too tightly.  I finally got the hang of that and it was less of a problem, as I got used to the rotation action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair, the result was mixed.  I did not tame the flyaway in my bangs until I applied my favorite anti-frizz lotion from John Frieda, but this is a very very dry day, so I will reserve judgment accordingly.  It did indeed create instant volume and easily turned my hair under.  I can see that with a little practice, I will be able to flip my hair up or down, with little problem.  So that is positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more typical day (California, high desert), with average humidity, I think the flyaway issue will be less of a problem.  As for the rest, with more experience, I believe this will add a useful tool to my arsenal, so I would recommend it, for the price and for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I really love the product and it DOES ultimately save me some labor and time over my other method of smoothing my hair. It results in much smoother hair using far less product than my normal hair dryer/large barrel curling iron routine. My only problem is that I have lots of thick hair and getting the roots dry can be tricky with this - I wish it generated a bit more air. But overall I really like it and will continue to use frequently.</li>
    <li> I have wavy thick hair so if I straighten my hair I have to blow dry it and then straighten it with a flat iron.  This thing blow dries and straightens simoltaneously, it is awesome. What I don&#x27;t like is the fact that you have to press and hold the button in order for the brush to rotate so it can get tiring.</li>
    <li> I have attempted to use this styler MULTIPLE times. I have watched multiple tutorials, used products, tried both settings, on wet hair, on dry hair, everything. I do not get any more volume using this than I would just flipping my hair upside down and drying. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> For the first time I did my own hair without spending $80 in a salon. First I hate salon and second with this product I save big money in a year.  It really dry ur hair and give a lot volume so be sure that if u used this to the a flat iron from the same company that comes with a brooch so u can do the whole job like a professional and look pretty.</li>
    <li> save time and makes the hair looks fuller. Heat it&#x27;s just right and easy to use. Give sometime to learn how to use it but works great!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer, even my mom liked it. i have medium carly hair and I have no paitience to streighten them out for 40 minutes that never turns out that well anyways plus it damages hair from heat. infinitipro does it&#x27;s job with in 7-10 minutes which is perfect for me. it makes my fusy hair look smooth and organized. i don&#x27;t need perfect streight look, just some curls. i have a full time job plus 14 month old, so time snaps in front of me real fast. way to go!</li>
    <li> I can not find only one reason for buy this hair dryer. I have two of another brand similar to this that works but this... no no. The idea that brush and dryer in one machine is perfect  because you do not need two hands for twist your hair around the brush and then pick up dryer whit a hand while with the another one handle the brush and repeat this step again and again. But one of the problems with this dryer is that bristles do not keep right while your hair is passing through them, they bend, do not comb so your hair is dried with freeze, not soft, without shine. It takes a lot of time to dry your hair. The spin, at begin, needs practice... until that you and your hair will suffer jerks, after that things will get better but, eventually you will be a jerks. You can use it with or without spin because is has two buttons for spin. These buttons are by press, if you want that it spins you press it and if you not only put out your finger. That is very easy and appropriated. One button is for right spin and the another one is for left spin. The brush is big so you never can put it in hair root for spin and, remember this does not comb, you can not use it like a normal brush for that part of your hair, so your roots will be wet. This is a little heavy too and the handle is hulking so your hand will be tired quickly. The only use that I think may it works (and this is only an assumption) is in a dried hair for give it style because it is like a roll that spin but for that you can obtain better results with thermal rolls or a curling iron. THIS NOT WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two of a similar product that works perfectly. Maybe you could read my review about it: John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush</li>
    <li> I read a lot about this before I bought it so I was excited to receive it. I usually blow dry my hair, straight iron it and put it in large rollers for volume. I have carpal tunnel so my wrists are like jelly when I&#x27;m done. NOT WITH THIS DRYER!! I HIGHLY recommend this! I was shocked at how nice my hair looked. It is SO EASY. You simply put your hair on the rolling brush (it rolls backward and frontward) and STYLE as you normally would. You can hold it in place at any interval of the drying process OR press the button and it will roll under the hair in place..etc. There was no need for me to have to straight iron or use the rollers because my hair was PERFECT when I was done. You can add volume simply by putting some of your hair that is at the TOP of your hair in the rolling brush and keep it there a bit until it is dry or when it is HOT and almost dry then switch the button (on and off) forward and it will be on COOL and lock the curl--or drying process. Simply fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I  bought  a revo styler and loved it . This is just as good except for 2 things -more power on the blower and the other is i wish it had a smaller brush attachment because I like curly hair. This does so well for what it was meant to do and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am terrible at using a round brush when blow drying, and I always get my hair tangled up and have to pull it out of the brush. This nifty styling tool will help you achieve a perfect hairstyle. My hair turned out smooth and bouncy with a little wave at the bottom. You can use the tool in three ways: you can either just run it through your hair and dry the hair while smoothing it (without the rotating function), or you can run it through your hair and when you reach the ends you manually wind it around the brush, or you can use the rotating function and have the brush your your hair around it. Now this sounds like it could get really messy and tangled, but it really works. I was doing a mix of all three options. It took only a few minutes to learn how to use the tool, which I thought was pretty neat. I love this item, and I can&#x27;t believe That I did not discover it sooner. People have commented on how great my hair looked.</li>
    <li> very easy to use once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;by the 2nd time of using it, I became an expert... it&#x27;s that easy&lt;br /&gt;This product is actually great for long hair.. the longer the hair, the better the result since the curl is very large.&lt;br /&gt;Gives full volume to your hair</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness -  The product was described as new and it arrived with a persons hair wound all through it.  Eeewwwww  So gross</li>
    <li> If only the brissels were a little stronger and it didn&#x27;t get stuck so easily. It definitely makes straightening my hair a lot easier. Maybe an inch would be better as well.</li>
    <li> “ This product is really fantastic, and I get amazing results - it looks like I&#x27;ve just gone to get my hair blown dry when I use it. ”</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Straightens my naturally curley hair at least till the weather and humidity gets to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great during our nonhumid and dry seasons of late fall, winter and early spring</li>
    <li> It is very good;&lt;br /&gt;Now. I can do  brush  my self&lt;br /&gt;But, it is not bivolt!&lt;br /&gt;So, we can use in city where 110 V only</li>
    <li> I bought this second Infinitipro for vacations in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have one at home in the UK and couldn&#x27;t face a month of hotel hairdryers which never make my hair look groomed.  I have shoulder length, layered hair which wants to flick out and I want it to turn under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I part dry my hair with a hairdryer, then clip up the top half so I can finish off the underneath hair in smaller sections, followed by the top hair in small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me look like I have been to the hairdresser at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered one by mistake that is too big but I just love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the infinitpro because a friend of mine had one. I used hers and really liked it.  Her hair is a lot longer than my hair. Although I think it works a little bit better when your hair is longer, it is a neat product to own.  Since I have been using the infinitipro, it is so easy and quick to style my hair. It adds body and fullness to my hair that I thought I could only get after I walked out of a hair salon.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Hair ends up frizzy and static filled. Also kind of scary to use. The rotating brush just about eats your hair making it impossible to get the roots if you have long hair.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this item.  I was excited to get it and used it right away.  It works exactly as it is described.  Highly recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a week now and LOVE it!!  Very simple to use.  I use the hot setting when my hair is wetter and the low setting when it&#x27;s about 80% dry.  I  love the rotating brush, but watch because it does go very fast and hurt sometimes when it rolls up to your head.  Once I got used to the easy to use thumb buttons for the rotation it was great!!  I used it to curl under my hair and flip it out and got tons of compliments.  My hair is shoulder length, but even if it was shorter it would still work great.  It does not tangle at all, which I was worried about.  Would definitely recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> it said NEW but it is not new at all, the box was open and the the wire cord was not tight together.  It a used product, but it listed NEW. So disappointed with this product, not recommend for others and very unsatisfied with this purchased.</li>
    <li> This Infiniti Pro spinning hair dryer exceeds my expectations.  My hair is very fine and thinning and this hair dryer gives me the volume I desire.  I would highly recommend this product especially if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> My old rotating brush broke and this is much better with the dryer and brush combined.  I actually enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work on my shorter style of hair, but ended up being one of my better investments.</li>
    <li> I try so many products and nothing worked better than Infinity Pro Spin. I love it, and leaves my hair shinny and doesn&#x27;t burn out like other products. I will recommend 100%  Pro Spin By Conair. Thank you Conair for such great Product. Ivonne 😊💞</li>
    <li> ok, it is pretty evident that when a product has over 1400 reviews and 4 stars, it is pretty great.  i have fine, mid- length hair, and have a hard time using a round brush and dryer.  i&#x27;ve tried a million times, but my hair never comes out like it does at the salon. i like to believe that it&#x27;s easier to do on someone else than it is on yourself ;)  i debated between this one and the john frieda hot air brush.  after reading quite a few reviews [on both], i decided to take the leap on this one even though it rotates and may have a higher likelihood of breaking.  (i, too, believe that the more parts there are, the higher chance it will break).  BUT if it does stop spinning, i assume it will then just be like the other hot air brushes out there.  so back to this god-send, this thing is so great!!  i saw that people have a hard time using the rotating part, but i think if you just look up some tutorials on youtube, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.  and also, practice makes perfect- i&#x27;m sure the stylists did not learn how to blow-out hair like that overnight.  my hair feels so smooth and has a lot of volume after using this-  you can use it to help straighten out your hair or add some nice big waves.  it really does give life to my fine hair!!</li>
    <li> Caused me to lose hair in patches. Stay away from this one</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Infiniti Pro Spinning Air Rotating Styling brush.  It took me a few times to get used to it.  There is one button for flipping  your hair up and one button for turning your hair under. I taped a extra small button on the side that turns under so I know which button is the one I need.  You can wash your hair and towel dry it and then use the Infiniti brush to style it.  I was amazed at how my hair SHINES when I&#x27;m done and it eliminates using a heavy blow dryer. I use it to style my hair dry also and my hair shines just the same.  You don&#x27;t have to have the brush spinning if you don&#x27;t want to, just use like a regular air brush.  It has a cool down button also along with 2 heat settings.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this brush!</li>
    <li> Love it. Dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome, especially for someone with no hair styling talent like me! It took me a bit to get used to the size, weight and the placement of the controls, but after that it&#x27;s pretty smooth sailing. It&#x27;s great for getting the ends of my straight, shoulder length hair to flip under or over. My only complaint is that the air blowing through does make the hair a bit frizzier than I would like, but that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for a product that can do my hair drying and styling in one step without me having to coordinate a brush and hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I am a 57 year old women with medium length thinning hair due to menopause. I purchased the Rotation Styler hoping it could give me some body in the places on my crown where my hair was thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it really worked well for me, the first day I used it and went into work, my boss asked me how did I get my hair so thick and shiny overnight!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the easiest hair tools I have ever used, and for me works better than any I have purchased in years.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this styler to anyone who wants to have thinning hair look so much thicker, so very easy.</li>
    <li> Ditch your round metal brush and get one of these. So much easier to use and so much more effective at producing volume.  Added bonus of smoothing my already smooth hair so it looks extra shiny. My hair ends up looking like it does after a professional blows it out after a haircut - no joke.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous when I purchased this that I was going to have trouble using it on my long thick hair. My hair falls about mid-way down my back and is layered.  It&#x27;s also quite thick.  To use this product, I needed to let my hair dry naturally for an hour as if I did it straight from the shower, it would have been too wet.  But it will be perfect for night time showers and morning time styling.  I did find that I needed to zap my roots with my regular hair dryer to ensure they were dry enough.  Other than that -- this left my hair shiny and smooth WITHOUT additional hair product. I highly recommend it!  It won&#x27;t replace my other tools, but it will save me time int he morning and save me from straightening my hair after blow drying (something I usually do because my hair is frizzy/wavy).</li>
    <li> I first used the Styler at my sisters just to see if it would add any life whatsoever to my fine hair and couldn&#x27;t believe how nice and full it made my hair look! I just recently purchased one of my own and really enjoy it, although since it is brand new the bristles are obviously a bit tougher and a little harder to manage at first.Overall though I would highly recommend this to anyone that has fine hair, it is definitely a game changer!</li>
    <li> Does a good job but broke one yr later when motor driving brush stopped working!  Taken good care of yet broke.  Trying Vidal  model next.</li>
    <li> the styler is great, and really works, but the brush is a little bit big to my hair, that is thin and not much long</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this tool gives me the option to blow my hair out and straighten it quickly.  Works like a charm!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have long hair that tends to frizz.  This brush makes my hair really smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it tangling. I don&#x27;t get any volume though.  For that I have to normal blow dry first and then finish it off with this brush to make it smooth.</li>
    <li> This looked great, and thought it would give my fine, limp hair volume.  But, it was too heavy for me to handle, and did not do for my thin hair, what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried several straighteners and hair dryers in the past but nothing works as good as this product. It is very easy to use and sets my hair beautifully (salon style) in less than half the time ! FYI, I have medium length hair and I have no troubles using it. Glad my hairstylist recommended this product. I love it !</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer/styler i have ever owen. It is great on my hair which is just below my chin. Styles and drys at the same time.</li>
    <li> I was so attached to my old Revostyler, using it long after the battery was giving up, that I resisted starting over with a new hair styler.  This Infinitpro was so fast, easy, safe I threw my old Revo right in the trash.  It made my difficult-to-tame hair look like I just got out of the salon.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is, at this point, medium length so I can not say how it would fare with very long or very short hair.  The barrel is fairly large and there was NO tangling when using the revolving brush.  It dried my hair in a reasonable amount of time on the high heat setting and was never burning hot.  It is light enough that I could do my whole head without my arms getting tired.  I cannot imagine you would be disappointed by this styler- Conair has perfected the spin.</li>
    <li> This is NOT an ESSENTIAL styling tool, but it&#x27;s still a lot of fun.  If you have some extra cash, for if.  If not, a big brush and blow dryer will do the trick.</li>
    <li> When you take it out of the box, you think oh my that&#x27;s really big but if you just try it and&lt;br /&gt;play around with it, it works great.  I have shoulder length layered hair and I practiced and&lt;br /&gt;it does smooth out all the frizzies.  You have to first dry your hair to dampness before you&lt;br /&gt;use this but then it does all the rest of the work and you don&#x27;t need to use two hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like it, Amazon&#x27;s more than generous return policy will let you send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> Let me say I purchased this 6 months ago, and I have worked in a salon and had to blow out hair (but am not a stylist).&lt;br /&gt;My hair is terrible, very thick, long and layered, easy to frizz, and anytime I purchase something from the store/online I&#x27;m always disappointed. Not this time! I now have 3 of these (one is the pro titanium but I don&#x27;t see a difference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer some concerns I saw on here before I made my purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is bigger, so if you have very short hair this may not work, it is NOT bigger than the brush I normally use (ceramic) to do my hair&lt;br /&gt;- There is no spinning in the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting because it SETS volume (just like hot curlers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this right out of the box, and reading one reviewers tip- the top button always curls in, no matter which hand. It does take some getting used to and you will end up pressing the button accidentally. The first time I used this I was going to a party, and I was shocked at how well my hair looked and held- for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not replace a ceramic crush or blow-dryer.I was confused about some reviews stating that they couldn&#x27;t use this on wet hair. You would NOT use a ceramic brush on wet hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that has a wave, so I usually wash my hair, add product and walk around for a bit. Once my hair is dry I section and start. Sometimes I need to use a blow-dryer on the back, section by section. If you have layers you need to learn to section well, or go back later and pull them out and go over them with the brush. If they are short they don&#x27;t catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has actually been very healthy because I don&#x27;t blow-dry, then ceramic brush, then use a curler etc. All I do is use this, spray some hairspray and it holds the style for a good 3 days, so for me even if this took 15 min longer the style stays for a long time making it 100% worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest reason you will never have a salon blow out at home is due to the fact that you need constant tension (pulling) and spinning. It&#x27;s almost impossible to do unless you have thin hair. This really curls hair in and smooths it. Normally I can&#x27;t just walk around or my hair will look \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; after I ceramic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this product from the get go, but what really stood out? I was going to the American Beauty Show and was sick, I could barely get up that morning and my hair was just frizzy and wavy (I washed and went to bed). I wet my hair with a keratin spray and water then used the brush. I was STUNNED. My hair looked like I spent hours blow drying and styling.. it took 20min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this to refresh a style with dry shampoo, or add more bounce to your hair. I really would recommend you try this a few times and see. This is the only product I have purchased that I actually love to use. Everything else is usually over advertised and does not work on thick hair. My hair is so thick I can&#x27;t even buy clips at the store (even when they say \\&quot;thick hair\\&quot;) because they don&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this rotating styler.  However, it&#x27;s not worth the money.  The styler is bulky and difficult to use if your hair isn&#x27;t long.  If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d pass on this item</li>
    <li> Because I have short hair the brush was a little too big to do a good job, so I rate it only as okay. I would like to have had a smaller brush. which was what I expected.</li>
    <li> This hair brush handle leaves me in pain. It is a fat hair brush for my hands to handle for too long.  The styler does not dry my hair roots very well leaving my hair damp and frizzy in the roots.  The reviews say it dries hair quicker but that is not my experience.  The dryer is not powerful enough in my opinion. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I was using the brush one morning in a hurry and got to close to my eye. It rolled right over my cornea. Pretty deep abrasions according to the eye dr. Love the brush and how it makes my hair shine, just don&#x27;t do what I did.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my right hand and it was in a cast for weeks.  I needed something to do my hair with that only required 1 hand -my left no less,  This was a god send! I have naturally curly hair and this made styling sooo easy and my hair was so soft and shiny! I actually bought 1 as a gift and recommended it to several other people with all sorts of hair, long, short, etc. It dries and styles in 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Totally unpractical product for your hair, especially if you think that it will save you some time from the traditional hair dryer....well not!!!  It actually takes twice the time and effort to brush your hair with this.</li>
    <li> I am naturally wave hair. It could help me make my hair looks more smooth and nature. But it is a little bit big to carry.</li>
    <li> My main complaint about this styler is that it&#x27;s too big. It is well made but is very awkward to use. Gave it to my granddaughter and she said the same thing.</li>
    <li> bristles don&#x27;t grip hair tight enough to straighten, and your left with styling ridges around your face and bangs - just ok</li>
    <li> I love this styler.  I normally have completely straight hair and this makes my hair smooth and bouncy looking with lots of body and shine.</li>
    <li> it do works... but must be careful.  as it do entangle and damage hair.  best to use the low heat.</li>
    <li> I was using a Infiniti Pro by Conair and loved it.  I had several of them as when one quit working I bought another. This time when I needed one I found it was unavailable! I tried the Conair 3-in-1 Ionic Styler Dryer  and even though by hair is to the top of my shoulders, my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough to pull though so it was rapidly returned. I read the ratings for the Infinitipro and wanted to give it a try.  All reviews said it did not tangle the hair......well it certainly does! I have pulled out a fair amount of hair trying to brush the tangles out, it really does a good job tangling!  When I finally finish drying and rolling, my hair does look good but this look does not last and then it seems more dull and listless. I also use a blow dryer with it as the Spin Air it not real good at getting the hair dry!  I never had this problem with the Infiniti Pro by Conair!  I have located the Infiniti Pro by Conair and have placed an order for it! I believe this one should only be used with shorter haircuts. I am disappointed in its performance.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product. It someone lags because I have really thick hair. If you have thin hair it&#x27;d be great</li>
    <li> Very happy with this.  I have curly/frizzy hair, but not curly enough to let it dry naturally.  This really smooths my hair.  My husband even noticed how nice my hair looked.  The bristles are very soft.  The spin you turn on going either way.</li>
    <li> It is pretty nice but I need time to get used to the rotating part.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length and really fine straight Asian hair.It smooth and shine my hair and adds volume :)&lt;br /&gt;Hint: really have to make sure your hair is 80% dry before using it, otherwise the rotating doesn&#x27;t work that well.&lt;br /&gt;Also I normally use cool air for the finish touch, it can shine your hair even more :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it over all!~</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair look ALIVE! I use it at home and take it with me when I go away from home. My hair has gone from flat, pin-straight flat ironed hair to salon-esque, volumized hair. My hair looks best when the spinbrush is used right after a shower as oppose to shower-sleep-style the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE IT: Take a small section of your hair, spin it into the brush up into the direction toward your head. Hold the brush in place for a few seconds, then move brush down to release hair into style--you may have to push the button in the opposite spin direction to release hair if you spin your hair too tight. Your hair should not be sopping wet--it should be air/blower dried, but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The buttons are easy to figure out. The user is able to catch on to using the spinbrush effectively right away. My hair is very curly, but the spinbrush makes my hair straight with life to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Ok, there&#x27;s a spot at the top of the brush above the bristles where your hair can get caught in an awkward spin pattern. I think it&#x27;s the only part that I think is directly, definitely burning my hair. It&#x27;s just not a good spot but it&#x27;s almost unavoidable to get your hair twirled awkwardly outside the bristles at that part, especially if you are spinning a big section of hair. Also, sometimes I use my straightener minimally to keep my hair nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must-have, and a must-use. I bought it to experiment with it out of curiosity. I choose to use it whenever I want my hair straight and stylish. Despite the cons, I rate this product 5 stars, because I do indeed love the product. Give it a try, and you will, too!</li>
    <li> Product arrived with hair in the brush and bristles falling out.  Threw it out and will reorder.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have been using it for at least 8 years and it makes styling so easy. Result is big waves, salon quality blow out. I am so thankful for this product and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!!  How are other companies not making this?!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the quality. The buttons did not work very well. Very bad quality to be honest. The box seemed to have been opened. I threw it in the bin and got another one. Ordering from europe is not worth it, it take too long to get here.</li>
    <li> This is better than I expected. It has a large barrel, but it gives just the right amount of body and somehow it does make my hair shinier.</li>
    <li> Made hair very smooth but did not give fullness or height as promised. Maybe works for short hair</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work the best on my hair. But works ok.</li>
    <li> An amazing product absolutely!!~ Definitely Love it!!!~~ I have shoulder-length hair and it does made my hair looks in great style and with volume added~~ I also searched some videos on Youtube to learn how to use it and that did help a lot!!~~In all, It is well worth the 5-star!~~&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: It may not totally substitute the blow-dryer, so I recommend using it when your hair is about 80% dry : )</li>
    <li> Returned it. THUMBS DOWN</li>
    <li> Even after watching videos on how to use this for optimal results, I couldn&#x27;t get it to perform. My hair is pin-straight, collarbone-length, and medium weight and texture. I don&#x27;t see how all that plastic with air blowing &amp; barrel turning can be good for your hair anyway. I got much better results when I went back to my trusty large-barrel aluminum blowdry brush and my 6-setting blowdryer. Don&#x27;t spend the $!</li>
    <li> The engine was too weak for my thick, long and curly hair.</li>
    <li> I read so many great reviews that I had to have it right away, so I bought it from a local retailer for about $50.  I was disappointed at first, but rather then give up I watched reviews and learned how to use it.  Now I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is chemically treated, damanged, fine, straight but with the most annoying cowlicks. I was looking for something less damanging then my flat iron, and this works.  My main issue was getting volume at the roots, especially at the crown, and this does it!  After so many styling tools, volumizing products, and teasing, I finally found something that works,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I have let my hair air dry to about 95% dryness.  I can style my hair in about 5 minutes and even on the hot setting, I don&#x27;t feel it is very damaging.  I recommend watching a few videos to see how to use it, and experiment several times before giving up.</li>
    <li> Best product to dry your hair and give it body.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is what I have  always needed. The rotating brush makes one handed drying/styling a breeze!  I no longer need my flat iron.  Now, just one step styling.</li>
    <li> REALLY easy to use.  You quickly get which button is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that this does not completely straighten my hair.  I get mostly straight but  this styler will give your hair a bit of curl.  Good product and does save me time...but not perfectly straight hair.  Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I use this after I have dried my hair about 70% with a traditional hair dryer. This is the perfect finishing tool to give you the best saon quality blowout. The one drawback is that my long hair occasionally gets caught in the metal piece at the end of the brush.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I&#x27;d like, but I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with my hair so naturally when I saw this I wanted to give it a go, I am disappointed. My hair is thick and long and the bristles on this brush are so soft, it doesn&#x27;t even grip my hair, needless to say I spent like 1.5 hours trying to blow it out...arghhhh, I think I&#x27;ll stick to air drying and using my Sedu to flat iron whenever I need to be super straight ...</li>
    <li> Love it, but you do have to dry your hair a little before use, or just air dry doing other stuff then style, it&#x27;s best if you have relatively short hair.  Mine is just to top of shoulders.  And I really love it.  I had the Revo spinning brush and liked that too but it is too cumbersome an you need to use the hair dryer with it.  Did I mention that I love this thing:)</li>
    <li> it works fine as expected my wife likes it she only were looking for metal roll which increase the speed but anyway it is good thick hair .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It was like doing nothing to my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is a few inches below my shoulders and layered.  I have full, coarse hair that tends to frizz easily.  I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to get my hair to look anything like what my hair stylists can do.  I&#x27;ve got no skills with a round brush, and my paddle brush just doesn&#x27;t do the trick to build in flip and body.  Then, this spinning hot air iron thing entered my world.  WOW.  I got REALLY close to what my hair looked like the last time I left the salon!  Now, I still can&#x27;t get it as smooth as he can as quickly as he can, but I&#x27;m still learning how to maximize this thing.  I think I&#x27;m only going to get better at it.  I&#x27;m totally shocked that it doesn&#x27;t tangle and get wrapped in my hair!  There were only a couple of times that I snagged something I didn&#x27;t intend to, and that was because I got button happy and forgot what I was doing and/or spinned it the wrong way.  But I still was using it well after only a minute of using it, and by the time I was halfway through my hair I had already learned a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I agree with other reviews that your hair needs to be 80%+ dry, otherwise you spend a lot of time just drying the roots.&lt;br /&gt;2 - If you keep hold of your hair (don&#x27;t let go) and turn on the spin, you can hold it at the root of your hair without wrapping your hair around it.  This helps to smooth it at the roots.  Just make sure the spin is going away from your head, whether you&#x27;re holding it on the top or the bottom of the section of hair you&#x27;re working.&lt;br /&gt;3 - I&#x27;m going to buy a second one to keep in my closet as a backup.  You never know when a power surge is going to take out your favorite appliance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so thrilled!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I wish the dryer part got a little hotter but I love it.</li>
    <li> This dryer/styler was a gift for my wife.  She LOVES it! She can dry &amp; style her hair in just a few minutes and it always comes out looking beautiful.  It may not work as well on very short hair, since the brush is designed to wind around the locks as you dry &amp; style.  My wife&#x27;s hair is medium short &amp; somewhat naturally curly -- the Infiniti Pro works well for her.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Works great on thick and curly hair!</li>
    <li> It works quite well but it tends to pull out lots of hair. So, I only use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> The product is really good, my wife was wanting it for ages and she is very satisfied. Somethimes her hair get stuck in the brush and it seems to really hurt, but it is not a big deal since it is not that often (she uses it everyday!)</li>
    <li> ilove this item and use it every day..</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was expected. Glad to have bought it for my girlfriend. She was happy.</li>
    <li> I did not like because it has no power and no heat is so much frizzy hair</li>
    <li> The brush is too big to use drying hair as short as mine. I think the brush must work well with girls with long hair. I would like the same hair dryer with a smaller brush.</li>
    <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
    <li> Your hair will shine after some brushes! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best handheld device I&#x27;ve ever found for round brush drying and smoothing. Easy to use and has a very strong motor.</li>
    <li> WOW I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THING STOPPED WORKING THE FIRST DAY I GOT IT I HATE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to, but works well, except it creates static, all in all a very useful tool</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, dries hair quickly and helps the style last all day! Makes a great gift as well!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as useful as you think it sould be.</li>
    <li> Perfect for finishing after using a hair dryer to partially dry my hair. Has cut time to style. Easy enough to use in layers beginning at the bottom and working up to top. Makes my shoulder length thick frizzy hair smoother.</li>
    <li> I really liked the product, the only thing that i have to complain is that is not working in a certain speed (the fastest).</li>
    <li> Loved it Does what it says</li>
    <li> pretty much useless, and leaves my hair full of static</li>
    <li> I can style my hair the way my hairdresser does. I have long hair and it takes less time than ever.  It takes practice but once you get the hang of it you will love it love it.</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome. I am a dude with shorter hair... probably should have gotten the thinner one.</li>
    <li> I have curly fine hair but a lot of it. I went from a ponytail every day to blown out beautiful hair! This tool is amazing and I may buy another one just in case this one breaks and they stop making it.</li>
    <li> This item is perfect dry and brush the hair at the same time. Super convenient.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about this hair brush as I have very fine hair but this is a true miracle as my hair looks and feel fuller than ever. My hand does not get tired and it does the trick in 5 mins.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up enough.</li>
    <li> Used it only two times and not rotating any more !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked only two times for me !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> i really like this item, i have a long hair and it does the job nicely, its worth it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! I have short hair so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as I blow dry/brush my hair with one hand and hold my 16 mo with the other. This may not be the case with longer hair or may just take more finagling. There are 3 settings - hi, low, and cool. The brush odors not spin on the cool setting. It&#x27;s great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the Infinitpro Spin Air Rotating Styler. Great for shaping and smoothing and does not damage your hair like the flat iron. Used it the first time early this year, my daughter who is in law school had one and i gave it a whril, Loved it so much I had to have one. I have short hair and it is perfect for me or for anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve a little over shoulder length hair... It gives my hair the perfect bounce, volume and curve...&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money... Although I just got it a couple of hours ago, I&#x27;m already loving it... It gives the desired look with not more than 15 mins of styling time... With the option of low heat, my hair needn&#x27;t endure as much damage as styling hair dryer does... (I find hair drying and styling at the salons very damaging to my hair... I can almost immediately feel the brittleness of my hair after the styling session) This styler does nothing like that to my hair and yet leaves it totally set and I&#x27;m ready for a perfect romantic evening with my husband within minutes... (without my hair smelling a burnt rubber tyre... Yes, my  hair is sensitive to even slightly high temp of the hair dryer... ) :)</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted the item after watching another girl with similar hair texture use it in a YouTube video.  The item was delivered on time.  It is easy to use and saves time and effort compared to the usual methods we were using to style my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is thick and kinky and it does straighten her hair, but after practice we realized to get he best effects we need to use a light hair grease and run the spin brush through her hair several times in both directions.  Still takes less time and effort than before and the results look nice.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use.  Did not send it back because they did not sent me an invoicre with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great styler.  Easy to use and cuts the time it takes to dry and style your hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this soooooo much, that I bought one for my&lt;br /&gt;sister. I also told my hairdresser about it and showed&lt;br /&gt;him how it works.[[ASIN:B004INUWX0 Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black]]</li>
    <li> Really like this product..I  have used this spin  air brush few times and Iike the result.I  have wavy hair.Love tbe idea of waiting till your hair al most dry before using tne brush.I do not like a lot of heat on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  I used to have to hold up a round hair brush with a hair dryer.  I kept knocking my head with the hair dryer because I&#x27;m completely uncoordinated.  I bought this when it first came out.  I have hair past my shoulders which is perfect for the spin brush.  I dry my hair mostly with a regular hair dryer first.  I also spray my hair while wet with a thermal protector.  I feel like I&#x27;ve just left the salon whenever I use this thing.</li>
    <li> For years, I used the older style of air curler (the one that did not spin).  I decided to give this one a try and feel that it works about the same as the older version.  I feel I get the same effect but slightly faster with this new spinning version.  I have long, loose curly hair which leaves me with frizzes everywhere after blow drying.  This product definitely gets rid of the frizzes but it does not leave me with much curl set in on the ends.  This is expected considering this is an air curler and not a curling iron.  Overall, this product does what it claims by smoothing out the hair...but so does the older version that doesn&#x27;t spin (and is cheaper).  If the one I have breaks, I would likely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> It shipped fast and was packaged safely! Very happy with this product! But don&#x27;t expect it to dry your hair super fast, it&#x27;s not made for that.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what its advertised to do which I love.  I just wish it was at least one third smaller.  It is slightly bulky.</li>
    <li> I definitely love this styling tool.  I am not a very coordinated person so trying to use a round brush and a hair dryer is out of the question...someone would get hurt. So, this is a fantastic alternative. You have the control to make the head spin both clockwise and counter clockwise or to not spin at all.  I have not ever gotten my hair stuck in the brush because of these controls.  If you spin it too tight one way, you can just back it off by spinning it the opposite way.  One thing I have noticed is one or two of my hairs can get caught in the seam between the cap at the top and the bristles when the brush is spinning.  It&#x27;s like when your hair gets caught in an elastic and you end up breaking it off in order to get it out.  The only way around this dilemma is to use smaller amounts of hair when you spin. Definitely a great purchase for those without the talents to dry your hair the old fashioned way.</li>
    <li> this is by far the worse product EVER..it rotated once then stopped...i received a refund on it..i ordered a Babyliss Nano titanium rotating hot brush and it was more expensive, but it works great..conair products are usually junk, I should have known better..</li>
    <li> Quite like this product. I have moderately coarse in texture (but not particularly thick in volume) naturally wavy and spongy shoulder length hair. t took me a few tries to get the hang of it, but I set it in on high, and use the rotating movement. After about 5-7 minutes, I can both dry my hair (although it works best with slightly damp hair) and style it. I end up with nice, bouncy (straight if I want it) bob with decent volume and lovely movement. I also get decent shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing preventing me from giving this product 5 stars is the fact that it&#x27;s left my hair feeling oily and limp at the end of the day. I don&#x27;t know why my hair is falling so flat, but it&#x27;s more flat than just using a hair dryer. I suspect it&#x27;s because the rotating motion is distributing oil from the scalp down the hair shaft -- in part why it creates shine and smooths. But, by the time I leave work at 5pm, my hair is so flat I&#x27;ve had to resort to putting in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I still need to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I have chin length straight hair that is not thick.  The rotating motor burnt out the FIRST time I used this product. Needless to say I returned it and did not take a replacement.  Maybe I just had a lemon and should have tried another. I can&#x27;t imagine this product would be able to work on longer or hair that is curly or even wavy. It also does not get very hot and was impossible to use without the spinning feature like some hair dryers of this type will.</li>
    <li> This is such a great hair styling product. It works exactly how it says it does. It cuts the time for me to blow out my hair by half. It is so easy to use, and leaves your hair smooth, soft, and styled. I have long, thick hair, and it works great in my hair. I absolutely love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> All i can say is i should have payed more attentions to the reviews. IT sucks it leaves my hair really frizzy and it gets caught up and practically yanks my hair. Save your money this isnt worth it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does not work as in the video. It slips right through your hair, and even when I can get it to wind around, the blower is so weak it doesn&#x27;t have any effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a brush hair dryer for years because I have fine hair. I have shoulder length hair and found that it straightens my curly hair (because the brush is too big), but leaves my hair very shiny. Although it&#x27;s a little heavy, the shine outweighs the bulk.</li>
    <li> Recibí este producto el viernes 21 diciembre 2012, lo utilice hoy en mi cabello, quedo mejor que ir al estilista. Porque los estilistas no hacen las cosas bien y si cobran mucho. Este producto es fantástico mi cabello quedo súper. Estoy feliz. Ahora solo falta ver cuánto tiempo de duración tiene este aparato.</li>
    <li> This thing GRABS your hair if you don&#x27;t get a narrow enough piece and very literally ties in knots.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating.  KNOTS.  My hair is fairly short (chin length) and while I think this does an okay job styling hair, I hesitate to use it because  end up having to spend extra time untangling the errible tangles.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> When I was researching a new product I was a little skeptical because I wasn&#x27;t sure the brush would dry my long thick curly hair.  I went ahead and ordered it, just because I needed something. When I washed my hair I toweled dried it. Then I separated my hair into small sections. I took my hair dryer  with the defuser and just dried my hair for about 5 minutes. I then took the Infinity Pro &amp; started to dry each section, going in one direction then the other until dry.  OMG my hair is so shinny and has the volume I like. I love my new Infinity Pro and would recommend it to anyone who wants beautiful hair. Everyday people tell me how beautiful my hair is. If you used the REVO styler in the past that is no longer available you will love this styler. It is so light and the buttons to control the rotations are so well placed. Bravo Conair for creating this product!</li>
    <li> Works okay.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to curl my hair like I hoped it would, like a styling brush and hair dryer.  Was hoping to have an extra hand while using it, but it doesn&#x27;t blow hot air as much as a hair dryer, and creates bad static!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week and I have been pleased. It takes some getting use to, and it won&#x27;t look perfect at first. The only negatives I have seen is if you are going too quick and it gets too close to my roots, my hair gets all knotted and tangled in it. Also the air flow is not heavy enough to dry the hair. Mine is long thick hair so I use a hair dryer to dry most of it before using this product. I don&#x27;t try it completely, just so it is a little damp.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product I have ever tried.  Use to take me up to an hour to blow my hair with a roundbrush and it still looked awful.  With the infinitipro spinner it takes 15 min and looks like a professional job plus my hair is super shiny.</li>
    <li> Purchased it for her at Christmas and she has really enjoyed it...So much so that the old &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; dryer is on my side of the cabinet now. Tells you all you need to know :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this rotating styler for about 3 weeks and it works great!  I love it!  It&#x27;s a little tricky at first as you need to keep a firm grasp on the handle.  It also took me a few times to get the hang of what directional button to press depending on what hand I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and was concerned that the brush wouldn&#x27;t hold the sections but it handles my thick mane nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice wavy style (not much curl) that will last a second day and still look nicely styled then this may work well for you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, not enough power. We bought two, one didn&#x27;t work at all, the other just didn&#x27;t get hot enough. Returned the second one to try again. It also didn&#x27;t work. Also three went back.</li>
    <li> I love this brush and can not be without it. It gives my long hair volume and makes it shine.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this would take the place of my blowdrier and round brush followed with flat iron but it won&#x27;t.  I have shoulder length fairly curly hair.  This straightened it somewhat but left it frizzy and often snarled/pulled and in need of a flat iron.  I tried it with and without product.  I let my 18 year old (long hair) try it and used it on my 7 year old (shoulder length straight hair) and neither girl liked it.  After using it only a handful of times it stopped spinning in one of the directions.</li>
    <li> excellent, Iloveit, works great and build body like a pro stylist I use it every time I style my hair, just wash and spin</li>
    <li> I have thinning, fine, medium length, semi frizzy hair.  When I first got this tool I was excited because I wanted volume in my hair and I figured this tool would do it.  At first it was awkward to use but you get use to it.  I&#x27;m very lazy when it comes to my hair so I don&#x27;t use it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for over a year but since it doesn&#x27;t get used frequently I&#x27;ll estimate that after approximately 10 uses,  the speed of the rotating brush went from 100% to about 25% - I mean ssssslllllooooooowwwww but then for no reason at all,  it would come back to its original speed then go back to slow - I checked to make sure no hair was tangled and I can&#x27;t figure out why it slows down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty unhappy with this air brush until a couple of days ago.  The brush has been at its regular speed but alone, the brush does NOTHING for my thin flat hair BUT in conjunction with John Frieda Luxurious Volume Shampoo, Conditioner AND Blow Out Spray I&#x27;m happier than I&#x27;ve ever been.  The shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel fluffy and soft and the blow out spray helps the Infinity Air Brush helps my roots stand up.  The amount of volume I get is astonishing!!!  Try it!!</li>
    <li> I gave it as gift for my sister, and she love it. just be careful for it not pulling so hard on your hair</li>
    <li> I can do better myself with a round brush and blow dryer. I got it hoping it would save time in the morning and I could still look like I attempted to do something with my hair. I have thin, medium length hair and still need to blow dry it quite a bit before using it which defeats the purpose. If you leave it wet it is difficult to dry it and curl it. The instructions that came with it even said that blow drying prior might be necessary. I was disappointed by that from the start. It also lessens my ability to get a good curl, because it&#x27;s now half dried. Not being ceramic is a down side too, because it doesn&#x27;t style that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has A LOT of power. It can take a fair amount of muscle to hold it back from tangling up in my hair. I did not think it would be that difficult to use. It also does wrap your hair in the groove between the brush and handle sometimes, this can be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t meet the expectations I had for it, especially for the price!!! I went back to my ceramic round brush and blow dryer method.</li>
    <li> Returned this product. I found that it tangled in my hair plus the brush rotation direction buttons were hard to navigate.</li>
    <li> great product!!!! Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler,.Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler, Black</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer for my long hair to smooth out my wet hair and make it shiny.  My hair dryer takes too long.  I recommend this if you want to speed up the drying process and straighten longer hair.</li>
    <li> The InfinitiPro Spin Air Rotating Styler works very well. I have medium length hair and it does not get stuck in my hair while spinning.  If it gets tight, just stop spinning and comb it out a little.  It spins just like they say it does. If you are wondering if the spin feature is going to work well like on TV, then YES it spins very well both ways.  It really does not &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my hair like a curling iron would though.  It does smooth it while it drys.  It does give it some shape and wave (especially if using mousse first.)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great and really does give you the salon blow dry look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick wavy hair and does a great job of smoothing, styling and straightening.&lt;br /&gt;It never tangles in my hair and is really easy to use, very little learning curve.  If you have a lot of hair to save time dry it a little first with a regular blow dryer.</li>
    <li> So much better than expected! Quick styling is possible and i don&#x27;t need to get expensive perms anymore! I think it works better when my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> Replaced for one my wife has been using a few years that broke. Such a good price bought a second one for future needs.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny this is a great blowdrying styling too. THE BEST</li>
    <li> I am glad that now I can manage my hair. It is comfortable in hands.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the heat was hotter.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  More than what I expected. Works greate on dry hair as a touch up if u are in a hurry. I have a long thick wavy hair. Grate adutrion too my hair essentials.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it. I have fine hair and it gives it a great boost.</li>
    <li> If you want this to replace the original REVO you will be disappointed.  If this is your first attempt at round brushing, you may love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick wavy/frizzy hair. I was in love with my original REVO back in the day (think gorgeous movie star hair), so I measure all my hair gadgets up to REVO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infiniti pros:  has a cord, doesn&#x27;t tangle long hair, puts out heat (not even close to enough to replace hair dryer), price, small learning curve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not enough tension to release tough frizz or create big volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original REVO pros: creates more tension, which equals better results- smoother hair with more volume than what is achievable with Infiniti&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: price, tangles easily, cordless (have to charge frequently), not as durable as you would expect for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously REVO isn&#x27;t the perfect product based on cons, but it does give the best results.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It makes my hair look fuller and straightens it the way I like it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cuts time and effort in less than half</li>
    <li> Always thought these rotating kinds would not work for straitening curly hair but it works perfect  and gives your hair a nice volume. just have to make sure to use it before your hair is completely dry. Also bought it from cvs for close to $70. And found it on Amazon for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent, good quality, durable excellent presentation. I had no problems even with quality. thanks you for it</li>
    <li> Great product and packaging. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Great product to dry and straighten my hair. Tried several times to curl my hair, doesn&#x27;t work very well, still trying now. Sometimes my hair gets caught between the rotating and stationary part as others mentioned in the review and that&#x27;s really hurt. I have very long hair, so it took me more than half an hour to dry my hair...... Anyway, still like it.</li>
    <li> I would love to find an identical brush with a smaller handle. The handle is way too big. My hair is bouncy and shiny after using it.</li>
    <li> Awesome results, every single female must have it. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair styler like this before. No Frizz , and so smooth, styled hairs.</li>
    <li> Did not work I have reached it does not operate will not bought back anything electronic impossible saddle ßĘíŃ you expect it to work well, but disappointed omitted did not work</li>
    <li> This styler is very easy to use and does a great job of drying the hair, as well as giving great volume.  I use this everyday and it makes styling my hair so quick and easy.  It only takes me about ten minutes to get fantastic bouncy hair.  This is a must have for everyday!</li>
    <li> It does a nice job of curling and smoothing out your hair.</li>
    <li> I do not use it to dry - use a blowdryer to partially dry then use the styler - It does a nice curl which does last - there was a slight learning curve with getting the right button.  I do agree with the person that wanted to see a smaller brush or interchangeable brush.  But I am glad I bought it and again love the curl.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, frizzy, damaged, awkward hair. It lays flat and limp against my head and no matter how hard I try, I can never get my hair to have any volume or shine without looking flat and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this spin styler once (I got it in the mail last night) but so far I LOVE IT! My hair is soft, smooth, and shiny! It&#x27;s laying straight with a touch of curl on the ends and it looks beautiful! The only thing I couldn&#x27;t do with it (so far, since I&#x27;ve only used it once) was to get any root volume. When I use a blowdryer, I can get root volume by pulling the hair up from the roots and flipping my head upside down. I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out how to do that with the spin styler, but I&#x27;m sure I will with a little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have frizzy, damaged hair that gets even more wrecked by a blowdryer, I highly recommend the Infinitipro spin air rotating styler. You&#x27;ll have smoother, softer, shiny hair in less time :)</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to get use to it, but now I really love it. Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited.  I&#x27;ve only tried it out so far but look forward to actually drying my very curling hair with it so that I can straighten my hair and yet leave it with body. The hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past have burned out because my hair wraps over the vent.  That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this one.  When I tested it, it dried my hair and left it with plenty of bounce .</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and was looking for a hairdryer that would help relax the waves for a more sleek look.  I found that this hairdryer isn&#x27;t strong enough.  I was reluctant to buy it after I read some of the reviews but I thought how bad can it be?  If you have 2 hours to dry your hair in the morning before you go to work then it will work. 500 watts is for baby hair or people with very thin hair.  I went back to my Conair with 1875 watts using a round brush.  It still takes me 30 minutes to dry my hair using this method but it&#x27;s the best I have at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning it but I would rather leave it in plain view in my bathroom as a reminder to never buy a hairdryer that only has 500 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Infiniti would make this same dryer with 1875 watts it would be like building a better mousetrap.  They would sell like hotcakes.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, really fine, and straight. But it&#x27;s thick, I have a lot of fine hair. Even with layers and a blow out, I always ended up with flat limp hair within hours , until now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take too long and gives me soft, voluminous hair.&lt;br /&gt;Yep, this is going to be my go to every day.&lt;br /&gt;Note: use the protective cover over the brushes. Otherwise the brushes get flattened, I didn&#x27;t read that part right away. But they straightened out.</li>
    <li> Actually it&#x27;s really awasome product, but i bought it on 15 Mar, only use 3mths, then it&#x27;s broken cannot spin. i think the quality must be improved !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
