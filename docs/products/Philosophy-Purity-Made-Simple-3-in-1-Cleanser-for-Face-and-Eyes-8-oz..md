    <li> Been using this for about two years.Started my friend to use this cleanser.I have never used a cleanser this great.Better than makeup wipes or cleansing oils.Does not sting or leave residue,An 8 ounce bottle lasts at least three months.QVC shows demos of this cleanser removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Only used one week, but so far so good. Cleans very well, eye makeup removed easy. Smells fine.</li>

    <li> Fantastic product, highly recommend, not too stringent, leaving the face feeling clean and soft. Will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Purity Made Simple is a really nice cleanser that leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.  It&#x27;s a 3-in-1 makeup remover, cleanser, and toner.  I don&#x27;t use it to remove my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick lotion that leaves my skin feeling like the makeup is melting away.  I don&#x27;t feel stripped after cleansing.  My face feels very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d call Purity Made Simple...luxurious.  I&#x27;ll be adding this to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and so gentle to the skin.</li>
    <li> Great fit, great product, great value!</li>
    <li> love the smell, works great to get all my makeup off including my eye makeup, doesn&#x27;t sting at all.  love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash in the entire world!!!! It cleanses so well and takes off your make up and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes either. I&#x27;m never going to be using anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> I do like it as a face wash but it does not remove all make up around the eyes. I have to wash my face three times to remove maybe 75% of the makeup.</li>
    <li> Cleans your skin without irritation.  Non drying.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early fifties and finally found this wash later in life. It does not dry out my skin, which is oily! Sounds odd, by some washes and soaps made it too dry and made my oily skin oilier! This cleans off my makeup, rinses well and has a citrus-y scent.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser I can use it for my face and I even use it to clean my makeup brushes it is the best !!!</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products and this is one of my favorites! Great daily face wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves your face clean.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and was very excited to get it, however it was not good for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this product was very irritating to my skin.</li>
    <li> Best face cleaner ever!</li>
    <li> Only cleanser I&#x27;ve used for nearly 10 years. I swear by this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin prone to breaks outs. This is the best make up removing soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is so gentle and smooth on my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue behind adding to breakouts.</li>
    <li> love my philosophy cleanser - not harsh but gets the job done, leaving skin smooth</li>
    <li> Awesome... great on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> This is not the 3-1. I didn&#x27;t realize until I opened and used it. So disappointed because it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
