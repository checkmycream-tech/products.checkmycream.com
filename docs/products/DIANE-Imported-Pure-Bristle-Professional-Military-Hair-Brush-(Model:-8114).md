      <li>This fits great in the hand.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s an all around good brush.</li>
      <li>Good quality, good price.  </li>
      <li>Right out of the package the brush had bristles on it with a perfect firmness.</li>
      <li>Its a nice brush but</li>
      <li>Nice brush I guess, but the description (or lack of) needs work.</li>
      <li>Product&#x27;s odor went away through the use of a wash with warm water and hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is a very good hair brush and is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Get one, you&#x27;ll be thrilled, for sure.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recall giving many, if any, one star reviews, but honestly this is a piece of garbage</li>
      <li>The bristles are on the softer side but still were able to brush the hair.  </li>
      <li>One of the best brushes if u want to get waves i started to use it and the next 2 days the waves were formed</li>
      <li>You will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>I am not even sure if the bristles were even cleaned by the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered this brush TWICE ; therefore, I am pleased with this brush.</li>
      <li>Works better than a comb.</li>
      <li>This brush works better when you have a &amp;#34;fresh cut&amp;#34; or have medium length hair.</li>
      <li>Now that I have had this brush for a while, I have been able to appreciate the softness.</li>
      <li>The Diane; however, produces better wave connections and Diane has been making quality products for a longer period of time, with greater availability and for a better price.      </li>
      <li>Im still typing because I had to add 4 more words(laughs).</li>
      <li>Fit the hand much better than a handled brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good quality and fits my hand very well.</li>
      <li>This keeps the top parted to the side to give it a good professional look.  </li>
      <li>Great for short hair.</li>
      <li>and they work great, properly made quality brushes.</li>
      <li>Excellent, stiff bristle hand brush.  </li>
      <li>I have also purchased a few Kent brushes, which work wonderfully, but carry a higher price tag.  </li>
      <li>Good quality especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>It still even looks good - no chipping off of the finish on the wooden part.</li>
      <li>Just the right brush for if you just got a cut or two weeks later this would be a good brush for like if you were trying to get waves</li>
      <li>I threw it out after that first use as I would not even bother giving it to someone for free.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only one i can use on a daily basis the bristle are well made and not too space out and great if you want better waves connection</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>this thing right here...</li>
      <li>It distributes the natural oils nicely leaving the hair soft.</li>
      <li>If you are willing to spend the money, the three brushes needed for best wave results are the Diane 8119, the CQP Premium (green), and the CQP medium (blue).       </li>
      <li>when  you first  receive it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s actually difficult to find a descent brush that has the perfect firmness to it.</li>
      <li>The first week or so the bristles will shed, it has to do with the over stuffing of the holes.  </li>
      <li>I have had this brush for a year and it is still my favorite brush for my short buzz cuts.</li>
      <li>first time with DIANE brush...</li>
      <li>Now, several days later, all is well with this great product, and I can highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The Diane can be your sole brush if you know the different waving methods and if you have a good du-rag or tsu-rag (my personal favorite).</li>
      <li>I love the spacing on the bristles which keep the brush from getting too dirty and if it does; it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It works really well if your hair is on the shorter side.</li>
      <li>If you are not concerned with wave and just want a capable brush, then get the Diane 8119 or 8118.</li>
      <li>, really I threw it in the trash.  </li>
      <li>Nice ckontrol brought my waves in after a day and a half of brushing!</li>
      <li>the only problem is that the bristle keep falling out after I clean</li>
      <li>My main concern was some of the bristle falling out.</li>
      <li>I need something a little more reinforced.</li>
      <li>Durable and easy to clean, not too soft or hard.</li>
      <li>I was looking somewhere between &#x27;medium soft&#x27; and &#x27;very rigid&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good size; not too big, not too small.</li>
      <li>It could just be that it&#x27;s new and those bristles that are stragglers from installation will fall away, and that will be the end of it.</li>
      <li>An average of the descriptions and comments on the webpage seem to be accurate.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda too soft but that&#x27;s better than too hard i guess</li>
      <li>the bristles are just a bit too soft for my liking and they stink.</li>
      <li>This brush was much to soft Togo though my think hair.</li>
      <li>OLD REVIEW:</li>
      <li>These border on &#x27;noodle soft&#x27;</li>
      <li>so far.</li>
      <li>I was actually hoping this was about 1/4 the size it really is.</li>
      <li>As the old adage goes: you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i will likely order a few more just for leaving one in each of my cars.</li>
      <li>This brush is too small, doesn&#x27;t fit well in the hand, the website picture somehow got thinking it was rather like medium size or so.</li>
      <li>I been buying a lot of brushes , this was by far one of my first wave&#x27;s brush and all the other brush I bought they fade away</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very happy to deal with you, and sorry for the late response for the feedback, and I will be dealing with you all the time.</li>
      <li>As with most natural brushes it needs to be broken in.  </li>
      <li>Nice firm bristles, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
      <li>If you are a serious waver with the time to spend brushing, then get a Diane, a Tsu-rag, a fine toothed comb, and some moisturizer and save some money.</li>
      <li>It could be a little more firm.</li>
      <li>Some of the bristles are oddly long and wispy like they came straight from the hogs back, gross, truly gross.  </li>
      <li>After about a week of shedding, it becomes the normal brush you expected.</li>
      <li>But it only happens for the first few uses and then they stop falling out.</li>
      <li>I do not particularly like this brush as it is too soft for my hair.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve had some military style boar-bristle brushes that were just too hard and stiff to use on my head, but this one was very comfortable to use.</li>
<li> The bristles have to be broken in but its not bad.</li>
<li> Firm but not hard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got this for our production of The Sunshine Boys.  It is perfect for the part of having a mens brush.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recall giving many, if any, one star reviews, but honestly this is a piece of garbage, really I threw it in the trash.  It is gross. The bristles fall out excessively, even after I shampooed it and used it for several days.  I am not even sure if the bristles were even cleaned by the manufacturer.  Some of the bristles are oddly long and wispy like they came straight from the hogs back, gross, truly gross.  If you are looking for an inexpensive brush try a Firstline Evolve or Wav enforcer brush.  I have bought a couple and they work great, properly made quality brushes. Firstline seems to direct its marketing toward African Americans, but I can assure you the brush doesn&#x27;t know what race you are, or at least the one I purchased has not raised any objection to my pale scalp. There is no reason to exclude yourself from a quality brush and proper grooming just because you are a lighter hue.  Firstline brushes sell on Amazon and at other department stores and pharmacies.  I have also purchased a few Kent brushes, which work wonderfully, but carry a higher price tag.  Whatever you decide, don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
    <li> Good quality especially for the price.  I just ordered a second one for my travel kit.</li>
    <li> This brush is of a low quality and is poorly made. Bristles have been falling out from the moment I opened the package.</li>
    <li> One of the best brushes if u want to get waves i started to use it and the next 2 days the waves were formed</li>
    <li> Firm but not hard. Good grip on the sides for brushing on angles</li>
    <li> Excellent, stiff bristle hand brush.  Good quality, good price.  I recommend it.  Feels good on the scalp.  Fit the hand much better than a handled brush.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair brush and is exactly what I wanted. It is well worth the price. Get it. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This fits great in the hand. It&#x27;s a good size; not too big, not too small. Feels good on the head and excellent for the beard, too. I do have to agree with one of the other reviewers in that the bristles do fall out while brushing...so far. It could just be that it&#x27;s new and those bristles that are stragglers from installation will fall away, and that will be the end of it. If it continues much past a few weeks usage, it will go into the annals of useless Chinese trash, and I won&#x27;t use &#x27;Diane&#x27; products again. As the old adage goes: you get what you pay for. In this case, I&#x27;ll just have to give it some time and either leave my review at 4 stars, or edit it accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/2012: My previous review will stand as is. My main concern was some of the bristle falling out. Now, several days later, all is well with this great product, and I can highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it could been a lil harder cause the waves need a hard brush to come in</li>
    <li> This brush leads you to believe it is stiff bristled. This brush was much to soft Togo though my think hair. It has a smell like a wet dog and bristles continually fall out.</li>
    <li> Nice firm bristles, not too hard, not too soft. Great for short hair. Works better than a comb. Ergonomic design.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for several years.  As with most natural brushes it needs to be broken in.  The first week or so the bristles will shed, it has to do with the over stuffing of the holes.  Once that happens, the scent gets really good.  I have really thin hair and usually keep a high and tight fade.  This keeps the top parted to the side to give it a good professional look.  It distributes the natural oils nicely leaving the hair soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an all around good brush. It works really well if your hair is on the shorter side. It could be a little more firm. Just a little. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to perfect their waves.</li>
    <li> Nice ckontrol brought my waves in after a day and a half of brushing! The bristles have to be broken in but its not bad.</li>
    <li> Now that I have had this brush for a while, I have been able to appreciate the softness. I use it in conjunction with the very rare and expensive Crown Quality Products (CQP) Premium Boar Bristle Brush (Green). I can say this. The Diane can be your sole brush if you know the different waving methods and if you have a good du-rag or tsu-rag (my personal favorite). It is also a fraction of the price of any Kent or CQP brush. The difference between the Diane and the CQP is that the CQP greatly reduces the amount of brushing time because of its curved design. The Diane; however, produces better wave connections and Diane has been making quality products for a longer period of time, with greater availability and for a better price.      If you are a serious waver with the time to spend brushing, then get a Diane, a Tsu-rag, a fine toothed comb, and some moisturizer and save some money. If you don&#x27;t have the time to brush for 5-15 minutes then get the CQP and a Tsu-rag. If you are not concerned with wave and just want a capable brush, then get the Diane 8119 or 8118. You will be satisfied. It is a great brush.  PS.  1. This is not a great brush for the &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; stage. Get a hard bristle Diane or a medium CQP (blue). 2. To address the lack of a curve in the Diane design, I used some clippers to put a curve in my Diane. It by no means works as well as the CQP but it works well enough.   3. This brush works better when you have a &amp;#34;fresh cut&amp;#34; or have medium length hair. 4. If you are willing to spend the money, the three brushes needed for best wave results are the Diane 8119, the CQP Premium (green), and the CQP medium (blue).       OLD REVIEW: I do not particularly like this brush as it is too soft for my hair. I need something a little more reinforced.</li>
    <li> Just the right brush for if you just got a cut or two weeks later this would be a good brush for like if you were trying to get waves</li>
    <li> This brush was falling apart before I even took it out of the package.  I would not recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used military hair brushes for the past 30yrs...first time with DIANE brush...this one did not meet my standards.  It was poorly made.  The bristles are constantly falling out.  Every time I brush my hair, I have to double check that I don&#x27;t have bristles stuck in there.</li>
    <li> This is a very good brush. Durable and easy to clean, not too soft or hard. I know there&#x27;s a few people complaining about bristles falling out. But it only happens for the first few uses and then they stop falling out. This is probably just because some are loose from the manufacturing process.</li>
    <li> I have had this brush for a year and it is still my favorite brush for my short buzz cuts.</li>
    <li> TRASH!!&lt;br /&gt;The bristles fell like snowflakes. The logo was faded off as well.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price.  Excellent quality.  I should have ordered two or three.  Get one, you&#x27;ll be thrilled, for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush in 2011 and keep it in my gym bag knocking around with all of the other miscellania I have in there. Right out of the package the brush had bristles on it with a perfect firmness. I&#x27;ve had some military style boar-bristle brushes that were just too hard and stiff to use on my head, but this one was very comfortable to use. It still is 3 years later. The bristles have&#x27;t dulled out or fallen off at all. It&#x27;s good quality and fits my hand very well. It still even looks good - no chipping off of the finish on the wooden part. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The two brushes purchased met my expectations. An average of the descriptions and comments on the webpage seem to be accurate.</li>
    <li> Received a fake ass one</li>
    <li> always wanted one because it fell good when a had a hair cut at the barber shop. finally got it. cleans all the little hair from my head and don’t have to worry of making a mess when moving around before taking a shower.</li>
    <li> this is at best an ok brush to just leave in the car. the bristles are just a bit too soft for my liking and they stink. I love the spacing on the bristles which keep the brush from getting too dirty and if it does; it&#x27;s very easy to clean. when the bristles get wet they have a unpleasant odor. it&#x27;s actually difficult to find a descent brush that has the perfect firmness to it. this brush constantly leaves bristles in my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;small&lt;br /&gt;nice black finish&lt;br /&gt;no handle&lt;br /&gt;perfect for a touch up brush to be left in the car&lt;br /&gt;perfectly spaced bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;bristles have foul odor when wet&lt;br /&gt;bristles often fall out while brushing&lt;br /&gt;not quite firm enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;i will likely order a few more just for leaving one in each of my cars. It&#x27;s kinda too soft but that&#x27;s better than too hard i guess</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very happy to deal with you, and sorry for the late response for the feedback, and I will be dealing with you all the time. Thanks</li>
    <li> I been buying a lot of brushes , this was by far one of my first wave&#x27;s brush and all the other brush I bought they fade away and this is the only one i can use on a daily basis the bristle are well made and not too space out and great if you want better waves connection</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped for! Bristles are stiff, and don&#x27;t get hair to lay down! I wouldn&#x27;t get the brush again.</li>
    <li> very happy with the price as well as the packing &amp; quality of brush.  would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Its a nice brush but the only problem is that the bristle keep falling out after I clean it started to stop falling out.</li>
    <li> The hair are a little harsh but it combs your hair right</li>
    <li> Over all this is a good product for the price.  The only down side is the ends of the bristles are a bit sharp that takes sometime to break in.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers that said the bristles started falling out immediately.  I used it once and there were no fewer than 20 bristles that fell out.  The bristles are on the softer side but still were able to brush the hair.  I threw it out after that first use as I would not even bother giving it to someone for free.  If you don&#x27;t mind cleaning up after it every time you use it and picking bristles out of your hair, by all means buy it.</li>
    <li> I was actually hoping this was about 1/4 the size it really is. Description doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s size. I was looking for a small brush with no handle that is pocket sized. If I had to guess I&#x27;d say this is 6&amp;#34;x2.5&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34; Not huge, but way bigger than needed to tame a 1&amp;#34; long high and tight haircut and/or most military haircuts, and definately too big to keep in my pocket. Nice brush I guess, but the description (or lack of) needs work. Works good but It stays in the car and was not what I was looking for. I guess I&#x27;ll look elsewhere for what I need.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this brush TWICE ; therefore, I am pleased with this brush. Enough said! Im still typing because I had to add 4 more words(laughs).</li>
    <li> Really disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the more study bristles that I thought I was paying for. I was looking somewhere between &#x27;medium soft&#x27; and &#x27;very rigid&#x27;. These border on &#x27;noodle soft&#x27;</li>
    <li> This brush is too small, doesn&#x27;t fit well in the hand, the website picture somehow got thinking it was rather like medium size or so.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush.  Arrived on time</li>
    <li> The brush does the job. I was unable to find a brush like this in store so went online and did some research and came across this brush. Only thing I noticed is that some of the bristles come out. Not a deal breaker since I bought two of them. Just a warning ahead of time.</li>
    <li> A little course but it makes you tough, come on man you have a beard.</li>
    <li> use it every day thank you</li>
    <li> Was not pleased with this product at all. The wood was very obviously fake and the bristles were not of any quality that I would use on my hair.</li>
    <li> Brush came as scheduled. Firm bristles. Product&#x27;s odor went away through the use of a wash with warm water and hair conditioner. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Sheds alot of bristles for 1st week of use. The bristles get in your hair and are hard to get out. The bristles also get all over your floor and your clothes. After about a week of shedding, it becomes the normal brush you expected.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush, and i have to say again it is a  medium brush despited what is said in the description.&lt;br /&gt;So what can i say about this brush.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only one thing is that  the bristle  do fall out, what I&#x27;ve learned is to comb the  the brush  when  you first  receive it.&lt;br /&gt;Do it for about maybe  a good  45 minutes  or so that  seem to  help  with the  bristle  issues, other then that  enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh yeah this worked for me , mileage may vary .enjoy</li>
    <li> i just bought the diane #8114 and this thing right here... boooyyy lemme tell you. As soon as i took it out of the package it was losing bristles. I combed the brush but the bristles would just keep falling. I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING ELSE ON EBAY... IM GONNA HAVE TO SEE IT IN PERSON BEFORE I BUY... DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF SHI...</li>
