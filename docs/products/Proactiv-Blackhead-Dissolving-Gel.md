      <li>The best results I saw from this product were from a few weeks of using it</li>
      <li>The best results I saw from this product were from a few weeks of using it</li>
      <li>leaves my skin smooth and almost 100%</li>
      <li>It still makes my skin feel smooth and does decrease the appearance of my pores.</li>
      <li>I got it free with another order I placed</li>
      <li>It still makes my skin feel smooth and does decrease the appearance of my pores.</li>
      <li>So far so good....</li>
      <li>I purchase all the Proactiv products when I find a good deal and send them to my grandchildren and they love it especially the boys.</li>
      <li>It makes me wonder if the original function of the product was one thing (exfoliating) and they tacked the blackhead treatment on.  </li>
      <li>The item works good but does not get rid of all blackheads, even with daily usage.</li>
      <li>Not such a good product.  </li>
      <li>I was truly amazed by how well and how quickly this works.</li>
      <li>I also got it fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>The product is great, but look around for someone who is not charging more than double the actual price.  </li>
      <li>It really makes my face feel smooth and looks so clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>Was worried because I have sensitive skin, but was able to use this without issue.  </li>
      <li>Actually no stars to be honest.</li>
      <li>So far a friend has asked me what I use on my face, saying that it looks so smooth; my skin has never been called smooth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Right now, I am pleased with the change in the appearance of my pores, how soft my skin feels and that it is helping with some of the blackheads on my cheeks.</li>
      <li>34;too good to be true.&amp;#34;  I will give it half a tube&#x27;s use before I declare it ineffective.</li>
      <li>Great for that extra pick me up after wearing more makeup than usual.</li>
      <li>I have had this one huge pore on my face right by my nose for nearly a decade</li>
      <li>The gel was exactly as described and advertised.</li>
      <li>I have been using consistently for 3 months as part of a skin care routine, and I have yet to notice a difference or improvement.</li>
      <li>I can say that I definitely notice a decrease in blackheads on my nose and even more on my cheeks and chin.</li>
      <li>I will update after I have used the product for a month regarding whether I notice a greater improvement in the removal of my blackheads, especially the ones on my nose</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have any real results from this product!  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I thought that maybe it worked, maybe it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>My skin still feels soft and is more clear.</li>
      <li>I use this once ever few months and the way it makes your skin feel is amazing.  </li>
      <li>When I used this stuff the second time, that huge hole on my skin disappeared.</li>
      <li>No magics cure here, and it didn&#x27;t really lift them out.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, and works well</li>
      <li>i just saw a commercial for the 29.95 kit and this gel as a free gift.</li>
      <li>Eve though I am a senior citizen according to my age, I still have very oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Proactive really does work.  </li>
      <li>but now I feel like it has just given me a smooth face, tightened my pores and has given slightly lesser blackheads.</li>
      <li>i expected something more than it was.  </li>
      <li>Expected more based on the hype</li>
      <li>I paid $40 for a product that doesnt really work.</li>
      <li>but now I feel like it has just given me a smooth face, tightened my pores and has given slightly lesser blackheads.</li>
      <li>but if you have large pores like I do, I highly suggest you get this stuff.</li>
      <li>More than double the total cost of 1 OZ.</li>
      <li>(my main problem</li>
      <li>I recommend getting it from a proactiv kiosk in the mall or calling them because this price is too high.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from proactiv not this vendor, I think the price on here is too high though.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t it say on the commercial that its worth $25?</li>
      <li>Better than no treatment, but no magic fix.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Complete rip off!</li>
      <li>Bought this because I saw it on television and have large pores and occasional blackheads.  </li>
      <li>I am 69 years old and have always had this problem to contend with.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s (ok, almost 50) and have outbreaks from my hormone therapy.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft after each use.</li>
      <li>But the second time that I used it, WOW!</li>
      <li>This product along with the other Proactive products I have purchased for my son work very well.</li>
      <li>Did say that it might dry your skin, but so far it has not.  </li>
      <li>Pretty disappointed....  used it everyday and it really didn&#x27;t work any better than soap and water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t it say on the commercial that its worth $25? Yikes!! This sounds like a bad deal to me, why so expensive?</li>
    <li> After using this for almost a week, I see little change except for a shiny nose.  The refining mask works much better.  The instructions on the box are slightly different than on the tube.  It makes me wonder if the original function of the product was one thing (exfoliating) and they tacked the blackhead treatment on.  I am most disappointed.</li>
    <li> No idea if this has even worked. Saw no noticable results.</li>
    <li> I purchase all the Proactiv products when I find a good deal and send them to my grandchildren and they love it especially the boys.</li>
    <li> The blackhead gel has proven to be a blessing to me.  I am 69 years old and have always had this problem to contend with.  Now all I have to do is remember to put it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my sisters and anyone else that I think would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> the stuff works but not enough of it in a tube. I like the way it works. thank you Rebecca stephens</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work in keeping your skin clean!&lt;br /&gt;I even purchased one of these as a gift for someone who has problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this stuff. I got it free with another order I placed and I have only used it twice but can already see the results. The first time I used it, I thought that maybe it worked, maybe it didn&#x27;t. But the second time that I used it, WOW! what a difference!!! I have had this one huge pore on my face right by my nose for nearly a decade and I always see it, it bugs me. Especially when I looked in my magnifying mirror. When I used this stuff the second time, that huge hole on my skin disappeared. And after I noticed that, I saw that a lot of my blackheads were gone, not all but some. I don&#x27;t care how they market this stuff but if you have large pores like I do, I highly suggest you get this stuff. It&#x27;s a miracle gel for large pores!!!</li>
    <li> See second updated review at bottom. I explain why I moved this product from 4 to 3 stars and stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with blackheads and enlarged pores. I got this product to help fix both of those problems. I have been using it for two weeks and I am very happy with how it makes my skin feel. It makes my skin feel so soft after each use. Also, it helps with the appearance of my enlarged pores. After two weeks I notice a difference in the appearance of pores and they don&#x27;t look as prominent. That said, I am not expecting a miracle with a topical skin care product and it is not as if my pores look perfect. But the change in their appearance is noticeable to me and that alone justifies me buying the product at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding my blackheads, I say the verdict is still out on how well this product works on blackheads because I do have a lot of blackheads and they are not all gone after using this product. It appears to me that this gel may be helping with some of them, especially the ones on my cheeks. However, I still have many blackheads on my nose (my nose has always been the hardest area for me to rid myself of blackheads). So, my plan is to continue with this product for at least a month and re evaluate how my skin looks after a month of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I am pleased with the change in the appearance of my pores, how soft my skin feels and that it is helping with some of the blackheads on my cheeks. I will update after I have used the product for a month regarding whether I notice a greater improvement in the removal of my blackheads, especially the ones on my nose (my main problem area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update- I have been using this product for several weeks and I am still loving this product. My skin still feels soft and is more clear. I can say that I definitely notice a decrease in blackheads on my nose and even more on my cheeks and chin. I am going to continue using the Proactive blackhead dissolving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***2nd Update - I have now been using this product for 1.5 months and I am taking it from four stars to three stars. It still makes my skin feel smooth and does decrease the appearance of my pores. However, my blackheads on my nose have not got away and now I think this product is only decreasing them slightly. The best results I saw from this product were from a few weeks of using it but now I feel like it has just given me a smooth face, tightened my pores and has given slightly lesser blackheads. It is too expensive to continue so I am discontinuing using it.ore on my cheeks and chin.

    <li> It is nothing great- i expected something more than it was.  Not any better than over the counter products I have tried</li>
    <li> my husband has had blackheads around his eyes for ever he says they are disappearing so thank you we will buy more if we have to</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend if you work out a lot and tent to breakout b/c of that. I love it. leaves my skin smooth and almost 100% clear.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Just started using it and it seems to work.  I notice less oil on my skin and it looks a little clearer.</li>
    <li> The gel was exactly as described and advertised. I also got it fairly quickly. Works great for my daughter and makes skin super soft</li>
    <li> I use this once ever few months and the way it makes your skin feel is amazing.  Was worried because I have sensitive skin, but was able to use this without issue.  Great for that extra pick me up after wearing more makeup than usual.</li>
    <li> It has been about a week now and I don&#x27;t have any real results from this product!  Not a huge fan!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s salicylic acid in a gel. No magics cure here, and it didn&#x27;t really lift them out. Better than no treatment, but no magic fix.</li>
    <li> thanks it works great!!</li>
    <li> Wow! Proactive really does work.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s (ok, almost 50) and have outbreaks from my hormone therapy. Proactive clears up hormone breakouts like magic.  I love it.</li>
    <li> The item works good but does not get rid of all blackheads, even with daily usage.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed....  used it everyday and it really didn&#x27;t work any better than soap and water. Expected more based on the hype</li>
    <li> I bought this product for $56.  There was an invoice in the envelope that I received with the product for $25 from the manufacturer.  The markup by the middleman...tinytinymushroom...was $35.  I emailed the seller to inquire about the huge $35 fee.  I was told in an email that it was membership fees, shipping and handling.  More than double the total cost of 1 OZ. of the product.  The product is great, but look around for someone who is not charging more than double the actual price.  Good luck.  Caveat Emptor</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! It really makes my face feel smooth and looks so clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Proactiv, but I did not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I was amazed. I did not expect this product to work. It was a small size so I was ready for disappointment. But I have only been using it for a few days and my blackheads on my nose are almost gone! I have not used any other proactive products but seeing how well this one performed, I will give them a try in the near future. I was truly amazed by how well and how quickly this works. Great product.</li>
    <li> I paid $40 for a product that doesnt really work. I never saw a difference. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, at least not for that price</li>
    <li> waited in vain.  i tried to track it but had to wait.  then was told it was unavailable.  took forever to just say &amp;#34;we don&#x27;t have this product&amp;#34;  Actually no stars to be honest.</li>
    <li> does nothing for bleadheads but takes your cash</li>
    <li> Not only did the Proactiv Blackhead Dissolving Gel not help my blackheads, it CAUSED whiteheads. I tried to get a refund and was denied, as I didn&#x27;t request it within a 30-day period. That seems very unfair because it is only used 1-2 a week and I wanted to give it a fair shot. Not to mention it cost me almost $30 for a little 1 fl. oz. container.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I saw it on television and have large pores and occasional blackheads.  Love the feel of the mask, a kind of tingle and goes on smooth.  Did say that it might dry your skin, but so far it has not.  I follow the directions and only us it once or twice a week.  So far a friend has asked me what I use on my face, saying that it looks so smooth; my skin has never been called smooth.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> Not worth it - usually I like Proactiv products, but this one I didn&#x27;t like at all - I don&#x27;t like how my skin felt after using it &amp; didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Not such a good product.  I paid $50 for this and it didn&#x27;t do anything!  I think it&#x27;s false advertising on TV!</li>
    <li> good product. works great.</li>
    <li> This product along with the other Proactive products I have purchased for my son work very well. They help with the acne and my cleaner smoother skin.</li>
    <li> just ordered this, so not sure how well it works, but FYI it costs $25 on the Proactive Individual products ordering page.  So that is where I ordered mine!  I would assume that is the same price at Pro Active kiosks too.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of you don&#x27;t feel that it removes blackheads, I was curious about that side of the product, thank you for your comments, please try Biore nose strips, available in walmart, they also have strips for your face, they work great on pulls out the blackheads, so maybe with both products we can get rid of those awful blackheads.......i use the biore strips and am very happy with the results, you can actually see them on the strip after you pull it off.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking into trying out Proactiv, scanning different sites to check out prices and this is insane. Talk about a rip off,  i just saw a commercial for the 29.95 kit and this gel as a free gift. Complete rip off!</li>
    <li> Seeing improvements. On about my  3 rd week or so. Hoping to see even more of an improvement after 3 months. Skin looking smoother and plugs in pours getting smaller. Using it now twice a day. Started with only once a day.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see any results that duplicate the claims and testimonials presented in the Proactiv ads.  The graphics are sufficient to pique interest, but appear to be &amp;#34;too good to be true.&amp;#34;  I will give it half a tube&#x27;s use before I declare it ineffective.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and works well</li>
    <li> Love this product. Take care my blackhead</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever bought. I love it, will buy it again when I run out</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using consistently for 3 months as part of a skin care routine, and I have yet to notice a difference or improvement.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from proactiv not this vendor, I think the price on here is too high though.  Anyway, I have black heads on my nose and chin.  I&#x27;ve use biore strips and those didn&#x27;t work and neither did other drug store brands.  I used this with a panasonic black head clearing tool (it sucks out the puss and I bought on Amazon I recommend that tool also).  I noticed a dramatic difference in my pores and my black heads really started to diminish.  I didn&#x27;t realize how great it was until I ran out and I can see the black heads coming back and pores getting larger.  I recommend getting it from a proactiv kiosk in the mall or calling them because this price is too high. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> The commercial on TV is for a face wash toner and lotion plus this gel and that&#x27;s for 20 bucks and free shipping dont buy from here go to proactive website</li>
    <li> i used this product as directed and haven&#x27;t found  the  miraculous change they claim it creates.&lt;br /&gt;i guess i was fooled by the commercials</li>
    <li> Eve though I am a senior citizen according to my age, I still have very oily skin.  This product appears to be working, but I would like to use it longer to see how it works on the long term.</li>
    <li> So far so good....skin softer...seems to be doing the job....will continue to use ....a little too expensive to use everyday</li>
    <li> Love this product. Wish they would put it on sale separate from their other products.</li>
    <li> Have been using for sometime now. I like the results. I use it only in the area around my nose.</li>
    <li> love it but the bottle is too small and expensive</li>
</ol>
