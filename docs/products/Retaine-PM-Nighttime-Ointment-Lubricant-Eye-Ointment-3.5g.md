<li> Sorry my little dog had an allergic reaction and we had to stop using</li>
<li> It is WAY too thick, and while lubricating your eyes, its blinds you as well with the consistency of Vaseline!</li>
<li> I was NOT impressed with the condition of the box upon arrival.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, when I went to reorder the product, it was unavailable.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> There is no substitute for this product.  It is a God send for anyone with dry eye or anyone who&#x27;s had surgery with stitches in their eye.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  After using at night, it was very difficult to see the next morning - until after my shower.  I would not&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product.  I would recommend the Retain drops - they are much better for dry eyes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from my opthamologist, but purchased THIS version because it was designed for nighttime use. It is WAY too thick, and while lubricating your eyes, its blinds you as well with the consistency of Vaseline!</li>
    <li> I like the product very much.  Unfortunately one of the tubes purchased was only half full.</li>
    <li> Great nighttime relief for my extremely dry eyes. However, it makes a film over my eyes that, should I rise hoping to do some reading, I find that I can&#x27;t tuntil morning and a warm face-wash plus eye drops. .Retaine soothes  dry eyes and forces them to rest.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of these ointments and this does not work for me. Odd as the eye drops by same brand are great.  I have a very serious dry eye condition.  Best ointment brand for me is Equate ointment, not as goopy and lubricates better.  Bummer but you need to get it at Walmart because on amazon the seller wants you to pay shipping per each tube. only $6-7 at Walmart.  Just stock up.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be better than sustain p.m.  It&#x27;s not.  About the same.</li>
    <li> Opthimologist recommended.  That is the main reason I switched.  I sleep with right eye partially open and now wear a guard to keep from scratching the cornea.  This works well with less fog and more oil.</li>
    <li> I like this ointment as it helps my dry eyes.  I put it in at night before bed.  I still could use something even more potent, but this is the best I could find.</li>
    <li> Sorry my little dog had an allergic reaction and we had to stop using</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those who struggle with dry eye.</li>
    <li> Retaine PM was recommended by my optometrist. I t has improved my eyesight better than any other product. I use it at night. my vision is clear in the morning.</li>
    <li> Best relief of dry eye than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried. Also, the best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> Good product at an excellent price.  I have purchase this before &amp; will again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Help with my lack of natural tears.</li>
    <li> I had  a severe allergic reaction to it after two uses. I cannot use it. It is a total waste of my money and was very disappointing. I was NOT impressed with the condition of the box upon arrival. It was not sealed in any way, which made me very uneasy about using it at all.</li>
