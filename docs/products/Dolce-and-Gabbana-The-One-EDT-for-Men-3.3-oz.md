      <li>Looked it up on amazon and got this good price.</li>
      <li>Really good scent</li>

      <li>Especially good as an evening / special occasion cologne.</li>
      <li>probably the best cologne i have ever owned and well worth it</li>
      <li>It is very elegant, and reminds me of something someone driving a Mercedes would wear.  </li>
      <li>or I feel very sophisticated.  </li>
      <li>The One By Dolce and Gabbana for Men  is  realy the  best, the fragrance of this lotion is really satisfactory, smells good, durable and makes good chemistry with the skin, is of the best lotions I bought, I highly recommend this lotion like the Dolce and Gabbana for Men SPORT</li>
      <li>i get a about 4-6 hours hours on my skin,  make sure you carry the bottle with you or carry a decant!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>the product was delivered fast to find it perfectly sealed.</li>

      <li>When I received this one, tried it on and really liked the smell, but I would say it is more for an evening wear.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because it is a gift, even though the package was lost and it did not arrive on time in good condition, I rate with maximum punctuation that is original</li>
      <li>It was a great deal and exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>If it seems too good to be true bc of the discounted price...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The smell was something only a mother would like and I could not return it. Will not buy from this company again</li>
    <li> Solid cologne. I a lot of compliments on the smell. I did the typical graduation from Drakkar Noir to Aqua d&#x27;Gio to this. I almost feel like a grown up now.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne, one of my favorites. I consistently get compliments and the scent is strong and last the entire day. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> the product was delivered fast to find it perfectly sealed. the bottle is gorgeous and the scent is sexy, i already get compliments every time i wear it. probably the best cologne i have ever owned and well worth it</li>
    <li> The Toilette Spray is a Christmas gift that is sure to please with  its subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> Much like my hairstyle, i normally only change scents once every 7 years or so. :p It&#x27;s replaced my Burberry and JPG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotten plenty of compliments. My girlfriend turned me onto this cologne -- she dug the Matthew McConaughey ads for \\&quot;The One gentleman\\&quot; so when we went to go check it out at nordtrom, we found that we both preferred the more \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; (if you will) smell of \\&quot;The One\\&quot; over \\&quot;The One Gentleman\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I picked a great product</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it very unique. It has this classy gentlemen scent. I hope its legit and the real thing but the smell doesn&#x27;t last as i thought it would.I mean i didn&#x27;t pay much for it. So i don&#x27;t want to really complain. but next time I will go to a department store and buy to see the difference if there&#x27;s any.</li>
    <li> I love this scent on me. It is litreally the one for me. I always get compliments when wearing it. If you want the ladies this is it. Grab a bottle matter fact grab a few bottles. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> To anyone looking for 100% authentic D&amp;G product - do not purchase this cologne.  I ordered it for my husband for Christmas, and upon opening the package and comparing it to a previously purchased bottle of this cologne from Sephora, I can tell you it is not the same.  The color of the cologne is even different!  If it seems too good to be true bc of the discounted price...well, it is.  You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
    <li> Great transaction and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent price for this product. I bought the smaller bottle at a perfume &amp;#34;outlet&amp;#34;. Looked it up on amazon and got this good price.</li>
    <li> This has been on my son&#x27;s Christmas list for a couple of years.  Large price tag for a small item.  However, I was able to purchase a good sized bottle (3.3 oz.) at a greatly reduced price.  It arrived quickly and was packaged well.  He was thrilled!</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Just wish it would last longer..</li>
    <li> I get &amp;#34;mmmm, you smell nice&amp;#34; a lot from the ladies, my wife and friends included. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> really like the fragrance.  what else can a really say but that.  Nice bottle?  Really nifty three dimensional box?  Well Wrapped?&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad:  The smaller size bottle came with a milled metal top, always went on tight.  This size came with a plastic top covered in a metal overlay, which was broken, either in shipping or as manufactured and does not stay on very well.  Small you might say, probably as you don&#x27;t actually wear it, but none the less speaks to shoddy workmanship, and certainly dims the luster of the product.  Every time I go to use it, it reminds me of this.</li>
    <li> Really, really nice fragrance....!</li>
    <li> ive got nothing but head turns and compliments, woman truely love the scent. i recommend this to everyone. some woman have wanted to give me a hug and it was hard to let go of me.....lol</li>
    <li> I bought from this vendor before, Davidoff Cool Water and it was good and long lasting.  For some reason this scent doesn&#x27;t last for longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> i was expecting something more manly, but it&#x27;s deep, woody and a little more on the feminine side. not exactly a bad thing though.</li>
    <li> I learned about this spray from my son. It is now my favorite and is not a &#x27;sweet&#x27; spray as too many are.</li>
    <li> I love this fragance. I used it every day and the fragance keep all day and even more. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this one. I got it for my dad and he loves it as well.  If you get a chance smell the roses....</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to sit down and write a review about this fragrance, as there is so much to appreciate about the product.  From the notes in the juice, all the way down to the design of the bottle, and even the box which is worth keeping.  I absolutely love everything about this cologne.  When I smell this on myself, I feel as though I have high class or I feel very sophisticated.  It is very elegant, and reminds me of something someone driving a Mercedes would wear.  I can imagine someone who wears a suit would also wear this.  I find it to be a very rich type of smell.  This is a high class&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can smell a bit of orange, maybe grapefruit type smell or citrus type smell, with a spicy accord to it, along with a hint of tobacco, maybe some cardamom &amp; coriander.  It has a very smooth dry down, and does not project too much.  Therefore I don&#x27;t think this scent would offend anyone.  This would work well in the office.  I find this to be very versatile. This is more of a fall/winter fragrance, but I think you could get by wearing it any season.  You could wear it day or night.  This is very unique and my favorite out of my collection.  I am a fan of the Thierry Mugler House, but I have to say this one rocks!  Very well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change if I could would be the way the cap on the bottle fits, as it comes off too easy.  I might also give this a little more silage and lasting power.  I use 3 sprays and get 3 to 4 hours out of it before having to reapply.  Overall this would be a definite go to fragrance. If I could only choose one fragrance to use, this would be the one.  I guess that is why they call this stuff &amp;#34;The One.&amp;#34;  I also recommend &amp;#34;The One Gentleman&amp;#34; for summer use.  I originally purchased &amp;#34;The One Gentleman&amp;#34; when I was going to the store to buy this.  I got the two mixed up because of the names were so closely related.  However I even got compliments on &amp;#34;The One Gentleman.&amp;#34;  It is also very well done.  Great job Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  Yes D&amp;G,  you too will be standing out in the crowd just as much as Thierry Mugler.It is also very well done.  Great job Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  Yes D&amp;G,  you too will be standing out in the crowd just as much as Thierry Mugler.</li>
    <li> This smells great only when it last more than a few minutes. Women love when I wear it but it doesn&#x27;t last long. therefore they quickly forget.</li>
    <li> For my love of my life for xmas. Love to smell the fragrence. Love this cologne, I use it everyday so does he.</li>
    <li> This has been my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance for a couple of years now.  It has a scent you never tire of.  Does not over power and perfect to wear anytime</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and was so happy to find this big bottle at such a great price! Shipping took a little longer then I had hoped but overall I am still very happy and my man smells great!</li>
    <li> Went to the store and smelled it, then purchased this product and it was a night and day difference, I couldn&#x27;t even smell the Amazon version.</li>
    <li> This cologne features a nice combination of notes that come together to create a very masculine scent. The opening is great, and the dry down leads to a subtle, sophisticated scent. I cycle through colognes, but this one (no pun intended) frequently garners compliments. It has pretty good longevity on my skin, and the projection on the opening is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want a cologne that&#x27;s assaulting the nostrils of all those around me, but this cologne - while fairly long lasting - requires very close proximity to smell after the opening fades. Then again, it might be one of those scents that the wearer gets accustomed to quickly, because I have had compliments from people hours after putting it on who weren&#x27;t necessarily face-deep into my personal space. I was almost tempted to give THE ONE four stars on what I&#x27;m perceiving as weak projection, but as I think subtlety can sometimes be a good thing and given that I do love the scent, I can&#x27;t bring myself to knock a star off the rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I highly recommend THE ONE. It&#x27;s one of those colognes that I will definitely purchase again once my current bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> The exact product I wanted for my husband. Smells great and you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price! It has a nice manly scent without being over powering, cheap smelling or too musky.</li>
    <li> I love this smell and I have always ordered the one and it came very quick and was a genuine product verses when you buy from a off company that sells a watered down version of it.</li>
    <li> There was a sample in a magazine &amp; I really enjoyed the smell.  Haven&#x27;t bought too many eau de toilette sprays recently, but I thought I would like the smell of this.  When I received this one, tried it on and really liked the smell, but I would say it is more for an evening wear.  Not too strong nor too weak, wears very well.</li>
    <li> I came fast and unbroken. With anything glass related, that is not easy. The price was the best that I could find too.</li>
    <li> Walk into the club. Women swarm kind of like honey bees. So many women. So little time. &amp;#34;What is that baby?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My friend manages a funny store here in southern Californian and he gets good deals from los angeles. One day he came and was like dude I got some great cologne for you , check it out. I fell in love with it. Love it a lot, but when it ran out asked him if I could get another and he said maybe not for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I noticed a few differences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish of the cap was a solid color, not wood-looking finish and was darker&lt;br /&gt;The magnet on the cap and the cap itself, a combination of the two made the cap very loose on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The part where the liquid sprays out – the little hole/nozzle – was white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I fell in love with a fake, but now I’m using the real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I will never again buy anything from DOLCE &amp; GABBANA. If they don’t care enough about their own products to at least try and limit fake distribution then I won’t be spending my money on their stuff. So while I love this product, I will never again be buying it.&lt;br /&gt;DOLCE &amp; GABBANA needs to get their act together. I made this decision when I saw amazon had the same problems with fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I ordered mine from amazon (shipped and sold by amazon) on 12/18/2013 and got a real bottle, so I think they might have resolved their distribution / supplier issues.</li>
    <li> If you like that smell then this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought it blind as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend, he doesn&#x27;t really wear fragrances so i was nervous that he wouldn&#x27;t like, but he said he love it so mission accomplished :P</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase for the price and the quality. This is my son&#x27;s favorite cologne and it was a gift for his birthday. He was thrilled. Love love love it!!</li>
    <li> This one was the best deal that i found , So i bought one more again .</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, it smells great! My 21 year old stepson also loves the smell. He is always asking to use it when he goes out. This is a great scent for the old as well as the young men in your life.</li>
    <li> Perfect..never disappointed.</li>
    <li> He use to wear this before we started dating and I fell in love with the smell but he ended up running out not too long after we began dating. Luckily Amazon had this in stock and I just had to get him some! Now he&#x27;s back to smelling delicious everyday :)</li>
    <li> Got this for my son for Christmas and not knowing what it smelled like, went totally off the reviews! Very happy I did! He loves it!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent and I found it for him on Amazon at a great value. The cologne was a gift and I was also relieved that it was delivered in an inconspicuous package so he had no idea!</li>
    <li> Women will want to tear your clothes off. Seriously, ladies have told me this many times. It&#x27;s that good with my natural scent.</li>
    <li> The delivery was prompt. I love the product, it i similar to Armani Code scent. It was a present for my husband and since he uses tons of cologne, it&#x27;s worth the money, because it is a lot of quntity verss Armani Code, which for the price comes so little.</li>
    <li> smells amazing i got complements all around it looks amazing and overall i loved it i really recommend it this is a good buy</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne, my bf is irresistible with this manly woodsy scent. A++ I will definatly keep his medicine cabinet stocked with &#x27;The One&#x27;</li>
    <li> I agree with everyone else, that great package, great perfume but doesnt even last 30 minutes, wish they will change it&#x27;s ingredients to make it last longer</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant smell and works just about how you would expect cologne to work.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If traveling, the cap does not stay on all that well. I run a rubber band vertically around the bottle and cap to ensure that it stays covered. This has done the trick and prevents unwanted sprays in your toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> This Spray is awsome, I would like to recommend anyone who don&#x27;t have a Idea what to buy or trying to make a call...!!!</li>
    <li> given to me as a gift and has a nice scent that attracts attention, but i don&#x27;t think it lasts long enough. Then again it could just be my nose getting used to it&#x27;s presence. Good gift choice too because it can fit a variety of age groups without being concerned that it&#x27;s too much or too light</li>
    <li> Great smell and quite long-lasting. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I received a package I ordered from you, a perfume. I appreciate and recognize that the perfume arrived in good conditions and sealed, but I was surprised to discover once I opened it, that it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s too old or what could have happened to it, but it certainly isn&#x27;t how it&#x27;s supposed to be and I can&#x27;t accept it in the previously described condition.  I would like to hear your response to this situation, hoping to find a way to fix it.  Order #110-4797693-9121817</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s that this fragrance makes me feel like;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;m in my expensive suit and boots...get off my Bentley and walk into Bellagio with one arm around my woman and the other holding a glass of martini, sipping into it as I make my way towards the high roller poker tables wearing an intriguing, confident smile.&amp;#34; Sounds like a James Bond Casino Royale scene? Probably is... ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not for everyone! It is one of those fragrances that&#x27;ll go with a suit-n-tie Gentleman attitude. It smells rich, classy and masculine, almost surprises me with it&#x27;s price tag...you get much, much more than what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I asked a woman &#x27;Is this what a real man should smell like?&#x27;, her answer would, quite certainly, be &#x27;Yes! Absolutely!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana always great. My husband uses  this one at night and it  is really amazing. It is so distinguish.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it specially when we go out for dinner or concerts.  He mainly  wears it when he is well-dressed. And I just  love it.</li>
    <li> Perfectly packed, legit product, very good fragrance, same as expensive stores at half the price.</li>
    <li> It was a great deal and exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Best there is my husband will not use anything else and I will not buy anything else theres nothing better</li>
    <li> What a great smell on my man. I love how sexy he smells when he wears this cologne. What a great price as well. I am going to buy him one for Christmas or his Birthday every year.</li>
    <li> Great Fragrance! It has a very tropical smell to it, I get about 8 hours on my skin with moderate projection.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product couple weeks back and i applied while going to office and this smells really good till evening..Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne and it lasts a really long time on you unlike most of the other ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne on my husband. It&#x27;s elegant and distinct. Especially good as an evening / special occasion cologne.</li>
    <li> Shipping took 3 days longer than expected. Otherwise my favorite cologne and it deserves 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful fragrance for men! Love it! Arrived promptly and the price was great too! Will keep this in mind for next year at christmas too.</li>
    <li> smells fine but I can not even smell it on myself by the time I go out. I I i</li>
    <li> great I truly recommend it to almost everyone searching for a distinct mature aroma. I also like sky blue aha</li>
    <li> This was a good choice for a gift, the person said they like it &amp; it smells great ,so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This is a personal choice I guess but this cologne is pretty good and the fragrance stays for hours. The shape of the bottle is neat as well.</li>
    <li> Great gift. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Its what I was looking for!  :)</li>
    <li> Fake, doesn&#x27;t smell like the real product at all, buyer beware</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift. He loved it. Smells amazing</li>
    <li> good smell but doesn&#x27;t last too long.  If it lasted it would be a 5 star but since it disappears in 6 hours or less I cannot give it 5.  Great smell for dates though.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and really good deal with the price. My hubby was a happy man as this is his favorite scent :-)</li>
    <li> I order this cologne as a gift to my brother. I saw the review and was hoping it to be good but instead the fragrance is not as good as it is supposed to be. It goes off immediately. It is nothing like the original D&amp;G.</li>
    <li> Great scent, poor longevity. Projection is okay at the beginning. A great scent to wear when you plan on just cuddling with your girlfriend or when you know you&#x27;re gonna be in close proximity to others. This scent smells great, you just have to know when and where to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves this cologne, He will not let it go and wears it everywhere. I , myself  love the smell on him.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to wear when it starts getting cooler out and had seen this scent on just about every top 10 list. Definitely glad I took a chance, this is now one of my favorites. The price was great and I wish I had gotten this sooner. Doesn&#x27;t seem watered down, only need a the normal amount and I can still smell a little the following morning.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite colognes</li>
    <li> Nice cologne with a pleasant smell receiving many compliments from the ladyfolk, I would recommend this product for single and married men.</li>
    <li> This is my umber one favorite smells. I have 5 or so bottles of &amp;#34;my best&amp;#34; and this is my number 1 favorite.</li>
    <li> excelent, very good. original</li>
    <li> I really love it and the fragrance mesmerize atmosphere and satisfactory. The price also reasonable and everyone can buy it. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product; great price</li>
    <li> for when im on my grown and sexy ;)</li>
    <li> First change of cologne in a long time and it was well worth it I love the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Really good scent, girls get crazy with that. You will reminded for sure. The One IS the ONE.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Not too strong either. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a gift for my boyfriend and I&#x27;m SO disappointed with the quality, not old does it not smell the same as I remember, the scent does not stick! It doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s not as strong. I&#x27;m embarrassed for giving such a horrible cologne to my boyfriend. I went into Ulta (beauty store) to check and see if the scent has change or if it was different from what I remember and it smelled WAY better from there. If you are thinking about purchasing any scent from amazon I would think twice! Someone told me that this cologne probably has been sitting here for years so the scent is not as strong and isn&#x27;t close to the smell that I had remembered. Biggest waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is a gift, even though the package was lost and it did not arrive on time in good condition, I rate with maximum punctuation that is original and I got very good price, which is not like me not arrive on time and is was unrelago: (.... they are very nice guys reciendo for us women;)</li>
    <li> bought this cologne for my 22 year old son for Christmas and he loves it, says all the girls really like it too!</li>
    <li> Husband loves it and I enjoy it, too!  It is difficult to find a cologne that complements your personality and lifts your spirits without being overpowering or unpleasant.  There are so many odd fragrances out there but THE ONE is definitely the one to purchase!</li>
    <li> What a great smell to enjoy on my man.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this is fantastic.  It&#x27;s got what I&#x27;d call a vanilla base but well mixed with other scents.  It lasts and resurfaces at just the right times (I don&#x27;t wear more than two sprays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also consistently get compliments. :)</li>
    <li> It is really amazing.</li>
    <li> The only cologne my husband will wear! Love it!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this, you are missing out. The fragrant that this special cologne emits drives woman to let you know they love it.</li>
    <li> Always been my favorite calogne. I love the smell and so do the ladies. Besides its D&amp;G how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> Great smell. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure my son will enjoy</li>
    <li> Absolutely satisfied with this. Made a great gift &amp; was larger size &amp; cheaper than from the store we use to get it from.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells on my fiance</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful scent. I enjoy this and get many compliments. I would say it has to be my favorite scent from a designer brand.</li>
    <li> best D&amp;G cologne ever for men</li>
    <li> So, I bought this perfume for my husband for his birthday.  He has been wanting this for over a year.  He was very surprised and happy when he received it.  Until he took a close look at it, that is.  He immediately looked at it suspiciously, but didn&#x27;t say anything.  Next day after wearing it all day, he told me, that he thinks it&#x27;s fake.  He says it doesn&#x27;t last that long and that he has to spray several times to feel the smell.  I don&#x27;t know how many times he sprayed, but i could smell it from the next room, lol.  Anyways, I think I&#x27;ll go with him to a department store so he can try on a sample and compare...  It could just be the original, and it isn&#x27;t as strong or doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
    <li> The ladies go crazy over this smell, a guy in Dillards sold me on this stuff but I did not buy from him as I was leaving the country. I eventually bought here onine and I love it, I wear it everyday and never fail to get compliments. I am buying this one again!</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, no problems at all, same product available at the department store for a higher price. I was concerned when I read some people thought theirs may not be the real deal but this is. I tried it before I bought it so I knew how long it would last and am not disappointed at all. Product was packed extremely well so five stars to amazon. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is great for causal evening and work good in a cool weather (fall season).  The only problem I see with the One by Dolce and Gabbana for Men is longevity (2 hours the max).  I would love to see an intense version of the One.  Great juice, but longevity is poor.</li>
    <li> Packaging is identical to the original and it has a fantastically warm almost Noir smell, however, unless you spray yourself well over ten plus times don&#x27;t expect anyone else to smell it on you, even those in relatively close proximity - it&#x27;s odor is authentic for sure but it is so light that I question the overall authenticity. Worth a try in my opinion, but would I purchase this product again? No, albeit again it does smell good to me when I apply it.</li>
    <li> i used to have this cologne a couple years back.  bought it again because  i absolutley love the smell and for the price i could agree on buying again.</li>
    <li> Another authentic fragrance purchase from Amazon direct.  The only other fragrance i ordered from non-Amazon was Angel Men from Frangrancenet and that was better than I could have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One has a very sensual, sweet, ginger, amber, tobacco notes.  This is a fabulous date night cologne.  I know I can score if I wear this....actually I can score anyway.  Ha ha.</li>
    <li> what i was really expecting to be getting and i would buy more of it when i am done with it</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling of the Dolce collection.  I sniff my husbands neck now more than ever!!!  He said he would probably never wear anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It smells great and lasts for hours. I&#x27;ve read a couple of bad reviews about this product saying you have to bathe in it? I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with those people, I guess they like to absolutely reek of cologne. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this one and have to say the opening is incredibly powerful and seems to have a scent that is of cloves (Is it the Cardamom?). I have only experienced this with one other cologne, \\&quot;Cigar\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t (and don&#x27;t like that smell) but waited for it to die down, which it did over several hours.  After that, the real and great scent of this cologne came out, and it was very satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I would actually buy this cologne due to it&#x27;s strong spice (clove) opening, but supposedly women love this stuff.  But half of the experience is liking it on yourself as well, soooo.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful bottle on this one, though.  Definitely something for night, winter, or fall.&lt;br /&gt;I would try it and see if you have a problem with the opening, if not (you might be one of the \\&quot;non-clove\\&quot; smellers) you might have a winner.  It also lasts a VERY long time, I smelled it the next day after a shower when smelling my wrist.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne. On time and as promised, brand new bottle in the box with the factory plastic and seal.</li>
    <li> Not sure, but I think it&#x27;s fake. The smell is a little bit different and I do know that my bottle when I look at it does appear to be a wood grain looking cap, but it doesn&#x27;t appear real. It&#x27;s not a real wood grain.</li>
    <li> The One By Dolce and Gabbana for Men  is  realy the  best, the fragrance of this lotion is really satisfactory, smells good, durable and makes good chemistry with the skin, is of the best lotions I bought, I highly recommend this lotion like the Dolce and Gabbana for Men SPORT</li>
    <li> Wow thats fantastic i love my lotion and i really happy to made my purchase what next lol here i go</li>
    <li> I love this smell which it is my most favorite cologne of all. I often bought at the retail over the years but the price went up so fast. I carefully searched the cologne through Amazon and found the cologne to be authentic which it is very important for me. I got a very good deal and will buy one again in the future.</li>
    <li> It is woody but not too much as those old and bad smells perfumes. I highly recommend this one. I had one and know I am buying again because I used it all.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells wonderful, and he really loved it.</li>
    <li> I always buy this cologne for my husband and we both love it. I love the fragrance...soft but still manley...I simply love it!!</li>
    <li> One of my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t have problems receiving it quickly either but maybe that&#x27;s because we have a prime account (which we love too).</li>
    <li> This has been my scent of choice for some time now. I&#x27;m afraid to admit this, but I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t searched for this on Amazon sooner. For the size purchased, I saved at least $30 compared to department stores. The quality is just the same as any others I&#x27;ve purchased. Amazon has done it again!!</li>
    <li> excellent parfum, i love it</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m only going to use this pre-coitus.  It smells sexy for a couple of hours, but then it&#x27;s very hard to detect.  This will be my close quarters combat scent .... xoxo (check out Brandon Thompson&#x27;s video on youtube:  watch?v&#x3D;6ne9mVy3GnU</li>
    <li> Pretty much what I expected.  No big surprises here.</li>
    <li> Greatest scent in the world!</li>
    <li> Great price, this is my default cologne which I love because it is subtle.  Bought two, arrived well packed within a few days.</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance, but the projection and lasting power is not there. i get a about 4-6 hours hours on my skin,  make sure you carry the bottle with you or carry a decant! the person has to be in your bubble to smell you about 2 feet, definitely a close combat fragrance, when you give a person a hug they will smell you say you smell great, and want more!</li>
    <li> The product was purchased for my son for Christmas, it is his favorite! I know he will be happy to see it on Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> This  &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34; is truly the one not too strong,smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last all day,&lt;br /&gt;was a good choice.</li>
    <li> This cologne was for my son. He really likes it. The cost on amazon was about half the price of the department store where we tried it.</li>
    <li> does not last as long as I expected</li>
    <li> Second best scent I buy right now.  The women like it, and even the girls.  Perfect size, scent lasting and cost of a cologne yuou can find.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! Stays on too</li>
    <li> I ordered this scent for my boyfriend as a christmas gift, it came in due time and was packaged very well! He hasn&#x27;t got it as yet but with previous experience it smells really great! I am satisfied thus far. Hopefully I don&#x27;t have to come and change my review when he uses it lol</li>
    <li> Helped me do what I wanted to... conquer that girl!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is now one of my favorites. The bottle is a bit too heavy for travel. Its elegance puts a perfect accent to the table. The packing and delivery service were impeccable.</li>
    <li> My S.O. and I smelled at least 25 colognes before finding one we both liked at the mall.  It was great to be able to order this online at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Like others have stated it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other scents, but when it&#x27;s there it smells really good.</li>
