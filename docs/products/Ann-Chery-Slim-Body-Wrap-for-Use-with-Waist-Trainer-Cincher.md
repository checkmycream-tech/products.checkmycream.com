    <li> I like it a lot. Very comfortable and I can see a difference every time I use it</li>
    <li> The product review is from his wife. Since it was bought for me. lol it&#x27;s an awesome product to me. To comment on some reviews it&#x27;s clearly not regular Saran Wrap. It&#x27;s of better quality . I had no problem putting it on and getting it to stay . It doesn&#x27;t roll or bunch unless trying to use in conjunction with the waist cincher . At least it did when I put them both on. It&#x27;s great without the cincher to me . I just put my caffeine cream on and apply my wrap it heats up instantly. Luv it !!! 💋</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy it was waste of money</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong thing. It is noting more than black plastic wrap. I was trying to order a waist trainer. Guess I should have read instead of looking at the picture.</li>
    <li> This product when wrapped around 3 times loosely just bunched up and didn&#x27;t work. I personally won&#x27;t use again but may work for others.</li>
    <li> This really works I put it under my waist trainer and I sweat it out and I see a big different in my waist so I will buy more very soon</li>
    <li> I love this black saran wrap! It stays on better than regular saran wrap and definitely gives you that thermal effect and helps you sweat like crazy! Perfect for workout!</li>
    <li> I saw no difference. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now. I use it in conjunction with the waist cincher. I find it to be a waste of money. Also, whomever said it didn&#x27;t roll up was incorrect.</li>
    <li> Great product and it was deliver very fast</li>
    <li> The wrap is awesome! However it does tend to roll up. I wear it under a waist cincher and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> Horrible kept rolling down</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money! Does not work for me . Disappointed purchase!</li>
