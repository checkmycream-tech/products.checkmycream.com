      <li>So in that regard, I am very pleased with this kit!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
      <li>/&gt;VERY happy with this system.</li>
      <li>great idea</li>
      <li>and I do think that it is great.</li>
      <li>It worked great on my teeth</li>
      <li>So except for the gel pen, I&#x27;m happy with the rest of the product.</li>
      <li>The “paint on” whitening gel is great since I can avoid putting it on the crown (something I can’t avoid with strips).</li>
      <li>The toothpaste is great tasting..</li>
      <li>This is a great toothbrush, and the whitening pen is just so neatly encased in the handle.</li>
      <li>Whitening Kit is a great idea for people who are looking to enhance the whiteness of their teeth.</li>
      <li>So for that it is great.</li>
      <li>Awesome product, better price than buying at the stores</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product but all of the items should be sold separately.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a dentist, but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel like they were getting a good cleaning.  </li>
      <li>what are the good aspects of this product?</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay because it doesn&#x27;t seem like you need the toothbrush at all!</li>
      <li>thats a lot better!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The toothbrush is amazing, I use an electric toothbrush morning and evening</li>
      <li>After I read all the chemicals that were involved I honestly did not want to use this day after day, although perhaps I would have achieved whiter teeth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice started kit, though.</li>
      <li>I always feel these things are some kind of gimmick.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the best I can say about the whole thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Colgate products, and as soon as I saw the TV ad for this two-in-one whitening kit, I knew I wanted to try it.</li>
      <li>but it feels nice.</li>
      <li>It makes it really handy.</li>
      <li>should be much more product to do any good.</li>
      <li>And I felt like I got nice results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen a nice improvement in brightening shades of my teeth.</li>
      <li>It has a good feeling of heft to it and the feeling on my teeth is pretty good too.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
      <li>this being said, I&#x27;m still kind of impressed because I think this whitening gel actually does work!</li>
      <li>Plus, it didn&#x27;t seem to whiten much more than the paste by itself.</li>
      <li>I love how it works.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I use the whitestrips from another brand and those are my favorite.</li>
      <li>That might be better</li>
      <li>This just wasn&#x27;t my favorite way to teeth whitening.</li>
      <li>Perhaps strips are a better solution and adhere to one&#x27;s teeth in places where this gel may not.</li>
      <li>Colgate Optic White is one of the best whitening toothpastes on the market.  </li>
      <li>dentist&#x27;s program is better.</li>
      <li>and I would say put your money towards better whitening products.</li>
      <li>fast delivery, and great product</li>
      <li>There must be better ways to whiten your teeth.  </li>
      <li>A lot better than the el cheapo CVS toothbrushes</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t expect to continue using this one because electric ones are better.</li>
      <li>MY TEETH LOOK BETTER</li>
      <li>Completely better then applying and waiting around with the strips.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush is OK, but I wondered about the pen.  </li>
      <li>Try it out yourself! :-)</li>
      <li>Great idea having the whitening gel so handy, makes you much more likely to use it.  </li>
      <li>A handy kit that whitens teeth quickly.  </li>
      <li>Kind of mildly yellowish,</li>
      <li>I said, it&#x27;s good for enhancing your teeth if they are not in need of a deep whitening, but if you are looking to truly whiten them, there are more effective treatments</li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to follow.</li>
      <li>brush and gel are easy to use.</li>
      <li>The gel pen for whitening tucks away inside the brush once you \\&quot;install\\&quot; and makes it easy to reach for post-brushing.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use, but</li>
      <li>Toothpaste is fine.</li>
      <li>I liked the toothpaste, and the application of the whitening agent was much simpler than a whitening kit I got from my dentist.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush is cheap.</li>
      <li>Sure, they seem to work better, but this works very well</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I loved this.</li>
      <li>My concern is not being able to distribute the right amount for each tooth.  </li>
      <li>This is to &amp;#34;spot whiten&amp;#34; areas (mainly front teeth) and it is a more potent and directed way to whiten teeth than just using the toothpaste.</li>
      <li>for the product, it is a handy and clever design.</li>
      <li>nothing too offensive looking just never could get that dazzling white thing going.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love it and it was waaaaaaaay too hot for me.</li>
      <li>In the 3-4 weeks I’ve been using it, I’ve seen significant results.</li>
      <li>After one week his teeth were significantly whiter.</li>
      <li>so it felt like my teeth did not get as clean as they should.</li>
      <li>The bleach pen dispenses this goo that you leave on, not rinsing off, that helps bleach your teeth clean while leaving a protective coating against staining agents like coffee and tea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one comes with a whitening pen and special toothbrush.</li>
      <li>So why was a special toothpaste included in the kit?</li>
      <li>Any suggestions for better use of the whitening pen would be appreciated.</li>
      <li>But the pen set up is cool.</li>
      <li>It is not a bad product, it is just not a miracle.</li>
      <li>The brush seems large, with good coverage, and not painfully firm.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The directions for the whitening pen say &amp;#34;no waiting, no rinsing&amp;#34; and that the whitening gel dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>And works quickly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m impressed with it enough to go out and use it on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>pen fits neatly into the bottom of the toothbrush for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process for the whitening pen is simple &amp; easy, just apply to teeth after brushing!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be even better in the long term.</li>
      <li>Some people have mentioned some minor discomfort, but if you&#x27;ve ever used whitening strips before I think you&#x27;ll find that the gel is much more enjoyable.</li>
      <li>My guess is that these two items were originally separate products which Colgate chose to package together in order to charge a higher price.</li>
      <li>I recommend still flossing after since the brush is good but not capable of extracting between the teeth 100%.    </li>
      <li>now im using aqua fresh</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say much more about this except that it works very well</li>
      <li>Kinda pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>These are reported to be useful for getting in between teeth and at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I eventually went back to using my own brush and just applied the gel to the spots that needed whitening.</li>
      <li>while it leaves your mouth feeling very minty and clean, it feels...hot..</li>
      <li>I found the Colgate Optic White kit very easy to use and had everything I needed in one kit.</li>
      <li>The Optic White toothpaste has a very strong minty taste that some might find a bit too</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was surprised how much I loved this. I tried the Colgate optic white toothpaste. I didn&#x27;t love it and it was waaaaaaaay too hot for me. So why did I like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is still too hot for me. But the pen set up is cool. It makes it really handy. And I felt like I got nice results. This definitely took care of discoloration around the edges. It also seemed to really brighten the teeth. I feel like they were subtly but noticeably improved.</li>
    <li> Great idea having the whitening gel so handy, makes you much more likely to use it.  It is very sticky and stays on the teeth well, I just didn&#x27;t notice any whitening of my teeth.  There are very few actual bristles on the brush, most of it is rubber.  That might be better, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a dentist, but my teeth didn&#x27;t feel like they were getting a good cleaning.  The whitening aspect of this product did not work for me and, considering the price, I&#x27;m a little bummed.</li>
    <li> Ok.  It does not do anymore than any other whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Not sure why but this toothpaste makes me gag, threw it out</li>
    <li> Awesome product, better price than buying at the stores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using whitening trays for years and hate the mess and messing with the trays. I could see this working by day two and it is so simple. I bought a second one for my husband who has never whitened his teeth and he loves how simple this us to use. After one week his teeth were significantly whiter. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is just such a clever idea. I&#x27;ve always liked Colgate products, and as soon as I saw the TV ad for this two-in-one whitening kit, I knew I wanted to try it. Sure enough, this is just as convenient and works just as well as advertised. This is a great toothbrush, and the whitening pen is just so neatly encased in the handle. It comes out easily, works easily and well, and pops back in with little or no mess. I really can&#x27;t say much more about this except that it works very well and I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase! Try it out yourself! :-)</li>
    <li> it ruined my teeth! i had high hopes for this but it was awful in all ways possible! i could see through my teeth after one month of using it that was scary! now im using aqua fresh thats a lot better!</li>
    <li> So dar seems to be working, I am only using the gel before bed and toothpaste after lunch (I use a different sensitivity toothpaste morning and evening), after a week I can see my teeth look wither&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is amazing, I use an electric toothbrush morning and evening and I figured I couldn use this one after lunch, well I was very surprised to findout it works almost as week as my electric.</li>
    <li> I kinda notice the difference but it just has a weird texture and taste recommend this product of you have a tolerance for s*** tasting things</li>
    <li> I have tried it already and I do think that it is great. The price is a little too high although shipping and handling prices were included. I like this and recommends it. It has not been two weeks yet for me using it but it feels nice.</li>
    <li> I FEEL LIKE MY TEETH LOOK BETTER</li>
    <li> This product restores my faith in marketing with honesty. I love how it works. I&#x27;ve seen a nice improvement in brightening shades of my teeth. I drink a lot of coffee. But this is a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;Winner, winner chicken dinner.......</li>
    <li> great idea but not enough whitening gel.  it&#x27;s gone too fast.  should be much more product to do any good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two days and it really works! My two front teeth are mostly fake and they stain when I eat or drink just about anything. Since I&#x27;ve used this stuff I have noticed a big change! After my morning cup of coffee my teeth no longer look disgusting! It whitened my teeth and really prevents staining. I&#x27;ll definitely stick to this product. Kinda pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Every time I go to the dentist, he tries to sell me a whitening kit for around $30. The thing is that teeth whitening can be done fairly cheaply at home using a rinse with hydrogen peroxide (but you have to be careful about concentrations as it is acidic and can irritate your gums). If you don&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of mixing with your own concoction, this is a reasonable alternative. That being said, this kit has little to offer over the toothpaste alone unless you have specific problem areas that you need to focus on whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Optic White toothpaste for awhile to bleach tea stains off of my teeth and it does work over about a week&#x27;s time to significantly fade stains. Your teeth will not be glowingly white, but there is visible improvement and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be even better in the long term. Besides the toothpaste, this kit offers a soft-bristled brush (a nice one, but the handle is large and hollow to hold the gel pen) which is fine. The gel tube is the thing which you have to consider whether or not you want to pay extra for. It contains a paste that comes up when you twist the bottom and apply to your teeth. This is to &amp;#34;spot whiten&amp;#34; areas (mainly front teeth) and it is a more potent and directed way to whiten teeth than just using the toothpaste. Note that I normally do not use a manual toothbrush and I don&#x27;t expect to continue using this one because electric ones are better. The brush mainly is a storing place for the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the gel is a weird experience. First, don&#x27;t use too much as you really don&#x27;t need a ton and it&#x27;ll apply in a film over your teeth. It also makes gums tingle and it also made the surface of my tooth ache a bit (though I wonder if this was a psychosomatic reaction to the filmy gel on my teeth). The instructions say &amp;#34;no waiting&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;no rinsing&amp;#34;, but the feeling on my teeth was so weird that I had to rinse after about 10 minutes. Still, if you need to concentrate where you whiten teeth, then it may not be the worst choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers did not experience teeth whitening. I can say that I absolutely did so I&#x27;m guessing that the reasons your teeth are stained (food, genetics, smoking, or whatever) probably has an impact on the effectiveness of this. I don&#x27;t smoke and have been prone to yellow-ish teeth (though nothing too intense) during my life, but I think my situation is mainly from coffee, tea, and cola.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the taste of the Optic White toothpaste, but I do think it works. I&#x27;m on the fence about the gel due to how filmy it feels on my teeth and think the toothbrush is just a pretty normal brush. I&#x27;d definitely recommend the paste, but I&#x27;m rather so-so on the overall kit.you whiten teeth, then it may not be the worst choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers did not experience teeth whitening.

I&#x27;d definitely recommend the paste, but I&#x27;m rather so-so on the overall kit.</li>
    <li> This kit includes a tube of optic white toothpaste, a special toothbrush (longer bristles and rubber scrubbing things on the other side), and a tube of optic white gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is manual.  The gel pen works by twisting (dispensing a creamy white paste)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see whiter teeth in two days.  The improvement has continued with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended to retreat every 3 months.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Optic White 2-in-1 Whitening Kit is a great idea for people who are looking to enhance the whiteness of their teeth. Colgate Optic white toothpaste , a toothbrush and a whitening polish that is located inside the handle of the toothbrush. While I find this feature very convenient, it becomes useless when the polish runs out.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has some very interesting bristles, which look like thick rubber and also include some that look like little tiny ropes. These are reported to be useful for getting in between teeth and at the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way the toothbrush cleaned, and the polish made my teeth a bit whiter, but overall, this kit is not really any better than any other whitening system, aside from the fact it is packaged all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, it&#x27;s good for enhancing your teeth if they are not in need of a deep whitening, but if you are looking to truly whiten them, there are more effective treatments available.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice started kit, though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Also, this stuff goes on chunky and doesn&#x27;t apply well. The toothbrush is cheap. The &amp;#34;hidden compartment&amp;#34; cap doesn&#x27;t stay on. Threw it out. The toothpaste is just normal toothpaste. Not worth $15 that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> This works well, I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my teeth in about 3 days, as promised. It comes with a toothbrush that can house the cleaning bleach pen and optic white toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the toothpaste kind of tastes weird, while it leaves your mouth feeling very minty and clean, it feels...hot..in your moth, which is a weird sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included toothbrush is medium firm and feels like it does a good job cleaning your teeth and gums. The bleach pen dispenses this goo that you leave on, not rinsing off, that helps bleach your teeth clean while leaving a protective coating against staining agents like coffee and tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good price too. And works quickly. Only 4 stars because of the odd mouthfeel of the toothpaste and the bleach you have to leave on tastes a bit weird.</li>
    <li> In case you weren&#x27;t aware, this is basically a relatively firm toothbrush with a hollow handle that holds a tube of whitening gel.  Also included in a tube of Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no question that it works and works well.  Basically, you brush your teeth in the usual way, and then put gel on your teeth.  That&#x27;s it.  2 clicks of the gel dispenser for the upper teeth and the same for the bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very convenient because you don&#x27;t have to wait around with strips on your teeth.  Sure, they seem to work better, but this works very well and you&#x27;ll notice the difference in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Criticisms?  Most dentists that I know recommend a soft brush and this one is very firm.  It can be hard on the gums and such, according to my dentist anyway.  But it&#x27;s well-priced, convenient, and does what is promised.  4 stars.</li>
    <li> This seems like a very good product.  I have to confess I do not use it exactly as the instructions say - twice a day.  I use it once at night.  I drink coffee during the morning and cannot see to whiten my teeth and then drink coffee.  Just using it once a day makes a lot of difference on my teeth.  I am almost 50 years old and cannot see my teeth ever looking completely stark white as plenty of the enamel is gone, and as I say, I like my coffee, but the difference is obvious with this product plus it is very easy to use.  I think it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to brushing my teeth multiple times a day with my regular toothpaste, with no problems.  So I was surprised when the first time I brushed my teeth with this kit&#x27;s brush and toothpaste and my gums bled profusely.  I used this product for 2 days as directed.  The label says your teeth will be whiter in 2 days.  I did notice a slight whitening, and if I&#x27;d continued to use the products for a longer time I think my teeth would have been noticeably whiter.  However, after reading the labels, I decided all the chemicals in these are not worth it to me.  Propylene glycol is just the beginning; the label reads like a lab experiment.  I try to avoid chemicals where possible, so I decided that for the toxic overload in these plus the gums bleeding, I would not get this product again.  There has to be something more gentle and less toxic out there, and I would be willing to use it longer and let it work more slowly in exchange for a lower chemical content.</li>
    <li> I have used many different whitening products over the years. I found the Colgate Optic White kit very easy to use and had everything I needed in one kit. It worked great on my teeth and I noticed that my teeth were several shades whiter with the first use. It did take a few weeks for a major difference because I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker, and as you can imagine they were very stained. I would recommend this to anyone who constantly battles coffee and/or tea stains.</li>
    <li> Some people have teeth yellowing due to coffee, tea or nicotine. In my own case, the yellowing is due to using Crest Pro Health mouthwash most of the time, and Peridex for gingivitis for several weeks after each quarterly cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether the cause of yellowing is related to the effectiveness of this product is unclear. All I know is that using it twice a day for over a week has not made my teeth any whiter – but definitely has kept them from getting yellower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush and gel are easy to use. Despite having sensitive gums which bleed easily, I did not find this too toothbrush too hard, and it did not cause my gums to bleed. The gel is less annoying to use than whitening strips which I don&#x27;t like. It is tasteless and not unpleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t adhere to the teeth, which leads me to wonder to what extent it is having any effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the holding compartment in the hollow of the toothbrush to be useful for holding the gel pen, since it is unnecessary and requires that the gel cap be removed. I prefer to keep the cap on in order to prevent the gel from drying out or getting contaminated by contacting other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was initially confused because I opened the gel first and read the instructions, which indicated that one should brush one&#x27;s teeth with one&#x27;s regular toothpaste before using the gel. So why was a special toothpaste included in the kit? My guess is that these two items were originally separate products which Colgate chose to package together in order to charge a higher price. Since I normally use a special toothpaste provided by my dentist for severe gingivitis, I prefer not to give up that toothpaste to use the Colgate Optic white toothpaste, which I did the past week. But I am not sure which whether the gel or the toothpaste had the most effect in preventing my teeth from yellowing further.</li>
    <li> While the kit comes with the toothbrush and the toothpaste the real star is the gel application. Not only did it work but the application it&#x27;s self took less then a minute and you could actually see results with 24 hours. Completely better then applying and waiting around with the strips.</li>
    <li> I HAVE to whiten my teeth because of my crowned front tooth; if my teeth get too stained, the crown is painfully obvious. But I have sensitive teeth and I hate the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t plan to like the toothbrush since I have a Sonicare, but I DO like it. I use it when I do the whitening and use my Sonicare at other times. The brush seems large, with good coverage, and not painfully firm. The “paint on” whitening gel is great since I can avoid putting it on the crown (something I can’t avoid with strips). I didn’t find it overly goopy. I apply it to the teeth (the amount recommended is fine) and in a few minutes, it’s dissipated. You can put it on in the morning and not look like a foamy monster by the time you get to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect solution for me. In the 3-4 weeks I’ve been using it, I’ve seen significant results. This system is removing a lot of the warmer tones so the crown looks a lot more natural against my other teeth. Results were visible within a couple days, and improve as I continue to use the system.&lt;br /&gt;Because my teeth are sensitive, I’ve knocked use down to once every day or even every other day. I never got to the point where my teeth were painful from use or anything, but I didn’t want to go that far either. With my more limited use, teeth continue to whiten/brighten without discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this system. It will be my go-to from now on.</li>
    <li> A handy kit that whitens teeth quickly.  This kit comes with a whitening pen, a toothbrush and a tube of Colgate White toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;The directions for the whitening pen say &amp;#34;no waiting, no rinsing&amp;#34; and that the whitening gel dries quickly.  I found that the whitening pen does tend to leave a wet residue after application, but that quickly dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen fits neatly into the bottom of the toothbrush for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process for the whitening pen is simple &amp; easy, just apply to teeth after brushing!  That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Eh, I don&#x27;t think this did much of anything.  Was a waste of money for me.  The brush head was way too large so it couldn&#x27;t get into crevices between teeth, and the whitener pen makes your teeth look whiter for about 10 minutes and then vanishes as soon as the gel comes all the way off.</li>
    <li> I tested this whitener by putting it only on teeth on the right side of my mouth every day for about two weeks. There is no difference whatsoever now in whiteness between the different sides of my mouth, which tells me this product had zero whitening effect in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have not been pearly white in a long time, if ever. Kind of mildly yellowish, nothing too offensive looking just never could get that dazzling white thing going. Maybe it was all the cigarettes I used to smoke up to about 15 years ago, or all the coffee and tea I drank and still do drink. Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as whitening is concerned, it was a complete washout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I give it one more star than the system-imposed minimum of one, because I actually like the toothbrush quite a bit. It has a good feeling of heft to it and the feeling on my teeth is pretty good too. A lot better than the el cheapo CVS toothbrushes I usually get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this system just for the toothbrush, however, and neither should you. Maybe the whitener works for some people, but if your teeth are like mine, you can forget it.</li>
    <li> The thing about this product is that it really doesn&#x27;t do what it promises. It says that it helps to block stains. I guess I was expecting too much because I do drink a lot of coffee, and that is probably the worst stainer next to cigarette smoke. The little tube of whitener is very convenient. You put the stuff on and just leave it so you aren&#x27;t waiting....waiting... to rinse. You don&#x27;t have to worry about your lips or gums getting sore from it, either. So for that it is great. I waited until I had used half the toothpaste and I guess half of the tube of whitener before posting a review just so I would know for sure how the stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It whitens after about two weeks, not two days as the package says. You must use it twice a day, not once a day. Probably it would work faster if you use it three times a day as the dentist recommends. Coffee (and presumably cigarette smoke) will wipe out the whitening. After a month, I think my teeth are a bit whiter, though so I give it three stars.</li>
    <li> The main problem with this product is the actual tooth whitening product: it&#x27;s a sticky, almost waxy substance which is twisted up through the dispenser into a rubber-brush applicator. Two twists and it oozes out and rubbed over your teeth; it doesn&#x27;t feel good stuck onto your teeth and you have to leave it...no rinsing. It&#x27;s really unappealing to me, and I honestly disliked using it, not to mention, there&#x27;s not really a way to clean the applicator between uses as it&#x27;s so sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the fact that I&#x27;m ingesting the gel instead of spitting it out. I think we eat enough chemicals with our GMO fruit and veg that we don&#x27;t need extra teeth whitening gel in our diet, or at least I don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as it whitening my teeth, I didn&#x27;t see a major change from using the gel and toothpaste, especially in just two days, however, I do think it works as my teeth do look lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this product? In a word...no. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed results after 30 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that the toothbrush with the whitener doesn&#x27;t fit in a typical travel case.</li>
    <li> Whiter teeth in 2 days? Well, maybe if you are not a smoker or a coffee drinker or eat teeth staining foods and drinks. It is not a bad product, it is just not a miracle. This one comes with a whitening pen and special toothbrush. I always feel these things are some kind of gimmick. It seems they could just add the whiteneing stuff in your mouthwash or toothpaste to begin with instead of giving you pens and strips, etc. Yes, I think it is making my teeth whiter, but it has been 2 weeks, not 2 days.</li>
    <li> Ok. This is the deal. I personally didn&#x27;t like this product and I would say put your money towards better whitening products. I used this for 2 weeks BEFORE starting to see a difference. And this was with brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day and using the pen in the morning and at night. I actually liked the massaging tooth brush and the toothpaste was not too bad. But as far as it&#x27;s claims for whitening teeth quickly...not sold on it here. I only drink tea and that is not every day. Does it depend on your enamel maybe? That could be. I don&#x27;t believe it &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for me. I have used Crest 3D White in the past with better results.</li>
    <li> This product is a LOT less expensive than a teeth whitening program you can obtain through your dentist.  But it is the dentist&#x27;s application that you have to compare this to... a home whitening kit versus a professional cleaning and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dentist&#x27;s program is better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the toothbrush at all. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth well enough. Went back to my old toothbrush instead. As for the gel, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth, and after using the whole kit for almost two weeks, there is no significant whitening. The toothpaste, however, leaves my mouth feeling extra clean at least. That&#x27;s the best I can say about the whole thing. Glad to read other reviews saying this worked, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> The instructions say you should see a difference in a couple days. A couple shades whiter. I used Colgate Optic White 2-in-1 Whitening Kit for a couple weeks. I didn&#x27;t really expect to see much change, and wanted to give it ample time for the benefit of a doubt. It did whiten a couple shades within a couple days, as promised. However, it doesn&#x27;t really go much further than that. Maybe regular use keeps that 2 shades from going back, but it just doesn&#x27;t turn your teeth into headlights to light your walk home in the dark.</li>
    <li> Eh. This just wasn&#x27;t my favorite way to teeth whitening. I use the whitestrips from another brand and those are my favorite. The application of it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other brands trying to join in on this niche just can&#x27;t compete with the adhesive quality of the strips and how it is so easy to use and unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the whitening pen it is really awkward. The rubber head is not controllable. I felt like I was trying to get this in all my teeth&#x27;s nooks and crannies with a spackle brush. No finesse, just glob it on. Which gets to my next point, the globs of gunk in my mouth is horrible. You&#x27;re just ingesting this stuff and I shudder to think what the teeth whitening chemicals are doing to my insides. It does most certainly not adhere within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, I&#x27;m still kind of impressed because I think this whitening gel actually does work! I do see a difference. I don&#x27;t know if it is the pen, or the toothpaste, or both, or maybe the tough toothbrush that I use that comes with this kit, but I have seen a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are this toothbrush and the toothpaste. When this runs out I think I will definitely get this toothpaste again. So in that regard, I am very pleased with this kit!</li>
    <li> The gel in the whitening pen is creepy and I disliked applying it. Once I did, I didn&#x27;t want to close my lips over my teeth and let the gel mix with my saliva. Plus, it didn&#x27;t seem to whiten much more than the paste by itself. So after enduring 3 days of the regimen, I&#x27;m just leaving the pen in the handle to keep the bottom of the brush flush. Otherwise, the brush bottom is hollow and arched and uncomfortable in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been using the Optic White prior to receiving this kit, and will continue because it does remove food stains and additionally makes my teeth feel stronger, as though it may be sealing up little cracks that can occur with age. I also notice that my teeth are not only whiter but also brighter, gleaming cleanly when I smile. I do like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s a little weird is that when I first apply the paste to my teeth, I feel a heat sensation. Surely some sort of chemical reaction which then subsides, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other reviewers mentioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful for the new toothbrush, as well. I don&#x27;t find it too large or strange or rough feeling. Instead, I feel that it does an overall great job of massaging the gums and getting in the tiny spaces while distributing the paste evenly and thoroughly. So except for the gel pen, I&#x27;m happy with the rest of the product.</li>
    <li> Colgate Optic White is one of the best whitening toothpastes on the market.  I have tried very expensive brands of whitening toothpaste to follow up after having my teeth whitened, and the expensive brands did a good job; however, Colgate Optic White works as good, if not better, than those brands, and costs much less.  I like everything about this kit.  My teeth look much whiter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Colgate Optic White 2-in-1 for a couple of weeks now and in all honesty, I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement or change in the whiteness of my teeth.  I have been using it regularly and it&#x27;s easy to use, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m impressed with it enough to go out and use it on a regular basis.  The texture of the paste is slightly grainy and not as pleasant as other brands.</li>
    <li> Toothpaste is fine. The whiting pen is gross. Forms a film that I must spit out. It&#x27;s got a gross texture. I have to be near a sink for about 10 minutes after using to spit.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is great tasting.. My teeth were not noticeably whiter after use. I also enjoy the flavor of the whitening pen, it&#x27;s like a white gritty paste you scrub on your teeth. Strangely the toothbrush part appeared dirty so I never used it. not great for whitening</li>
    <li> Having switched over to Philips electric toothbrush, it took a little getting used to the different amount of pressure needed to manually brush again.  However, the bristle pattern on the brush included in the Colgate Optic White 2-in-1 kit seems to do the job well, scrubbing out small food particles and leaving mouth feeling very fresh.  I recommend still flossing after since the brush is good but not capable of extracting between the teeth 100%.    The gel pen for whitening tucks away inside the brush once you \\&quot;install\\&quot; and makes it easy to reach for post-brushing.  I found the gel difficult to apply directly to teeth.  I gave it 2 tries and wound up wiping it away.  A bit disappointed in how it dispenses but since it is a thicker gel, it doesn&#x27;t drip.  My concern is not being able to distribute the right amount for each tooth.  Any suggestions for better use of the whitening pen would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on everything with the Colgate Optic White line of products.  This is the perfect set you can give yourself or anyone.  A new toothbrush...which the chubby handle stores the Whitening paste, and a big tube of Colgate&#x27;s optic white toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works...2 days yes, take pictures so you can compare, my teeth are lighter and brighter, after 5 days the effect improves but tapers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say how often or long you should use the whitening paste for, but I would take a break a every 2 weeks to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this regularly, morning and night, for just over 2 weeks and have seen very little difference. I do not drink coffee or tea, but do drink maybe a soda/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it is a handy and clever design. The brush has rubber nubs that feel odd when brushing- like something hitting your teeth. The bristles are OK, if a bit hard, but half the brush head is the nubs so it felt like my teeth did not get as clean as they should. The Optic White toothpaste has a very strong minty taste that some might find a bit too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening paste is lumpy on the teeth and sticky and feels just like that on your teeth- lumpy and thick. The applicator works well and if it clogs up (from not wiping after use) it can be opened easily by poking it with something thin and sharp. The paste must have peroxide in it because when applied at night there was a bad taste in my mouth the next morning similar to the aftertaste of other peroxide products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were almost no directions included, or at their website, so I had no idea if I was to apply and rinse, apply and leave it on for a certain amount of time, or leave it on till it wore off. I chose the last option- not a problem since the paste did not last long after you closed your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to work well for some, but I saw little difference so cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, and great product</li>
    <li> I want to start by stating that I don&#x27;t have really yellow teeth. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they&#x27;re not as pearly white as I would want them to be, but they&#x27;re not that bad. I wanted to get that out in the open because while I found the whitening to make a difference, I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference it would make on someone with really yellowed teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I must admit that I have tried numerous whitening techniques. When the whitening strips first came out, I was lined up at my local CVS for them! But the strips were cumbersome and the gel inside of them tasted awful. Colgate&#x27;s product seemed like a big step up because it even says that you can notice the difference in two days. While I did notice the difference, I also noticed how uncomfortable the brush is. Typically, I use an electric toothbrush or a small brush because I have a smaller mouth. This brush seemed to be right in the middle in regards to size and bristle strength. It was fine for the first day or two, but I soon noticed that I couldn&#x27;t clean as thoroughly as I usually do with my own brush. But that&#x27;s okay because it doesn&#x27;t seem like you need the toothbrush at all! I eventually went back to using my own brush and just applied the gel to the spots that needed whitening. I don&#x27;t really understand why you have to use the brush that is provided. Personally, I think it&#x27;s so the company can jack up the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the good aspects of this product? The gel works, at least for me. Even better, it doesn&#x27;t have that gross taste that the whitening strips have. Some people have mentioned some minor discomfort, but if you&#x27;ve ever used whitening strips before I think you&#x27;ll find that the gel is much more enjoyable. It is a bit sticky and odd at first, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product but all of the items should be sold separately. Also, I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for someone who has stains from coffee, smoking, etc. It&#x27;s not an elixir, but it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I tried Colgate&#x27;s Optic White Kit for a couple of weeks with mixed results. The instructions were easy to follow. I liked the toothpaste, and the application of the whitening agent was much simpler than a whitening kit I got from my dentist. However, my teeth only showed a slight bit of improvement. That was kind of disappointing. I may try the kit again at some point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only a few days and I already see a bit of a difference! I have sensitive gums, and this has not harmed them at all. I would definitely recommend this so far. Love it. And it&#x27;s so easy!</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed but really didn&#x27;t notice that much whitening of the teeth.  The toothbrush is OK, but I wondered about the pen.  After I read all the chemicals that were involved I honestly did not want to use this day after day, although perhaps I would have achieved whiter teeth.  But I don&#x27;t think it is wroth it because it is not good to digest a lot of chemicals.  There must be better ways to whiten your teeth.  I really don&#x27;t drink coffee and I don&#x27;t smoke.  I guess just getting older makes one&#x27;s teeth a little yellow.  I&#x27;d like to whiten my teeth but not using this method on a long-term basis.  Perhaps strips are a better solution and adhere to one&#x27;s teeth in places where this gel may not.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush last less than a month</li>
