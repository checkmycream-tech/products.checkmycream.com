<li> My son loved the bottle but we all suffered from the bad smell.</li>
<li> lol I&#x27;m taking one star for the bad smell and another for the slowest shipping EVER!</li>
<li> A big chunk was missing from the left wing of the symbol, like someone had scraped part of it off with their thumb.</li>
<li> Opened up the box and found the bottle wet with cologne, which got all over my hands.</li>
<li> It smells like aged sweat.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this did not improve my hand&#x27;s ability to fight crime, but instead made them stink for the next couple of hours, even after washing them multiple times (with regular soap, not Batman soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Cute box and bottle but HORRIBLE SMELL!</li>
<li> Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br</li>
<li> I would only recommend buying this Batman cologne if you don&#x27;t mind smelling bad, you don&#x27;t mind your surroundings smelling bad, and you don&#x27;t really care about the Batman part of the product.</li>
<li> Nothing horrible, but it had clearly been opened several times.</li>
<li> smell itself was awful, and was about as far from musky as you could get.</li>
<li> you can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this item.</li>
<li> Musky smell, not too crazy about it</li>
<li> I was shocked at the scent!  </li>

    <li> Our Kindergartner won&#x27;t leave for school without his Batman Cologne.  He had started using daddy&#x27;s but it was getting a bit out of hand.  So we got him his own and the Batman by Marmol &amp; son is a full size bottle.  It only takes a small spray and it is very pleasant and manly.</li>
    <li> This actually smells good. My son loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a 10 year old. He sprayed and sprayed and sprayed.  Several person said it spelled similar to Axe.</li>

    <li> Smells really good. Has like a sweet scent.</li>
    <li> smells great bought it for my 6yr old son, he like it too.. It has a  nice mild sent, not to strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is an avid Batman fan. I was very surprised at how well it smelled. It&#x27;s manly without being musky. (Neither of us like musk) definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> my grand son loved it , very fast delivery</li>
    <li> My 4 year old son love this. It really does smell nice, and he feels special when getting ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> My son loved the bottle but we all suffered from the bad smell. It smells like aged sweat. Find other kind or just place a batman sticker on a good quality perfume bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne hoping to smell like Batman. I was looking for a strong, musk scent that might possibly make me smell like a superhero. Based on the other reviews I had pretty high hopes. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne box featuring the Dark Knight wasn&#x27;t in great shape. Nothing horrible, but it had clearly been opened several times. I could already strongly smell the cologne before opening it. Opened up the box and found the bottle wet with cologne, which got all over my hands. Unfortunately this did not improve my hand&#x27;s ability to fight crime, but instead made them stink for the next couple of hours, even after washing them multiple times (with regular soap, not Batman soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself had the bat symbol on it, but it didn&#x27;t look as pictured. A big chunk was missing from the left wing of the symbol, like someone had scraped part of it off with their thumb. It was a symbol reminiscent of the bat symbol, but not the bat symbol. That takes away like 80% of the reason you would buy Batman cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell itself was awful, and was about as far from musky as you could get. I received the package at work and opened it here in the office. Within five minutes I had tied a garbage bag around it because everyone around me was coughing and complaining about the scent. Took about thirty minutes for the smell to go away, and I never once sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would only recommend buying this Batman cologne if you don&#x27;t mind smelling bad, you don&#x27;t mind your surroundings smelling bad, and you don&#x27;t really care about the Batman part of the product. If so, great. It&#x27;s pretty cheap and does in fact contain cologne. If you were hoping to smell alright and have some good novelty cologne around the house, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention that this stuff is so strong that if you did spray this on before putting on your vigilante gear, everyone would be able to identify you later just by the smell. \\&quot;Of course Bruce Wayne is Batman! Haven&#x27;t you smelled him?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a refund, so that&#x27;s something.</li>
    <li> My son has been asking for cologne so I searched all the stores and couldn&#x27;t find anything I liked for boys. This one is great since it has the Batman theme and a nice smell.</li>
    <li> This was a lot of fun, and my 7 year old boy loved that he has his own spray now. The smell is really good, and I will probably have to buy him some more when this bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> Smells great kinda like polo black</li>
    <li> my son loves the scent</li>
    <li> I love the smell.......Love it for my little man</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, our 5 year old batman fan absolutely loves his big boy bat man cologne.</li>
    <li> My son is a huge batman fan. We thought this would be a great present for our son so we got it for him. We were surpised how good this cologne smells considering its a &#x27;batman cologne&#x27; for kids but we think it smells awesome  on our son. He puts it on in the morning before school and he still smells like it when he comes home 9 hours later.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is just perfect for a young men even for a little boy.  It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;My 4 yr old and 11 yr old love it.</li>
    <li> Cute box and bottle but HORRIBLE SMELL! lol I&#x27;m taking one star for the bad smell and another for the slowest shipping EVER! I was guaranteed delivery before Christmas (19th-23rd) but didn&#x27;t receive it until a couple of days after! I ordered on Dec.17th and even paid for expedited shipping to be sure I&#x27;d get it in time for Santa to stuff it into my 6yr old&#x27;s stocking... It didn&#x27;t get here until Dec.27th:-( Lol Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t something at the top of my child&#x27;s Christmas list:) BUT if you are a collector of cute Batman stuff then this will work for you! Also, another seller may do better, I ordered from Perfumeland Megastore.</li>
    <li> I was kind of nervous, reading that people had gotten open boxes and smelly packages, but mine was wrapped up and in perfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;The package was packed so well and so perfectly! I bought this as a gift for my brother as a gag gift and can&#x27;t wait to see how it smells!</li>
    <li> This smells great. I&#x27;m 21 and I use it. Mostly because I&#x27;m Batman, but it still smells great. I use it more than my Old Spice cologne.</li>
    <li> I was not prepared for this cologne to smell as great as it does since it&#x27;s for kids , my son is 6 and loves cologne and Batman so I figured it would be a great gift, after smelling it for the first time I was taken back because it smells so good, I will buy this again,</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne for the young men in your life. I will definitely repurchase for my son and nephews.</li>
    <li> This cologne is the best smelling cologne I have found for little boys so far.</li>
    <li> Great cologne son loves it</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, for a kids cologne it&#x27;s very nice. I didn&#x27;t expect for it to smell this good. Even an adults can wear this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great.. Son loves it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who loves Batman. He is keeping it as a novelty piece.</li>
    <li> my 6 years old son loves it.&lt;br /&gt;smells good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son who likes batman kindof as a joke and he LIKES the smell</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and my son loves it</li>
