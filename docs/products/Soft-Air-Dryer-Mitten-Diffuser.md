      <li>Great on any size dryer.  </li>
      <li>So happy to have another one.</li>
      <li>Works well and comes in handy traveling.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t practical to carry your own dryer and diffuser everywhere</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, doesn&#x27;t take up any space and works with any blow dryer.  </li>
      <li>I guess I should have known better at that price.</li>
      <li>Super handy.</li>
      <li>Works great to bounce up my natural curls :)</li>
      <li>It just blows the air through the incredibly cheap plastic mesh, and makes it even more frizzy.</li>
      <li>The dryer is lightweight and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Easy to pack for travel.</li>
      <li>Really cheap.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these for an overseas trip and it was fantastic to have a diffuser that took up virtually no space on my suitcase.</li>
      <li>Now I can take my sock difuser with me and it will fit on every blowdryer I find.</li>
      <li>Fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>And when I was able to use it, it really wasn&#x27;t any more effective than holding the hairdryer at a greater distance to avoid frizzing my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Fell apart right away!  </li>
      <li>It actually came quite quickly, which was a pleasant  surprise.</li>
      <li>Not as good as a regular diffuser</li>
      <li>I travel a lot and this little genius works great.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>It really is worth about a penny.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the expense.  </li>
      <li>The opening wasn&#x27;t large enough to fit over most of the hairdryers in the hotel rooms.</li>
      <li>I was very please by how quickly I received this product.    </li>
      <li>Originally bought for travel, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive, light weight, and packable that it is now the only diffuser that I use.</li>
      <li>My stylist has one of these devices (not this exact one, thank goodness) and it works wonders on my hair.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I felt it made me have more frizz than a regular diffuser.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use any other kind of diffusers but these.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how well it works, and for the low cost you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;The size and flexible storage is handy for travelers.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when using this.</li>
      <li>Wish I had spent a bit more to get something of quality.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as my old one, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to last too long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly lightweight and easy to put on to my dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse even a little bit.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts upon seeing it since it didn&#x27;t really look like it would do much to diffuse the air coming out of a blow dryer, but I tried it two different times</li>
      <li>I actually like it better than any other diffuser I have had.</li>
      <li>First time I did not have to bring my big hair dryer with the diffuser on vacation!</li>
      <li>I had one in the past and it was 100% better.</li>
      <li>Easy to pack, takes up little room.</li>
      <li>I had no trouble getting it to stay on as others did.</li>
      <li>Gives me the soft curls I like.</li>
      <li>This mitten does exactly what I want -- lets me style and dry my hair without having the hair dryer air blow my hair all all over the place.  </li>
      <li>This works well if you want to put the strength of the blower in between high and low.  </li>
      <li>Poor quality, &amp;#34;Hot Sock&amp;#34; is a much better choice.  </li>
      <li>This little mesh mitten is exactly what I&#x27;ve been look for.</li>

<li> This was disappointing,  not enough density to really difuse hair well.</li>
<li> This thing works a little and it should have cost a dollar.  </li>
<li> Waste of 3 dollars-</li>
<li> I use it on an extremely small, travel hair dryer that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
<li> However, I never take my blowdryer with when I travel or to the gym, since hotels and gyms usually have avilable blowdryers to share.</li>
<li> It was actually very small and narrow.</li>
<li> It seriously did not work at all.  </li>
<li> I had bought one at a Beauty Store and poorly made.  </li>

<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ahve been looking for this product for years and could not find it in my country! I have got curly hair and use a blow dryer with a difusor. However, I never take my blowdryer with when I travel or to the gym, since hotels and gyms usually have avilable blowdryers to share. Now I can take my sock difuser with me and it will fit on every blowdryer I find. Besides, it doesn&#x27;t use any room of my luggage.</li>
    <li> This works well if you want to put the strength of the blower in between high and low.  If you really want to diffuse with very little blowing it is not for you.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this little genius works great.  It&#x27;s very light weight, doesn&#x27;t take up any space and works with any blow dryer.  It isn&#x27;t practical to carry your own dryer and diffuser everywhere and this is a great solution!</li>
    <li> I want everyone to know that this product is great!  I had one a number of years ago but it melted from constant use and I have been searching for another one for about the last six months.  I contacted the maker of my hair dryer who put me in contact with another company which finally led me to this site and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Now I can style my hair the way that I want to!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as a regular diffuser but it works well when your hair drier doesn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
    <li> Works well and comes in handy traveling.</li>
    <li> I was very please by how quickly I received this product.    The mitt was what I expected.  A little on the thin side, but the price was right.    I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product (or gift) for anyone with curly hair.  I ordered two, one for home and one for travel.  Easy to pack, takes up little room.</li>
    <li> Originally bought for travel, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive, light weight, and packable that it is now the only diffuser that I use.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the item I ordered &amp; it arrived on time &amp; in great condition.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well it works, and for the low cost you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;The size and flexible storage is handy for travelers.</li>
    <li> This was disappointing,  not enough density to really difuse hair well. Really cheap. And not a lot of elasticity. Wouldn&#x27;t retail to my clients. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, curly hair and travel a lot. My stylist has one of these devices (not this exact one, thank goodness) and it works wonders on my hair. I have been looking for one for myself. This is definitely not it. It&#x27;s certainly lightweight and easy to put on to my dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse even a little bit. It just blows the air through the incredibly cheap plastic mesh, and makes it even more frizzy. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for an overseas trip and it was fantastic to have a diffuser that took up virtually no space on my suitcase. It fits on any dryer, so you can use it with the ones provided in hotels. I ended up buying a second one to keep in my gym bag to use at the gym. Super handy. They&#x27;re a bit on the thin side so be careful taking it on and off the dryer so as not to rip it.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works great! I actually like it better than any other diffuser I have had. My hair was perferctly curly!</li>
    <li> Fits my Remington hair dryer perfectly. Works great to bounce up my natural curls :)</li>
    <li> Used it for 8 days on vacation.  Worked great!  I had bought one at a Beauty Store and poorly made.  Fell apart right away!  This one was heavier and fits any size hair dryer.  First time I did not have to bring my big hair dryer with the diffuser on vacation!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected, fits on my dryer with no problems, dries my curly hair without blowing it all over the place, and ya can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> Not as good as my old one, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to last too long.</li>
    <li> I had one before and it ripped. So happy to have another one. It actually came quite quickly, which was a pleasant  surprise.</li>
    <li> This thing works a little and it should have cost a dollar.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the expense.  I had one in the past and it was 100% better.</li>
    <li> Great on any size dryer.  Diffuses air for very short hair and makes it easier to use a curling iron or brush</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and figured, hey it&#x27;s only 3 bucks it&#x27;s worth a shot.  I was traveling overseas and I didn&#x27;t want to lug my giant diffuser so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  It seriously did not work at all.  I had my doubts upon seeing it since it didn&#x27;t really look like it would do much to diffuse the air coming out of a blow dryer, but I tried it two different times and it definitely did not work- my hair frizzed out immediately so I put it in a ponytail instead.  Waste of 3 dollars- I guess I should have known better at that price.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, &amp;#34;Hot Sock&amp;#34; is a much better choice.  This diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to diffuse at all - might as well not have anything on the hair dryer</li>
    <li> The sock wasn&#x27;t as the picture showed.  It was actually very small and narrow.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser as we travel alot and it doesn&#x27;t take up the space of traditional diffusers. It fits well on my travel dryer and does the job.  Great idea and great product.</li>
    <li> Not the best, but will work in a pinch! I felt it made me have more frizz than a regular diffuser.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this to work as well as it does and I will never, ever buy a big, bulky diffuser again!  If you diffuse your hair and travel a lot, buy this!!  Or even if you don&#x27;t travel a lot, buy this!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference when using this. I had no trouble getting it to stay on as others did.</li>
    <li> Yes, I burned it. I left the sock on while using the hair dryer with a brush.  I shouldn&#x27;t have because now my diffuser has a hole in it.  Besides that, it works well as a diffuser.</li>
    <li> This mitten does exactly what I want -- lets me style and dry my hair without having the hair dryer air blow my hair all all over the place.  Actually works,</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser to use while I was in Europe on vacation to save room in my suitcase.  The opening wasn&#x27;t large enough to fit over most of the hairdryers in the hotel rooms. And when I was able to use it, it really wasn&#x27;t any more effective than holding the hairdryer at a greater distance to avoid frizzing my naturally curly hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like these soft mitten diffuser instead of the hard plastic ones. Fit my blow dryer. Easy to pack for travel. Gives me the soft curls I like.I don&#x27;t use any other kind of diffusers but these.</li>
    <li> It is small and it works, but it is not like the larger ones you can get. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was leaving on a cruise, and needed the diffuser because I did not know what the blowdryer would be like.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted and you can&#x27;t beat the price. And I can just pack to use on any dryer.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> This little mesh mitten is exactly what I&#x27;ve been look for. I use it on an extremely small, travel hair dryer that I&#x27;ve had for years. The dryer is lightweight and easy to hold. This diffuser slips over the end and stays on beautifully!</li>
    <li> Tore after 3 uses.  It really is worth about a penny. Wish I had spent a bit more to get something of quality.  The concept is great.</li>
