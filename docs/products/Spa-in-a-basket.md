<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Nice gift presentation for my good neighbor who helps out so much. Good basket, very nice items, looks expensive.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift and she loved it!</li>
    <li> The product looked great and it was a perfect gift for a friend of mine</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my girlfriend.  She loved it! Scored many, many brownie points, and I wasn&#x27;t even in the dog house! :-)</li>
    <li> I thought the basket would be bigger and it was stuffed to make it appear fuller.</li>
    <li> The spa box comes in a great basket that will be useful after everything else is gone.  It&#x27;s a great gift</li>
    <li> This spa-in-a-basket has loads of things to get excited about. It has every kind of wash and lotion, not to mention a loofah, slippers, and a massage tool. Everything smelled great and apparently still calms the nerves of the person I gave it to. I recommend you give this as a gift to anyone who has tons of stress. So everyone.</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews and was skeptical. I had the basket delivered to my home so that I could evaluate before giving as a Bridal Shower gift. I was pleasantly surprised when I removed the plastic wrapper. The products are of good quality, including the slippers. The basket is of good quality, also. I then had to secure the contents sufficiently to gift wrap. Lots of pink ribbon did the trick. The Bridal Shower was today and the gift was a hit. I couldn&#x27;t have done better unless alcohol was involved.</li>
    <li> Raffle winner LOVED this!</li>
    <li> I got this from my hubby when he was deployed. God Bless him.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the vanilla body wash and the poofie but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;The shoes where too small,I never use the wooden scrubby thing, but most off all the basket smelled like fresh lacquer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I would have liked it a lot more if the basket didn&#x27;t smell so bad, I had to take it outside the whole house smelled so bad.</li>
    <li> Easy nice choise of gift for Xmas:)</li>
    <li> Gifted and they loved it, Awesome Gift IDea</li>
    <li> This company is very good and the product is wonderful.The only complaint I have is I would have liked to include a gift card,but they do not offer that. The porduct though is great and they delivered before the ecpected delivery date which I loved because it came right on her birthday.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law loved her present</li>
    <li> My wife loved it! Looks exactly as the picture on your site and contained all the products described.</li>
    <li> Looked nice an big in pic. Said it was a picnic basket.  Maybe a picnic for one. Not much bigger than a lunch box. Stuff iside was nice. Taking stuff out an putting in bertter basket.&lt;br /&gt;Read reviews from others, that&#x27;s why I purchased.. plastic  wrapper its in does make it&lt;br /&gt;look cheap..slippers in pic make it looker bigger than is.</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful gift, it came just as it is pictured. I ordered 4 total and all the people I gave it to loved it..</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. She LOVED the smell of it; she said she could sit and smell it all day! (And I should note that my girlfriend is very particular about the scents she likes.) She also liked the other items in the basket besides the scented pieces ... the slippers, the scrubby thing.</li>
    <li> The person that was receiving this seemed happy, we did a robe and bath comfy theme for my boyfriends mother. I did get to smell the soap and it smelled great. Would recommend taking it out of the plastic wrap to gift it out, that part looked tacky.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my sister. I am out of the country, and it is often difficult to tell online what the quality of a product is. Not only is this as attractive as the picture (my sister loved the basket and it is now part of her bathroom decor) but she said the quality of the bath products are top notch. This was very important because part of why I chose this gift is because I used to make her bubble bath for her birthday each year. I would recommend this product as a gift or for personal use.</li>
    <li> Ordered it as a gift so I did not look at it until it was opened. The product was not the one shown, did not come with brush or slippers.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son, the contents of the basket would have been better suited to a woman. The shoes did not fit anyone.</li>
    <li> My cousin was very surprised to see that I got such a wonderful gift on amazon...she really likes this kind of stuff and it dure didn&#x27;t disapoint her</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with what comes in the basket. The amount of glue they used to keep the items in the package from moving around was crazy, and in the end the shower gel still opened and spilled over everything. (I did leave shipper feedback on this) for the price I expected a little better, I wouldn’t order this again.</li>
    <li> Poor quality basket and packing - slippers and bath products ok!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift and got exactly what was pictured and it was promised before Christmas and it arrived on schedule!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift so I don&#x27;t know a lot about it but the recipient said they liked it. I liked that it came with slippers along with the other stuff. It was also a pretty good price compared to others I looked at. I do wish the overall presentation of it would have been better though. The labels looked plain so it made it look kinda cheap.</li>
    <li> I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT DUE TO:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. IT WAS HELD BY SOME RUBBER BANDS JSUT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER YOU KNOW THE LID AND THE REST I was very annoyed with it. The SLIPPERS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FOUND IN THE DUMP. EVERYTHING WAS STUCK TOGETHER. I was extremely annoyed the minute I looked at it. The price for this I expected a good product and I felt I got garbage.</li>
    <li> This is okay, kinda cheap and the slippers really suck.  My wife threw out the slippers immediately.</li>
    <li> Basket is not the strongest, but the products are sized nicely and are of good quality.  The Sponge included is NOT soft - its is a harder sponge which was not what i expected - but it works ok for what it is.  Just would have preferred a softer sponge to use with the soaps.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift &amp; she loved it! I was told the products were great! It arrived on time, new condition of course.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift so I have no idea if the products were phenomenal or not.  The only negative was that the package was abit on the cheap side...so I had to fuss it up abit before I gave it to my daughter.  Not a big deal, but to me a spa gift basket has to ooze indulgence...and it didn&#x27;t straight out of the box.</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife, she really liked it, useful and quality basket and items, the packaged deal makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice gift for the price you pay. since this product is not expensive at all, you should not expect high quality about this item . The only thing that I did not like was a plastic/foam base that has all the products glued on top. That really made it look cheap and a pain to remove.  But in the end, I thought it was a very good and nice product for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Everything the discriptipn saod it came with, came. My wife loved it a lot and has already started using it Thanks</li>
    <li> I am staging my home to sell and I&#x27;m using this product. It&#x27;s so sweet and makes the bathroom look great. I wish someone would buy me one....very happy with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was a gift that I got from my mother she loved it and was very happy to receive it and said it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I thought the basket itself looked a little cheaply made so that kind of made me upset because it was pretty expensive but the stuff in it was nice</li>
    <li> it was just a nice extra touch to throw in. she likes this kind of stuff and was happy with it. so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my older sister after reading the reviews. It was set up nicely in the basket. My sister wanted to use it as a decorative piece for her bathroom and not open it. But she broke it open and she loves it. She actually doesn&#x27;t like vanilla but I guess this stuff just smells so wonderful she changed her mind. She did say she was confused about the slippers because they could go on any foot and she said the items were glued down so well almost as if it was a decorative piece. But overall she loves it. I recommend it to any woman or girl or as a gift for any girl/woman. It can also be a nice decorative piece if you can stand not ripping it open to get to that good stuff inside lol.</li>
    <li> It was a gift to someone...they seemed to enjoy it as far as I know....might try this again in the future</li>
    <li> This basket is a gift that I haven&#x27;t even given yet, however, the presentation is beautiful just a little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Great gift for the money</li>
    <li> Great service and great product!!</li>
    <li> The product looks and feels cheap, but it was cheap so you get what you pay for. Can not comment on items inside as it was given as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful gift for the women.  Lots of variety and very high quality.  First class.  Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA</li>
    <li> I sent this to an ill friend who got into and used some products the first night.  She said she loves it.  So 5 starts for the basket but just 1 star for Amazon who AGAIN left out the gift card so my friend had no idea where it came from.  I am batting zero with Amazon when it comes to including gift cards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great gift.  Another great gift idea from Amazon. I haven&#x27;t actually seen the product, but have been told that it was fantastic.  Delivery was fast, and the sister liked it, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> Our daughter in Law was delighted with same on her birthday !</li>
    <li> Sent to my sister as a get well gift.  She liked it, but the gift card I requested with it did not arrive, so it was a &amp;#34;mystery gift&amp;#34; until I asked her if she got it.</li>
    <li> This was a mother&#x27;s day gift , if you love to take a relaxing bath with soothing bubbles and beaufiful fragance...this is for you</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my sister-in-law &amp; she loved it! The price was good for what all was in the basket.</li>
    <li> A Xmas gift for my girlfriend.  She loves it and plans on buying more of them.  She has bday coming up!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom (who is picky and kind of a snob! Lol) and she loved it. The scent is very clean and refreshing. The slippers are well made and she uses the basket in her bathroom to store things and as a decoration. Great gift idea!!!</li>
    <li> This basket was a gift so I can&#x27;t give a review. I do know she was very excited when she saw the gift</li>
    <li> Spa in a basket?  That is debatable.  It is something that looks good staged as a usable product that is never used.  Call it a bath in a basket and it would be an easy 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. They liked it. Much better than sending chocolate or candy - healthier!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift for my mother in-law, and directly shipped to her house. We arrived home before Christmas day, when I opened the package to wrap the gift, it looked so cheap that my husband and I even don&#x27;t want to gift it out, but we don&#x27;t have time to buy her another gift.  So I wrapped it.  I don&#x27;t  recommend it at all. It&#x27;s not a good gift!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother in law for christmas, she loved it! it looks really pretty the way it comes.</li>
    <li> Great product to give as a gift. Includes everything needed to have a relaxing bath. My wife really loved this as a gift.</li>
    <li> got this basket as a present for my mother on christmas.  She said it worked perfect after a rough day at work.</li>
    <li> Basket is attractive. Contents are well-sized. But, still, not a wow. It was adequate but not worth the price of the item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece who so happens to be very particular, And I am happy to say she was very pleased with the quality of the products in the basket. The only reason for the 4 star rating was it was a little smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> My mother was the one that received this arrangement and she said she was very happy with her gift.  Only problem for her was the slippers didn&#x27;t fit, but she like everything else.</li>
    <li> recipient of this gift said she liked it very much</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend.  I was there when she opened it and she loved it!  The shoes fit her perfectly and the smells were wonderful and relaxing.  The basket is the size I expected and could be used for different things afterwards.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it looks in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice gift for my boyfriend&#x27;s mother.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give five stars but I could not open to smell the lotions cause it was a gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice. The perfect gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my parents as a thank you present. It arrived on time and from what my parents have said its very nice. Makes a great thank you gift!</li>
    <li> I purchased  this as a mother&#x27;s day gift.  My mother loves it.  She hasn&#x27;t tried everything in the basket yet but so far she &amp;#34;loves&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for Christmas and she loved it! Great way to pamper a lady for a special holiday.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to to friend. She was both surprised and delighted!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product.  Very disappointed that the basket was cheaply made and came bent and out of shape.  It would not even close correctly.  Couldn&#x27;t possibly give it as a gift.  The slippers are pitiful, something you would find at a dollar store.  I am sad because it was suppose to be a gift for a close friend.</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought it would be for the money I spent on it and she has not really use it that much. But it does smell good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a gift for my mother-in-law thinking that the basket was a nice addition that could be useful after the lotions/oil were used. I was surprised when I opened the box and saw the very small basket and the cheap feel and appearance of it. Not worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Great gift for someone who loves taking baths !</li>
    <li> great gift,my girlfriend loves it she said all the lotions were nice and smooth and smell great. it is hey great inexpensive gifts but has high quality with the slippers salts and even the basket. I think she likes the basket more than anything to tell you the truth.</li>
