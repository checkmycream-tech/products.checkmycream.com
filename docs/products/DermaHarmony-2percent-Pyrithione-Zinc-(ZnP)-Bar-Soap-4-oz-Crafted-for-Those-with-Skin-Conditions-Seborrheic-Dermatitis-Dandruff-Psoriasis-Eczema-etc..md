      <li>Great bargain</li>
      <li>my skin feels great.  </li>
      <li>has been working great on my acne and scars on my face.  </li>
      <li>This soap is great.</li>
      <li>This soap is great.</li>
      <li>I use this along with baking soda and it works amazing!</li>
      <li>very pleased with this soap.</li>
      <li>Love this soap!</li>
      <li>Works even better than the Rx stuff I got from my dermatologist!</li>
      <li>Effective and not too drying OR greasy.</li>
      <li>Its the best deal on the internet and its mild and light scented too.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, this soap is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Still, this stuff is great - it cleared up my shoulder in a week, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a noticeable smell, which is nice.</li>
      <li>I now use products from medical supply stores to wash my hands - I have the found the best are the foam kind and the rinse-free (but I still rinse it off anyway).</li>
      <li>once I get this condition under control just to be sure.</li>
      <li>I love this soap and anticipate that I&#x27;ll continue to use it a couple of times a week forever</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a scrubbie disposable wipe before, this soap  seems to work better.</li>
      <li>But once I realized that Pyrithione Zinc is the magic ingredient, I switched over to using dandruff shampoo as body wash, and that worked better for my needs, even though it&#x27;s just 1% rather than 2%.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, the best thing I&#x27;ve found is Head and Shoulders Almond conditioner which I put on nightly after washing and moisturizing with facial products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it and thank you Amazon Prime for the speedy delivery.</li>
      <li>I have tried bleach and Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.</li>
      <li>I was suffering from perioral dermatitis and this soap helps tremendously!</li>
      <li>Cleared up my seborrhic dermatitis on my face quickly!</li>
      <li>Great soap without any perfume or chemical smell-very gentle, did not dry out my skin and is taking care of the problem in a safe way</li>
      <li>so I use a couple of products afterward: Freeman&#x27;s pineapple enzyme mask to exfoliate, a serum, then a rich moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use a washcloth with soap then wipe clean.</li>
      <li>I wish we had tried this first!</li>
      <li>Any one who has skin problems this bar soap is just the right soap for you.  </li>
      <li>My skin cleared up very fast.</li>
      <li>my face is starting to look better</li>
      <li>worked wonders and I will definitely buy more of this soap.</li>
      <li>and it performs better in treatment of my back fungus!</li>
      <li>works great leaves no soap scum</li>
      <li>I am editing this review, just in case there&#x27;s people who have super sensitive moody skin like mine:</li>
      <li>Leaves skin oil free but not dry.</li>
      <li>It really helped with my rash.</li>
      <li>I really like this soap-</li>
      <li>But this soap started &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; my face after just one use, and now I&#x27;m four days in and my complexion is so much clearer.</li>
      <li>This last a long time and is truly effective on sebhhoreic dermititis on the face.</li>
      <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts at all, and the acne I had is clearing up very fast.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t really helped at all as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>big side benefit is it also seems to have significantly helped my stubborn moderate acne.</li>
      <li>Just last night my husband was rubbing my back and for the first time in as long as I can remember, my skin felt so smooth to his touch</li>
      <li>However, after using it in the bathtub it left a huge grey residue stain on my plastic tub.  </li>
      <li>The soap burned a bit at first when my skin was in worse shape, but after using it for about two weeks, my skin is doing SO much better</li>
      <li>Use it twice a day now to keep my face clear.</li>
      <li>I have seborrhea dermatitis on my eyebrows, each side of my nose and near my mouth.</li>
      <li>so now I&#x27;ve got a good, expensive, bar of hand soap:-/</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had moderate rosacea, redness and small pimples, for about fifteen years and have tried many prescription creams and skin care products.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it and will be a regular customer.</li>
      <li>The Pyrithione Zinc is the key and this bar is gentle enough to use on the face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major reduction in inflamed cysts since I&#x27;ve started using this soap.</li>
      <li>The only problem with this is that if you want to use it for more than your face, it&#x27;s hard to get enough of a lather going to do so.</li>

<li> The Pyrithione Zinc is the key and this bar is gentle enough to use on the face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed a major reduction in inflamed cysts since I&#x27;ve started using this soap.</li>
<li> The only problem with this is that if you want to use it for more than your face, it&#x27;s hard to get enough of a lather going to do so.</li>
<li> Because it&#x27;s a bar soap, and I have mature skin, it&#x27;s a little drying</li>
<li> Read about zinc soap being good for rosacea - didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, and was extremely drying to my skin:(  </li>
<li> I have tried expensive sensitive soaps and natural oils and creams, antibiotics internally and topically and steroids.</li>
<li> It leaves my skin feeling dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also been using a zinc lotion to deal with the  the rest of the dry skin.</li>
<li> but it does dry your skin a bit.</li>
<li> My husband has had irritable itchy, red, dry and scaly skin all winter, he&#x27;s been using this soap for less than a week and immidiatley the itching subsided and already his skin is visibly less red and irritated.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t dry you skin out like other brands.i</li>
<li> I have only used this product for a few days no positive change</li>
<li> I bought it because I had patches of dermatitis with a non-determined cause and this has seriously helped to clear it up.</li>
<li> I used this in conjunction with zinc supplements and after 1 week I have no more facial redness, flaking or pimples.</li>
<li> Disappointed that this hasn&#x27;t help more with Seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  </li>
<li> There is no dye, no fragrance, no uneccesary additives, and it arrived from the seller faster than I expected!</li>
<li> My facial redness got worse after I stopped using it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s only gotten worse over the years.</li>
<li> Wait a few weeks before you can see the results.</li>
<li> I hate getting old!!!!</li>
<li> This brand of zinc soap is almost twice the size of the competitor&#x27;s product, and, it is less expensive when bought in volume (2 bars).</li>
<li> I sleep on - whitehead looking things that wouldn&#x27;t go away and then 2 big painful pimples, and I was browsing around online and read about Pyrithione zinc.</li>
<li> Simple ingredients without nasty Emu Oil.</li>
<li> Gave me a horrible acne breakout that still continues after stopping.</li>

    <li> Great soap without any perfume or chemical smell-very gentle, did not dry out my skin and is taking care of the problem in a safe way</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks. I have dermatitis and really red cheeks. It hasn&#x27;t really helped at all as far as I can tell. It leaves my skin feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap- I just got it and my skin feels great.  However, after using it in the bathtub it left a huge grey residue stain on my plastic tub.  HELP!  Does anyone else have this problem?  I can&#x27;t seem to get it off- I have tried bleach and Mr. Clean Magic Erasers.</li>
    <li> Gave me a horrible acne breakout that still continues after stopping. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening, but the only thing ive changed is adding this into my routine.</li>
    <li> It has gritty substance in the soap--</li>
    <li> This soap is great. Effective and not too drying OR greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that this hasn&#x27;t help more with Seborrheic dermatitis on my face.  Believe it or not, the best thing I&#x27;ve found is Head and Shoulders Almond conditioner which I put on nightly after washing and moisturizing with facial products. It&#x27;s the only thing that stops the constant peeling and itching.  Update 6/1/2015- After discontinuing use, I realized that even though this didn&#x27;t work as well as the Head and Shoulders, it was actually working a bit.  My facial redness got worse after I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have seborrhea dermatitis on my eyebrows, each side of my nose and near my mouth. My doctor prescribed a cream that didn&#x27;t work at all&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this soap and after only washing my face 3 times, I don&#x27;t have the skin flakes. My facial skin feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This worked wonders and I will definitely buy more of this soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I bought it because I had patches of dermatitis with a non-determined cause and this has seriously helped to clear it up. The soap burned a bit at first when my skin was in worse shape, but after using it for about two weeks, my skin is doing SO much better and it doesn&#x27;t burn any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big side benefit is it also seems to have significantly helped my stubborn moderate acne. I&#x27;ve noticed a major reduction in inflamed cysts since I&#x27;ve started using this soap.</li>
    <li> Read about zinc soap being good for rosacea - didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, and was extremely drying to my skin:(  so now I&#x27;ve got a good, expensive, bar of hand soap:-/</li>
    <li> This soap is great! Its the best deal on the internet and its mild and light scented too. My boyfriend uses this for a skin condition and it keeps it from coming back. The only soap he will use! Great bargain</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a few days no positive change but it does dry your skin a bit. Will update after two weeks.</li>
    <li> It really helped with my rash.</li>
    <li> I am editing this review, just in case there&#x27;s people who have super sensitive moody skin like mine: within 3-4 months of using this soap, my hands started reacting to it and I had to stop using it.  I now use products from medical supply stores to wash my hands - I have the found the best are the foam kind and the rinse-free (but I still rinse it off anyway).</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this soap to prevent acne breakouts on my back and chest. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for two weeks and so far I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts at all, and the acne I had is clearing up very fast. Just last night my husband was rubbing my back and for the first time in as long as I can remember, my skin felt so smooth to his touch and I didn&#x27;t have any pain from inflamed comedones (because there were none). Time will tell if this continues to work as it has been!</li>
    <li> This brand of zinc soap is almost twice the size of the competitor&#x27;s product, and, it is less expensive when bought in volume (2 bars). I have used it for three weeks and it performs better in treatment of my back fungus! I will be using this product instead of competitors product in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this along with baking soda and it works amazing! My skin cleared up very fast.</li>
    <li> has been working great on my acne and scars on my face.  my face is starting to look better</li>
    <li> Cleared up my seborrhic dermatitis on my face quickly! I use together with a Clarisonic-type face scrubber (the Olay one), and I let the soap sit on my face for several minutes before rinsing. This stuff is a godsend! Works even better than the Rx stuff I got from my dermatologist!</li>
    <li> Be careful if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a scrubbie disposable wipe before, this soap  seems to work better. I&#x27;ve been using this  for a week seem to work well against acne too. I use a washcloth with soap then wipe clean. The photo is after a week of treating it was gross a week ago and to embarrassing to share with the world. I&#x27;ve also been using a zinc lotion to deal with the  the rest of the dry skin. I hate getting old!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, this soap is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Wait a few weeks before you can see the results.</li>
    <li> Any one who has skin problems this bar soap is just the right soap for you.  It cleanses deep and does not irritate. Go for it!</li>
    <li> This soap is my $6 miracle. I&#x27;ve had moderate rosacea, redness and small pimples, for about fifteen years and have tried many prescription creams and skin care products. It&#x27;s only gotten worse over the years. But this soap started &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; my face after just one use, and now I&#x27;m four days in and my complexion is so much clearer. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like in two weeks. Because it&#x27;s a bar soap, and I have mature skin, it&#x27;s a little drying so I use a couple of products afterward: Freeman&#x27;s pineapple enzyme mask to exfoliate, a serum, then a rich moisturizer. I love this soap and anticipate that I&#x27;ll continue to use it a couple of times a week forever once I get this condition under control just to be sure. I&#x27;m so glad I found it and thank you Amazon Prime for the speedy delivery. Please do try it if you fight rosacea.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Simple ingredients without nasty Emu Oil. Inexpensive. I was suffering from perioral dermatitis and this soap helps tremendously! Use it twice a day now to keep my face clear. My complexion looks great!</li>
    <li> works great leaves no soap scum</li>
    <li> Been using for seborrehic dermatitis and its seems to be helping a lot. Leaves skin oil free but not dry.</li>
    <li> It works well - I had some weirdness happening on the shoulder I sleep on - whitehead looking things that wouldn&#x27;t go away and then 2 big painful pimples, and I was browsing around online and read about Pyrithione zinc. The only problem with this is that if you want to use it for more than your face, it&#x27;s hard to get enough of a lather going to do so.

    <li> I have tried expensive sensitive soaps and natural oils and creams, antibiotics internally and topically and steroids. I used this in conjunction with zinc supplements and after 1 week I have no more facial redness, flaking or pimples.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this soap. doesn&#x27;t dry you skin out like other brands.i highly recommend it and will be a regular customer.</li>
    <li> My husband has had irritable itchy, red, dry and scaly skin all winter, he&#x27;s been using this soap for less than a week and immidiatley the itching subsided and already his skin is visibly less red and irritated. There is no dye, no fragrance, no uneccesary additives, and it arrived from the seller faster than I expected! I wish we had tried this first!</li>
    <li> This last a long time and is truly effective on sebhhoreic dermititis on the face. The Pyrithione Zinc is the key and this bar is gentle enough to use on the face.</li>
    <li> did not work for me after a couple of days using it redness and flakiness on the face showed. had to stop using it and ordered the one w/ card board packaging</li>
