      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>If she puts on her mascara with and without primer, she should be able to tell the difference....</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>The brush is not the best for a primer either- not enough bristles for this clumpy primer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Today was my first day using the product, and let me tell you, it works amazing!</li>
      <li>It also makes for awesome white eyelashes too.</li>
      <li>I emailed the seller about this and he ensured me this product was authentic.</li>
      <li>It also does run out.its not like mascara in how u can use it for months.your mascara also ends up clumpy on top of the conditioner, so u need to seperate them after.</li>
      <li>You get more, it dries quicker.</li>
      <li>This product was able to keep my eyelashes separated</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lash primer of all time</li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work better after I had it a month or so because it thicken up somewhat.  </li>
      <li>I find that this product makes my eyelashes look MUCH better than they do without it.  </li>
      <li>Also, as an added perk, my lashes have never looked better.</li>
      <li>With a primer the mascara works so much better.  </li>
      <li>This is the only eye lash primer I will ever use anymore, the rest are ok but this one is great!</li>
      <li>adhere better to the eyelashes.</li>
      <li>You put mascara on top of primer.</li>
      <li>helps the mascara I put on top of it</li>
      <li>I also use a translucent powder to dab under my bottom lashes and on the tips of my top lashes to set mascara.</li>
      <li>Lancôme is my favorite primer.</li>
      <li>Love this primer.</li>
      <li>Mary K lash primer is better</li>
      <li>but i am so glad that I did</li>
      <li>There can be some flaking off during the day, but in general, it is a very good product.</li>
      <li>I get comments quite often on how nice and full my lashes look, and when people ask me what type of mascara I use, I tell them</li>
      <li>It keeps my lashes separated, instead of clumping together, and while it keeps my mascara on well, it comes off easily when I wash off my makeup.</li>
      <li>This does not flake or wear off during the course of the day, yet it comes of easily with soap and water or makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>if you have fine lashes like me this makes and cheap or fancy</li>
      <li>Even with a cheap mascara like [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>After seeing all the fantastic reviews for this product I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I had originally tried Smashbox&#x27;s lid primer, and it&#x27;s fabulous with eyeshadow</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS SO MUCH!</li>
      <li>I was never satisfied with the quality of the ones I found in stores (name brands) and this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product in Sephora -</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I love this product so much!</li>
      <li>A really unique product on the market.  </li>
      <li>To me primers make the mascara go on smoother and more efficiently for a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to another person, even if it&#x27;s just used for special occasions.</li>
      <li>That being said, I want the best products to maximize the little bit of effort I am willing to put into my face every morning.</li>
      <li>Can be a bit &#x27;thick; sometimes, but the best primer that I have found!</li>
      <li>It really lengthens once I put my mascara on and no flaking and lasts 12 hours or more.</li>
      <li>It makes it so much more easier to put on mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up so much.</li>
      <li>ok, well if u are VERY patient and have time to do your mascara, then this product does work and will lengthen your lashes.</li>
      <li>However, you just need to make sure the brush is not overly saturated with the product, scrap it gently along the rim of the tube to get the excess off.</li>
      <li>Really wanted it to be better</li>
      <li>Despite their length, they never look full even after putting three coats of mascara on them.  </li>
      <li>The more primer you add to your lash, the bigger and more voluminous it will look.</li>
      <li>I feel as if at times it causes my mascara to clump more than it would normally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other good ones out there, but why try to fix what&#x27;s not broken.  </li>
      <li>Great for building mascara with less mascara</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Lancome primer which has a great brush and isn&#x27;t a sticky mess like Smashbox.</li>
      <li>This stuff worked really well for me!!</li>
      <li>It makes a very noticeable difference in the look of whatever mascara you put on and provides all day flake free wear.</li>
      <li>The priner seemed old, but that it had potential to be a great product.</li>
      <li>Yes you do need to devote time and energy to applying this because it is worth having.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a couple of months, and it is now by far my favorite thing in my makeup bag.</li>
      <li>Now, my lashes look as long and beautiful as they did with extensions, but they are my natural lashes.</li>
      <li>It works as far as primers go, but for this price the quality should be better.</li>
      <li>B00008MOQN Maybelline Great Lash Waterproof Mascara, Very Black- .44 Fluid Ounce]], your eyelashes can look amazing.</li>
      <li>Was told this was a great product, I was very let down with it.  </li>
      <li>Goes on thick and made my eyelashes look beautiful</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly, but goes on easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. Coat the lashes first then put on mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to make lashes look fuller. I like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;ve been searching for years for this type of product. I was never satisfied with the quality of the ones I found in stores (name brands) and this is perfect. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> A really unique product on the market.  Makes your lashes look longer and thicker.  A bit pricey, but there&#x27;s nothing out there like it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!....threw away my eyelash curler that I have had for 20 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Mac&#x27;s lash primer for about 2 years before deciding to order this from Amazon. I knew the products would be similar, but I was still surprised at how nice smashbox&#x27;s version was. Yes you do need to devote time and energy to applying this because it is worth having. I have light colored, as well as thin, eyelashes and this product helps the mascara I put on top of it adhere better to the eyelashes. I would recommend this to another person, even if it&#x27;s just used for special occasions. I did expect it to be &#x27;clumpy&#x27; the first week or two of use, due to the fact that there is a lot of product in the tube.</li>
    <li> After seeing all the fantastic reviews for this product I ordered it. Unfortunately this is the worst primer I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s super clumpy and it was a mess every time I opened and closed the bottle. I would have to wash my hands and the bottle after each use because it went everywhere! The brush is not the best for a primer either- not enough bristles for this clumpy primer. Also I ran out of this primer within a couple weeks! It works as far as primers go, but for this price the quality should be better. I&#x27;ve switched to Lancome primer which has a great brush and isn&#x27;t a sticky mess like Smashbox.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried other brand name primers and none of them worked as promised. This one extends your lashes noticeably, widens them slightly and boy does it keep mascara on. I love it so much I&#x27;ve gave it out to a few friends as holiday gifts.</li>
    <li> ok, well if u are VERY patient and have time to do your mascara, then this product does work and will lengthen your lashes.The product is VERY VERY clumpy and u have to work on how to use it evenly.It also does run out.its not like mascara in how u can use it for months.your mascara also ends up clumpy on top of the conditioner, so u need to seperate them after.Overall, i wouldnt buy it again.</li>
    <li> Usually use Lancome primer, but thought I&#x27;d try this and see if I could save some money.  It&#x27;s okay, but I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> The priner seemed old, but that it had potential to be a great product. It also had a very weird smell to it that I was not expecting.</li>
    <li> Great primer for the eyelashes. It really lengthens once I put my mascara on and no flaking and lasts 12 hours or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of primers and this one&#x27;s the best. It really coats the lashes with a think layer of white - after that the mascara goes on like a dream.</li>
    <li> I have used better primers in the past. I feel as if at times it causes my mascara to clump more than it would normally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand in the past and feel this Smashbox product didn&#x27;t measure up.  I like Smashbox products and have been using them for years, but this one particular product allowed smudging after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I do not wear much makeup; a bit of concealer, mascara, and lip gloss does it for me. That being said, I want the best products to maximize the little bit of effort I am willing to put into my face every morning. I have tried every mascara out there, primers, and lash fibers. Smashbox lash primer is amazing. It makes a very noticeable difference in the look of whatever mascara you put on and provides all day flake free wear. Washing it off at the end of the day is a breeze, no makeup remover needed. The best benefit of this product is that my eyelashes are longer and healthier than ever before. I have tried eyelash extensions and did not enjoy the experience (expensive, time consuming, and itchy watery eyes resulting) although they looked good. Now, my lashes look as long and beautiful as they did with extensions, but they are my natural lashes. I will continue to use and recommend this product. It could not be easier to use and the results are wonderful. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used a lash primer before but it does give length to lashes and holds mascara very well.  I&#x27;d recommend this to add definitions to lashes!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly, but goes on easy. I had been using the Blinc brand one which is about the same price and contains more in volume, but wanted to try this one out because of the company, but I will definitely be switching back. You get more, it dries quicker.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the lash primer for 29.00 I thought I would have received two. But i only received one&#x27; if I would have know this I could of purchased this at ulta for 17.00. So this was not a deal, very disappointed</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SO MUCH! This is my favorite lash primer of all time and that&#x27;s the truth! My eyelashes are so stubby and short, that when I apply this, it makes my eyelashes SOO much longer. Plus, it looks natural! No one can tell if you are using primer, it just looks like you have naturally long lashes! Say good bye to those fake eye lashes of yours, they are not worth the money after using this product. The more primer you add to your lash, the bigger and more voluminous it will look. I recommended this to EVERYONE and this is a must-have product I cannot go a day without this! This is the only eye lash primer I will ever use anymore, the rest are ok but this one is great! Not to mention it also last all day! I have had no problems using this and I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> The Smashbox Lash Primer makes my mascara look much fuller and longer. I use the primer daily, it never clumps or flakes. Great product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my mascara from running and giving me raccoon eyes.  I also use a translucent powder to dab under my bottom lashes and on the tips of my top lashes to set mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noticeable, that when using this primer, I don&#x27;t have to apply as much mascara. When sometimes I would have 5 or even 6 coats, now only 3 is sufficient. It keeps my lashes separated, instead of clumping together, and while it keeps my mascara on well, it comes off easily when I wash off my makeup. I had originally tried Smashbox&#x27;s lid primer, and it&#x27;s fabulous with eyeshadow (it actually stays on until I wash it off!)</li>
    <li> Can be a bit &#x27;thick; sometimes, but the best primer that I have found!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice and thick. works well on my already long eye lashes so it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I thought my blue mascara would have came out more blue with the fact that it&#x27;s a white primer but maybe it&#x27;s just my blue mascara. Will try another brand of coloured mascara and see.</li>
    <li> Hmmm... what can I say about this product. Virtually nothing. It does nothing if you ask me. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes after using the product. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this primer. It makes unruly lashes sit well. I use it with lots of different mascara brands and it works well with them all.</li>
    <li> This lash primer really helps make lashes look longer and keeps mascara from drying and flaking all day long.  Love it and can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
    <li> Eh I was not impressed, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  I&#x27;m trying to stay away from animal tested, but this doesn&#x27;t compare to Lancome, or even Revlon.  :(  Was disappointed in this one.  Really wanted it to be better</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s plenty of product in the tube, unlike store bought brands I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s thick but not clumpy. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but honestly, the E.L.F. mascara primer is the BEST.</li>
    <li> Excelent lash primer!!! Make your lahes longer and the gel is not to hard or white. Youre not goning to have white lashes. This is perfect i love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months, and it is now by far my favorite thing in my makeup bag. It makes me look like I am wearing false eyelashes! Even with a cheap mascara like [[ASIN:B00008MOQN Maybelline Great Lash Waterproof Mascara, Very Black- .44 Fluid Ounce]], your eyelashes can look amazing. I honestly no longer buy any expensive mascaras. Who knew the whole time I was wasting money looking for the perfect mascara all I needed was a primer?! This product does take some getting use to, the first time I used it I was not thrilled. However, you just need to make sure the brush is not overly saturated with the product, scrap it gently along the rim of the tube to get the excess off. Then, I just build up the product on my lashes, I think where people are getting clumps is when they just put a lot of product on at once. Instead, you have to take a couple of seconds to build up the length and volume. Then, just let dry for 2-3 minutes, I just finish up the rest of my makeup, and apply whatever mascara you like. I would recommend this product to anybody. This is the first eyelash primer I have used, so I can&#x27;t really offer a comparison between Smashbox and say Too Faced or Tarte, or Urban Decay, but I can say that I don&#x27;t really feel the need to compare or look any further because I am completely satisfied with this product.  Also, as an added perk, my lashes have never looked better. I am thrilled with the results while wearing makeup, but I never expected it to have an effect on my lashes health in general. I have pretty long lashes, but now they are SO SO SO thick! It looks like I have 3xs the amount of lashes I did before I bought this, each individual hair is very thick and strong. I don&#x27;t think it has had much of an effect on my lashes length, but like I said I have long lashes to begin with.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked really well for me!! I have fairly long eyelashes, but they clump together so much so it&#x27;s difficult for me to put on mascara sometimes. This product was able to keep my eyelashes separated so then once I put on mascara, my lashes looked amazing!! It&#x27;s a really good price so I would recommend this to people who want to make their eyelashes even more amazing!</li>
    <li> I am one that will not be without a last primer.  I do not like eyelashes that look clumpy nor do I like having to put on extra coats of mascara.  With a primer the mascara works so much better.  To me primers make the mascara go on smoother and more efficiently for a more natural look.  This one works well.  It seems to work better after I had it a month or so because it thicken up somewhat.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this brand of lash liner.  I prefer the Clinique brand.  This brush isn&#x27;t as nice.  After this tube is finished, I will switch back to Clinique.</li>
    <li> The brush is so skinny, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply a useful amount. I have to say I like Urban Decay eyelash primer much better.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is plush (ha) and after you use the mascara, your eyelashes look so much thicker and longer. The Urban Decay brush will not fit into this primer, I tried, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> This stuff set my eyelashes so they don&#x27;t clump when putting on my mascara. It works great. It also makes for awesome white eyelashes too. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product really plumps your lashes--it&#x27;s unreal.  Buy it!  Such quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Great for building mascara with less mascara</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to try this product. Shipped quickly and a good price. Only bee using it a couple of days and cannot decide if it works or not !</li>
    <li> Was told this was a great product, I was very let down with it.  This product made my waterproof mascara non waterproof.  I could make my lashes look fuller and longer without the primer.  What use is a primer if it doesn&#x27;t make a good foundation?</li>
    <li> I bought a lash primer before this one and it worked so well so I thought I would buy another lash primer. It makes it so much more easier to put on mascara, it doesn&#x27;t clump up so much.</li>
    <li> I do like it - but I still  must use several coats of mascara - and from what I read of the reviews - that was not to be the case.  the seller did provide it on time and on spec</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing primer for your eye lashes.  It&#x27;s white so you can see what your adding before actually putting on your mascara.  It helps the mascara stick to the lashes and gives them body and length.  Now that I&#x27;ve found this product I won&#x27;t be without it...at home or away.  Trust me...this is wonderful...awesome!</li>
    <li> Color question is moot.  It&#x27;s white. You put mascara on top of primer. It does make lashes look thicker and longer.  There can be some flaking off during the day, but in general, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> its ok - haven&#x27;t found a better one that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune- maybe would buy it again, i&#x27;m not sure</li>
    <li> Every single mascara, no matter how expensive, smudges on me and leaves me with raccoon eyes an hour after applying it. I ordered this after doing some research and reading that a primer might help to stop that. I ordered it but didnt have high hopes as I thought I was doomed to be a raccoon forever...I received this and my first impression was that it wouldnt work as I could barely see it on my lashes but this thing WORKS! I am able to wear any mascara from the cheapest drugstore brand to the most expensive brand and NO SMUDGES!! I will never be without this!</li>
    <li> How disappointing it was.  By the time I would send it back and pay postage, it would have cost me even more, so I know that  I had to go to my regular cosmetic store and buy  primer. It was so dried out and old that the brush was even dry.</li>
    <li> Best lash primer there is, no flaking which is great. Helps my lashes look longer and fuller. My mascara stays on longer too.</li>
    <li> I do like it but it can be a little clumpy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after running out of my urban decay primer thinking all primers are pretty much the same, especially since this is a high-end brand, but I&#x27;m disappointed.  The consistency isn&#x27;t thick at all, and it takes several layers to even see it coating my lashes.  When I apply mascara, it doesn&#x27;t look any thicker than if I hadn&#x27;t used primer.  Definitely going back to urban decay.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this item to save herself a trip to the mall... she said she should have taken the time.  She said she would have traded her inconvenience for a product that was good.  If she puts on her mascara with and without primer, she should be able to tell the difference....she couldn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t make her mascara on her lower lashes lash any longer than usual.  So..skip this primer and go to the mall!</li>
    <li> This primer turns average lashes into fantastic lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes applying mascara much easier, and removing the mascara as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of using this product, I cannot go without. I get comments quite often on how nice and full my lashes look, and when people ask me what type of mascara I use, I tell them it&#x27;s not the mascara that does it, it&#x27;s the primer!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! I had never used a mascara primer before but i am so glad that I did and this brand dis amazing. My mascara never runs now!</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and made my eyelashes look beautiful</li>
    <li> if you have fine lashes like me this makes and cheap or fancy mascara make your eyelashes ten times longer</li>
    <li> I find that this product makes my eyelashes look MUCH better than they do without it.  This was recommended to me and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and years.  I&#x27;m sure there are other good ones out there, but why try to fix what&#x27;s not broken.  I love the thickness this primer gives.  Some products didn&#x27;t give enough primer on the brush.  This will give you a nice, thick coat and it lasts for months.</li>
    <li> The very best lash primer on the market.  My lashes are sparce and grow straight out.  This makes my lashes appear much thicker and helps them to curl like they used to when I younger.  This does not flake or wear off during the course of the day, yet it comes of easily with soap and water or makeup remover.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Mary K lash primer is better</li>
    <li> I love this primer and it dries fairly quickly and coats all of the lashes, while some other primers don&#x27;t. It makes my eyelashes look so much longer after I put myascsra on!</li>
    <li> Lancôme is my favorite primer. This will do in a package</li>
    <li> Thick product, not as dramatic as I expected.</li>
    <li> When I first received the product in the mail, the packaging was not the best and I was a bit wary. I emailed the seller about this and he ensured me this product was authentic. Today was my first day using the product, and let me tell you, it works amazing! I wear mascara all day, everyday and I also work in a very hot environment so by the end of the day my mascara usually smudges down. When I came home today, I was surprised to see that nothing had smudge. It looked just as if I had just applied my makeup. If you are thinking about buying this product, you should! It works amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a good product in that it helps to make your mascara stay on better and gives your lashes a fuller effect and I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I expected the product to make my eye lashes appear thicker/fuller. It does minimally but not nearly as good as some other products I&#x27;ve used. Won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this lash primer.  I have tried a lot of lash primer in my time and this is by far the best I have ever used.  This is a must have for me!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I am a 42 year old female who has long but thin eyelashes.  Despite their length, they never look full even after putting three coats of mascara on them.  I originally bought this product in Sephora - had never used a lash primer before bought thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  It makes your lashes thicker, preparing them for the mascara.  Basically, you put this on just like you do mascara - the wand and tube look and work exactly like a tube of mascara.  It is white but don&#x27;t worry - you will never see it after you put the mascara on.  You let this dry for about a minute, and then put your mascara on like you would normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used this, I now only need one coat of mascara (instead of 3) and my eyelashes look much thicker and fuller.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it makes your mascara last any longer - but certainly makes your eyes look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use mascara without using this first.  I have been using this product for 3 years now and I love it.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I use it before putting on my mascara.  I&#x27;m not sure if my lashes are growing, but it does not cake up, and hopefully it will in the future help my lashes ot grow.</li>
