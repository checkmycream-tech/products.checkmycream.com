      <li>Great blades, effective and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>feels good man:)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have also tried Dorco and Astra blades those did not feel as good as the 7 O&#x27;clock blade plus with the Dorco blades</li>
      <li>but the feather blades don&#x27;t feel as good as the 7 O&#x27;clock blades do.</li>
      <li>But they ae both good.</li>
      <li>and he loved them..</li>
      <li>These razors are amazing</li>
      <li>But, too each his own.</li>
      <li>It was good to be able to find this product.</li>
      <li>A great blade and well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I find that the feather blades are the best as far as the closest shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;Considering that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted, I ended up being pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>For me, the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Stainless (made in Russia) blades are the perfect balance for my shaves.</li>
      <li>What blade to use is all a matter of personal preference, but for me the 7 o&#x27;clocks give me the best shave with the fewest nicks out of the blades I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I would use these over all others and more and more I do.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>There are better blades out there</li>
      <li>Will gladly suggest to anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the description to make sure you&#x27;re getting the blades that you want.</li>
      <li>Out of those, the Gilette were my favorite.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, I also nicked myself once every time I used the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For reference, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89L. Blades are a very personal choice, but for me, these are perfect.</li>
      <li>And make sure to get these blades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did not get rid of them.</li>
      <li>have tried several type of razors and found these to be the best for my skin/beard.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good blades.  </li>
      <li>This is the second time I ordered these blades, hoping to get the ones in the description which are &amp;#34;Super Stainless&amp;#34;, Made in Russia and are of a good quality and provide a good shave.</li>
      <li>blade would work great if your skin is not too sensitive</li>
      <li>and it is not as easy to nick or cut yourself.</li>
      <li>Good blades at a decent price.</li>
      <li>I purchased these from Super Safety Razor and love them.</li>
      <li>However, most of the blades are excellent, and the price is hard to beat.</li>
      <li>I tug and pull with them in a Merkur 23C LH and can never get an irritation free shave.</li>
      <li>He is hispanic with relatively course hair and they do a great job in his safety razor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great way to avoid a second mortgage just to buy disposable cartridges.  </li>
      <li>The company that filled the order was &amp;#34;Skin Companion&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>great product; i buy regularly</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good thing for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>For my particular face, fair somewhat sensitive skin, course red beard, these work the best out of what I have tried.  </li>
      <li>This one gave me the most consistent shave without irritation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The first pass did not seem to remove any hair, thus I had to change my technique, resulting in many nicks, a shave that was not that close, and</li>
      <li>These are not the sharpest blades -- they are reasonably smooth -- so they pair really well with a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razor.</li>
      <li>I tried about 10-15 out of a sampler pack and after these I tried one or two more, realized these were by far my favorite and here</li>
      <li>I personally feel that even if the first shave isn&#x27;t as good the fact that I can get 3 pretty nice shaves out of a blade makes up for it.</li>
      <li>I get a super close, super comfortable shave with no irritation and no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Everything arrived as expected and in great condition.</li>
      <li>and some not so good that I thought were going to be good,(7&#x27;0 Clock) and several others in between.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wanted to purchase these razors, I did as any good American should, and clicked on the sellers to find the cheapest price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really good option if you don&#x27;t want to spend big on blades.</li>
      <li>For a good low cost option, these are worth a try.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Super Stainless\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>O&#x27;clock stainless give a nice balance, and are my personal favorite brand of razors.</li>
      <li>My beard grows fast enough that with these razors I find myself having to shave against the grain every day, but there is no razor burn and feel nice and smooth every morning.</li>
      <li>and I rarely ever experience razor burn using these blades (and</li>
      <li>These give the most comfortable shave and last longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Upping this review to three stars for their success with a slant head razor.</li>
      <li>Blades work great and are priced right so they can be disposed after using a few times.</li>
      <li>Shaving sucks, but life is good!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking at the box right now</li>
      <li>and I got the right</li>
      <li>You will not get Super Stainless blades, you will get cheap inferior Permasharp Stainless Blades.</li>
      <li>I am glad I was able to find this product at Amazon as I could not locate double edge blades at any of the stores near my home.</li>
      <li>about 3 shaves out of a blade which is something I can&#x27;t do with most of the others, although the first shave isn&#x27;t as nice as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>The product listed is the Super Stainless blades made in Russia.  </li>
      <li>These are great blades, second only to wilkinson IMO.</li>
      <li>I personally think these blades are just as good as the old platinum coated blades you could buy in the 80s.</li>
      <li>These are listed as 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless, Made in Russia.</li>
      <li>(Super Stainless manufactured in Russia) and</li>
      <li>It says these are Super Stainless, which are from Russia.</li>
      <li>With DE Blades it is very much a preference thing, and what works for me, may not work for you.</li>
      <li>I bought some trial packs of blades and ultimately fell in love with the Gillette 7o&#x27;clock Super Stainless blades.</li>
      <li>All the little razor boxes were in good shape.</li>
      <li>have since tried a second blade, and works much better.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll  be in luxury and save yourself a pretty penny over time.</li>
      <li>I use a hot soap lather and these blades work much better with that than they do with traditional shaving cream in my opinion.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I also got the Permasharp blades made in India, which are of lesser quality than the ones made in Russia. The company that filled the order was &amp;#34;Skin Companion&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> great product; i buy regularly</li>
    <li> Bargain, quality razor blades.  3 years ago I got tired of the razors with 3,4 or more blades and decided to go back to the razor of my dad.  I ordered an old fashioned safety razor on amazon,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bargain solution for shaving, but it is not really about money.  The multiple bladed razors did a poor job of shaving my upper lip and close around the base of my nose (you may have different issues,with the newer razors)  Those touchy areas were not an issue with the safety razor and the shave was just as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are super sharp, and take a little getting use to, but once you get the hang of a &amp;#34;light touch&amp;#34;, you should do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 blades lasted me at least 3 years, not bad for seventeen dollars in blades</li>
    <li> Amazing value, and great blades! Everything arrived as expected and in great condition. These blades, after trying them out via a sampler pack, seem to be the best compromise between close shave/less irritation for me. So all in all, I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Having tough facial hair and sensitive skin, I have never found consistent success with these. I tug and pull with them in a Merkur 23C LH and can never get an irritation free shave. Thinking these would be comparable to the Yellow Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock SharpEdge blades in sharpness, I bought a 100 pack and I&#x27;m stuck with about 85 of them. Leaning toward just getting rid of them. But again, different blades work for different men: this is just my experience. ADDENDUM: I now only use these in my recently acquired Merkur 37 Slant and they work like a charm. These are not the sharpest blades -- they are reasonably smooth -- so they pair really well with a more &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; razor. I&#x27;m so glad I did not get rid of them. Upping this review to three stars for their success with a slant head razor. I just don&#x27;t plan to use them with my 23C again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good blades.  I tried one in a Merkur razor, and I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the blade, but when I put it in a 1980s, made in USA  Gillette Superspeed, I can get 5 days of excellent shaving.  I guess it has a lot to do with blade angle in the razor, rather than technique.  I personally think these blades are just as good as the old platinum coated blades you could buy in the 80s.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item specifically because the listing says it&#x27;s made in Russia. I&#x27;m looking at the box right now and it says it&#x27;s from India. I also ordered this on June 29th and received it on August 5th. That&#x27;s a LONG time to finally receive the wrong items.</li>
    <li> Much smoother than derby&#x27;s or Astras, though not quite as sharp as Feather. Only four stars, because occasionally an inferior blade crops up in a pack, which makes me question the quality control. However, most of the blades are excellent, and the price is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> The product listed is the Super Stainless blades made in Russia.  The ones I, and apparently others, received are the Permasharp blades made in India.  I don&#x27;t know if one is &#x27;better&#x27; than the other, but they are certainly different.  Different blades perform differently for different people and razors, so getting the right blade is important.</li>
    <li> Blades are a personal preference, and I recommend a sampler pack if you need to choose one. I tried about 10-15 out of a sampler pack and after these I tried one or two more, realized these were by far my favorite and here I am.  For my particular face, fair somewhat sensitive skin, course red beard, these work the best out of what I have tried.  I read another review with a person with a similar skin and hair, so maybe this is the type of face that these are made for.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. Used daily to keep a well groomed look. Will gladly suggest to anyone looking for a close shave.</li>
    <li> The ones I received were the ones made in Russia, not India.  I agree with others the Feathers are too sharp.  These are good quality blades and an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Blades work great and are priced right so they can be disposed after using a few times. if you like to keep em new and sharp i would defiantly recommend these for you</li>
    <li> Arrived exactly as described. 100 blades in a retail pack. This 100 pack is perfect for my beau&#x27;s needs ... Even the best blades dull after a few uses, and these usually last him 3-5 shaves (1 week)... He is hispanic with relatively course hair and they do a great job in his safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a lot of reviews out there that complain about how these razors only last a few shaves... but that&#x27;s pretty standard, folks!</li>
    <li> Blades arrived on time and were the russian version as advertised.  They shave very smoothly with little to no irritation. Not as aggressive as astra or bic. I can normally get about three, two pass shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product. I am glad I was able to find this product at Amazon as I could not locate double edge blades at any of the stores near my home.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re trying to avoid the Indian blades / incorrect product, know that &amp;#34;Super Safety Razors&amp;#34; has the blades manufactured in Russia.</li>
    <li> They worked the best.  Even better than the more expensive ones. They don&#x27;t shave as close as the straight edge but it&#x27;s a good thing for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Before settling on this blade, I had sampled a wide variety of blades, then re-sampled the top 4.  This one gave me the most consistent shave without irritation.  Feather, Derby, and Crystal blades were sharp, but always seemed to leave me with little nicks or irritated patches, and were uncomfortable when shaving against the grain.  The Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock yellow was good, but did not leave as smooth a face as these green.  That said, experiment since blade performance and preference seems to vary greatly by individual and the razor used.  I use my blades in an Edwin Jagger DE89.</li>
    <li> These blades are awesome. I&#x27;ve tried the Derbys and they&#x27;re okay, but a little too dull for my taste. After reading reviews on the Astra Platinums, I ordered and gave those a try. Every time I would shave I definitely cut myself and it just felt harsh on my skin. After going to my local barbershop I saw that he had a pack of these Gillette 7 O&#x27;clocks so I gave them a try. Just the right sharpness for a smooth shave with barely any nicks. But, too each his own. What works for me may not work for someone else. I would recommend someone new like I am to get a sampler back. Or if your local barbershop sales DE razor blades, purchase several different ones and see which works for you best.</li>
    <li> Beware! This is a SCAM! You will not get Super Stainless blades, you will get cheap inferior Permasharp Stainless Blades. This is the second time I ordered these blades, hoping to get the ones in the description which are &amp;#34;Super Stainless&amp;#34;, Made in Russia and are of a good quality and provide a good shave. The blades they send are the &amp;#34;Permasharp Stainless&amp;#34;, made in india, which are inferior blades and only provide a mediocre shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they are both green box Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades, the seller is hoping you don&#x27;t notice or are too stupid to realize they are different or that you wont go through the time and trouble to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept them a year ago and lived with a mediocre shave, I am not doing this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCAM! SCAM! SCAM!</li>
    <li> Good for two shaves then they hurt. Thought I would try them because I have russian blood, all they did was shed my blood. Back to BIC.</li>
    <li> Great Value. Excellent blade!!!</li>
    <li> There are two types of Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock in the green box.  One version is what is advertised here (Super Stainless manufactured in Russia) and the other is \\&quot;Permasharp\\&quot; and it is manufactured in India.  They are not the same quality and should not be thought of as interchangeable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, if a seller has a product to sell that says \\&quot;Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock,\\&quot; Amazon just uses the same product posting information and doesn&#x27;t require the seller to post photos of their actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wanted to purchase these razors, I did as any good American should, and clicked on the sellers to find the cheapest price.  Unfortunately, I chose to purchase from a seller (Mangup) that fulfills their own orders.  Much to my disappointment, I received the poorer quality \\&quot;Permasharp\\&quot; razors from India and not the advertised \\&quot;Super Stainless\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, lesson learned.  I placed a second order for these razors and selected a seller that fulfilled through Amazon and I got the right product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several type of razors and found these to be the best for my skin/beard.  I would highly recommend them, but suggest you purchase them from a seller that ships from Amazon.</li>
    <li> my husband likes these blades along with the Parker26C razor which was also ordered</li>
    <li> tahe blades I received are not what I expected, and certainly not the same as what I used to get.  these&lt;br /&gt;blades are thinner and not as sharp and of lesser quality.</li>
    <li> These are listed as 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless, Made in Russia. When you get your order, you will receive 7 O&#x27;Clock Permasharp, Made in India.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to the seller to complain, as I had read that the Permasharp blades were not in the same league as the Super Stainless blades. I felt the seller handled the situation fairly, so I tried the blades. They&#x27;re awesome - I get a super close, super comfortable shave with no irritation and no nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted, I ended up being pretty happy with this purchase. Be aware, but don&#x27;t expect to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was good to be able to find this product. My husband has used Gillette for years but could not find in stores with the stainless steel. He was happy to get this package</li>
    <li> These razors are amazing</li>
    <li> Love these razors!! However when the description reads 100 I expected to receive 100 blades... not 15.  This has happened twice, I figured the first time was only a simple mistake. However when the second package arrived 2 days later with only 3 little 5 packs in it I realized that this wasnt the company I should be dealing with.</li>
    <li> It says these are Super Stainless, which are from Russia. Instead, I got Indian Permasharp. Different blades. IMHO, the Indian blades are inferior. Find another vendor.</li>
    <li> These are the from the St. Petersberg Gillette factory and very sharp and comfortable.  A great blade and well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Great way to avoid a second mortgage just to buy disposable cartridges.  As far a sharpness goes, they are a great middle ground between aggressive/sharp and less aggressive.</li>
    <li> For me, the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Super Stainless (made in Russia) blades are the perfect balance for my shaves. I have very coarse facial hair, and fairly sensitive skin. Using the cartridge blades like Fusion or Mach 3 give me too much irritation and razor burn, so just about any double edge safety razor blade gives me a better, less irritating shave. I got a sampler pack of a few different types of blades, but I found some of the popular cheaper blades like Derby just pulled at my whiskers more than anything else. The ultra sharp Feathers on the other hand were a bit harsh on my skin. Then after trying several other brands but not being satisfied, I tried these blades, and it was like a match made in heaven. They&#x27;re sharp enough to cut smoothly through my thick coarse whiskers, but gentle enough that my skin doesn&#x27;t get overly irritated or nicked like with the Feathers. For reference, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89L. Blades are a very personal choice, but for me, these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I ventured into the world of DE shaving this past September. I bought some trial packs of blades and ultimately fell in love with the Gillette 7o&#x27;clock Super Stainless blades. These blades work well with my beard/skin type and I rarely ever experience razor burn using these blades (and if I do, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m hurrying, or pushing instead of letting it glide and do its job) I have it paired with an Edwin Jaggar razor and a Van Der Hagen shave set I also bought here on Amazon.  My suggestion, before buying blades in bulk, is to spend a little in a multi-pack or trial pack first, try the different blades, and find one you like from there. With DE Blades it is very much a preference thing, and what works for me, may not work for you.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I decided on these after using trial/samples of a multitude of different blades. Make sure you read the description to make sure you&#x27;re getting the blades that you want. (My purchase was from the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Super Safety Razor and love them. I would use these over all others and more and more I do. They are as sharp as yellow super sharps and if possible a bit smoother. I have over 1000 blades and these 100 will be the first to go. And they were only about 15 cents each. Shaving sucks, but life is good!</li>
    <li> These are great blades, second only to wilkinson IMO.</li>
    <li> These were advertised as &amp;#34;Super Stainless made in Russia&amp;#34;. The seller obviously needs to be investigated because they sent me PERMASHARPS made in INDIA. The blades are ok and it seems like I&#x27;ll be averaging about 3 shaves for blade (I have stubborn Eastern Bloc European facial hair and need to give about 3 passes, same for cartridge blades but this is wayyyyyy cheaper). No nicks, no irritation, decent life, but the bottom line is that the seller is SHADY and is falsely advertising what they are selling compared to what they are shipping.</li>
    <li> Good blades at a decent price. I like the Russian ones a bit better than the Indian ones. But they ae both good. The Russian blades are green and marked Super Stainless, the Indian say Permasharp otherwise the packagein is the same.</li>
    <li> Love these razors, they work awesome on my face. I prefer them over the Gillette Platinum as well as others like Feather, Derby, Astra.</li>
    <li> No need to shop around further. These give the most comfortable shave and last longer than any blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Not quite India sharp but then again I lack technique.  Wall display w/ only 5 packs. Strop on palm of hand.</li>
    <li> For my beard nothing beats the 7 O&#x27;clock Super Stainless Double Edge Safety Razor Blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 blades arrived in packaging designed for display in a barber shop. All the little razor boxes were in good shape. No complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this purchase I&#x27;m set for the next couple of years.</li>
    <li> Great blades, effective and inexpensive. Recommended.</li>
    <li> After trying a number of razors, I found these blades to be the best mix of sharpness and forgiveness for my face. Sharp enough for a good shave, but not so sharp that I cut up the sensitive areas of my face. My beard grows fast enough that with these razors I find myself having to shave against the grain every day, but there is no razor burn and feel nice and smooth every morning.</li>
    <li> What blade to use is all a matter of personal preference, but for me the 7 o&#x27;clocks give me the best shave with the fewest nicks out of the blades I have tried.  I purchased a sampler pack from Amazon which included Blue Bird, Feather, Bic, and these Gilette 7 o&#x27;clocks.  Out of those, the Gilette were my favorite.  This order of 100 arrived promptly and were made in Russia as advertised.</li>
    <li> I recently got into wet shaving with Double Edge Blades after 20 years of using other Gillette products for a couple of decades. These blades feel great on my face and like others have said the 7 O&#x27;clock blades are forgiving and it is not as easy to nick or cut yourself. I have tried the Shark blades and I hated those blades. I have also tried Dorco and Astra blades those did not feel as good as the 7 O&#x27;clock blade plus with the Dorco blades I had to make several passes which irritated my skin and I got razor burns. The only challenge I have with these blades is I have a very coarse and thick beard, I dull these blades fairly quick and it although I can get a close shave... I find that the feather blades are the best as far as the closest shave but the feather blades don&#x27;t feel as good as the 7 O&#x27;clock blades do. I will probably end up ordering both blades.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as 7 O&#x27;clock yellows or blacks, but still very smooth shaves. I pair this blade up with my Merkur 37c slant bar and I have had excellent, effortless shaves. This blade is in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Derby razors are too dull, and give me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather razors are too sharp and give me tons of nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 O&#x27;clock stainless give a nice balance, and are my personal favorite brand of razors.</li>
    <li> I got these as part of a sampler pack ([[ASIN:B002Z6YXIW 125 BEST Blade Sampler FEATHER SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD NACET BIC LORD 7 O&#x27;Clock]]) I used them in my Merkur 180 ([[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Time I use these blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first pass did not seem to remove any hair, thus I had to change my technique, resulting in many nicks, a shave that was not that close, and a razor burn that lasted until the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looked as the blade was just a bit smaller than other blades,I have used.  Being further back behind the razor&#x27;s bar which I had to compensate for, by changing my normal shave angle and pressure. Maybe the combination blade and razor does not work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought the sampler, I have found some great blades I did not expect ([[ASIN:B009CCFW14 TRIG Silver Edge Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100)]]) and some not so good that I thought were going to be good,(7&#x27;0 Clock) and several others in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6/28/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried a second blade, and works much better. I found these sharp and close shave with minimal irritation,nicks or burn. Not sure what happen with the first blade, probably operator error. Still like the Trig blades better, though these are a close second.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e tried a few other blades, all purchased here on Amazon.  For a good low cost option, these are worth a try.  The blades are sharp and and last a few shaves, I would buy again, but there are still a few brands I will try later after I finish the 100 count this package comes with.  The only downside is the cheap cardboard boxes the blades are packaged in.  A few have opened up on their own and the blades fall out, even though they are still packaged in wax paper, in my toilet kit they are all loose.  They come from the supplier on a clip strip for a retail store, just like you bought the whole clip strip, about three feet long.</li>
    <li> I know this is just a personal opinion... I have been shaving with double edges for 25 years now.. I decided to try these out and for some reason i just could not get a close enough shave...  I had a buddy of mine try them out and he loved them.. I ended up giving them to him... Maybe he should be the one reviewing these!!</li>
    <li> Are you tired of spending tons of money on disposable cartridges? Do  you get razor burn from having to push the cartridge so hard against your skin to get an even shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then go old school with a safety razor and brush. And make sure to get these blades. They will slide over your skin and after 2-3 passes you have a cleaner, smoother shave than any cartridge can promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is now an experience for me and my wife loves the scent of my Taylor of Old Bond Street Jermyn Street soap. You also cannot go wrong with the St James scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do yourself a favor and shave like your grandpa shaved... you&#x27;ll  be in luxury and save yourself a pretty penny over time.</li>
    <li> Very good just what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I tried 2 of these blades, got them in a variety pack for my first DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin and tend to get irritation, so take that into account here. I did get a very close shave, one of the closest I have had, however these blades gave me pretty bad irritation/razor burn and ingrown hairs. On top of that, I also nicked myself once every time I used the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blade would work great if your skin is not too sensitive and you want a close shave. No go for me though.</li>
    <li> Perfect sharpness! Much better than anything we can find at the big box stores!</li>
    <li> There are better blades out there but I keep coming back to these because the consistency and price can&#x27;t be beat. I get about 3 shaves out of a blade which is something I can&#x27;t do with most of the others, although the first shave isn&#x27;t as nice as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used. I personally feel that even if the first shave isn&#x27;t as good the fact that I can get 3 pretty nice shaves out of a blade makes up for it. I use a hot soap lather and these blades work much better with that than they do with traditional shaving cream in my opinion. It&#x27;s a really good option if you don&#x27;t want to spend big on blades.</li>
    <li> Update: Still using this blade and since I wrote the review below I am convinced this is a replica/new issue of the Spoiler of old!  Otherwise; after trying a dozen different blades I&#x27;ve settled on three Gillette blades for my rotation: Super Sharp, Platinum (Black Ninja&#x27;s) and the green pack 7 0&#x27;Clock Super Stainless. Like the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s I&#x27;m a Gillette D/E man again...feels good man:)&lt;br /&gt;To keep it short; I was buzzing around my face using these blades in both a Merkur 34C and a 1981 Gillette Adjustable Black Beauty like I was using a Mach 3!  No cuts/nicks/razor burn at all, shaved with the grain and then re-lathered and shaved against the grain with a couple of touch ups and done! Just like the old Spoiler blade Gillette used to have it&#x27;s a very forgiving blade, sharp but forgiving.  An excellent blade for new wet shavers and old guys like me that remember the Spoiler and don&#x27;t mind a little touch up in exchange for a gentle shave.</li>
