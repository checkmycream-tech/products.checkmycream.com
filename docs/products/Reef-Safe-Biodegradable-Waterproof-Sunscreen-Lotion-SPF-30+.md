      <li>I love how I can protect myself and protect our ocean as well.</li>

      <li>I love this sunscreen because it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and is ocean safe</li>
      <li>To determine the impact of its sun care products on coral reefs, Reef Safe engaged the world-renown Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to test the toxicity of Reef Safe’s formulations, containing varying levels of sunscreen actives, including oxybenzone, on corals representative of inshore and offshore habitats.</li>
      <li>I was glad I could order it online instead of drive all over the place to find it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and rubs on easily.  </li>
      <li>and it went on smoothly and stayed.</li>
      <li>not only did it stay on, its biodegradable- which makes me happy.</li>
      <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a water-fresh, super-light spf (albeit one with chemical blockers), this is a fabulous choice.</li>
      <li>A true gem of a spf find.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really inexpensive compared to so many sunscreen products out there.  </li>
      <li>This product was very easy to rub into my skin as to not leave white streaks.</li>
      <li>I took this sunscreen because at the Xel Ha park you need to use biodegradable reef safe sunscreen but upon showing the sunscreen to the attendant at the entrance was informed that the product was not considered reef safe due to a couple of ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>All tanks were placed in the laboratory’s temperature controlled raceway and supplied filtered seawater at a temperature of 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit under natural light conditions.</li>
      <li>Ok so it&#x27;s not a physical (reef-safe) sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Reef Safe sunscreens were subjected to a comprehensive series of independent laboratory tests to support and authenticate the biodegradability of the lotions.</li>
      <li>They did thankfully give me a couple packets of proper reef safe sunscreen to use for the day.</li>
      <li>Safe™ SunCare    Reef Safe SunCare, was introduced in 1996 by Tropical Seas of Ormond Beach, FL, as a sunscreen scientifically proven to biodegrade in oceans, lakes and rivers; thus protecting fragile ecosystems while protecting skin.</li>
      <li>(.050) observed at any level of exposure of test fragments relative to controls, therefore proving the safety of Reef Safe SunCare products on these corals.    </li>
      <li>Research findings concluded Reef Safe formulas showed no visual signs of stress, bleaching or mortality to corals at any level of sunscreen treatments over periods 24 hours, 96 hours and 20 days.    </li>
      <li>Further testing included simulating snorkel boats with equivalent of 2,984 snorkelers wearing Reef Safe formulas battering the reef twice a day.”    </li>
      <li>The makers of this deceptive product should be ashamed of themselves for branding a product as reef safe when it&#x27;s the exact opposite.</li>
      <li>Reef Safe is Harmless to Corals and Causes No Visual Impact</li>
      <li>It was more fluid than I&#x27;m used to, and it took a little more effort to rub it in.</li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>fast shiping</li>
      <li>“This test was designed to simulate conditions found at coral reef sites impacted by large volumes of bathers, snorkelers and scuba divers, all using Reef Safe formulated sunscreens, which includes oxybenzone as one of the active ingredients.</li>
      <li>so I will stick with this one as long as its available.</li>
      <li>Research also found that Reef Safe’s waterproof formula allows less than three percent of the product to come off in water.    </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but this product didn&#x27;t work as well as my normal sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The price was right and we would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>Since we are from the Midwest, reef safe products are not easy to find.</li>
      <li>and we didn&#x27;t sunburn any more than we usually do while in Mexico.  </li>
      <li>I bought this not for reef but for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>A super liquidy, super thin, highly absorbent texture &#x3D; means low in fillers and thickening emulsifiers.</li>
      <li>The research found that Reef Safe SunCare products biodegrade, on average, less than 90 days in seawater and freshwater.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this sunscreen because it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and is ocean safe</li>
    <li> We had to have this for swimming with the dolphins and it worked great for all us.  Recommend multiple applications if you are going to be in the sun awhile.</li>
    <li> Our daughter had a school trip to Florida Keys in June. Since we are from the Midwest, reef safe products are not easy to find. We order the product and had it shipped next day for an extra $6 I believe.&lt;br /&gt;We received the product on time!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used the product while in Florida for the week per the instructions and it worked good!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We bought this to take to Cancun, Mexico with us. It works great and non-greasy, which is a bonus! We did a lot of swimming and snorkeling... not only did it stay on, its biodegradable- which makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reef Safe Sunscreens and sun care products for years! I am very fair skinned, and I never burn with this product.  This lotion does not sting my eyes like other sunscreens in the past have. The best part about this lotion is it is eco-friendly and non-toxic to all sealife. I love how I can protect myself and protect our ocean as well. They also list their testing on their website:    REEF SAFE™ SUNCARE PROVEN NON-TOXIC TO TESTED CORALS  **Study Conducted by Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory Reveals Reef Safe is Harmless to Corals and Causes No Visual Impact**    Ormond Beach, FL (March 2, 2016) To determine the impact of its sun care products on coral reefs, Reef Safe engaged the world-renown Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to test the toxicity of Reef Safe’s formulations, containing varying levels of sunscreen actives, including oxybenzone, on corals representative of inshore and offshore habitats. Research findings concluded Reef Safe formulas showed no visual signs of stress, bleaching or mortality to corals at any level of sunscreen treatments over periods 24 hours, 96 hours and 20 days.    “Coral Reefs have been subjected to damage over the past decades, and one of the supposed contributing factors is the effect that sunscreen chemicals have on the health of corals,” commented Dan Knorr, President and C.E.O of Tropical Seas. “This test was designed to simulate conditions found at coral reef sites impacted by large volumes of bathers, snorkelers and scuba divers, all using Reef Safe formulated sunscreens, which includes oxybenzone as one of the active ingredients. However, with Reef Safe, it&#x27;s not just about the ingredients; it&#x27;s about how those ingredients are processed. Further testing included simulating snorkel boats with equivalent of 2,984 snorkelers wearing Reef Safe formulas battering the reef twice a day.”    All testing was conducted in the Mote Marine Tropical Research Laboratory to scientifically substantiate Reef Safe’s claim that their sunscreens do not harm corals. For the research, Mote Marine Laboratory tested Reef Safe’s SPF 50, SPF 45 and SPF 30 (no oxybenzone) formulas against a control setting with no product. Hard corals tested were representative of inshore and offshore habitats. Each of the coral fragments (100 each) were distributed equally between 20 tanks with five of each species in a given 20 liter aquarium. All tanks were placed in the laboratory’s temperature controlled raceway and supplied filtered seawater at a temperature of 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit under natural light conditions. Before starting the test, each fragment was visually inspected to evaluate the health of the corals, to be compared up to 20 days or the completion of the study. All corals were visually assessed using a coral health code established by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).    Each day before the sunscreen was added to the tanks, a condition survey was completed to note each individual coral&#x27;s health. Corals were ranked on a scale of 1-6 for tissue loss and color; 1 being no live tissue and 6 being no loss of tissue.    The test results revealed at the end of the 20 day study there were no mortalities and no significant difference (.050) observed at any level of exposure of test fragments relative to controls, therefore proving the safety of Reef Safe SunCare products on these corals.

    <li> great for every day use</li>
    <li> Reef Safe is a great sunscreen.  It is biodegradable - perfect for keeping the environment safe.  We found it easy to apply; it absorbs very nicely without clumping or leaving streaks.  We were Minnesota white and did not get a sunburn.  It was only necessary to reapply the sunscreen after we had been in the water a long time.  The price was right and we would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND YOURSELF.  THIS WORKS GREAT.  I BUY IT BY THE GALLONS!!</li>
    <li> The top  leaked and there was sunscreen all over the box.</li>
    <li> Ok so it&#x27;s not a physical (reef-safe) sunscreen. It&#x27;s got the chemical blockers. HOWEVER, the texture of this spf is just superb. A super liquidy, super thin, highly absorbent texture &#x3D; means low in fillers and thickening emulsifiers. Similar to the Japanese sunscreen textures, It&#x27;s so invisible in feel, that I applied 3 coats on my arms and no residue built up at all. It felt like nothing. no stickiness, no visible evidence of having applied &#x27;screen. wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate oily, greasy sunscreens and thick formulas that make you feel sticky. if you&#x27;re looking for a water-fresh, super-light spf (albeit one with chemical blockers), this is a fabulous choice. I&#x27;d compare it as even lighter than my LaRoche Posay&#x27;s Anthelios spf 50 (the european version). A true gem of a spf find.</li>
    <li> This is now the only sunblock that I use.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and rubs on easily.  It&#x27;s biodegradable so it&#x27;s not (as) bad for the fishies and other sealife.  And it provides sufficient SPF protection.  It&#x27;s also really inexpensive compared to so many sunscreen products out there.  I keep a bottle in my car, in my beach bag, in my camelback, and in my dive bag.</li>
    <li> Worked well on a sailing trip in the coral reefs off the coast of Florida!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and not greasy</li>
    <li> Had to use a biodegradable product when we swam with the dolphins in Mexico. It met out expectations in that regard as well as being an effective sun screen.</li>
    <li> Great,  just what we needed. Thanks,</li>
    <li> Read the article from PADI, the reputable Professional Association of Diving Instructors:  [...]    They list some ingredients that are harmful for coral reefs:    1) oxybenzone  2) butylparaben  3) octinoxate  4) 4-methylbenzylidine camphor    This product contains both oxybenzone and octinoxate.  The makers of this deceptive product should be ashamed of themselves for branding a product as reef safe when it&#x27;s the exact opposite.</li>
    <li> This product was very easy to rub into my skin as to not leave white streaks. This product also protected me from getting bunt by the sun but, also allowed me to get a tan.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. fast shiping</li>
    <li> It did what it was supposed to - no sunburn.  It was more fluid than I&#x27;m used to, and it took a little more effort to rub it in.</li>
    <li> i like the environment but this product didn&#x27;t work as well as my normal sunscreen.</li>
    <li> We used this on our trip first trip to Hawaii with all of us being very fair skinned. It was wonderful! we got great protection in and out of the water and it went on smoothly and stayed. We bought this from a recommendation from http://www.tropicalsnorkeling.com/best-snorkeling-sunscreen.html and they were spot on! We bought more for our 2nd trip this month to Hawaiian, it is the perfect sunscreen for swimming &amp; snorkeling.</li>
    <li> Great product, even for the hot and humid Cancun! Got a great tan and no peeling or sunburn. Excellent product knowing you&#x27;re saving the sea life as well.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed to learn that it won&#x27;t be accepted for trip to coral reef.  Has an ingredient that is not allowed.  The reason I purchased this expensive sunscreen was specifically for snorkeling the reef!</li>
    <li> i usually have an allergic reaction to off-the-shelf oil-based sunscreens and the brand name organic sun screens are usually so thick it&#x27;s like rubbing paint on your body. this sunscreen works great and applies well. highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this not for reef but for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. She and Myself are allergic to regular sun screams, even some physical sun blockers, but not to some biodegradable ones. We used to buy another biodegrade sun scream but that one became unavailable these days so I picked this one. It works well on our skin, doesn&#x27;t cause any unwanted reaction and prevent the sun burn. Its easier to apply than the other type of biodegradable so I will stick with this one as long as its available.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but do need to reapply often</li>
    <li> Great product! Bought it for the last 3 years for snorkeling in the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Took it to Mexico and didn&#x27;t need it.  I was glad I could order it online instead of drive all over the place to find it.</li>
    <li> Item as described and we didn&#x27;t sunburn any more than we usually do while in Mexico.  The container was a little smaller than I was expecting, so don&#x27;t expect the giant, bargain container.</li>
    <li> On a recent trip to mexico I took this sunscreen because at the Xel Ha park you need to use biodegradable reef safe sunscreen but upon showing the sunscreen to the attendant at the entrance was informed that the product was not considered reef safe due to a couple of ingredients in it.  They did thankfully give me a couple packets of proper reef safe sunscreen to use for the day. Don&#x27;t buy this product if going to an area where you need to use reef safe screen because this product is not.</li>
    <li> It it very thick and remains white even after it dries, but I use it when swimming in the coral reef....</li>
    <li> great product, reef safe, and NO BURN!!!!</li>
</ol>
