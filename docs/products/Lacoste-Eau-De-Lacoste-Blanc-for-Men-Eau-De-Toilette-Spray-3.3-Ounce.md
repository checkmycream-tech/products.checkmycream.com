      <li>I never found one scent that could even come close to how good this cologne is.</li>

      <li>New, on original package, perfect!</li>
      <li>I like the lemony perfume smell of LaCoste - better than Drakkar Noir.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend love it.</li>
      <li>Many compliments from the ladies.</li>
      <li>The fragrance has a hint of sweetness which can be overwhelming at times.  </li>
      <li>Love the fresh clean scent!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, I want to get that for my husband/boyfriend/dad, etc, etc, etc</li>
      <li>I absolutely love how this cologne for men smells, I love it so much</li>
      <li>cant tell which is the original</li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent - The smell is light and somewhat fruity/feminine (which the girls really like) but not over the top to the point where you cannot tell its for a man.</li>
      <li>but it smells very different from what I purchased sometime ago at a good retail store....</li>
      <li>Fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend first trying it at the store before buying it online.</li>
      <li>You can only really smell it when someone is in your personal space (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I decided I liked the white just a little bit better than the other, and I could not be happier with my choice.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Strength - It is not too strong where it overpowers a 50 ft. radius like some other brands.</li>
      <li>This one (original) and a limited edition summer version (has neon green/yellow around the gator).</li>
      <li>Great cologne and not too expensive.</li>
      <li>Gets plenty of compliments, and you will notice that the ladies hug you a bit longer than they normally would.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it too, and let me tell you her nose is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>Light, not overwhelming - even if you like to bathe in it.</li>
      <li>Christmas present for a high end male</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall - Before I ordered this from Amazon recently I had switched over to some other brands for about 8 months just to try something new.</li>

    <li> Smells terrible, just like an evergreen tree.</li>
    <li> very good. It is not an immitation.</li>
    <li> the best item, good price</li>
    <li> Like the fact that this cologne is not over-powering in any way, and lasts all day.  My wife loves it too, and let me tell you her nose is very sensitive. All around great scent and an extremely great price.</li>
    <li> Happened to get a few samples of this white one and also the black... I decided I liked the white just a little bit better than the other, and I could not be happier with my choice.  Perfect to wear to work without smelling up the whole place.  Gets plenty of compliments, and you will notice that the ladies hug you a bit longer than they normally would.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love it. Great perfume!</li>
    <li> Price was affordable and it smells great....my boyfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> Have smelled this at many retail stores - LOVE it! My husband LOVES it! I love that he loves it! Light, not overwhelming - even if you like to bathe in it. Fresh. Not chemically smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learned something about Lacoste Blanc - there are TWO VARIATIONS of BLANC! This one (original) and a limited edition summer version (has neon green/yellow around the gator). BOTH smell amazing!</li>
    <li> Was the same I expected</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my husband.  He gets a ton of compliments on it. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This scent is a scent of power. I get complements from women all the time when I wear this. One girl offered to take me home to be her bed candy just so her room will smell like me when she wake up. I dont know whats in this cologne but it work for ALL women when us men wear it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s mine!&lt;br /&gt;:-)&lt;br /&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this cologne for men smells, I love it so much I just can&#x27;t get enough of it. Price was super cheap compared to how it&#x27;s marked at the stores and it arrived in perfect conditions this is a perfect gift no questions asked.!!!! Totally worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my dad, i didn&#x27;t got to smell it, but he really liked the smell.</li>
    <li> GRACIAS POR EL PRODUCTO ES EXACTAMENTE LO QUE COMPRE BUEN DIA EXCELENTE</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVED IT!!</li>
    <li> Christmas present for a high end male and he liked the scent</li>
    <li> Highlights - This is the only cologne that I have ever worn where I have received multiple compliments and been asked, &amp;#34;What cologne are you wearing? It smells fantastic, I want to get that for my husband/boyfriend/dad, etc, etc, etc...&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength - It is not too strong where it overpowers a 50 ft. radius like some other brands. You can only really smell it when someone is in your personal space (which is a good thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - The smell is light and somewhat fruity/feminine (which the girls really like) but not over the top to the point where you cannot tell its for a man. This is definitely a man&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Before I ordered this from Amazon recently I had switched over to some other brands for about 8 months just to try something new. I never found one scent that could even come close to how good this cologne is. I guess you don&#x27;t realize how good it is until its gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Many compliments from the ladies. Great cologne and not too expensive. This is my second bottle. I also tried l&#x27;oriental white edition which is cheaper than this. I would recommend them both but if you have the money for this go ahead and buy it. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> New, on original package, perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the fresh clean scent! Not over bearing</li>
    <li> I like the lemony perfume smell of LaCoste - better than Drakkar Noir. Perfect product at an awesome price. Almost 50% off Macy&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> Really nice smell. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> The bottom of the plastic was not sealed and you can tell the box had been opened. For the price, the toilet water is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> its good but it smells very different from what I purchased sometime ago at a good retail store.... cant tell which is the original</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance, and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, he&#x27;s happy. Delivery was on time</li>
    <li> The fragrance has a hint of sweetness which can be overwhelming at times.  I&#x27;d recommend first trying it at the store before buying it online.</li>
