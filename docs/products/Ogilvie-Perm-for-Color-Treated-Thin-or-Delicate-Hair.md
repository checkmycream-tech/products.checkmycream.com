      <li>A silky perm that looks as good as salon perms for this prices is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I kinda like it to be honest</li>
      <li>I covered my head with rods, but not in the tidy rows in the directions.</li>

      <li>The instructions were very easy to follow.</li>

      <li>and I am always satisfied.  </li>
      <li>What went rng and what can I do now with 2 more that I certenly don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
      <li>but what ever.:)</li>
      <li>I have used this perm for many years but can no longer find it at Kmart or wal mart but love this perm</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Seemed to need more time.  </li>
      <li>Have been using your product for many years.</li>
      <li>Frizzy because that is ok with me.</li>
      <li>I have had many perms over the years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a great product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants an easy at home perm solution.</li>
      <li>This perm I have loved from the first day I had it done.</li>
      <li>I have used Ogilvie for years and it is easy to use and safe</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this many times and it always works well and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Also, it helps if you have someone who can assist in rolling hair, because one of the more important things about a perm is the rollers used and how well your hair is rolled.</li>
      <li>Also, I like this because the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as some I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t know what to do with baby fine hair, they never make me look like the model in the picture...</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t need the leave-in conditioner, as I use my own conditioners, Frizz-Eze and also use a mousse with conditioner in.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t overprocess my hair which is really important since I also color my hair.</li>
      <li>It was easy &amp; quick for my friend to do.</li>
      <li>This was easy to use and I ended with a nice soft curl.</li>
      <li>and i was excited</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t confuse this one with the Ogilvie Home Perm / The Original.</li>
      <li>Gives great body with soft curl &amp; leaves your hair in good condition, no frizz that I had with other perms.</li>
      <li>I am 78 years old, and still wanting to do my own perms ....</li>
      <li>This was also gentle for her to use after she had shingles that healed on her scalp--that&#x27;s how safe it seems to be.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for having what the stores don&#x27;t anymore. :)</li>
      <li>We have used several over the years wit good results.</li>
      <li>When I mixed the solution I knew the product was good because it did what it was suppoed to do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, even on the first try.  </li>
      <li>quickly and precisely the perm gave back the fullness and great soft curls ..</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair that has no body at all.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this for all ages, but if we&#x27;ve been using this for many years and still have full heads of hair, and if you can&#x27;t afford the high prices of a beauty salon, I highly recommend this perm!  </li>
      <li>This gave me more bounce, definition and curl than my naturally wavy hair.</li>
      <li>It says not to shampoo immediately after, but I would recommend a leave-in conditioner or hair serum to pamper those fresh waves or curls.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t mind the hassle of having my hair permed more often, because I actually like the results BETTER than most of the salon perms I&#x27;ve had in recent years</li>
      <li>(I used it for the waving lotion), but it&#x27;s nice to have extra on hand</li>
      <li>It produces just the right curl without frizziness.</li>
      <li>I prefer the preceisely right permanent because of the built-in timing.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I actually rolled up my own hair without help.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only perm I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have problems with, and it curls beautifully and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on my colored-treated hair.</li>
      <li>my 96-year old Mom also uses this (and we both have fine hair but lots of it).  </li>
      <li>This was my first time.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>The first one turned out so well, when it came time to give myself another perm, I checked to make sure to get exactly the same again.</li>
      <li>I know I will be buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>Really holds the curl!  </li>
      <li>When I first reviewed this my product hair was just below my shoulders, now it is a medium length bob.</li>
      <li>I do my own perms due to time restriction.</li>
      <li>The first time I did it, my hair was already really damaged and had a lot of split ends.</li>
      <li>Also, some perms emit such a strong ammonia that it can make your eyes water (like an onion).</li>
      <li>However, with the perm, using medium to large perm rods, my hair has body, curl and thickness.  </li>
      <li>this is the only perm for my fine colored hair.</li>
      <li>IT IS GENTLE ON HER HAIR.  </li>
      <li>Stores don&#x27;t carry home perms much anymore</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times and it always works well and is easy to use.  I have not been able to find it locally in the last few years.</li>
    <li> Great product for people with straight hair who want to keep some nice curls with a curling iron.  Really holds the curl!  It&#x27;s made with starch from potatoes, so it&#x27;s similar to starching a shirt, but doesn&#x27;t feel hard or stiff.</li>
    <li> I prefer the preceisely right permanent because of the built-in timing.  Can&#x27;t overprocess my hair which is really important since I also color my hair.</li>
    <li> Frizzy because that is ok with me. I have very very fine hair and it needs a perm twice a year. Frizzy gives me some thicker looking hair. Stores don&#x27;t carry home perms much anymore so ordering from Amazon has become necessary. I do my own perms because beauty shops drive me crazy. They don&#x27;t know what to do with baby fine hair, they never make me look like the model in the picture...lol, and they charge a lot of money for a scary look. I can do that for under $20.00 all by myself. I will be ordering another of these perms soon as it is almost time. Thanks Amazon for having what the stores don&#x27;t anymore. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Good product for my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this perm for many years but can no longer find it at Kmart or wal mart but love this perm</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it because there are no instructions or end papers at all. I have no idea how to use this or where to begin, so if someone can email me the instructions barstarry7@netzero.net , I can always go to a beauty store and get papers.  Or if someone can just give instructions here that would be great!  I have never given myself a perm before.  Otherwise its a useless kit.  Please help... :(</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin and have problems with perms burning your skin you might want to try this one. It&#x27;s the only perm I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have problems with, and it curls beautifully and lasts a long time. Don&#x27;t confuse this one with the Ogilvie Home Perm / The Original. The boxes look similar but they aren&#x27;t the same thing. The one I like is the one with the heat activator you mix with the waving lotion, the other one you don&#x27;t have to mix. I accidentally bought the other one once and it burned my skin like any other perm, and I wasn&#x27;t as happy with the curls, either.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing that when you can&#x27;t find a product you used to get in the stores because most of them have quit stocking that item but you can on Amazon. The wave turned out as good as it could and I&#x27;m happy with the way my hair turned out. Amazon Rocks!</li>
    <li> It is good, definitely better than the foam perm. I think that I will buy again. The curve becomes really wavy after a month or two</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 15 years and I am always satisfied.  I perm first and get a hair trim later.  I am always satisfied with the results and I have saved about $50 each time I do this myself.</li>
    <li> Perfect for colored hair, amazing product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this product. When my beautician went to give me the perm, the solution leaked out and only three quarters of the solution was left. By the time I realized it, the time to return it was up. Please examine everything when it arrives. I didn&#x27;t do that so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> this perm didnt work for me i ordered a foam perm and got this one it also made my hair frizzy</li>
    <li> It felt very soft until I washed it and then it began to be frizzy.  I had a haircut to take care of part of that.  I will try it again, just not leave it on as long as it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give myself a home perm. The first one turned out so well, when it came time to give myself another perm, I checked to make sure to get exactly the same again. The first time I did it, my hair was already really damaged and had a lot of split ends. I had about 3/4&amp;#34; of really fuzzy ends after the perm that had to be trimmed off, but I knew before I started the ends were in bad shape and was expecting this. After the second perm, I didn&#x27;t have to trim anything. The ends looked as good as the roots. I plan to keep buying this brand.</li>
    <li> I do my own perms due to time restriction. I need a good color safe one as I also do my own color. I have used Ogilvie for years and it is easy to use and safe, I have never had a problem with it. I would use no other</li>
    <li> I have always used Ogilvie home perms and have never been disappointed. To me these perms are always perfect .PERFECT</li>
    <li> I like this product as my hair is thick and color treated.  It produces just the right curl without frizziness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve given myself lots of perms. But this one, I did NOT like at all. I&#x27;ve got hair that did not get curled at all. I will NOT be buying this perm again.</li>
    <li> This was just like the home perms I remember from long ago. Same smell, even. Not hard to use, and I had no trouble with skin irritation. It took really well. I used this a month ago and still have plenty of curl. Hardest part is finding tiny rollers for short hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for do it yourself perm.  Everyone still states it must be nice to have natural curls and are shocked when I say it&#x27;s a perm and then even more so when I tell them I did it myself with Olgilvie.</li>
    <li> This is a good perm. It was easy &amp; quick for my friend to do. It is a curly perm that seems to hold up really good.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice with good results. The processing time is 20 minutes or less, depending on how your hair holds a curl. I have naturally wavy hair but the waves and curls are not very uniform. This gives me the amount of curl I want while still looking natural. I have used it twice and nobody has asked if I have had a perm.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just used this again, and seriously, even a klutz will get good results. I covered my head with rods, but not in the tidy rows in the directions. And thinking I remembered the process, I didn&#x27;t mix part A and B -- oops-- so I applied part B after part A and hoped it would still turn out okay.Still turned out great ! I also varied the rod size for a natural look. When I first reviewed this my product hair was just below my shoulders, now it is a medium length bob.This gave me more bounce, definition and curl than my naturally wavy hair.I used it for the minimum amount of processing time with good results ( 12 minutes). It says not to shampoo immediately after, but I would recommend a leave-in conditioner or hair serum to pamper those fresh waves or curls.</li>
    <li> I felt like anew person once I put the perm in my hair.  Got lots of body and made my hair much easier to style.</li>
    <li> Ogilve Precisely Right Perm for colored treated or fine hair was the best perm. I have had many perms over the years. This perm I have loved from the first day I had it done. I know I will be buying more in the future. I want to thank this company.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this product on-line because I was worried it might be out of date.  I cannot find this product anymore in any store.  I bought two of them, the ad said they were new.  When I mixed the solution I knew the product was good because it did what it was suppoed to do.  I am very satisfied with the product and happy I found it on line.</li>
    <li> This proved to be a great perm! Very gentle on my colored-treated hair. Didn&#x27;t burn my skin too badly. I would purchase this again! Sure saved me some money doing it myself, instead of at the salon!</li>
    <li> It was too expensive comparing with other products</li>
    <li> I have straight fine hair that has no body at all.  This permanent wave fixed that in no time at all.  I had my daughter do it for me and now have a carefree curly hairdo for the hot summer and doesn&#x27;t look like a wet dish rag.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review about the Color sensitive version....had no good results with that one.  So I tried the regular and had the same bad results.  I use the Toni Home Perms for over 40 years and had always had good results.  This does not compare to those and I am in a quandry as to what to try next. Wish I had better info to share.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this perm. Have been using your product for many years. This one diod not take at all, my hair hardle had any body or curl. The girl that gives them to me at home is a beautician. We have used several over the years wit good results. For the past couple years we have used the foam one and I thought this was what I was geting. It was not, but we went in and used it. I am 78 and my hair is salt and pepper and it is thin but not colored. What went rng and what can I do now with 2 more that I certenly don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
    <li> quickly and precisely the perm gave back the fullness and great soft curls ..this is the only perm for my fine colored hair.</li>
    <li> I have always used Oglive&#x27; perms, and they always turn out just the way I want them!  I don&#x27;t use anything but this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good product line!</li>
    <li> Gave myself this perm &amp; was so happy with it I ordered one for my friend &amp; she loved it too. Gives great body with soft curl &amp; leaves your hair in good condition, no frizz that I had with other perms.</li>
    <li> Seemed to need more time.  I think I will go have mine professionally done next time.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and have never been disappointed. Never causes any damage to my hair.  Stays in hair a long time.</li>
    <li> Way overpriced. Wish I had thought of Wal Mart instead.</li>
    <li> The product and transaction experience were both excellent.</li>
    <li> This was easy to use and I ended with a nice soft curl. Just what I wanted. The instructions were very easy to follow.</li>
    <li> I have permed my hair once a year for a lot of years. I have colored hair. This product damaged my hair. It was to harsh. I followed the instructions. I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and this product works just as well as any salon perm. Also, it helps if you have someone who can assist in rolling hair, because one of the more important things about a perm is the rollers used and how well your hair is rolled. Mess those up and your perm won&#x27;t look right, no matter the processor used. Also, I like this because the smell isn&#x27;t as strong as some I&#x27;ve used. Also, some perms emit such a strong ammonia that it can make your eyes water (like an onion). I didn&#x27;t get that with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used perms for non-treated hair less damaging! Not only did the perm barely work it damaged my hair very badly. Would not recommend and will not use again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perm for at least 5 years now.  Normally, my hair is stick straight and thin.  However, with the perm, using medium to large perm rods, my hair has body, curl and thickness.  Follow the directions closely and keep checking your hair for the desired curl.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is the best perm I have a sensitive scalp the perm took perfectly will defenatly order again. Real soon</li>
    <li> This was my first time. I had been sleeping foam curlers every night and it was very annoying having to put them in. I have very short straight hair. I followed the directions very carefully and got help from my mother. I was kinda disappointed with the outcome. I heard that perms usually give you really cute, tight curls and i was excited cause thats what my foam curlers do. The chemicals completely ruined my hair(which I was expecting) and left no curl. My hair is frizzy with a little bit of wave here and their. I kinda like it to be honest but it was not what i was going for. But my hair now does what i want it. When I use a curling iron it stays forever, like 2 days. So I&#x27;m probably not gonna use this again but what ever.:)</li>
    <li> This is the only perm I&#x27;ll use, but I prefer the perm that comes with a pre-conditioner and leave-in conditioner rather than the heat activated one.  I really don&#x27;t need the leave-in conditioner, as I use my own conditioners, Frizz-Eze and also use a mousse with conditioner in.  I never have breakage and the newer scent is great, though all perms do smell!  Notice also that this does not seem to fade my hair as others do.  I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and my 96-year old Mom also uses this (and we both have fine hair but lots of it).  This was also gentle for her to use after she had shingles that healed on her scalp--that&#x27;s how safe it seems to be.  I only time mine for 9 minutes - Mom for 20 minutes---we both get the results we like!  I recommend this for all ages, but if we&#x27;ve been using this for many years and still have full heads of hair, and if you can&#x27;t afford the high prices of a beauty salon, I highly recommend this perm!  Just hope they never discontinue this!</li>
    <li> Very pricey but hard to find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> THIS PERM WORKS WELL ON THE FRAIL, THIN, COLOR TREATED  HAIR OF THE ELDERLY PERSON FOR WHOM IT WAS PURCHASED.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS THE ONLY BRAND SHE CONSISTENTLY USES.  IT IS GENTLE ON HER HAIR.  A REPEAT PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled that I can now buy this product through Amazon!!!!!  I thought that foam perms had gone off the market completely since I could not find them in any stores.  I am 78 years old, and still wanting to do my own perms .... the foam ones are so much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> horrable didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> This perm stunk... it just made my hair frizzy and it didn&#x27;t even curl. Would not recommend it! Now I have to go to the hair salon and have my hair chopped off. I followed the directions to the T... even reading them 3 times to make sure I did it correctly!!!</li>
    <li> always a good perm, but difficult to do alone.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my hair except break it.  Followed all directions, even though there was confusing information. I have both fine hair and hard to curl hair, so I left it on for the maximum time allowed for fine hair, but it still is very damaged and without curl at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!! Excellent Seller!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2 or 3 times so far (I bought mine at the local drugstore, so I can&#x27;t comment on the particular seller).  It is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out hair like some salon perms do.  It&#x27;s quite gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, even on the first try.  The first time I used it, I actually rolled up my own hair without help.  While I don&#x27;t recommend that (because it&#x27;s really difficult to get all the rollers tight and to roll the back of your head), the perm actually turned out pretty well.  Other people would not have been able to tell that I did it myself except for maybe the fact that some curls were more relaxed than others (it was a subtle difference).  In other words, this perm is very difficult to mess up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price!  A silky perm that looks as good as salon perms for this prices is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons/Caveats:&lt;br /&gt;It may not last as long as a salon perm.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was just for me, but a salon perm usually lasts about 7 or 8 months for me, whereas this perm only lasts about 4 months.  But I don&#x27;t mind the hassle of having my hair permed more often, because I actually like the results BETTER than most of the salon perms I&#x27;ve had in recent years (and it saves me a good bit of money too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to buy some extra cotton to wrap around your hairline.  The box only includes enough to wrap once (I used it for the waving lotion), but it&#x27;s nice to have extra on hand so you can use clean dry cotton when applying the neutralizer.  You may also want to buy extra rolling papers.  There have been plenty in the box for the times I&#x27;ve rolled my hair, but there aren&#x27;t a lot of extras left when I&#x27;m done, and my hair is pretty thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more than enough solution in one box, at least for me (my hair is slightly longer than shoulder length but not very thick).  However if you have very long or very thick hair, you might need more than one box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#x27;t ever used a home perm,  you should also know that the you have to buy the perm rods separately.  This product only contains the waving lotion/solution, the neutralizer, cotton for your hairline, and rolling papers in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants an easy at home perm solution.</li>
    <li> Work nicely, gentle to color treated hair. I plan to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> like always my hair looks great</li>
    <li> I use this kit for years and like it. This one unfortunately arrived  with chemicals spilled all over the box</li>
    <li> This is the only perm I will trust for use on my color treated hair that is partly grey.  It really curls the hair and is long lasting.  I still have to be careful when I have let my hair grow longer and am repeating the perm over previously permed hair, you can cause frizzing if you leave it on too long.</li>
