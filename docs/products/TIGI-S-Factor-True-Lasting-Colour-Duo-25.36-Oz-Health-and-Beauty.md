    <li> Highly Disappointed!  Shipment arrived late. I did not receive the items pictured. The shampoo I received had a strange scent and was harsh on my hair.  The conditioner is a different consistency and smell than what I have purchased in the past.  The containers the products are in are very flimsy.  This does NOT appear to be an authentic TIGI product. It does not meet the typical quality and standards of a TIGI product that I have grown accustomed to. Will NOT purchase from this seller again.</li>
