      <li>Having a mirror in the shower to shave with or remove makeup, what a great idea.</li>

      <li>Received on time, great buy</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>It is hoped readers will find I was successful in accomplishing that.</li>
      <li>I would say a good inch.</li>
      <li>good news is that when it does fall off the wall, it doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Over all I would say this is a good product.</li>
      <li>reiterate, my intent with this review is to be fair to all prospective affected parties.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This could have been a good mirror</li>
      <li>Fair</li>
      <li>I ordered this mirror for my husband&#x27;s shower, and when I asked him how he liked it, he said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need a mirror to shave in the shower.&amp;#34;  The implication seemed to be that his method of shaving by feel could win a prize for machismo.  </li>
      <li>The mirror is foil which is a good thing, for safety reasons, so reviewers who took off for that were not being fair.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions on installing this mirror and for the first couple days it was great, but then at 3 a.m. the crash in our bathroom woke both of us up with a fright!  </li>
      <li>And it worked a lot better!</li>
      <li>the fog free feature works great.  </li>
      <li>kind of not so intelligent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mirror is really nice to have in the shower.  </li>
      <li>so there is a need to continually dump the cooled water out and refill with warm water from the shower</li>
      <li>When I ordered this through the amazon vine program in exchange for an honest review, I had no idea what the street price of this mirror was.  </li>
      <li>One fills this container with warm water from the shower to bring the mirror up to the temperature of the shower.  </li>
      <li>In order to be fogless, you have to fill the reservoir with warm water every time you get in the shower.</li>
      <li>The LED light seems to work well and is really bright.  </li>
      <li>It does not fog and the light is bright.</li>
      <li>Add a bright LED light</li>
      <li>My favorite have been the kind that don&#x27;t have a reservoir and retain heat for extended periods, keeping them from fogging up.</li>
      <li>These suction cups were not any better.  </li>
      <li>Mostly I don&#x27;t fill the reservoir, my husband does if he knows he has a lot of shaving to do that day.</li>
      <li>The light is handy.</li>
      <li>We gave it one more shot and</li>
      <li>But, I did expect more for $50.  </li>
      <li>this is an ok shower mirror.</li>
      <li>so you can see well in the shower, an even better idea.</li>
      <li>The thing that bothers me the most about this mirror is that the reflection is distorted.</li>
      <li>Then I might be able to accept most of it&#x27;s shortcomings.</li>
      <li>how cute it looks.</li>
      <li>Recommended for anyone who needs to be able to shave in the shower.</li>
      <li>They fit nicely so there are no problems there.</li>
      <li>The suction cups are nice and secure.</li>
      <li>are better.</li>
      <li>When washing my face I like to make sure that all of my makeup has come off and my boyfriend prefers shaving in the shower.</li>
      <li>Still is usable but without the handy light feature.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
      <li>This has been great so far and was very easy to set up.</li>
      <li>I asked him if he ever turned on the super bright LED light.  </li>
      <li>even if you don&#x27;t fill the reservoir, you can still wipe off the fog and get a pretty good reflection.</li>
      <li>The LED light is great although I have not used it that much.</li>
      <li>Slim design, easy to mount.  </li>
      <li>Its easy to use, works well and either mine leaks by design or is defective.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s easy to do; you&#x27;re running the shower already,</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has a rubber gasket at the bottom that holds razors, it&#x27;s pretty handy</li>
      <li>This mirror is pretty neat, it suction cups to the wall and is a nice size.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now this product is marketed towards men, which is fine.</li>
      <li>don’t use the light on this mirror because it is way to strong.</li>
      <li>The light is a very nice addition as showers often do not have enough light to safely and accurately shave.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>The LED light uses three AA batteries which are not included.</li>
      <li>I personally would not recommend it but see others are happy with it.py with it.</li>
      <li>The LED light runs on three, not included, AA batteries (you know</li>
      <li>I received a white mirror and it looks great.</li>
      <li>I think it would be a nice gift for a man you have to purchase a gift for, but that you don&#x27;t know very well.</li>
      <li>I read the directions and filled the water reservoir so that the mirror wouldn&#x27;t fog up.  </li>
      <li>The light is fully splash resistant.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>It has slots for razors, but they seem to fit the disposable size.</li>
      <li>and you had to add water to keep it stream free.</li>
      <li>The mirror is cheap...</li>
      <li>I like this fog free mirror and</li>
      <li>Once I got the batteries in the light came on but could not be switched off, they would just be on all the time.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the button is jammed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The overall quality of the mirror itself is not as good as it could or should be.</li>
      <li>This is because it is made of plastic (not glass) and is not rigid enough to give a good reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light is a nice touch for anyone whose shower doesn&#x27;t have a separate light directly above it, and so is the non-fogging surface.</li>
      <li>It is pretty easy to install in the shower.  </li>
      <li>there it is, easy to install, easy to use, nice little light.</li>
      <li>Its easy to clean an works really well for men or women.</li>
      <li>thing comes with super duper suction cups</li>
      <li>I cleaned the surface well and even prepped with alcohol, but it would constantly fall off with kind of a Bang Ding Ow sound.  </li>
      <li>Second, it has to be filled up with warm water before each use to prevent it from fogging.  </li>
      <li>real issue though is the entire thing is made of plastic, all of it, so it feels cheap and looks not as good if that had been a glass mirror.</li>
      <li>Works by adding hot water every time you shower to keep the mirror fog free.</li>
      <li>It’s pretty bright actually.</li>
      <li>First off, this isn&#x27;t really a mirror (probably for safety reasons), but more of a plasticy foil material.  </li>
      <li>Nonetheless, the mirror seems pretty fogless!  </li>
      <li>Then I was surprised that the mirror is nothing more than shiny reflective plastic.  </li>
      <li>Light is ok, but don&#x27;t really use because I have enough light in my shower.</li>
      <li>You are supposed to fill a compartment with warm water which theoretically makes the mirror fog-proof.</li>
      <li>The mirror is like looking into a fun house.</li>
      <li>If it was just a little higher quality, I’d happily give it at a gift.</li>
      <li>all right</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>Yeah, right.</li>
      <li>In fact, the mirror itself now has about a 3&amp;#34; vertical crack running along the right side of</li>
      <li>The major problems with this is the design that requires a lot of work for an item that is supposed to make shaving more  convenient and ends up being self defeating.</li>
      <li>It is very much a distorted &#x27;fun house&#x27; view at times.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Its easy to use, works well and either mine leaks by design or is defective.  Non the less it holds enough hot water long enough to get the job done.  The light is handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used some fogless mirrors in the past. My favorite have been the kind that don&#x27;t have a reservoir and retain heat for extended periods, keeping them from fogging up. This particular product definitely hasn&#x27;t sold me on the reservoir design, but I think that has more to do with the quality of the product itself. The mirror is plastic and not terribly clear, the entire thing snaps together in a very unsatisfying way (it almost feels as though it&#x27;ll fall apart or off the wall at any moment) and the light is a bit of a joke. Can&#x27;t recommend this product very highly, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Fogless bathroom mirrors fall into 2 categories: 1) The type where the difference between the mirror temperature and that of the surrounding air and water is minimized to decrease likelihood of condensation (aka fog) forming on the mirror and 2) an anti-fog  coating of some sort that discourages condensation (fog) from forming on the surface of the mirror. There are several ways to achieve either 1) or 2) depending on the conditions in your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror falls into the first category.  The mirror is attached to a small rectangular container that slots into the body of the unit.  One fills this container with warm water from the shower to bring the mirror up to the temperature of the shower.  The pros and cons of this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ The method of using warm water from the shower is the best way to bring the mirror up to the correct temperature since water from the shower is the source of the temperature discrepancy.  This works. It&#x27;s science.&lt;br /&gt;+ The light is a very nice addition as showers often do not have enough light to safely and accurately shave.&lt;br /&gt;+ The light is part of the base (bottom unit).&lt;br /&gt;+ The light is an energy efficient and long lasting LED.&lt;br /&gt;+ The light is fully splash resistant.&lt;br /&gt;+ Zadro is a well-known brand in the mirror industry and their mirrors are generally of a high quality. This mirror is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This particular method is a bit tricky with soapy hands or hands covered with shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;- As the water cools in the container behind the mirror, the mirror will fog up. so there is a need to continually dump the cooled water out and refill with warm water from the shower&lt;br /&gt;- Depending on the type of shower one has, it may be a b&#x3D;it awkward and slippery to continually remove the container to refill it with fresh warm water from the showerhead.&lt;br /&gt;- The LED light does not emit enough light in a very dark shower.&lt;br /&gt;- The slots in the bottom unit are too restrictive for larger ergonomic-grip toothbrushes and larger shavers&lt;br /&gt;- The overall quality of the mirror itself is not as good as it could or should be. There is distortion on the edges where the mirror (plastic for safety in the shower) is bent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this fogless mirror. The science behind it is basic and simple.  The mirror does do what it claims to do.  Best of all there are no chemical coatings to wash or wear off.uality of the mirror itself is not as good as it could or should be.

    <li> The reason for the title is because I had a heck of a time getting this thing to stay attached to the wall of my shower enclosure.  I cleaned the surface well and even prepped with alcohol, but it would constantly fall off with kind of a Bang Ding Ow sound.  In fact, the mirror itself now has about a 3&amp;#34; vertical crack running along the right side of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with the suction cups, per se.  And yes, you can mount it via double-sided sticky tape.  But again, I had some difficulty with the mounting.  Perhaps you won&#x27;t though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fogless mirror seems to work well, although filling the reservoir with warm water each time is a minor hassle.  The LED light seems to work well and is really bright.  Maybe too bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries aren&#x27;t included and I think they should be.  I also had trouble with the switch, as it wouldn&#x27;t seem to keep the light on unless pressed.  However, you have to really press and hold the switch down firmly in order to lock the light on or turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent fogless mirror though.  I don&#x27;t love it and I don&#x27;t hate it.  It did wake me up in the middle of a sound sleep a few times by crashing to the shower enclosure floor at unexpected times.  3 stars.</li>
    <li> Received on time, great buy</li>
    <li> This mirror is pretty neat, it suction cups to the wall and is a nice size. To activate the fogless, gently remove the mirror attachment and fill with water, it even as a squeegee attached to it to remove any fog before you turn it on. It has slots for razors, but they seem to fit the disposable size. It&#x27;s functional and as described.</li>
    <li> I bought a ten dollar mirror about 15 years ago that is not exactly new anymore. However, it works. It is just a mirror though with places to hang razors. I am a female and wash my face with the mirror. I have moved with my mirror, it has suctions cups on the back and never has fallen off. It does not have a brand name on it or I would link the page to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this mirror I was excited to try it. It seemed like great timing. My mirror was in bad shape and this one had a lot of bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was not impressed with the fact it had batteries and you had to add water to keep it stream free. The first few days I was ready to put my old one back. However, with time I have learned to appreciate that feature. It also sticks really well on the shower. I have a stand up shower so it is stuck on the glass. I received a white mirror and it looks great. My razors, which I use male razors to shave, fit well. I do not buy female razors since it is all about the color and shape. I want to know if I am shaving, that it is getting hair, not the color or how cute it looks. The mirror itself sits out from the wall/glass or wherever you place it. I would say a good inch. I find that bothersome, but know that is so you can place the batteries in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few weeks and at first hated it, then liked it, and now am going back to my older cheapo mirror. The main reason, the mirror on this one is warped, not defective but not like an actually mirror. My other mirror is cheap too but it at least looks like me. The mirror is like looking into a fun house. I get vertigo a lot and this mirror does not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hope for it and tried to for several weeks but think it is a lot of fluff. I already put my older mirror back last night and finally did not feel dizzy looking into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been a good mirror but it is not made well. I personally would not recommend it but see others are happy with it.py with it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is really nice to have in the shower.  It is for shaving or other reasons you may need a mirror in the shower.  It is pretty easy to install in the shower.  The price seems a little too much for this item, but it is a nice mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea that got lost in translation. Having a mirror in the shower to shave with or remove makeup, what a great idea. Add a bright LED light so you can see well in the shower, an even better idea. Make the mirror fog less, wow, now you&#x27;re talking almost genius. And then add a little shelf for a razor or other stuff - Albert Einstein would be impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then go try to build that thing, run it through committee after committee for product development, worry about safety issues; and you end up with something that is way overpriced and kind of not so intelligent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does what it says it will do - there are suction cups on the back to attach the base to the wall. The LED light runs on three, not included, AA batteries (you know Zadro - not including batteries was evil, I have bought really cheap things that include a set of batteries - seriously?) that require a Philips head screwdriver to install. The mirror section is easy to remove from the base because you have to fill it with warm water before you use it. That&#x27;s easy to do; you&#x27;re running the shower already, right? Pull off the mirror, run water into the back of the mirror, and replace the mirror - done super simple, not complicated. Over time the water flows out of the mirror back slowly (I have no idea why it does this, but it does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there it is, easy to install, easy to use, nice little light. What&#x27;s not to like? Well the mirror is a major piece of junk - fun house mirrors are better. The mirror is a thin sheet of plastic that is wavy. At $20, a wavy mirror wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing or it would be marginally acceptable; for $50, I expect that mirror to be glass perfect flat, not wavy. It just looks stupid cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a brilliant idea. The execution is terrible and at a very dear price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and worried it would not attach to the shower wall properly.  Not a problem at all!  It works great and it&#x27;s made shaving a breeze.</li>
    <li> Recommended for anyone who needs to be able to shave in the shower. The light is a nice touch for anyone whose shower doesn&#x27;t have a separate light directly above it, and so is the non-fogging surface.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror for my husband&#x27;s shower, and when I asked him how he liked it, he said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need a mirror to shave in the shower.&amp;#34;  The implication seemed to be that his method of shaving by feel could win a prize for machismo.  I asked him if he ever turned on the super bright LED light.  No.  Did he keep his razors in the flexible accessory holder?  No, too much effort.  I can&#x27;t imagine him ever taking the time to lift the mirror out of its base, fill the reservoir with warm water, and slide it back into place, thus fog-proofing the mirror.  Nonetheless, the mirror seems pretty fogless!  Did I mention that there is a little tiny built-in squeegee that one could use to remove water spots?  OK, this is a product for the fastidious male who might also empty water from the reservoir after every use, thus deterring growth of mold and mildew between uses. But not mine.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting this mirror and trying it out. Because it was ordered through the Vine program I&#x27;m obligated to write a review about the product or I will lose my eligibility to participate in future Vine offerings. Today is the final day for me to write the review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve elected to give it a neutral grade. I did not think either a favorable one or negative one would be fair to either the company or the prospective customers. I will say that I&#x27;ve bought two shower mirrors from this company before and was not happy with either or both, their ability to remain fog less and/or remain stable on my shower wall which is a common tile wall. I used the glue that product provided and when the mirror still didn&#x27;t stay up it simply made removal more difficult; particularly getting all the glue off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reiterate, my intent with this review is to be fair to all prospective affected parties. It is hoped readers will find I was successful in accomplishing that. I do not wish to unfairly hurt a product&#x27;s reputation. If I&#x27;ve done that, I&#x27;m open to suggestions as to how to make this review more equitable.</li>
    <li> When you fill the reservoir with tap water like you are supposed to, the fogless feature works. Naturally, it’s not intuitive enough for my guests to realize this, so I tell them after they ask me why my fogless mirror didn’t work. I can’t really fault the product for that. It’s just not intuitive right away to fill that reservoir, and since it empties itself, I just don’t remember to tell people, especially if I don’t think they will use it. There is definitely interest in the product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real issue though is the entire thing is made of plastic, all of it, so it feels cheap and looks not as good if that had been a glass mirror. If it had been real glass, well I might be worried about when those suction cups eventually fail, but then I would probably use the tape system instead. It recommends you check them every once in a while, and of course you can use tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this product is marketed towards men, which is fine. I have it in my guest bathroom and the ladies find it very useful, they especially like the light. It’s pretty bright actually. It works as advertised. If it was just a little higher quality, I’d happily give it at a gift. As it is, I recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a shower mirror, so I have no other product to compare it against.  But, I did expect more for $50.  First off, this isn&#x27;t really a mirror (probably for safety reasons), but more of a plasticy foil material.  Second, it has to be filled up with warm water before each use to prevent it from fogging.  These two things were actually what made me not like this shower &amp;#34;mirror.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Garbage.  Please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; is glass.  This garbage is a piece of foil.&lt;br /&gt;-Decide after starting that you want to shave in the shower?  Not with this piece of...garbage.  You need warm water (which will grow moldy) to start it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to get a REAL shaving mirror and some Rain-X anti-fog (which will last about a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sum:  Complete waste of money and effort.  Worthless.</li>
    <li> The mirror worked for the time I had it- 2 weeks- light would not come on without holding the button continuously - this is the second mirror with lights from Zadro that have stopped working right.  No more for me. It did stay fogless, but couldn&#x27;t see well enough to get the shave without the light.</li>
    <li> Having a mirror in the shower is a great thing in our household. When washing my face I like to make sure that all of my makeup has come off and my boyfriend prefers shaving in the shower. I followed the instructions on installing this mirror and for the first couple days it was great, but then at 3 a.m. the crash in our bathroom woke both of us up with a fright!  Apparently the suction cups had come loose from the the glass and the whole thing fell. Thankfully nothing was broken, but it was definitely not a way we wanted to get woken up. We reinstalled it the next day hoping that we wouldn&#x27;t have a repeat of the same and we didn&#x27;t....until a week later. This time it happened while we were both out of the house so nobody was surprised. We gave it one more shot and two days later it fell again. Because we do like the mittor we&#x27;re going to try and figure out a way to install hooks so that will hang over the shower wall.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight shower mirror. In order to be fogless, you have to fill the reservoir with warm water every time you get in the shower. The water will slowly drip out of the shower but this will take several minutes so your mirror will stay fogless for the duration of your shower. It really works. The thing that bothers me the most about this mirror is that the reflection is distorted. This is because it is made of plastic (not glass) and is not rigid enough to give a good reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, because of the spacing of the 3 suction cups on the back and the size of my tiles, I have to hang this mirror at a slight angle so that none of the suction cups sit on top of the grout. I have 3 inch square tiles. If your tiles are larger than this then you shouldn’t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t use the light on this mirror because it is way to strong. Because of that and it’s position it is just too uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> The fogless mirror really does work so as long as you follow the directions. Its easy to clean an works really well for men or women. Simple open the package  add batteries and apply to your shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by the foil mirror at all.  And the fog less technology means putting water behind the mirror.  Not every guy is going to remember to change the water out after showering.  The suction cups don&#x27;t work well on my shower polyvinyl  walls either.</li>
    <li> This mirror is ridiculously overpriced. We had one for almost 4 years and it didn&#x27;t even cost half of this price. And it worked a lot better! You have to actually pour water in the little reservoir in back of the actual mirror for it to stay defogged. It&#x27;s a real pain especially since half the time I&#x27;m still having to wipe my hand over it to clear it up. The light is pointless. You have to press really hard on the button for it to work, and I don&#x27;t actually see a purpose to it, as it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference as to what you&#x27;re seeing. The razor holders are a joke. I nearly tore the whole mirror off the wall trying to yank one of my razors out. You have to be super gentle or the front of the mirror will come off (which it does anyway because it takes almost no effort to loosen it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not impressed with this at all and do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband has actually turned to using our reflective mirror-like shower head as a mirror while shaving in the shower.  This would explain the sloppiness and missed hairs.  When this item was offered, I readily snatched it up so that he would no longer have to resort to using a distorted shower head reflection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package I was stunned at how &#x27;plastic&#x27; the whole mirror truly was.  Then I was surprised that the mirror is nothing more than shiny reflective plastic.  It is very much a distorted &#x27;fun house&#x27; view at times.  I read the directions and filled the water reservoir so that the mirror wouldn&#x27;t fog up.  I find the whole situation rather silly that I need to replace the mirror contraption to fill reservoir each and every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto installation:  Simple enough because it is suction cups!  YES... suction cups!  I am not sure of others personal experience with suction cups in the shower but for my own use they have always done less suc-king and more slipping &amp; sliding.  These suction cups were not any better.  The &#x27;mirror&#x27; continuously slides and has also jumped off the wall twice.  A chunk has broken off and with it went a piece of the porcelain tub.  Needless to say we will no longer be using this fog-less &#x27;mirror&#x27;.  The fog-less part worked all right but it wasn&#x27;t as clear as we required.  I believe this is because of the foil mirror&#x27;s distortion.  There are also LED lights which require the use of batteries to run.  LED lights are harsh especially when coupled with a foil mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend!  There are better products out there; especially at this price.  If this item was half the price then it would make sense and be a good buy.  Then I might be able to accept most of it&#x27;s shortcomings.</li>
    <li> When I opened this and removed the packaging, a sticker on the front left behind residue on the &#x27;mirror&#x27;. (Which itself is reflective sticker material) Trying to get it off just scratched the reflective layer so I gave up. My husband frequently comments about the blob of sticker residue that appears to be on his face as he&#x27;s shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works--even if you don&#x27;t fill the reservoir, you can still wipe off the fog and get a pretty good reflection. Mostly I don&#x27;t fill the reservoir, my husband does if he knows he has a lot of shaving to do that day. To me it&#x27;s a pain in the behind to mess with. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d care if we had a mirror in the shower but it&#x27;s actually saved me from getting out of the shower before a blob of hair color could be washed off my forehead, and to tell if I&#x27;ve gotten all my eye makeup off before getting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a rubber gasket at the bottom that holds razors, it&#x27;s pretty handy and it holds both metal and plastic handle shavers with no problem. I guess for me the cheapness of the product doesn&#x27;t make it worth $50, and if I couldn&#x27;t get that blob of sticker off something I paid $50 for I&#x27;d be mad. Oh and don&#x27;t try to use OOPS or GOO GONE to get that residue off---after all that reflective surface is itself an adhesive product, and those solvents eat adhesive/plastic. Take my word for that. Tried it---bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment takes a screwdriver to get to---which is a pain, but on second thought I&#x27;d want it to be that secure considering you are going to have it in a wet environment constantly.</li>
    <li> Slim design, easy to mount.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had to laugh when the mirror first arrived on a cold, dreary day and I pulled it out of the package and it was... foggy. :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I read the packaging, turned out you have to fill the back of the mirror with hot water to prevent fogging. Fair enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing comes with super duper suction cups so it AIN&#x27;T coming off the wall! There&#x27;s a little squeegee for removing water droplets and rogue fog (it happens), but I&#x27;ve never been able to get the light to work. I&#x27;m pretty sure the button is jammed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for the advertised price would I buy this, but, maybe 10-25% of the MSRP.</li>
    <li> I like this fog free mirror and the fog free feature works great.  Unfortunately the light switch does not work.  You must find a small phillips head screwdriver in order to install the batteries.  Once I got the batteries in the light came on but could not be switched off, they would just be on all the time.  Still is usable but without the handy light feature.</li>
    <li> This has been great so far and was very easy to set up. You use the suction cups to place it on the wall and this thing sticks. The LED light is great although I have not used it that much. The glass is not actually glass like others have said but it works for me. At the bottom you get the placements for the razors you use. They fit nicely so there are no problems there. Over all I would say this is a good product.</li>
    <li> The major problems with this is the design that requires a lot of work for an item that is supposed to make shaving more  convenient and ends up being self defeating. The things I didn&#x27;t like are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 You have to replace the batteries before you can use the item and they are encased in an area with two little, difficult-to-unscrew-without-a-little-screwdriver, screws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 You have to fill a reserve with water all the time and it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 The instructions say &amp;#34;to avoid water spots on mirror surface, postion mirror in area without water overspray from shower&amp;#34;. Yeah, right. In a little shower that is not so easy to do, then you get waterspots on the mirror and it loses a lot of it&#x27;s usablity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says it will do as long as you baby it and jump through the right hoops... but who really wants to spend $50 to do that?</li>
    <li> When I ordered this through the amazon vine program in exchange for an honest review, I had no idea what the street price of this mirror was.  It seemed like a practical item to have.  You can&#x27;t imagine my surprise when I found out it costs $50 or so since it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be a quality product.  When I opened the package and pulled the photo sticker off the &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34;, I ended up scratching it since it isn&#x27;t really a mirror at all but some type of distorted foil.  I also couldn&#x27;t believe that it takes 3 AA batteries for a light and was quite a hassle to actually install.  Moreover the suction cups lasted approximately two showers before it started slipping off the wall. Last, but certainly not least, I couldn&#x27;t quite grasp that you had to fill a receptacle with warm water to ensure that the faux glass actually doesn&#x27;t fog up.  I thought the whole point of the special mirror was for this purpose.  Granted, only my husband needs a shaving mirror in the shower, so I can&#x27;t attest to the practicality quite the way he can, but he was not pleased.  All I can say is that it technically meets the description but without quality and durability behind it.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;mirror&amp;#34; for use in the shower. I got it as an item to review so thankfully I did not put out cash for this. I found it awkward and pretty much gave up on installing it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is plastic with a shiny surface to use as a mirror. Unfortunately it distorts your reflection like a fun-house mirror, which is not fun at all if you want to see your face clearly. The LED light uses three AA batteries which are not included. You need a small Phillips screwdriver to install them. You are supposed to fill a compartment with warm water which theoretically makes the mirror fog-proof. Unfortunately there is a tiny hole in the back of my unit so as soon as I filled it, water started leaking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to mount it using the three suction cups that are included. I cleaned the tile first, as instructed. Two of the suction cups stuck to the tile but the third one did not. As I pressed and pressed in an effort to make it stick, one of the other little cups pulled through it&#x27;s hole so I had to start over. Finally I gave up because it&#x27;s not worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;ll stick this up somewhere else as an extra emergency light. LED lights usually last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this mirror. It can be affixed to your shower wall w suction cups, glue or tape and none worked well.  I would prefer if it came  with a hook, I also don&#x27;t like the bottom lip that holds the razors. I always bump into it and knock it down. My daughter and husband do like it however, so it gets 2 stars.</li>
    <li> this is an ok shower mirror. Works by adding hot water every time you shower to keep the mirror fog free. The problem is it&#x27;s a little difficult to remove and slide it back on. Light is ok, but don&#x27;t really use because I have enough light in my shower.</li>
    <li> The mirror is cheap...not actually a real mirror...more like a thick foil....it distorts your face. It does not fog and the light is bright.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. I like this since it&#x27;s pretty much unbreakable and does work as advertised. My only complaint is that the suction cups don&#x27;t stick for as long or as well as I&#x27;d wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that when it does fall off the wall, it doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as far as enabling you to shave while in the shower, it does that well.</li>
    <li> This is very functional, it works and does what it says it will do, which is why I am going to give it three stars. I think it would be a nice gift for a man you have to purchase a gift for, but that you don&#x27;t know very well. It is a little inconvenient though as you have to fill the mirror with warm water every time you use it (and then empty it.) I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of anything that requires three batteries and having to replace them relatively often if you&#x27;re using the mirror everyday to shave.</li>
    <li> Mine is white plastic. There is a compartment inside where you put three batteries...you have to have a small screwdriver which immediately put me off. The mirror is foil which is a good thing, for safety reasons, so reviewers who took off for that were not being fair. I kept trying to get the mirror to slide back in place and finally realized that it does not fit together tightly. The big thing is that you really need a shower thing that pulls out to fill it with warm water which you must do for every use, I don&#x27;t have that. Otherwise you will need a cup. And you have to drain it after each use...can we say mold. I know that will not happen. The suction cups are nice and secure. Finally, I really don&#x27;t think the price justifies the product.</li>
</ol>
