      <li>shampoo is effective at preventing dandruff.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt soft and smelled great !</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mint scent smells really chemical to me and the microbeads aren&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly like no other shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>Great fresh scent, not too strong.</li>
      <li>but I like garnier better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo - I wish I could find it at a cheaper price</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this was the Garnier Fructis Dandruff shampoo I had</li>
      <li>and it definitely was the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for dandruff....</li>
      <li>It has worked a lot better for me than coal tar shampoos like T-Gel.  </li>
      <li>I love both of these products but have some advice for those who want to extend time between washing your hair but have dandruff</li>
      <li>I love it and hope it will never be discontinued</li>
      <li>He does like how refreshing it feels though.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo to help with my dandruff.</li>
      <li>I must say that the exfoliating beads in this shampoo are very unique</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is nice and mild and works well for both women and men.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves my scalp so clean and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Just a practical, easy to use, lid is all I need and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product Garnier.</li>
      <li>The cap for this is so hassle free too.</li>
      <li>Greatly priced and it actually works!</li>
      <li>Cool mint feeling on my head</li>
      <li>But I think one star is more appropriate because it just simply does not work for me.</li>
      <li>I Love it and glad I can finally put my itch to rest.</li>
      <li>Dandruff is gone after the very first hair wash.</li>
      <li>This shampoo helps relieve my itchy scalp for several days at a time, and I&#x27;m quite pleased Amazon carries it!</li>
      <li>It is probably worth trying if you are looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
      <li>The shampoo seems to be very old, with grainy substances in its texture, rather than having  a smooth liquid presence.  </li>
      <li>But suddenly we havn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere</li>
      <li>Mint Cleanse does have a nice smell to it, not very chemically but a bit minty.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so please be aware when ordering it.</li>
      <li>I recommend this shampoo to anyone with dandruff or dry skin who wants an effective, mild smelling, low cost hair product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Anti-Dandruff Intense Cleanse and the Mint Cleanse.  </li>
      <li>I really want to give it 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks again nancy very helpful</li>
      <li>I HAVE A VERY ITCHY SCALP AND THE MINT CLEANSE</li>
      <li>I will try buying a different one which the same apple and lemon and sugar ingredients that made up the scent I liked and without microbeads.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m was a fan of the original or 2nd incarnation of the Garnier Fructis shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different dandruff shampoos but they only seem to work for the day I showered.</li>
      <li>The microbeads really help clear up my dandruff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my scalp feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to wear a black suit and never had a problem!</li>
      <li>I have distressed hair that I use other special hair care products on</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many ridiculous concoctions they come up with for caps these days.</li>
      <li>But when I bought this shampoo upon first use I noticed that my head did not itch and the flaking was minimal.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t like the harsh other stuff, and I really like the original apple-lemon-sugar smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a grit which would be nice on my scalp except I have very thick long hair.</li>
      <li>Its too rough on the hair and if you have a lot of hair you really have to rinse and rinse to get all the granules out.</li>
      <li>being said, there is absolutely no reason to pay $11 for this product, you can get it much cheaper at Walmart or Target.</li>
      <li>It works really fast and is not harmful for the hair, like other products that may dry it.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure that the exfoliating beads help much unless you really press down into your scalp</li>
<li> So the shampoo never gets down far enough to do</li>
<li> Also the aroma is quite different from other Garnier shampoos of this nature.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t dry my hair at all.</li>
<li> For me, I apply it directly to my scalp and massage in the beads for at least 10 seconds in each area then rinse out and apply my conditioner to the rest of my hair.  </li>
<li> Tried this shampoo for a few days, but tossing it and going back to head and shoulders.</li>
<li> Wet hair and put shampoo on for five minutes 3 times a week</li>
<li> Other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried left my hair dried out and heavy from their chemicals.</li>
<li> It does not have the harsh chemical smell of other dandruff shampoos.&lt;br</li>
<li> Was looking for something that was a bit less &#x27;all chemical&#x27; smelling.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like a handful of sand was dumped in to a runny green medicine.</li>
<li> It has decreased the amount of dandruff but there is still dandruff present.</li>
<li> My showers went from everyday to every 2 days.</li>
<li> No more itching, flakes on dryness during colder, drier months.</li>
<li> I have excema so there are very few products I can use that don&#x27;t make my skin freak out</li>
<li> so it is hard to do that.&lt;br</li>
<li> Well, at least for 48 hours I can.</li>
<li> The microbeads are not refreshing and are difficult to rinse out.</li>
<li> In fact the problem seem to get worse...</li>
<li> I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS EVERYWHERE IN THE STORES AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND.  </li>
<li> Smells terrible, has annoying little plastic granuals.</li>
<li> My dandruff wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate it.</li>

    <li> I got this shampoo for my husband. Head &amp; Shoulders does not work for him so I was hoping this would do the job. It has decreased the amount of dandruff but there is still dandruff present. He does like how refreshing it feels though. Perhaps for someone whose dandruff is not as severe this would be great. It is probably worth trying if you are looking for an anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is not a review of the actual shampoo (which I would give 5 stars) but of the product. I ordered 4 bottles but when they arrived, the expiration date had been trimmed off. I know they are not making this product anymore so please be aware when ordering it.</li>
    <li> I was having some issues with a flaky scalp.  I bought a JASONs product (much more expensive) and it was aweful.  This product worked in just two uses.  I was able to wear a black suit and never had a problem! The smell is great.  I must say that the exfoliating beads in this shampoo are very unique and I love them!  This product even gets a good lather going, which the JASONS product did not.  Impressed for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I saw all the great reviews of this product and decided to give it a try. But after 10+ wash I found no improvement. In fact the problem seem to get worse...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my medical shampoo.</li>
    <li> Using this product twice cleared out my dandruff and I returned to using my regular shampoo! It smells great, I love the mint and the like exfoliating particles</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps relieve my itchy scalp for several days at a time, and I&#x27;m quite pleased Amazon carries it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Was looking for something that was a bit less &#x27;all chemical&#x27; smelling. This stuff is great. Cool mint feeling on my head and it does the job. The cap for this is so hassle free too. I can&#x27;t tell you how many ridiculous concoctions they come up with for caps these days. Just a practical, easy to use, lid is all I need and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product Garnier.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used. It works perfectly like no other shampoos I have tried. I love it and hope it will never be discontinued</li>
    <li> It works! Dandruff is gone after the very first hair wash. Nothing else works like this product. I tried head and shoulders before but I like garnier better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE A VERY ITCHY SCALP AND THE MINT CLEANSE AND WITH THE MICROBEAD HAS STOPPED MY SCALP FROM ITCHING.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WITH DANDRUFF OR JUST AN ITCHY SCALP.  I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS EVERYWHERE IN THE STORES AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND.  I HOPE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have dandruff problems and we&#x27;ve tried several things but we found this at cvs one day and decided to try it. It worked! Itchy and flaky head went away!! But suddenly we havn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere so off to amazon we went! Greatly priced and it actually works! Don&#x27;t take it away from us amazon because the stores here have!</li>
    <li> Best dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for dandruff....and this is the only one that has worked for me. It smells great. Thoroughly cleanses my hair and scalp and dandruff was improved immediately after use and is gone after 4 days of use, depends on your level of dandruff. This beat Selsun Blue and Head&amp;Shoulders.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible, has annoying little plastic granuals. They have discontinued it, if that tells you anything.</li>
    <li> It works really fast and is not harmful for the hair, like other products that may dry it. Totally recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the only dandruff shampoo that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve tried everything!! The microbeads really help clear up my dandruff. I now can&#x27;t find it in my local drugstore so needed to buy on Amazon</li>
    <li> I really want to give it 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m was a fan of the original or 2nd incarnation of the Garnier Fructis shampoo. My dandruff wasn&#x27;t that bad so I didn&#x27;t like the harsh other stuff, and I really like the original apple-lemon-sugar smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was cheaper on Amazon, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint scent smells really chemical to me and the microbeads aren&#x27;t ideal. I will try buying a different one which the same apple and lemon and sugar ingredients that made up the scent I liked and without microbeads.</li>
    <li> I like the minty scent but thats about it.  I don&#x27;t like the scubbing granules in this shampoo. Its too rough on the hair and if you have a lot of hair you really have to rinse and rinse to get all the granules out. As a dandruff shampoo it does work , but the granules are just to aggravating and damaging to my hair for me to continue using this.</li>
    <li> The shampoo seems to be very old, with grainy substances in its texture, rather than having  a smooth liquid presence.  Also the aroma is quite different from other Garnier shampoos of this nature.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Anti-Dandruff Intense Cleanse and the Mint Cleanse.  I have distressed hair that I use other special hair care products on and I also have curly hair and dandruff.  I love both of these products but have some advice for those who want to extend time between washing your hair but have dandruff so it is hard to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two shampoo&#x27;s have invigorating beads and I suggest only apply to the scalp and not the rest of the hair.  For me, I apply it directly to my scalp and massage in the beads for at least 10 seconds in each area then rinse out and apply my conditioner to the rest of my hair.  I don&#x27;t have to use this every time I wash my hair but maybe around once or twice a week.  My husband uses Mint Cleanse on a regular basis and his dandruff is gone.  Mint Cleanse does have a nice smell to it, not very chemically but a bit minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I don&#x27;t think this stuff can be beat.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does a good job. I&#x27;m trying to wean my husband off of Head and Shoulders because I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Best anti-dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used. And smells good to boot</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - I wish I could find it at a cheaper price</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this shampoo after seeing all the good reviews on Amazon and after a month of using it, I want to post my own good review of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is effective at preventing dandruff.  It has worked a lot better for me than coal tar shampoos like T-Gel.  I&#x27;m not sure that the exfoliating beads help much unless you really press down into your scalp but they do force me to rinse my hair extra well, so none of the beads stay in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and mild and works well for both women and men.  It does not have the harsh chemical smell of other dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very good on Amazon.  I recommend this shampoo to anyone with dandruff or dry skin who wants an effective, mild smelling, low cost hair product.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo for a few days, but tossing it and going back to head and shoulders. The microbeads are not refreshing and are difficult to rinse out. It&#x27;s like a handful of sand was dumped in to a runny green medicine. Also, dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my scalp so clean and healthy.  And it is so refreshing! Great fresh scent, not too strong. No more itching, flakes on dryness during colder, drier months. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair at all. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo to help with my dandruff. It soothes and tingles and reduces the itchiness.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate it. But I think one star is more appropriate because it just simply does not work for me. It has a grit which would be nice on my scalp except I have very thick long hair. So the shampoo never gets down far enough to do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> perfect all has been settled and the shampoo is great. will deal with him again !thanks again nancy very helpful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure if this was the Garnier Fructis Dandruff shampoo I had but it had a 48 hour control and it definitely was the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I have problems with severe scalp itch and flaking. I&#x27;ve tried many different dandruff shampoos but they only seem to work for the day I showered. I was taking almost showering daily to relieve my scalp itching. But when I bought this shampoo upon first use I noticed that my head did not itch and the flaking was minimal. As it states my head did not itch for 48 hours. My showers went from everyday to every 2 days. My hair felt soft and smelled great ! Other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried left my hair dried out and heavy from their chemicals. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Garnier Fructis before and been using their Length and Strength shampoo prior to using this. I Love it and glad I can finally put my itch to rest. Well, at least for 48 hours I can. Definitely would recommend this to anyone needing scalp itch and dandruff relief !!</li>
    <li> Scalp inching and dandruff is treated by this shampoo.  Wet hair and put shampoo on for five minutes 3 times a week and you will get relief from the symptoms, I have tried all the dandruff shampoos and this one works the best. Try it....................</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have excema so there are very few products I can use that don&#x27;t make my skin freak out and this is one of them. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out and my scalp feels clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there is absolutely no reason to pay $11 for this product, you can get it much cheaper at Walmart or Target.</li>
