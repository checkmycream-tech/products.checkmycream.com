      <li>I am an eyeliner lover and this one is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best pen type liquid liner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>got great packaging and is super adorable- if you&#x27;re not wearing concealer on the eye, it will flake and show up streaky.</li>
      <li>The tip is very fine</li>
      <li>I also love the formula how it glides very easily.</li>
      <li>Instead it was a very light application.</li>
      <li>The BEST part is that it is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day, AND is still easy to take off with my neutrogena makeup remover wipes!</li>
      <li>If I do cat eyes, they do end up disappearing by the end of the day, but it hangs on longer than most.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a much more affordable alternative to the lorac front of the line and kat von d tattoo liquid eyeliner with a brush tip.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>it does a heck of a lot better job than most waterproofed liners.</li>
      <li>but I do love the cute packaging and</li>
      <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY</li>
      <li>I honestly would buy a dozen of these if it was available in my area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing them again :)</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love Dolly Wink products.</li>
      <li>This is honestly my favorite eyeliner.</li>

      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love the tip on this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m dying to love this-</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just an okay liner.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>Fantastic eyeliner!</li>
      <li>I stumbled across it looking for cheaper options than at the drug store but after reading the reviews I figured I would shell out a couple more bucks to try this liner.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s the most precise brush tip kind</li>
      <li>love a thicker end of my eyeliner, and this liquid eyeliner is convenient to use.</li>
      <li>Will buy again soon! :)</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner</li>
      <li>Basically, I would go to Sephora and try on a different liquid eyeliner on each eye and then go in to work and see which formula performed best.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so precise and easy to apply!</li>
      <li>This is my first time using a liquid eyeliner, and I find it so easy to apply!!</li>
      <li>It does glide on pretty good and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love the fine tip of the brush and also that it&#x27;s a fiber brush and not a felt tip.</li>
      <li>Love the darkness and love the tip of the brush that allows me to have full control of how I want to draw my liner in that day.</li>
      <li>but this one is more precise and easier to use.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t good at liquid liner and this helped so much.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter because she really had heard good things about it.</li>
      <li>I really love the fine brush tip, but it&#x27;s important to be mindful of recapping the product so that none of the hairs are pushed backwards (which I did in a rush).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have issues finding a stay-on liner w my hooded and oily lids, with that said this liner it&#x27;s just OK for me! i heard so many good thing that I  bought it with too many expectations...The liquid is a little of watery and not as black so you will have to go over a couple of times, also you will have to re-apply after 7hrs-8hrs which you don&#x27;t need to do with the Stila Stay All-day Liner which I also own. Overall you get what you pay for and if you dont have any issues like me this liner is a good cheap alternative.</li>
    <li> Finally an eyeliner with a very fine tip! I&#x27;ve used Stilla for quiet some time. It get&#x27;s really chalky and falls off and also needs reapplications. With this tip I can really draw the cat eyes that I want. Would definitely buy it again !</li>
    <li> Creates very thin lines and doesn&#x27;t leave a greenish tint when wiped off!</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t run, and easy to apply!</li>
    <li> great quality if you love this type of eyeliner - dark black too! it bleeds slightly more than other japanese brands Ive tried but that parts barely noticeable. i will buy again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product when open it is not working its dry sucks lol!!! Never purchase again TT</li>
    <li> Best. Eyeliner. Ever. Glides on easily. Just one stroke is sufficient. Last all day and does not crack. So easy to use and looks so defined. Love it.</li>
    <li> I saw this eyeliner in San Antonio but it was $20, so I bought it for about $4 less here. I like this eyeliner since it&#x27;s really precise, but I do have to do like 4 layers, since it comes off during the day. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another of this eyeliner! I have only tried the MAC, Avon and Victoria&#x27;s Secret eyeliner. None of the tips were as thin as the Dolly Wink eyeliner. The Victoria&#x27;s Secret had a thick tip, so I always ended up with raccoon eyes! cx</li>
    <li> Long wearing and super cute.</li>
    <li> I have really watery eyes and I had heard this eyeliner was great! But it doesn&#x27;t come on that dark and although it stays on pretty okay I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again. It does glide on pretty good and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has amazing staying power.  I have greasy eyes that will tear throughout the day.  Even though I always use primer first, no other eyeliner has been able to stay on all day under the outer corners of my eyes.  I never touch or rub my eyes.  This liner does just that -- stays put all day, minute fading, which is nothing, considering every other brand from Sephora, drug store brands and Japanese lines are completely faded or gone by the afternoon.  The best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found yet.  I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used.  I have oily eyes and nothing stays even with primer.  Someone on Reddit posted about this eyeliner in a forum so I decided to try it since it was a brand I hadn&#x27;t heard of before and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to try and find an eyeliner that will STAY.  This stuff went on beautifully and dried quickly and then lasted ALL DAY without moving. Even once it started to wear off (after a shower and sleep) it just faded, not smudged all over the place like other stuff.  This is my eyeliner from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dying to love this- but it&#x27;s just an okay liner.&lt;br /&gt;Its got great packaging and is super adorable- if you&#x27;re not wearing concealer on the eye, it will flake and show up streaky. And on top of that- you need to pass it twice to get a real black line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise- it&#x27;s alright application and decent wear.</li>
    <li> Ordered my 2nd one! I normally use MAC liquid eyeliner but this one is more precise and easier to use. I find the MAC one to not be as consistent with lines. Much cheaper here on Amazon vs going to Uwajimaya.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I&#x27;ve used in the past two years. Although it doesn&#x27;t say it is waterproof it does a heck of a lot better job than most waterproofed liners. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t need to be applied constantly. Maybe once or twice throughout the day if it is warm/hot out.</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest to find a water proof, smudge proof liquid liner and this is probably the best yet.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliners so much. It&#x27;s sooo easy to apply and it looks great. The only problem I have is after a while it may fade a little bit so you may need to keep it with you to apply a second layer. It&#x27;s easy though if you apply it like usual but then put another layer on of a different eyeliner. This helps it stay in place much longer. Would like to see a water proof one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many high-end liquid eyeliners, Dolly Wink is my new favorite. The tip is great for small lines or you can make more defined ones for a more dramatic look if you wish. It doesn&#x27;t budge all day until you remove it with makeup remover. I would recommend it for people who are new to using liquid eyeliners or seasoned pros. Very easy to use. The product was shipped quickly as well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this eyeliner before and loved it. However, this product from this seller did not perform as expected. The black line seemed watered down and the eye liner did not leave a solid black line. Instead it was a very light application. I had to go over it several times and could not get it to apply properly no matter what I did. I have requested a refund and will return the product.</li>
    <li> Super pigmented, fine tipped, and easy to use. I don&#x27;t usually like liquid eyeliners as they aren&#x27;t very forgiving if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand, but this baby is awesome to use. Has some staying power, I had to learn to draw on the line, let it dry for second and then fix any mistakes. Dolly wink is a bit pricey but I do love the cute packaging and the eyeliner is super pigmented! will buy again!</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Best brush tip ever! Wing tips have never been so simple! Has a super smooth application, so much so, that I literally do my eyeliner one-handed. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or rub and it drys super super fast. I have oily skin on my eyelids so it&#x27;s super hard to find eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t crease. This eyeliner is perfect! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have been using liquid eyeliners for ages now.  This is my ultimate favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t erase during the day, so I almost never need to re-apply.  Also, very easy to remove unlike other eyeliners.  Love the darkness and love the tip of the brush that allows me to have full control of how I want to draw my liner in that day.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews. In fact, I have been a member of Amazon for over ten years and this is probably my fifth&lt;br /&gt;. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this liner. I love makeup and have tried every brand under the sun, this by far takes the cake when it comes to liners. It goes on super dark and it&#x27;s the easiest to apply. It&#x27;s so dark and pronounced, I can only compare it to a sharpie. If I don&#x27;t wash my lids, it stays on perfectly for 2 days. I don&#x27;t make a habit of not washing my makeup off but I do like to test certain shadows and liners to see how long they last. It&#x27;s the perfect liner if you want a dark and lasting line.</li>
    <li> I swear by dolly wink. The brush size and texture is perfect for every use. The only thing is if you go over eyeshadow with it a lot, it tend to absorb the powder and dries out a bit faster. But I still always choose this eyeliner above anything else. And amazon sells it cheaper than my local asian beauty stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderfly easy to draw on cat eyes with this pen!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stay on the lid, it was not water-proof, and the line has to be filled in after applied.</li>
    <li> This is my Holy Grail eyeliner. I have tried other liquid eyeliners and they don&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not great at doing my makeup to begin with, but Dolly Wink gives such precise, thin lines that it&#x27;s really hard to mess it up. I also like how thin it is because I can build it up. Other liquid liners go on way too thick and there is no way to fix it. I will never use anything else for liquid eyeliner as long as Dolly Wink is around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 3 of them so far. Long lasting, very black, and precise with the sharp tip, all for an affordable price :)</li>
    <li> Great product. Met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Seems identical to KPalette&#x27;s similarly priced 24 hour liner. Both have a fine point and go on easily, drying quickly. Both also fade after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I love Dolly Wink eyeliner in black. Although I&#x27;ve used other eyeliners, I always make sure to have one of these with me. It goes on smoothly, has a great texture and stays there for a long period.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s the most precise brush tip kind I have ever used! I also love the formula how it glides very easily. The brush has never given me a problem with stray hairs, it stayed put all the way until it was used up! It stays all day as long as it doesn&#x27;t get wet...in that case it can be wiped off. I only use it over shadows, because it stays better, and has a darker black color because of them.</li>
    <li> The very fine tip and deep pigmentation of this eyeliner make it great for everyday use. The brush is very precise and the color lasts a very long time, although sometimes it does flake. Removes easily without leaving residue. Overall, very high quality product, comparable to high-end eyeliners.</li>
    <li> WOW. This stuff is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t come off for crap and that&#x27;s because I have very watery/teary eyes. The tip is very small and perfect for making a small or dramatic line. 10/10. I was using a Marc Jacobs eyeliner pen before this that wiped off easily and had a bad felt tip end that came apart. Plus it was three times the price of this.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is decent. It tends to flake a little on me. I have greasy lids and by the end of the day, it is completely gone if I dont use a primer.  At least it does not leave me with panda eyes which is how most eyeliners end up on me.  If I used primer, I am sure it would have a little longer staying power. I will try to use it with primer next time and report back if I remember.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless eye liners, starting from drug store brands to others such as mac fluid line and urban decay 24/7 just to name a few and they never managed to keep their pigment as well as stay smudge free. I decided to give this eye liner a try after hearing so many good reviews about it, and I am SO happy that I did. I use this every single day simply because it is the best eye liner I have ever used. The pigment is very dark and it is so comfortable to use! The lines are fluid and creating a sharp wing and thin lines have NEVER been easier. I am thrilled with this purchase! I&#x27;ve worn this through dance performances, hot humid weather and work days and it has never failed. I highly recommend!! :)</li>
    <li> I love the tip on this brush. I have small lids and so the thin brush allows me to make thin lines. The only downside to this liquid liner is that it rubs off easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got to try Dolly Wink eyeliner! My friends suggested this brand and color and I love it! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is honestly my favorite eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been searching for an eyeliner that wouldn&#x27;t smudge and would last for a long time. I heard about this eyeliner from makeup gurus that were endorsing this product. They all loved it and so did I when I received my eyeliner. When I take off my makeup, there are no leftover residue that other eyeliner brands have left me with. As a liquid eyeliner, I was skeptical at first because it&#x27;s very hard for me to apply it with a straight edge. Yet, I had no issue with this eyeliner. I love it soooososososoooo much! I will be purchasing them again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of liquid eyeliners, ranging from drugstore to high-end, and I keep going back to this one. The tips are perfect and don&#x27;t dry out like other liners do, and is still less expensive than department store liners. I order these in bulk (5-6 at a time). Each liner lasts me about 2-3 months with every day use.</li>
    <li> looks a little different than the image. but works fine. very thin, but i like it.  not recommend for beginner.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing eyeliner. I live in a humid environment, and this stays ALL day. Kind of a pain to apply because it dries relatively fast and it stays on so it&#x27;s hard to clean up if you&#x27;ve messed up!</li>
    <li> I am an eyeliner lover and this one is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this stuff. it&#x27;s sooo easy to use even if you have shaky hands. it glides so smoothly so you&#x27;re not pulling at your skin. it is deep and dark. stays all day without smearing and yet isn&#x27;t a pain to remove. I will always buy this brand.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a much more affordable alternative to the lorac front of the line and kat von d tattoo liquid eyeliner with a brush tip. i decided to give the dolly wink a try since i&#x27;ve heard some asian youtubers rave about it. i have asian hooded eyes and other liners (aside from the ones stated above) tend to transfer to the upper part of my lid. this is a great alternative..it&#x27;s cheap, decently dark, lasts til the end of the day and best part is it hasn&#x27;t transferred. will definitely buy another back up.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described.  This eyeliner is easily one of the best ones out there.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best pen type liquid liner I&#x27;ve tried. Previous types I&#x27;ve used have always seemed to have issues having enough liquid in the tip, I&#x27;d have to shake and shake them to get the tip wet enough to give me a nice solid, clear line. I&#x27;ve been using this liner for over a month now and have never had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid comes out easily and the tip is super fine. My eyes water A LOT and It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. If I do cat eyes, they do end up disappearing by the end of the day, but it hangs on longer than most. Of course, it always helps to set a liquid liner with a bit of powder (I use an angled brush and black shadow).</li>
    <li> I am SO happy I finally got to try Dolly Wink liner! I absolutely LOVE the brush and the tip, which isn&#x27;t too fine but slender enough to use in your eye&#x27;s inner corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used everything from drug store - Chanel liquid liner and honestly, Dolly Wink has been by far my absolute favorite! The name and packaging are also super cute too, which is a huge plus. Forumla is dark, but not super heavy like Chanel liner and doesn&#x27;t smuch like Lancome (I&#x27;m telling you, I&#x27;ve tried them all lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing this liner again and will look for it in brown. Extremely happy with my purchase!!! Shipping was also super faster than anticipated!</li>
    <li> Best and easiest to use liquid eyeliner. Amazing application and foolproof applicator. Seriously worth the $15.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent purchaser of Koji products, especially anything Dolly Wink related. I have used many different eyeliners, and this one is currently my favorite! Just practice on the back of your hand a few times and you will be fine!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It goes on so easily and it is really water resistant. You can easily draw a very fine line or thick. You are in control. I have never had it flake or smudge. A great liner.</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever bought! It is a little pricey but since buying in Sept. I have used this about 5 days a week with no signs of the well going dry. I bought another after realizing how much I liked this product, afraid that it would run out quickly as most of my favorite liquid liners tend to do. It is extremely easy to apply and while it is easy to get a very thin, natural looking line, you can darken or bold the line with more pressure. I have been using liquid liner for about 10-15 years, but there are some that I am never able to use without it looking messy. That is not the case with this liner. The few times I have made a mistake, it is very easy to clean off with a q-tip and reapply without having to wash my entire lid or face with cleanser. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend with any eye makeup, I have slept in this liner and it looks just about the same as when I went to sleep. It washes off easily, I don&#x27;t feel any irritation with this product, and I don&#x27;t find little black makeup deposits in my eye later. I will keep buying in the future when my current two pens finally run out!</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner i have ever used</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice and applies very easily but can dry out very fast.</li>
    <li> Got the actual product not some knock off. Works great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner! I&#x27;ve heard great things about it and after I ran out of my Physician&#x27;s Formula Liquid Eyeliner (very similar to this one) I decided to try this out. Also found this NEW one that is a deeper black. It lives up to its claims of being a very deep black color. Also it is very long lasting so it never flakes or smears off during the day! It is a little trickier to work with at first, but once I had it down, there was nor turning back. The point is so fine and thin that you can create the perfect winged-liner with such precision! Would purchase again &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for over a month and i still have a lot of product left! The fine brush tip enables me to tight line/make very precise deep black lines.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but from a store.  I&#x27;m reviewing it because I&#x27;ve done a lot of experimenting trying to find the right liquid eyeliner for me and am hoping that my experiences can be helpful for someone else on the search for a reliable liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, so different cosmetic solutions will react differently.  It affects the staying power of the product and how the pigmentation appears.  For instance:  I was in Sephora and a saleswoman was telling me &amp;#34;this one is the darkest!&amp;#34;  Makes a line on her hand, which is dark.  Then I use the same pen and make a line and it&#x27;s just kinda weak and watery looking.  She couldn&#x27;t believe her eyes, haha!  So it made me feel a little better after trying out different formulas and seeing that they didn&#x27;t work out the way that they had for other reviewers/bloggers: the Marc Jacobs liner turned into a sticky goo on my eyelids.  Stila wasn&#x27;t that dark, and disappeared after a couple of hours.  Basically, I would go to Sephora and try on a different liquid eyeliner on each eye and then go in to work and see which formula performed best.  I decided that Sephora&#x27;s liquid eyeliner had the best staying power and was dark enough, but the felt tip brush crapped out on me so my search started over.  I hit google with &amp;#34;best liquid eyeliner asian eyelid&amp;#34; and found Dolly Wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about me:  I&#x27;m of Korean descent and work in the service industry.  So it&#x27;s double duty difficult to find a liner that will make it through a work day on my greasy, hooded lids.  Until there was Dolly Wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolly Wink will last through a double, not perfectly (it seems realistic it would break apart on the inside corners of my lid where my eyelid fold is), but is way better than any other formula I&#x27;ve used.  The wing is still in solid condition by the end of the day!  I really love the fine brush tip, but it&#x27;s important to be mindful of recapping the product so that none of the hairs are pushed backwards (which I did in a rush).  I can do a super fine line, or  make a bolder cat eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;ve had similar experiences with the formulas as I&#x27;ve had, you might want to try Dolly Wink.f the hairs are pushed backwards (which I did in a rush).  I can do a super fine line, or  make a bolder cat eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;ve had similar experiences with the formulas as I&#x27;ve had, you might want to try Dolly Wink.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. This is now my everyday eyeliner. Will buy again soon! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used eyeliner from many brands such as Lancome, Bobby Brown, Mac, Make up forever... By comparing them, I found Lancome is good, but too bold, and the volume is small. The bobbi brown one doesn&#x27;t work well for me, and the gel needs a brush to use. After watching some videos of making up on Youtube, I saw this one, and this version is the updated one. It is really thick, black and it is just like my ink pen which is 0.3 mm or less. I really love this one, as it is very easy to apply to my eyes, and it keeps for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I love a thicker end of my eyeliner, and this liquid eyeliner is convenient to use. I&#x27;ll definately buy another one later!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye liner. I stumbled across it looking for cheaper options than at the drug store but after reading the reviews I figured I would shell out a couple more bucks to try this liner. Great decision! It is so easy to apply. I&#x27;m not Asian but I have cat like eyes and can easily apply too much eye liner. The tip of this pen is super fine and I&#x27;m able to get my liner just right. I will be using this eye liner exclusively now. Thank you amazon for helping me find products I love that I would never have been able to find before!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a liquid eyeliner pro, and have used liquid eyeliner since I was 16. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about this, and i really liked the product. The color is a true black, and the wand is very easy to use. The liquid is very smooth and the wand tip is amazingly precise, I was very impressed. The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t smudge, even after a hot summer afternoon watching a baseball game in the sun. However, I was quite surprised at how thin the tip was, and took a little getting used to. It&#x27;s good for people who want a very precise, thin line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective one but mine was pretty dried up and waxy within a week.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews. This eyeliner does everything the description says. I&#x27;ve searched for precision liquid eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smear, flake or lose pigmentation since 2009. I&#x27;ve tried expensive, affordable, liquid, gel, popular, discounted, professional HD, etc .... The search is over. Pigment stays dark and black. It dries quickly upon touch to skin - doesn&#x27;t smear. The tip is so fine, that I can deposit color in between my sparse lashes at the base, which make my lash line look fuller. It did not flake during day long wear. It was still in tact after dance workout (although corner of my left eye had decreased pigment when I used a towel to wipe sweat from that part of my face - quick touch up corrected easily) Sometimes my eyes tear up when keeping my eyes open for long time during application of makeup ... tears did not ruin what I already applied. The width and length of pen are ergonomically comfortable for precision placement. The tip can be used at an angle or on its side for a wider line. Or, you can use another color liner as your liner and keep the black as thin line at the base to really set a thin base line for your lashes. I got tons of compliments on my eyes. Even thought I had mascara on when I did not (I was going for day look). Mascara just amplifies and intensifies once I&#x27;ve established a base line. I provided a close up pic</li>
    <li> Very fantastic eyeliner!! I love Dolly Wink products. Although it did smudge a little when i rubbed my eye,but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable at all. The precision of the tip is phenomenal and makes prefect thin or thick wings.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I have EVER used, and I have gone through 15 brands, all different kinds of pencil, liquid, and gel/creme eyeliners! This is VERY easy to apply, no need for an angle tip brush--if you want precision, look no more! This has the TINIEST tip I have ever seen so you need to be careful where you draw your lines because it places them EXACTLY where you want them to go! However it&#x27;s so easy to apply and it&#x27;s much easier to fix a tiny tip mistake by adding more rather than blotching a huge ink stain on top of your eye (as with some liquid liners). I will continue to get dolly wink&#x27;s eyeliner from now on whenever I run out. It may seem really black (as it is a deep black), but it softens up when you blend it with your eyeshadows. The BEST part is that it is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day, AND is still easy to take off with my neutrogena makeup remover wipes! Some eyeliners have been a bitch to take out because they just do not come off (and yet they still somehow smudged, even though I use a good mac primer...). Look no more for a good eyeliner! Thank you bubzbeauty for recommending this!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner it&#x27;s super dark, smooth, easy to use. It never smudges or faked it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> awful.  terrible color and watered down.  never used and couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> Not a good eye liner especially for the cost .</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t good at liquid liner and this helped so much. It makes it easier (cause it&#x27;s never easy) and faster to do. It doesn&#x27;t migrate. I don&#x27;t do liquid liner every day and was worried that this was too $$ and would dry out on me in a day or 2 like the other pens I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s been months and still going strong. Ink black and a fine point for control. Holy grail.</li>
    <li> I had no control with the tip. It seemed too long. It kind of made my eyes itch after a while I just ended up scratching my eye so badly and having it rub off. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I honestly would buy a dozen of these if it was available in my area. It&#x27;s so precise and easy to apply! And it lasts like that for the whole day! Absolute perfection! My one and only major problem with it though is that it already starts to dry after the 4-6th time. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she really had heard good things about it. It&#x27;s not available over her in the USA so I had to order it online. It came very fast and made an excellent stocking stuffer for Christmas. My daughter says that this is THE best eyeliner she has ever used.  She loves it. It goes on easy &amp; looks great.</li>
    <li> MAN, THIS STUFF IS THE BOMB.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to apply it once a day, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all! Also, I use this eyeliner when I cosplay and it doesn&#x27;t run at all! Even when it&#x27;s 90 degrees and I&#x27;m sweating buckets in countless layers of clothes. I was afraid the color would be too light, but its very dark.&lt;br /&gt;It glides stupendously and has great precision. I&#x27;ve tried bout 20 other brands, from American, to Korean, and to Japanese, but this eyeliner is definitely the best out of all that I&#x27;ve tried. Totally worth my money, and I can&#x27;t see myself using any other eyeliner in the future.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again. :-)&lt;br /&gt;EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE ♡</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyeliner! The tip is very fine so you can really draw a thin fluid line with this eyeliner. I got it when I went to Japan and ordered through Amazon when it was finally time to replace it.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner due to its pen-style application! Fairly long-lasting, even for my naturally oily lids.</li>
    <li> Not that great. As far as product goes, it was nice. I love the fine tip of the brush and also that it&#x27;s a fiber brush and not a felt tip. That being said, the eyeliner wipes itself off if you go over a line you just made so layering isn&#x27;t really an option and it&#x27;s not the darkest. I recommend Physician&#x27;s Formula Eye Boosting liquid liner in Ultra black- same nice tip of brush end and way better quality.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner seems to have the finest tip of any I have had. Stay on well for me. I&#x27;m a fan. Thanks Youtubers!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the best one i have bought, you can make really fine lines, or make it thicker and it does not smudge, the color goes on so well you dont have to go over again to make it darker, love it!</li>
    <li> Best Eyeliner I have ever had, none messy easy to remove</li>
    <li> I have double eyelids and it&#x27;s been so hard trying to find an eyeliner that does&#x27;t smear/smudge. My friends recommended me to this and I gotta say I love it! It doesnt smear at all and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. The only reason it&#x27;s getting a 4 out of 5 is because it is very very watery. I know it&#x27;s a liquid liner, but i&#x27;ve tried my far share of liquid liners and this is the most watery liner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This liner is a shiny soft black, not a flat super dark black. If you don&#x27;t know the difference, you may want to research it and decide what you are looking for. Again I used this with Wet and Wild Fergie eye primer (the plain daily kind) and it stayed, to my amazement, all day long. the only places it seemed to rub off was in the corner of my eyes, which makes sense. The tip does have a lot of give and is very flexible. this can be very useful in getting details correct. But if you are needing something that&#x27;s a bit shorter or more stiff, you may want to consider another brand.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a liquid eyeliner, and I find it so easy to apply!! It glides on smoothly and can get very close to the lash line because how thin the brush is. The &amp;#34;ink&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t come out a lot at every stroke, so it&#x27;s very buildable and easy to avoid mistakes.</li>
    <li> Meh, this product is okay! I heard a lot of raves about it and put off buying it as long as possible due to it being so over priced! It&#x27;s a good eyeliner due to its fine point and dark pigmentation, however, after having water on it and you rub it, it comes STRAIGHT off. Not good for oily eyelids, just a good eyeliner in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great liquid eyeliner! Smooth application. Easy to use.  Dark, bold, black color.</li>
