      <li>I&#x27;ve been very loyal to them</li>
      <li>I am always worried the concentration of the perfume isn&#x27;t as strong as it is in stores...</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it was no longer available in my dept. stores.</li>

      <li>This is a fun, summery fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and I think they should treat their customer&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>I thought it was the mail service at fault at first but on opening the box</li>
      <li>Much to my wife&#x27;s dismay, we found out that this product is being discontinued by Ralph Lauren!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance and it is becoming more difficult to find in the stores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s getting hard to find since it was discontinued, but it smells amazing!</li>
      <li>When it was delivered the box was wet and it had a strong scent, turns out the bottle had leaked all over the box!  </li>
      <li>The perfume is long lasting and a good price.</li>
      <li>Audigier\\&quot; (the one in the pink bottle w/ skulls and hearts that say \\&quot;LOVE KILLS SLOWLY\\&quot;)</li>
      <li>I really felt I got a bargain.  </li>
      <li>Item exactly as described - boxed and new.  </li>
      <li>I received this product and it had leaked and was only 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast and in new box.  </li>
      <li>Worth the extra cost to find it!</li>

      <li>but this was exactly the same and obviously paid less...</li>
      <li>I really loved this fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on me for long which is disappointing.</li>

<li> Half the price I would normally pay going into a department store!</li>
<li> Large size bottle for little cost!  </li>
<li> My granddaughter got  what she wanted, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune for a small bottle  of perfume that was marked up because of its name.</li>
<li> I was very sad when Ralph Lauren discontinued my favorite scent by them.</li>
<li> Only about half of the bottle of perfume made it to my house.    </li>
<li> I am so sad that amazon can&#x27;t ship it to Hawaii, since the stores here only sell the 1.7 oz, and its almost as much as the 3.4 oz on amazon!...   </li>
<li> I&#x27;m saddened due to the discontinuation of this product on the market...</li>
<li> ( previously used maybe?)    </li>
<li> Got it on Amazon for half price!</li>
<li> I checked all the department store and specialty store prices and found  that Amazon was offering this product for at least half off the price  of \\&quot;name\\&quot; stores.  </li>
<li> I was so sad when I found out they discontinued it in retail stores, however I found that perfume outlets like perfumania and etc., still sell the smaller 1.7oz size.</li>
<li> Seriously, this is a winner.</li>
<li> I sent an e mail but have heard no reply :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with amazon at the moment.   </li>
<li> I was shocked!    </li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t stay away from my wife even more so because she loves to ware this fragrance.... Lol&lt;br /&gt; this is an amazing product!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Love Rocks! It&#x27;s getting hard to find since it was discontinued, but it smells amazing! Worth the extra cost to find it!</li>
    <li> WHY WOULD YOU DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT???????? WHY???????????</li>
    <li> I buy this regularly for my wife from Amazon because she loves it. However we recently noticed that it is no longer being carried in stores. Much to my wife&#x27;s dismay, we found out that this product is being discontinued by Ralph Lauren!</li>
    <li> When I bought the perfume for 37.00 a 3.4, and received it from Amazon.com I looked at the invoice the price was for 62.00 for a 3.4 fl.  So now I have to try and fix that error.  Otherwise came as stated.</li>
    <li> First let me say the spray itself was fine.  How ever...  When it was delivered the box was wet and it had a strong scent, turns out the bottle had leaked all over the box!  I thought it was the mail service at fault at first but on opening the box I was shocked!    1. The box for the spray itself was already opened. ( previously used maybe?)    2. The cap for for the bottle was no where to be found.    3. There was no packaging. ( it was free to bounce around spilling all over the place.)    4. Only about half of the bottle of perfume made it to my house.    5. Lastly because you can&#x27;t return flammable items in the mail?? ( so I was told)  I&#x27;m stuck with it and out 44.00 dollars.     I&#x27;m really disappointed with amazon at the moment.   I&#x27;ve been very loyal to them and I think they should treat their customer&#x27;s right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saddened due to the discontinuation of this product on the market...this is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE perfume...this is what &#x27;wooed&#x27; my husband and he still loves it on me :)  A+ from me!! :)</li>
    <li> This is a fun, summery fragrance.  It&#x27;s tangy but floral, with lingering citrus notes.  The perfume is long lasting and a good price.</li>
    <li> awesome value for this wonderful smelling fragrance...all ages would love to wear it...I am still wondering how it can last for so long-I get compliments every day!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance and it is becoming more difficult to find in the stores. Thank you for offering it! Each day I wear it people smile and tell me that I smell good. It never gets old and it makes me feel happy. I am on my sixth bottle and I never tire of it!</li>
    <li> This was a great product to buy on Amazon.com.  I checked all the department store and specialty store prices and found  that Amazon was offering this product for at least half off the price  of \\&quot;name\\&quot; stores.  I really felt I got a bargain.  My granddaughter got  what she wanted, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune for a small bottle  of perfume that was marked up because of its name.</li>
    <li> Half the price I would normally pay going into a department store! Can&#x27;t pass this one up!</li>
    <li> This scent has a tropical appeal to it. My wife is making me write this review. Seriously, this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I really loved this fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on me for long which is disappointing. It could be my genes, but if not, I would recommend another brand.</li>
    <li> Large size bottle for little cost!  Shipped quickly!  Item exactly as described - boxed and new.  Very happy with this purchase as I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume in stores by me.</li>
    <li> I received this product and it had leaked and was only 3/4 full. I sent an e mail but have heard no reply :(</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume and I get compliments on it all the time.. I was so sad when I found out they discontinued it in retail stores, however I found that perfume outlets like perfumania and etc., still sell the smaller 1.7oz size. I love the way the smell changes overtime, but it still has a really beachey/summery kick to it.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume ever since it came out in 2007.. I am so sad that amazon can&#x27;t ship it to Hawaii, since the stores here only sell the 1.7 oz, and its almost as much as the 3.4 oz on amazon!...   p.s I&#x27;ve tried \\&quot;Ed Hardy by Christian Audigier\\&quot; (the one in the pink bottle w/ skulls and hearts that say \\&quot;LOVE KILLS SLOWLY\\&quot;) and it&#x27;s my current replacement while I look for another ralph rocks... if you like Ralph rocks, you might like that Ed Hardy perfume... just a tip.. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted Ralph Rocks for Christmas but it is no longer sold in stores. Got it on Amazon for half price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It is light and stays on all day.  I constantly get compliments.  [[ASIN:B000WZRBF0 Ralph Rocks by Ralph Lauren for Women, Eau De Toilette Natural Spray, 3.4 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> YOU CAN BUY THIS PERFUME WITH CONFIDENCE, IT IS AUTHENTIC AND THE SCENT IS SO FRESH AND CLEAN. I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT FOR MY BEST FRIEND AND SHE WAS SO IMPRESSED I FOUND IT BECAUSE IT IS A DISCONTINUED ONE. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE :)</li>

    <li> Could not find this perfume anywhere at any price.  Shipped fast and in new box.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I used this product almost exclusively several years. Don&#x27;t remember why i quit. Perhaps it was no longer available in my dept. stores. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
