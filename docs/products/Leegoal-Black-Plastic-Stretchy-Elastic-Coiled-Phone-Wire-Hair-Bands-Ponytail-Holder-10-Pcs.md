### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very cheap Plastic!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great hair bands!</li>
      <li>They are great!</li>
      <li>Perfect for not damaging hair or leaving lines in your hair after working all day.</li>
      <li>Whoever had the bright idea of using this type of coil for a hair tie deserves a medal!  </li>
      <li>Came on time and are great.</li>
      <li>(ask my hairdresser - LOL.)  </li>
      <li>so im happy.</li>
      <li>Please continue to sell them and, for sure I will continue to buy them!!</li>
      <li>For the price they are good though.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>I was delighted to &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; those hair bands.  </li>
      <li>Love them for my curly hair!</li>
      <li>so I decided to buy my own batch.</li>
      <li>They were a lot smaller than I thought they would be but for the price they work really great and great for braids.</li>
      <li>Too good to be true</li>
      <li>I just started using them today, they are fine!</li>
      <li>I knew that they were shipping from China, but that was 3 weeks after even the latest estimate given.</li>
      <li>These are ok.</li>
      <li>I love using these coiled plastic elastics on my &amp;#34;blow dry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; days.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these hair ties.</li>
      <li>These are the best hair bands for anyone with long hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to take off, didnt pulled my hair :)</li>
      <li>One order I received super nice hair ties that made my pony tail bouncy.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as the ones I&#x27;ve gotten else where but still ok quality.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know it shipped from china, it is so cheap, and I love it</li>
      <li>They look good but don&#x27;t have much utility to me.</li>
      <li>It breaks so easily.</li>
      <li>Too stretchy and easy to break</li>
      <li>and it seems to stretch easily</li>
      <li>No pull, easy to loop over for tighter tail.</li>
      <li>and these do just fine during my hikes and yard work.</li>
      <li>I enjoy them.</li>
      <li>i ordered the small size, it holds my hair perfectly even though i have fine hairs.</li>
      <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t score 5 stars is they are not coiled as tightly as my original ones.  </li>
      <li>If you styled hair and what to save it till the evening, but during the day you prefer a pony-tail - these bands are good decision, because in the evening the styling will be the same as you did it before the pony-tail.</li>
      <li>These would be good for fine hair, and someone that don&#x27;t like a tight hold.</li>
      <li>At first I was dissapointed, but in a couple of days it returned to its original shape.</li>
      <li>I was hesitating to buy them, but my friend recommended them because they don&#x27;t break the hair, so far I love it.</li>
      <li>Why would I pay more for the exact same thing?  </li>
      <li>I was able to wrap it around my hair twice, and now I have to wrap it 4-5 times to get the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Within the first two weeks 3 of them snapped while I was securing my pony tail.  </li>
      <li>maybe thats just the quality for such a cheap price but their not bad.</li>
      <li>They definitely opened me up to the world beyond rubber bands though :)</li>
      <li>The first one broke, came apart where joined after 3 weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, the plastic on these is just not good.</li>
      <li>I love them because they don&#x27;t leave the same crease in your hair that normal hair ties do.</li>
      <li>Since my hair is fine I have to double the band to make it work</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get caught in your hair and when you use them and take them out your hair goes back to it&#x27;s original style without leaving the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; that normal hair ties leave.  </li>
      <li>the really worked by not leaving dents in your hair like a normal hair tie</li>
      <li>Also I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>I think that after considerable use, they would stretch out too much but for $2, who cares?  </li>
      <li>But they are so inexpensive, I can live with that.    </li>
      <li>During the third day of using my first hair band it snapped.</li>
      <li>They are the perfect dupe for more expensive (but essentially the same) coil gizmos (I forgot the name of the original product, sorry).  </li>
      <li>They arrived earlier than anticipated and i really needed them</li>
      <li>It firmly holds my locks in place and is fairly cheap.</li>
      <li>Shipping was slow but that was okay.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I would have to tie my hair into a pony to work on something faster by keeping my hair of my face, and these elastics do a wonderful job without the annoying pony tail line.</li>
      <li>I really wish the product listings would show estimated shipping time on the item &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; the final checkout screen, I would have ordered them from a different seller.  </li>
      <li>I got 100 tiny, flimsy, thin, much-too-stretchy to be effective pony tail holders.</li>
      <li>They keep my hair in place like no other scrunchie I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t stretching it too much or using it roughly.</li>
      <li>Trying 3rd one, using only loosely, NO TWIST in it, just as circle around hair &amp; will see it lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>2nd one broke also after not long use.  </li>

<li> There are 10 in the package and although they look small, they really stretch out and can be wound around a ponytail several times with ease.  </li>
<li> Too small, doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all, total waist of $, went straight to trash.</li>
<li> They stretch a little too much which makes your hair very loose inside the ponytail.</li>
<li> They are tiny but hold hair well loosely.</li>
<li> Having long hair is not an issue anymore because of this product.</li>
<li> These do not pull hair out like it states, BUT after 2 uses it has stretched out.  </li>
<li> I definitely recommend these little things for anyone who wants to get rid of funky creases that usually come with wearing a ponytail.</li>
<li> You then have to loop it 20 times to get it tight enough.</li>
<li> These little coils are fantastic and don&#x27;t leave weird marks in my hair like coated elastic bands.  </li>
<li> It took 3 weeks before i got them, it was expected though coz they had to shipped it here from korea.</li>
<li> This will be very loose.</li>
<li> But don&#x27;t expect to do anything active.</li>
<li> They are very loose and there is no way to get a tight ponytail from them.</li>
<li> but they don&#x27;t stay tight</li>
<li> I bought a few some 25 years ago and lost all but one that I literally treasure</li>
<li> Several have broken while putting my shoulder length hair in a ponytail.  </li>
<li> I have heavy hair and they can&#x27;t seem to hold them.</li>
<li> Product Quality Unpredictable and Inconsistent!   </li>
<li> , it is not too tight on your hair and scalp, as I have very heavy hair</li>
<li> No more having to use 2 ties.</li>
<li> No more having to tighten your pony.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not too thick or heavy.  </li>
<li> Very small.</li>
<li> poor quality.</li>
<li> for thin hair or kids</li>
<li> The hair bands are very thin, small and useless.</li>
<li> Unfortunately i have broken a couple within a month of using them.</li>
<li> Very bad quality, it tears in couple weeks of using</li>
<li> Just awful.</li>

    <li> They are tiny but hold hair well loosely. I have curly hair that is moderate thickness and these do just fine during my hikes and yard work. I enjoy them.</li>
    <li> Just awful. They took 2 months to arrive. I knew that they were shipping from China, but that was 3 weeks after even the latest estimate given. They are very loose and there is no way to get a tight ponytail from them. If you&#x27;re going for a look like you would get from tying a ribbon around your hair, this will work and will actually stay. But don&#x27;t expect to do anything active.</li>
    <li> Love these. Perfect for not damaging hair or leaving lines in your hair after working all day. Not as strong as the ones I&#x27;ve gotten else where but still ok quality. Unfortunately i have broken a couple within a month of using them. They arrived earlier than anticipated and i really needed them so im happy. (Cant find these any where)</li>
    <li> U can only use them once! They won&#x27;t shrink back together!</li>
    <li> I was delighted to &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; those hair bands.  I bought a few some 25 years ago and lost all but one that I literally treasure (ask my hairdresser - LOL.)  The reason I didn&#x27;t score 5 stars is they are not coiled as tightly as my original ones.  Since my hair is fine I have to double the band to make it work and it seems to stretch easily which may be a problem for me.  Please continue to sell them and, for sure I will continue to buy them!! Thank you!!  Also I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> They are great! You don&#x27;t see any trace on your hair after these bands. If you styled hair and what to save it till the evening, but during the day you prefer a pony-tail - these bands are good decision, because in the evening the styling will be the same as you did it before the pony-tail.</li>
    <li> I love using these coiled plastic elastics on my &amp;#34;blow dry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; days.

    <li> Too small, doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all, total waist of $, went straight to trash.</li>
    <li> I was hesitating to buy them, but my friend recommended them because they don&#x27;t break the hair, so far I love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair bands! You can have a pony tail, remove the hair band and have hair that doesn&#x27;t leave the pony tail look.!</li>
    <li> Came on time and are great. I love them because they don&#x27;t leave the same crease in your hair that normal hair ties do.</li>
    <li> I dont think I will ever buy anything else</li>
    <li> Too stretchy and easy to break</li>
    <li> These little coils are fantastic and don&#x27;t leave weird marks in my hair like coated elastic bands.  There are 10 in the package and although they look small, they really stretch out and can be wound around a ponytail several times with ease.  They are the perfect dupe for more expensive (but essentially the same) coil gizmos (I forgot the name of the original product, sorry).  Why would I pay more for the exact same thing?  Whoever had the bright idea of using this type of coil for a hair tie deserves a medal!  They don&#x27;t leave kinks in my hair at all, unlike elastic bands.  I&#x27;m ordering another package so I don&#x27;t run out.  I think that after considerable use, they would stretch out too much but for $2, who cares?  I&#x27;m stocking up!  I definitely recommend these little things for anyone who wants to get rid of funky creases that usually come with wearing a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Product Quality Unpredictable and Inconsistent!   One order I received super nice hair ties that made my pony tail bouncy. so I placed an order for 100. I got 100 tiny, flimsy, thin, much-too-stretchy to be effective pony tail holders.</li>
    <li> for thin hair or kids</li>
    <li> No pull, easy to loop over for tighter tail.</li>
    <li> Love them for my curly hair! They don&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
    <li> Several have broken while putting my shoulder length hair in a ponytail.  I bought larger coiled pony tail holders at my local grocery store and have lost two of them so I ordered these.  They were smaller than I realized, but still seemed to work.  Within the first two weeks 3 of them snapped while I was securing my pony tail.  The rubber is not as elastic as the ones I&#x27;ve owned before.  They also took eternity to arrive.  I really wish the product listings would show estimated shipping time on the item &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; the final checkout screen, I would have ordered them from a different seller.  These took weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Not even stretchable. It breaks so easily. It&#x27;s literally the size of a lifesavor.</li>
    <li> I just started using them today, they are fine! Easy to take off, didnt pulled my hair :)</li>
    <li> These get my hair caught in them if I loop it twice.  I cant take it out without ripping my hair.  i&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, the plastic on these is just not good.</li>
    <li> It took 3 weeks before i got them, it was expected though coz they had to shipped it here from korea. Overall, i am using it. Good thing i ordered the small size, it holds my hair perfectly even though i have fine hairs.</li>
    <li> The bands are about 1 1/4 inches in size &amp; do hold hair it it&#x27;s not too thick or heavy.  The first one broke, came apart where joined after 3 weeks of use.  But they are so inexpensive, I can live with that.    UPDATE:  2nd one broke also after not long use.  Trying 3rd one, using only loosely, NO TWIST in it, just as circle around hair &amp; will see it lasts longer.  Anytime you put a twist in it, it breaks/comes apart where ends fused together.</li>
    <li> Work well, but after one use they streatched out. At first I was dissapointed, but in a couple of days it returned to its original shape.</li>
    <li> I started using one of these the day I got them and the really worked by not leaving dents in your hair like a normal hair tie does. I started telling people how well they worked. During the third day of using my first hair band it snapped. I wasn&#x27;t stretching it too much or using it roughly. I don&#x27;t think they should break after only 3 days. Too good to be true</li>
    <li> These are the best hair bands for anyone with long hair.  They don&#x27;t get caught in your hair and when you use them and take them out your hair goes back to it&#x27;s original style without leaving the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; that normal hair ties leave.  My only wish is that they were a bit bigger.  Still you can&#x27;t beat them for the price!!!</li>
    <li> The hair bands are very thin, small and useless. Do not buy them.</li>
    <li> These are tiny, nothing like what i expected, I have seen some that are twice the size and much more durable, I was not happy at all with these.</li>
    <li> They definitely work and don&#x27;t hurt my head but they don&#x27;t stay tight and I&#x27;m the type of person who needs that feeling maybe thats just the quality for such a cheap price but their not bad. They definitely opened me up to the world beyond rubber bands though :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these hair ties. My cousin keeps these lying around the house so I decided to buy my own batch. They keep my hair in place like no other scrunchie I have ever owned. No more having to tighten your pony. No more having to use 2 ties. Shipping was slow but that was okay. I can&#x27;t see them ever breaking on me but I would definitely repurchase!!!</li>
    <li> Having long hair is not an issue anymore because of this product. It firmly holds my locks in place and is fairly cheap.</li>
    <li> These do not pull hair out like it states, BUT after 2 uses it has stretched out.  A lot.  I was able to wrap it around my hair twice, and now I have to wrap it 4-5 times to get the same &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;.  I should have only bought one pack to try - but I bought multiple....</li>
    <li> Very cheap Plastic!!!!!</li>
    <li> poor quality. not as pictured.</li>
    <li> Oops, maybe it gave the size and I missed that, but just assumed these were &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; pony tail size, instead of the tiny ones they are.</li>
    <li> They look good but don&#x27;t have much utility to me. I have heavy hair and they can&#x27;t seem to hold them.</li>
    <li> Very small. Doesn&#x27;t hold hair up at all</li>
    <li> They were a lot smaller than I thought they would be but for the price they work really great and great for braids.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it shipped from china, it is so cheap, and I love it, it is not too tight on your hair and scalp, as I have very heavy hair and I don&#x27;t like something to hurt my scalp. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These over stretch over time. You then have to loop it 20 times to get it tight enough. These also kink and tangle on itself when you take them off.</li>
    <li> Very bad quality, it tears in couple weeks of using</li>
    <li> These are ok. They stretch a little too much which makes your hair very loose inside the ponytail. For the price they are good though. But don&#x27;t reccomend to anyone looking for a tighter ponytail. This will be very loose.</li>
    <li> These would be good for fine hair, and someone that don&#x27;t like a tight hold.</li>
</ol>
