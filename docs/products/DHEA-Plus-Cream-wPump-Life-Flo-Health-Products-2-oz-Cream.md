      <li>Seems to be effective.</li>
      <li>This is a nice feeling cream that absorbs in to the skin and is in a pre measired pump that has no order.</li>
      <li>I have tried many supplements over the yrs....</li>
      <li>so glad I bought 2 bottles to start with.  </li>
      <li>I think Testromax works better for me than this, but this is cheaper.  </li>
      <li>but I suggest splitting the dose between your face and thighs for better absorption.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell you this cream is better than another, but it does work the way I use it.  </li>
      <li>I will give it some more time but my faith says &amp;#34;save your money.&amp;#34;</li>

      <li>It is a very significant amount of hair loss.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive stomach, so it&#x27;s great to have something that bypasses the belly.</li>
      <li>As for the cream: decent, but no appreciable differences; somewhat greasy; pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pump dispenser is easy to use and the product seems to work well.</li>
      <li>I am feeling much better fewer hot flashes better</li>
      <li>but I think it works fine.</li>
      <li>but their is a huge difference in the labels.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had friends have fantastic results with this product.</li>
      <li>I found this to be not only great</li>
      <li>I used it primarily on my face and it seemed to be too oily.  </li>
      <li>some of those were good, but so far this has had a noticeable effect.  </li>
      <li>When applied in cream form in gets right into our blood and works better than when taken in pill form.</li>
      <li>I am on my 3rd day and so far I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
      <li>I feel more intense.  </li>
      <li>And now instead of a full body sweat</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a nice moisturizer so far.  </li>
      <li>Tho I am as sweet as they come anyway.</li>
      <li>Good product but only 15mg.</li>
      <li>Then on my next order I purchase the best selling one which looked to be the same thing</li>
      <li>This cream is easily absorbed into the skin and is without noticeable fragrance.</li>
      <li>I purchased Life-Flo Blue label and I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>I ended up using all of it, and I have to say I&#x27;ve noticed that I have more energy throughout the day, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have not noticed any side effects.</li>
      <li>have noticed that I feel more intense physically so far.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>So, for others who are also sensitive I must tell you that the difference is huge.</li>
      <li>Sure enough when I did it again</li>
      <li>I thought this would be better than tablets based on a Mercola article, but the only time I get side effects was from trying to use this cream transdermally.  </li>
      <li>I have been having hot flashes for about 7 years now</li>
      <li>The hot flashes have gone from having them throughout the day to maybe 1 or 2 a day.</li>
      <li>for the delivery: if you purchase this product be sure to find a different delivery method.</li>
      <li>I will come back for more results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 65 yrs old and my muscles have never been stronger and more developed.</li>
      <li>Also I have not tried any other dhea creams so I cannot tell you which is the best only that this one has had an affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  20 days later.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a mild warm flash that doesn&#x27;t last very long at all!</li>
      <li>This product is convenient to use, but from information we have read from Dr. David Brownstein the dosage may be higher than he recommends so we use a half stroke of the pump applicator which would still be higher than recommended, to safely use DHEA  a lab test of hormone level should be performed.</li>
      <li>So, for all of you sensitives who have experienced Green and Blue and can not figure out the difference, I am writing this review just for you.</li>
      <li>I am now using Life Flo creams instead of Rx Creams, which cost 2x as much.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it is pre-measured with the pump</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice anything after using this.  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to guess at how much to use.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
      <li>This particular blend combined with Vitamin E and MSM helps rejuvenate your skin and reduce inflammation.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This dtuff I would highly recommend</li>
      <li>I am a 40 year old female with a full hysterectomy.</li>
      <li>Have only used this a short time, so I will say I like it, thus far, if I see better things, I may upgrade this to 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>I needed help getting my hormones balanced, but did not want to take traditional oral hormones, so this was my first try at it.  </li>
      <li>but I purchased the Blue first just by luck.</li>
      <li>and then I ran out of the Blue as it was the first one I had ordered.</li>
      <li>I went to my Gyno but my insurance doesn&#x27;t help much on an estrogen cream, besides I wanted to try to find something as natural as possible.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to taking the tablets occasionally when my job is very demanding.</li>
      <li>I think applying it directly to the skin would give me side effects too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural way to cope with vaginal pain from the thinning of my vaginal walls.</li>
      <li>stars given because I don&#x27;t really feel any different from using it.  </li>
      <li>Now as far as using the cream.  </li>
      <li>In fairness I will tell you that I am extremely sensitive to all herbs and supplements.</li>
      <li>I am 55 years old and went through mentalpause at 46, the thinning thing started about 3 or 4 years ago.</li>
      <li>Am going to try natural harmones to see if it will help.</li>
      <li>I have weak bones and the meds the doctor gives me has too many side effects</li>
      <li>Starting to feel like my old self again.</li>
      <li>I only bought it because I&#x27;ve read hormones should be released in the blood stream, as they would naturally, and not taken orally.  </li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating enough to make me never purchase this type of pump action bottle again.</li>
      <li>Have only been using this a week and it has cut my hot flashes down about 90%.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Green label first, I would never have purchased this product again</li>

<li> I imagine Life-Flo loses lots of would be customers by not stating clearly on the label that the Green label has Chamomilla and the Blue label does not have Chamomilla in it.</li>
<li> I started to use the Green at night and the Blue label during the day</li>
<li> but Green is different as it has Chamomilla in it.</li>
<li> Not much time to see the results,</li>
<li> Suddenly after I received the Green label it seemed as though the stuff had stopped working</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really cannot speak to whether it works as advertised or not (haven&#x27;t had blood work, and no increase in energy or anything), but I can say that this is a very thick luxurious feeling cream that doesn&#x27;t leave any nasty greasy film that makes you want to clean scrub it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars given because I don&#x27;t really feel any different from using it.  It&#x27;s just a nice moisturizer so far.  Will update later.</li>
    <li> This product smells great, feels wonderful on my skin and is easy to dispense.  HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I am feeling much better fewer hot flashes better sleep much more energy. My moods have also improved for the better!</li>
    <li> This works without the negative side effects I had when taking DHEA tablets orally and what happened to it passing through the liver. I could do without the heavy moisturized feeling with this cream though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural way to cope with vaginal pain from the thinning of my vaginal walls. I&#x27;ve been using DHEA Plus for just over a month and it&#x27;s working already. I am 55 years old and went through mentalpause at 46, the thinning thing started about 3 or 4 years ago. I went to my Gyno but my insurance doesn&#x27;t help much on an estrogen cream, besides I wanted to try to find something as natural as possible. My husband and I had the best sex we have had in years thanks to this cream!!!</li>
    <li> I am a 40 year old female with a full hysterectomy. I used this stuff to help with sex drive and vaginal atrophy and dryness. It does help with all three moderately(honest review) enough you notice a difference and so will your spouse. It make your face skin look great if you apply it there but I suggest splitting the dose between your face and thighs for better absorption. I put it on my private parts but it burned. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my hair falls out after a couple weeks of using it. Its no the products fault its just the added hormones in your body can do that to people. After I stop using  it takes about a month for my hair to start growing back. It is a very significant amount of hair loss. Good luck, Sally</li>
    <li> Starting to feel like my old self again. Feel more energetic and hopefully it will activate my libido (I am 57), my cousin recommended it to me after her gyno put her on it. I have a very sensitive stomach, so it&#x27;s great to have something that bypasses the belly. I hope it will replace the Estrace cream that is too expensive and messy!</li>
    <li> This cream is easily absorbed into the skin and is without noticeable fragrance. The pump dispenser is easy to use and the product seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had friends have fantastic results with this product. I think I&#x27;ll give it another shot- probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> Good product but only 15mg. of active DHEA. Men need around 50mg. I should have done more reserch before buying. Seems to be effective.</li>
    <li> This product is convenient to use, but from information we have read from Dr. David Brownstein the dosage may be higher than he recommends so we use a half stroke of the pump applicator which would still be higher than recommended, to safely use DHEA  a lab test of hormone level should be performed.</li>
    <li> I bought this knowing that it might have side effects for women, so I avoided using it on the face and only used it on the chest, stomach, and thighs. I ended up using all of it, and I have to say I&#x27;ve noticed that I have more energy throughout the day, and I&#x27;m lucky enough to have not noticed any side effects. All in all a good purchase.</li>
    <li> As for the cream: decent, but no appreciable differences; somewhat greasy; pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the delivery: if you purchase this product be sure to find a different delivery method. The bottle never pumped any lotion out and I had to physically take it apart in order to get at any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating enough to make me never purchase this type of pump action bottle again.</li>
    <li> I found this to be not only great but I saw immediate changes in my skin, hair and over all mood . Tho I am as sweet as they come anyway. This dtuff I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I needed help getting my hormones balanced, but did not want to take traditional oral hormones, so this was my first try at it.  I am so glad I did, as it works wonderfully, and I do not have to worry about side effects.</li>
    <li> Have been reading that this might be good for the bones. I have weak bones and the meds the doctor gives me has too many side effects so I am stopping them. Am going to try natural harmones to see if it will help. This is a nice feeling cream that absorbs in to the skin and is in a pre measired pump that has no order. I like it very much. We will see how it works.</li>
    <li> Have only used this a short time, so I will say I like it, thus far, if I see better things, I may upgrade this to 5 stars.  DHEA is supposed to help the hormones and enhance all the hormones, Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I am on my 3rd day and so far I&#x27;m very impressed.  I have tried many supplements over the yrs....larginine, ginseng, goat weed, etc and some of those were good, but so far this has had a noticeable effect.  Now I did do some research before buying this and found out some good info.  The pill form messes with the liver and does not convert to testosterone or estrogen.  It converts to dhea-s whatever that is.  Now as far as using the cream.  I read you do not want to place this on the skin it does not absorb as well that way (plus if your skin that you put it on gets onto kids it can mess with them).  Now hopefully this does not gross you out, but ladies you should put this on your \\&quot;inner lips\\&quot; and guys should put it on their bum hole.  Also for the guys I read to take zinc with this and that will prevent the testosterone from converting into estrogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that I feel more intense physically so far.  Maybe this will change to more muscle mass?  I&#x27;m just hoping for a libido boost, but in any case I have noticed a difference.  I will try to post an update to this after I have been taking this for longer.  Let me know if this is helpful.  Also I have not tried any other dhea creams so I cannot tell you which is the best only that this one has had an affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  20 days later.  I have used this almost every day with zinc.  I think the effect was wearing off so I took 2days off.  Sure enough when I did it again it had an increases result.  I cannot tell you this cream is better than another, but it does work the way I use it.  I feel more intense.  I think if you have a temper this could make it worse.  Erections are also stronger.</li>
    <li> Cream has an odd odor but it&#x27;s not obnoxious.  The cream dispenses well and has about what it says, 15 mg. of dhea in it.  I used it primarily on my face and it seemed to be too oily.  I will try other areas.  Not thrilled with the product though.  I only bought it because I&#x27;ve read hormones should be released in the blood stream, as they would naturally, and not taken orally.  That said, though, I think I prefer the oral tablets over this cream.</li>
    <li> I think Testromax works better for me than this, but this is cheaper.  I don&#x27;t feel that this product is effective.</li>
    <li> Not much time to see the results, but I think it works fine. I will come back for more results.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! The hot flashes have gone from having them throughout the day to maybe 1 or 2 a day. And now instead of a full body sweat it&#x27;s just a mild warm flash that doesn&#x27;t last very long at all! The result was immediate....so glad I bought 2 bottles to start with.  I have been having hot flashes for about 7 years now and I have tried everything believe me and this cream has given me the fastest and best results yet.  I really like the fact that it is pre-measured with the pump so I don&#x27;t have to guess at how much to use. I can sure tell when I forget to put it on too!</li>
    <li> I purchased Life-Flo Blue label and I liked it very much. Then on my next order I purchase the best selling one which looked to be the same thing but the label was Green but Green is different as it has Chamomilla in it. I thought their was no difference or it would have said so on the front of the container but I was so wrong. Suddenly after I received the Green label it seemed as though the stuff had stopped working and I was so tired and sleeping all the time and sometimes getting sick in the stomach. In fairness I will tell you that I am extremely sensitive to all herbs and supplements. So, for others who are also sensitive I must tell you that the difference is huge. I started to use the Green at night and the Blue label during the day and then I ran out of the Blue as it was the first one I had ordered. Finally I got my magnifying glass and studied the ingredients on the container as you can&#x27;t read them on the amazon site. As soon as I found the Chamomilla I knew immediately what was putting me to sleep and as it accumulated was making me sick in my stomach and very tired during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Has I purchased the Green label first, I would never have purchased this product again but I purchased the Blue first just by luck. I imagine Life-Flo loses lots of would be customers by not stating clearly on the label that the Green label has Chamomilla and the Blue label does not have Chamomilla in it. So, for all of you sensitives who have experienced Green and Blue and can not figure out the difference, I am writing this review just for you. I have to give it one star because it does not explain this fact on the front label. It should say \\&quot;contains Chamomilla\\&quot; or \\&quot;does not contain Chamomilla\\&quot;. Chamomilla calms some people down but it puts some of us to sleep or makes us sick if we use too much of it. Now you don&#x27;t have to feel confused about this if you are a sensitive type like I am. I think it is a great product but their is a huge difference in the labels.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this a week and it has cut my hot flashes down about 90%. But I still have some night sweats but not as bad.  This only thing is it takes a little with to completely absorb. If you use it put it on 20 to 30 minutes before getting dressed or other contact.</li>
    <li> This product is the best way to use DHEA. As we age our bodies do not produce enough DHEA. When applied in cream form in gets right into our blood and works better than when taken in pill form. It works best when put on your fore arms and you rub your arms together. I take the excess and apply it to my face. When used for 25 days you will see and feel the difference. It&#x27;s keeps you younger and when used with exercise it helps get rid of the fat in the belly area that is almost impossible to get rid of. It enhances your ability to exercise and is well accepted as an anti aging supplement. This particular blend combined with Vitamin E and MSM helps rejuvenate your skin and reduce inflammation. I play a lot of tennis and the natural increase in testosterone caused by DHEA improves my game. I&#x27;m 65 yrs old and my muscles have never been stronger and more developed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am now using Life Flo creams instead of Rx Creams, which cost 2x as much. I saw a naturopath who did a saliva test for hormones and was on Rx, (prescription) creams for 6 months. At my time of retesting, I switched to Life Flo creams and they work just the same. I had suffered many years with terrible hot flashes and now NO MORE!</li>
    <li> Been on this product for three weeks now with no results what so ever. I will give it some more time but my faith says &amp;#34;save your money.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Rubs on well. No odor.</li>
    <li> Again Amazon delivery is on time and the items well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it works well but it leaves your skin a little sticky, however it&#x27;s not as bad (sticky) as the Progesterone Cream, though.&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better than tablets based on a Mercola article, but the only time I get side effects was from trying to use this cream transdermally.  I think applying it directly to the skin would give me side effects too.  I&#x27;ll stick to taking the tablets occasionally when my job is very demanding.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice anything after using this.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Good as lotion - has great ingredients. Was not very effective as a DHEA supplement.</li>
