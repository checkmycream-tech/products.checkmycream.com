      <li>and they both liked it.  </li>
      <li>Like I like it and a nice smell to it.</li>
      <li>I missed a friends birthday and wanted to get him something nice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
      <li>Good for a vacation smells fantastic</li>
      <li>smells great our son wants to buy his own.</li>
      <li>Very light but refine scent...</li>
      <li>I love it on my husband.</li>
      <li>I should have read the descriptor better-</li>
      <li>The thing about cologne is it needs to be put on their skin, and so many men spray it on their clothes.  </li>
      <li>I looked up the top notes for his favorite scents (Sean Jean..</li>
      <li>was a lot more fragrant.</li>
      <li>Ladies love it.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Gucci Pour Homme cologne too, and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I cant remember the others off top) and went by the recommendations to find this Versace.</li>
      <li>This is a very good &amp;#34;Stink Purdy&amp;#34; it arrived as only a sample</li>
      <li>Light, almost misty and refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>Very nice I surely will buy from the same seller.</li>
      <li>Lies about the size and its a cheap fragrance.</li>
      <li>So they both tried it and put it on their skin, and they both said it was a light scent</li>
      <li>do the smell test confirmed that the bottle I bought this vendor was not as fragrant.</li>
      <li>Great smelling, would order a bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>It is not too overwhelming but people can definitely smell it on you in a good way.</li>
      <li>Good for traveling its only a sample bottle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a wonderfully sweet but spicy smell.</li>
      <li>the item was shipped quickly</li>
      <li>It is an original product, good quality, delivery in time set, it&#x27;s expected sales of products come sealed, with no sign of struggle or attempted opening</li>
      <li>However, after wearing this product for a few weeks I noticed that people were no longer commenting on how great I smell.</li>
      <li>Love the product - wish however, I knew it was only a free sample</li>
      <li>I know some of you customers want the real deal at bargain prices and this one sweet deal.</li>
      <li>It is even marked not for sale under where it says free sample.</li>
      <li>THEY FIRST MISLEAD ME BY WHAT I PURCHASED</li>
      <li>I bought a good bit of sampler colognes and this one is by far my favorite, with Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water coming in behind it.  </li>
      <li>I received this product and was very excited because this is the only cologne I wear.</li>
      <li>These are a spitting image of their bigger brothers - the box and bottle are identical, including all the fancy engravings on the top (which is obviously plastic) and the smooth texture of the box.</li>
      <li>small bottle but smells really good</li>
      <li>this smaller size grave a chance to sample some fragrance scents before investing in a large size that wasn&#x27;t available at dept stores</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d hv gone to the mall &amp; actually gotten it free.</li>
      <li>My son really likes the fragrance</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very eazy to hide and always excite my girlfriend....</li>
      <li>my mistake really</li>
      <li>It sits really well with my body and doesn&#x27;t offend anyone I have come across.</li>
      <li>small, and handy.</li>
      <li>I put him together a gift box with a few different samples of &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; products, and he absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>Pretty small and doesn&#x27;t really last long, does have the great smell but never noticed by anyone.</li>
      <li>The cologne works with our body oils, and gives us each a unique smell good or bad.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it is in a small package so he can try it before he spends a lot of money on it.....</li>
      <li>my son and his girlfriend thought that the small bottle was hilarious.</li>
      <li>It came early and the size (if I had to describe it) is about as big as a 9v battery.</li>
      <li>This is the cologneI wanted however it is super small like a box matches.</li>
      <li>so it was smaller then expected, haha.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my little brother and his exact words were &amp;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small size but the smgell is worth it.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s small size but the smgell is worth it.</li>
<li> the fragrance doesn&#x27;t  last long at all</li>
<li> I expected it to be larger ,but...</li>
<li> The only thing I didnt like is that the perfume was in a little box that said &amp;#34;sample not for sale&amp;#34; which was marked out with a black marker and was just a little..tacky to me.</li>
<li> Very small, only slightly larger than a sample size, but in the same bottle as its big brother.</li>
<li> Do not underestimate how tiny this bottle is, it&#x27;s smaller than a pack of Tic- tac&#x27;s which is a bit small for the price in my opinion</li>
<li> no I strongly suggest to just save your money or just go ahead and buy the regular sized 40 or 50 dollar bottles.</li>
<li> I like other Versace colognes</li>
<li> TOO SMALL BIG PRICE!!!</li>
<li> USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING FROM THE FRAGRANCE DEALS -</li>
<li> 8 dollars plus for a barbie size spray not worth it.</li>
<li> Hands down everyone I had</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t forget that this is a really small bottle; always look at the ounces, but a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I like the little bottle of mens cologne.</li>
<li> SO I LEFT POOR FEEDBACK.  </li>
<li> Hey Guys, i just received this product and this small bottle does it come with a sprayer??</li>
<li> I used this small unit at bed time..</li>
<li> have i received a damaged product or does the small bottle does not have a sprayer.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t  expect to be so small</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never bought cologne this small</li>
<li> I knew it was gonna be small but not this small.</li>
<li> IF I REMOVED THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK</li>
<li> This is a very, very small bottle.  </li>
<li> Yes it is a very small bottle, but this is a 0.17 Ounce .</li>
<li> This is a very small bottle, but this is what I needed to purchase for two presents.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great smelling, would order a bigger bottle. I ordered the Gucci Pour Homme cologne too, and this is my favorite. Great sample size to test the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M ACTUALLY WRITING THIS REVIEW TO WARN EVERYBODY  THAT TheFragranceDeals IS THE WORST VENDOR YOU COULD POSSIBLY DEAL WITH.  DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THEM!!!    THEY FIRST MISLEAD ME BY WHAT I PURCHASED SO I LEFT POOR FEEDBACK.  THEN SOMEONE NAMED \\&quot;EDWARD\\&quot; CALLED, SAID THEY&#x27;D MAIL ME A BIGGER BOTTLE SINCE I WAS DISAPPOINTED IF I REMOVED THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK SO TRUSTING THEM I DID.  NOTHING EVER CAME TO ME AND THEY WOULD NOT RESPOND TO ANY OF MY FOLLOW UP EMAILS.  I OPENED A CLAIM ON THEM...    USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PURCHASING FROM THE FRAGRANCE DEALS - I DON&#x27;T WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE GET DECEIVED THE WAY I WAS!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and just revived it in the mail today. DO NOT BUY. It&#x27;s made for someone the size of a Barbie!</li>
    <li> Do not underestimate how tiny this bottle is, it&#x27;s smaller than a pack of Tic- tac&#x27;s which is a bit small for the price in my opinion</li>
    <li> Great smell very quick delivery</li>
    <li> amazing...love it...but the size it&#x27;s ridiculous for the price...</li>
    <li> smells great our son wants to buy his own. says a lot for a teenager to want it.</li>
    <li> TOO SMALL BIG PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> Very small, only slightly larger than a sample size, but in the same bottle as its big brother.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant. Light, almost misty and refreshing smell. It&#x27;s Perfect for summertime.</li>
    <li> 8 dollars plus for a barbie size spray not worth it. I was being silly thinking 0.17 ounce was travel size.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my little brother and his exact words were &amp;#34;I smell glorious, I want to dump a gallon of this stuff on myself.&amp;#34; Enough said!</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s very strong. Like I like it and a nice smell to it. But I like the Versace Man a lot better!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any Versace scent.</li>
    <li> Lies about the size and its a cheap fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells great and great for travel</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small size but the smgell is worth it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Versace cologne! It is the best smelling stuff I have ever bought and worn! Ladies love it.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. I&#x27;ve never bought cologne this small so it was smaller then expected, haha. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a sprayer thing.</li>
    <li> I used this small unit at bed time..it&#x27;s very eazy to hide and always excite my girlfriend....surprise, surprise, surprise! Good supplier!!</li>
    <li> I bought a good bit of sampler colognes and this one is by far my favorite, with Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water coming in behind it.  It sits really well with my body and doesn&#x27;t offend anyone I have come across.</li>
    <li> Very light but refine scent... I use to like Versace dreamer but not anymore. Don&#x27;t pass up on this scent! BUY BUY BUY</li>
    <li> Love the product - wish however, I knew it was only a free sample I was paying $10 for. I&#x27;d hv gone to the mall &amp; actually gotten it free. It is even marked not for sale under where it says free sample.</li>
    <li> Pretty small and doesn&#x27;t really last long, does have the great smell but never noticed by anyone. Buy it now</li>
    <li> Good for traveling its only a sample bottle.  Smells really good.  I gave it to my son for valentines day.</li>
    <li> I like the little bottle of mens cologne. I realize it is a very expensive men&#x27;s fragrance, so that is why the bottle is a bit small. My son really likes the fragrance</li>
    <li> This item was a hit at Christmas- my son and his girlfriend thought that the small bottle was hilarious. I expected it to be larger ,but...I should have read the descriptor better- it was just as described- the item was shipped quickly</li>
    <li> It came early and the size (if I had to describe it) is about as big as a 9v battery. It smells great and I plan on buying the bigger bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I knew it was gonna be small but not this small. It&#x27;s smaller than the palm of my hand oh no I strongly suggest to just save your money or just go ahead and buy the regular sized 40 or 50 dollar bottles.</li>
    <li> Very nice I surely will buy from the same seller.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone. It is not too overwhelming but people can definitely smell it on you in a good way. It&#x27;s a wonderfully sweet but spicy smell.</li>
    <li> This is a very good &amp;#34;Stink Purdy&amp;#34; it arrived as only a sample so it was not a very big unit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sample size, if literally says that the item is not for sale-__-</li>
    <li> I missed a friends birthday and wanted to get him something nice but I didnt want to invest in a scent that I didnt know if he&#x27;d like, nor did I want to purchase something he already had. I looked up the top notes for his favorite scents (Sean Jean..I cant remember the others off top) and went by the recommendations to find this Versace. I put him together a gift box with a few different samples of &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; products, and he absolutely loved it. The only thing I didnt like is that the perfume was in a little box that said &amp;#34;sample not for sale&amp;#34; which was marked out with a black marker and was just a little..tacky to me. Otherwise speed of service and product was awesome!</li>
    <li> Great starter bottle to test before you buy</li>
    <li> Yes it is a very small bottle, but this is a 0.17 Ounce . If you are looking for something to sample before you make the purchase this is for you. It is enough to be put on skin.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells divine and because it is a sample size it&#x27;s perfect for a carry on bag when travelling!</li>
    <li> These are a spitting image of their bigger brothers - the box and bottle are identical, including all the fancy engravings on the top (which is obviously plastic) and the smooth texture of the box. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace Pour Homme - it&#x27;s just a nice fresh/clean smell, and I get compliments on it all the time. I bought 3 of these (one for backpack, one for car, one for work) so I can freshen up throughout the day after splashing some on in the morning from the big bottle I have at home. Buy it, and get yourself a stick - you&#x27;ll need it to keep the girls away...</li>
    <li> Good for a vacation smells fantastic</li>
    <li> small bottle but smells really good</li>
    <li> This is a very small bottle, but this is what I needed to purchase for two presents.  I wanted something both men could sample, and see if it&#x27;s what they like.  The thing about cologne is it needs to be put on their skin, and so many men spray it on their clothes.  The cologne works with our body oils, and gives us each a unique smell good or bad.  So they both tried it and put it on their skin, and they both said it was a light scent and they both liked it.  Hurray!!!</li>
    <li> This is the cologneI wanted however it is super small like a box matches. I was disappointed by the time it took my order to arrive. It was not by the date given</li>
    <li> small, and handy. smells good</li>
    <li> This is a very, very small bottle.  I like other Versace colognes, this is not one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> what a rip off the box  say&#x27;s sample not for resale&lt;br /&gt;what a rip off what a rip off .</li>
    <li> I received this product and was very excited because this is the only cologne I wear. The price was good and I trusted that there was some level of honesty with this vendor. However, after wearing this product for a few weeks I noticed that people were no longer commenting on how great I smell. I also notice my girlfriend would ask me if I were wearing any cologne and after a while I decided to compare the smell and color of the bottles I owned hear at my home and at my girlfriends place. Hands down everyone I had do the smell test confirmed that the bottle I bought this vendor was not as fragrant. 8 out of 8 friends identified the bottle I purchased from a local National retailer was a lot more fragrant. Then I showed the all the two bottles of cologne and the bottles were significantly different in color. STAY AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!</li>
    <li> It is an original product, good quality, delivery in time set, it&#x27;s expected sales of products come sealed, with no sign of struggle or attempted opening</li>
    <li> FAKE. Compared with my friends bottle bought from Macy&#x27;s and it was obvious I was ripped off.</li>
    <li> so tiny...lol...my mistake really</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t  expect to be so small the fragrance doesn&#x27;t  last long at all</li>
    <li> IT WAS A GIFT AND IT SAID SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE. DID NOT LIKE THAT.</li>
    <li> Enjoying it!Enjoyed it! I love it on my husband. I would buy again and I love that it is in a small package so he can try it before he spends a lot of money on it.....</li>
    <li> I have the bigger bottle of Pour Homme, I had to get a smaller bottle for traveling. This is the best smelling cologne for me by Versace. Love it!</li>
    <li> I know some of you customers want the real deal at bargain prices and this one sweet deal. Don&#x27;t forget that this is a really small bottle; always look at the ounces, but a little goes a long way. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> amazing fragrance! the bottle has no sprayer so be prepared for that but its a sample so don&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;m getting the big bottle.</li>
    <li> Says sample not for resale on box.  Smaller than I realized.</li>
    <li> tiny, but it did its job</li>
    <li> Hey Guys, i just received this product and this small bottle does it come with a sprayer?? coz the one i received does not have one!! have i received a damaged product or does the small bottle does not have a sprayer. DO i have to talk to the vendor about it??</li>
    <li> this smaller size grave a chance to sample some fragrance scents before investing in a large size that wasn&#x27;t available at dept stores</li>
