      <li>I love this hair remover!</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind, PERIOD.</li>
      <li>Great, at first.  </li>
      <li>keep it in for more than 10 if you need to.</li>
      <li>Better than Nair, IMO</li>
      <li>I left it on for 10 minutes, then rinsed it off, also used a washcloth, and it worked great!</li>
      <li>SHE WILL LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I would have been fine with that, but it lasted over 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT NEEDS 2 PEOPLE FOR THE BACK</li>
      <li>After having a similar product that worked (and smelled) great I decided to try this one.</li>
      <li>and it is so smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, after leaving it on for about 5 minutes, I would suggest getting in the shower and using a sponge to lightly brush the hair off.</li>
      <li>I got this, and was so excited to use it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it again.</li>
      <li>The smell was the most surprising, since it wasn&#x27;t as lye smelling as other cream/spray removers.</li>
      <li>The times when I have been able to keep it on the area for the whole time, nothing happens.</li>
      <li>Full from hip to ankle..and even if it can&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I left it on for the full 10 min, and it did a good job.</li>
      <li>Smell not bad.</li>
      <li>A bit strong, so do a test area first, like it reads on the can.</li>
      <li>It is worth it for me though.</li>
      <li>the bottle says, but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I used it first on my arm for 10 mins, and it come right off</li>
      <li>, it is more affordable than waxing and It will last for a couple hours.</li>
      <li>Will purchase more in the future.  </li>
      <li>an hour later so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>It was delivered faster than expected, and above all word great.</li>
      <li>it had helped removed a large portion of the body hair.</li>
      <li>hard to get good coverage because of the spray</li>
      <li>6 oz will not do the whole body.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>I have very course hair and nothing else</li>
      <li>Not as good on course thick hair as it says.</li>
      <li>I applied a little more just because the first application just dripped off.</li>
      <li>I then put it on and kept it in for 12-13 mins, on a small part of my leg where its the most hairy, and it came right off.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that this stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>The only thing I ever wanted was hair removal to last more than an hour</li>
      <li>This is so much better and easier than the creams used in the past.</li>
      <li>First it constantly slips off the area I put it</li>
      <li>My legs were smooth for a few days which was great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The only downside I can say to this, which isn&#x27;t really a downside just a shocker is that when I was doing the testing, I walked over to the bathroom and a glop of it fell off</li>
      <li>however it did completely irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and nothing happened after 13.</li>
      <li>I was so surprised.</li>
      <li>Hard to get on the right areas, and it seemed to slide right off.</li>
      <li>Some hair left behind, but also used a good shower soap to remove any left over solution.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very funny &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; so it ends up dripping everywhere leaving the area where it&#x27;s applied with little foam remaining.</li>
      <li>Compared to other options -- shaving, waxing, gooping and then pulling -- this is so much easier!</li>
      <li>It works pretty good, but no one mentioned how bad it smells!</li>
      <li>so I rarely use it :/</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and was afraid I would not be able to use it, but I didn&#x27;t have any rash or itch after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> only used this product on my legs twice and the bottle was empty..</li>
<li> I have used this continually for a long time and it works...</li>
<li> I now have big patches of red, raw bumps in both armpits.</li>
<li> Am looking forward to using it all summer long!!</li>
<li> Removes every very coarse, black hair on my body, in 10 minutes, with 0 irritation.</li>
<li> Yeah it says for hard to remove hair, and not to be used for sensitive people.  </li>
<li> I tried it in the shower once and even keeping my leg out of the water it all came off either due to gravity or humidity</li>
<li> I have very coarse, thick and plentiful hairs--all over--that are black.</li>
<li> if I even slightly move.</li>
<li> I used about half the bottle, and then the nozzle clogged.  </li>
<li> So, half a bottle wasted.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s a little drip-y.</li>
<li> YOU WILL WASTE A LOT</li>
<li> I think the aerosol aspect of it actually makes it smell worse.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
<li> this was a waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Unfortunately this product cause an extreme breakout on my back and neck.</li>
<li> However, the smell is very strong and it smells terrible.</li>
<li> Please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money on this item..of not for me but to save your skin the irritation!</li>
<li> Even worse is that it does smell and it smells worse than products like it that actually work.</li>
<li> Speaking of which, do not use down below!!!</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like earlier removal creams either.</li>
<li> All others I&#x27;ve tried caused bad irritation &amp; left a lot of hair.</li>
<li> When i got it the bottle was warped, and sprayed just the nasty &#x27;fresh smell&#x27;.</li>
<li> This is the absolute worst depilatory ever!  </li>
<li> just saying that is weird.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t imagine keeping this on for 10 minutes what with the slipage and everything.</li>
<li> burns it if hits the wrong area!</li>
<li> Like really bad, it stinks.</li>
<li> It is very tedious to shave, and I get prickly within an hour.</li>
<li> Bad idea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this on my legs and bikini area and it worked.  I have very course hair and nothing else has ever worked for me, but this was awesome.  I have the smoothest legs ever.  I highly recommend it!  (Oh, I did leave it on for the maximum 10 minutes.)</li>
    <li> I left it on for 10 minutes, then rinsed it off, also used a washcloth, and it worked great! Am looking forward to using it all summer long!!</li>
    <li> I got this, and was so excited to use it. When i got it the bottle was warped, and sprayed just the nasty &#x27;fresh smell&#x27;. After i finaly got it to spray on it burns it if hits the wrong area! It also left my hair in spots! I would never get this agian!</li>
    <li> After having a similar product that worked (and smelled) great I decided to try this one. Bad idea. First it constantly slips off the area I put it on if I even slightly move. I tried it in the shower once and even keeping my leg out of the water it all came off either due to gravity or humidity, I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t care. The times when I have been able to keep it on the area for the whole time, nothing happens. I rinse it off and find all the hair still there. Since the people who are saying it worked left it on for 10 minutes and not the 3 that it states on the bottle I&#x27;m thinking Sally Hansen needs to remake the bottle to say 10 minutes. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t imagine keeping this on for 10 minutes what with the slipage and everything. Even worse is that it does smell and it smells worse than products like it that actually work.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT NEEDS 2 PEOPLE FOR THE BACK YOU WILL WASTE A LOT IT YOU DO IT YOUR SELF SO HAVE A GIRL FRIEND FOR THAT SHE WILL LOVE IT THE NO HAIR THAT IS</li>
    <li> Hello.. this product does work but the smell is overpowering..  I recommend keeping your bathroom door open and window..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to get good coverage because of the spray but it works.  My legs were smooth for a few days which was great.&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product on my legs twice and the bottle was empty..</li>
    <li> it works to a degree. it had helped removed a large portion of the body hair. but did not remove all.</li>
    <li> Spray on aspect of this product is actually its downfall. Hard to get on the right areas, and it seemed to slide right off. I think the aerosol aspect of it actually makes it smell worse. Save your money and buy the cream instead.</li>
    <li> Removes every very coarse, black hair on my body, in 10 minutes, with 0 irritation. All others I&#x27;ve tried caused bad irritation &amp; left a lot of hair. This is the best of it&#x27;s kind, PERIOD. Speaking of which, do not use down below!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that this stuff really works!  I was pleased with the results!  Try it and you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. A bit strong, so do a test area first, like it reads on the can. Keep the bottle upright so it will continue to spray evenly. 6 oz will not do the whole body. but a good portion like both legs. ... Smell not bad. but shower floor does get slippery. Careful of sensitive areas, as the directions read. I left it on for the full 10 min, and it did a good job. Some hair left behind, but also used a good shower soap to remove any left over solution. This is so much better and easier than the creams used in the past. Yeah it says for hard to remove hair, and not to be used for sensitive people.  Wife loved it. but acts faster on her, than me.    Remember this is x-tra Strength    Tip... when done use some good body lotion for anything that is a bit irritable.</li>
    <li> Compared to other options -- shaving, waxing, gooping and then pulling -- this is so much easier! Just spray it on and then rinse it off. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like earlier removal creams either. I have very sensitive skin and was afraid I would not be able to use it, but I didn&#x27;t have any rash or itch after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst depilatory ever!  I applied following the directions.  It&#x27;s a very funny &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; so it ends up dripping everywhere leaving the area where it&#x27;s applied with little foam remaining. I applied a little more just because the first application just dripped off. I did a test patch after 5 minutes and the hair was still there so I kept it on for 10 minutes.  It removed nothing..however it did completely irritate my skin. I now have big patches of red, raw bumps in both armpits. Please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t waste your money on this item..of not for me but to save your skin the irritation!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t trust any sally hansen products the never work</li>
    <li> Does remove hair but the chemicals in it burn your skin as well</li>
    <li> I love this hair remover! Not as good on course thick hair as it says.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product cause an extreme breakout on my back and neck. I would have been fine with that, but it lasted over 6 weeks. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great, at first.  I used about half the bottle, and then the nozzle clogged.  It does work, but once the nozzle clogged, I couldn&#x27;t get it to spray. I have tried cleaning it, several times. So, half a bottle wasted. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I had to leave it on for 5-6 minutes which is longer then the bottle says, but it was worth it. The hair literally fell off I was so surprised. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or itch. However, the smell is very strong and it smells terrible. It is worth it for me though. I would recommend trying it because you never know how it will affect your skin. Also, after leaving it on for about 5 minutes, I would suggest getting in the shower and using a sponge to lightly brush the hair off. This sort of helps it along.</li>
    <li> good product. Better than Nair, IMO</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...I tried several brands this was a waste of time and money. It runs and does not work that well. The best I have tried is Veet no odor and I was amazed how great it was.</li>
    <li> I have used this continually for a long time and it works...</li>
    <li> It works pretty good, but no one mentioned how bad it smells! Like really bad, it stinks. The smell makes me want to vomit all the time so I rarely use it :/</li>
    <li> My daughters loved the convience of the spray.  They felt it worked great.  Transaction and Item were both wonderful.  Will purchase more in the future.  Thank you. I recommend seller &amp; product.</li>
    <li> It was delivered faster than expected, and above all word great. The smell was the most surprising, since it wasn&#x27;t as lye smelling as other cream/spray removers. I have very coarse, thick and plentiful hairs--all over--that are black. It is very tedious to shave, and I get prickly within an hour. I used it first on my arm for 10 mins, and it come right off and it is so smooth. I then put it on and kept it in for 12-13 mins, on a small part of my leg where its the most hairy, and it came right off. The result was the same as shaving only, little black dots over pale skin...but the dots that were there were very very soft and fine an hour later so I&#x27;m satisfied. The only thing I ever wanted was hair removal to last more than an hour and this did. I&#x27;m excited to use it again. I feel like i can get both my legs with this...Full from hip to ankle..and even if it can&#x27;t and I have to use 2, it is more affordable than waxing and It will last for a couple hours. The only downside I can say to this, which isn&#x27;t really a downside just a shocker is that when I was doing the testing, I walked over to the bathroom and a glop of it fell off and I came back 2 mins later and it took the wax off the tile...just saying that is weird. And it&#x27;s a little drip-y. Those are the only downsides, that I personally don&#x27;t mind overlooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also keep it in for more than 10 if you need to. Im going for 15 mins next time. I have sensitive skin and nothing happened after 13.</li>
