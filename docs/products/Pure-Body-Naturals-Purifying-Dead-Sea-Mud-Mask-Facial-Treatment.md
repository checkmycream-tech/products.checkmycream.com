<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff! My complexion and skin is so much softer, brighter, pores smaller...will buy again!</li>
    <li> Truly amazing miracle in a bottle</li>
    <li> Love this dead sea mud mask! Made my face super soft and my skin is clearing up pretty quickly after just 1 use! I&#x27;m very happy with this product! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have had this product about a week, and I am very impressed. I also have the GlamGlow Youth Mud mask, and honestly this Dead Sea Mud Mask is my favorite. You get much more product for a cheaper price. The consistency of this Dead Sea Mud Mask is easy to work with. The smell is pleasant, it smells clean (if that makes sense). My face feels extremely smooth, clean, and soft. I also haven&#x27;t had any breakouts with this either! I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Loving this stuff!  Made a visible difference the first time.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this product coz my wrinkles are gone and I look more younger than ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;my face is free from any acne,pimples and blackheads it truly helps me a lot!</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell!  It gets my skin all glowing and smooth.  Could be a little easier to spread on, but the end result more than makes up for it.  The jar is filled to the brim, and a little seems to go a long way.  It comes with a manufactured date sticker on it, so you know exactly how old the product is.  It says only to use it once a week, but it really hard to follow those guidelines because I want to do it more often!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Just using it the first time made my face soft and clear. Even in the morning when I woke up my face looked really good.</li>
    <li> Very impressed so far, pores are noticeably smaller and skin seems softer.</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just superb &amp; exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud consistency is perfect; It goes on smoothly, creamy smooth, and dries gently and supple on the skin. It smells delicious, a subtle pleasant natural fragrance type scent - cannot describe/ identify it, however, it&#x27;s lovely. The ingredients are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The results are wonderful - it leaves my skin feeling super clean, smooth and youthful. A great product, that I&#x27;m grateful to have been able to purchase as a promotional sample in return my objective review. It deserves the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Had red itchy bumps the next day. Never had a reaction this bad on my face will not use the rest....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start this review our by saying that I have used other wraps from another company claiming they they work.... They don&#x27;t. One application of these bad boys and I can already see a significant difference!! I love that I don&#x27;t have to wrap my body in plasric wrap. They are comfortable and work!! I was skeptical at first, but I have been losing baby weight and wanted my tummy to go down a few sizes. I think after I go through the two boxes I bought I will be purchasing more!! For sure!!!</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time and my only regret is that it does not come in a gallon size.  I would like to use this over my entire body.  my blackheads were removed and my skin is so soft.  I love this mud!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I am an avid mask user. Masks have always been a key product in my skincare routine. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the Dead Sea Mud Mask lately and after seeing how many great reviews it has, I had to give it a try! All I can say is WOW! I&#x27;ve always gone between 2 or 3 masks at a time for different skin problems. Not anymore! The Dead Sea Mud Mask has completely replaced those. After just one use I felt a major difference in my skin and by the next morning most of my skin problems had vanished. I have combination skin (oily t-zone and dry everywhere else) and large open pores on my nose. I use this twice a week after cleansing my face before bed. This is the first mask that hydrates my skin AND clears any acne and uneven skin tone. My biggest skin problem is the pores on my nose. I&#x27;ve always found no matter what I use they just don&#x27;t go away. This mask fixed that problem, too! I&#x27;ve had a lot less dirt and oil build up and my pores are starting to look smaller and less noticeable. It&#x27;s not often you get a mask that does it all. A little goes a long way and I see this mask lasting quite a while. I will definitely be repurchasing when the time comes. I would highly recommend this mask to anyone! Dry, oily, acne, uneven skin... this mask will fix it.</li>
    <li> I never write negative reviews but this gave me a horrible allergy..now I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll recover. Adding a photo so that future customers know the potential side effects.</li>
    <li> what makes this a killer deal is its potential to snowball further if improved and wanted to improved by the manufacturer is already raking in thousands.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have been using this mask for the past month every other day I love it my skin is smooth, the pores are smaller I love it easy to do it before showering. I have a sensitive skin and the mask doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
    <li> This mask left my skin feeling amazing and cleared up my problem areas fast!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, ir really do make your skin soft, but it didn&#x27;t harden like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I try it as soon as I got it  me n hubby all I got to say wow we loved it</li>
    <li> This stuff feels amazing!! A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m looking forward to lasting results.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to contact the seller but I received my mud mask today and the lid was off of it and mud inside the box. It was a bit messy! Haven&#x27;t tried the product yet but was disappointed about the mess in the box 😕 Hopefully the mask is good and makes me excuse the mess at delivery time.</li>
    <li> I got this today and was very excited about trying it out after seeing the exceptional rating and reviews on this mud mask. I&#x27;ve only used sheet masks before, so I can&#x27;t compare it with anything else. I&#x27;m very pleased with how my first mud mask experience. Firstly, the shipping was quick. It arrived right on time. Now going into the product itself. I love the consistency and texture of this mask. I applied it using my fingers and it glides on very smoothly on the face. The smell is amazing. I can&#x27;t exactly tell you how it smells like, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering. I left it for about 15 minutes. While it was on, I could feel my skin tighten, just as a good mask does. And then rinsed it out with warm water. It left my skin baby soft and I&#x27;m pretty sure it reduced the appearance of my black heads on my nose. As this is my first try with this, I don&#x27;t expect it to miraculously cure all my face concerns. However, I&#x27;m looking forward to what it can do in the long run. I will update my review after I have used it for a while. Overall, I think this is a good quality mask that can be used to just pamper oneself.</li>
    <li> Husband fairly satisfied</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The smell is amazing. Works wonderful. I highly recommend it. Will be purchasing more soon!!</li>
    <li> This was a great mask, though it wasn&#x27;t perfect for my drier skin.  It made it a little more dry than usual, but it cleared up the acne quite a bit.  I just needed to use some moisturizer afterwards.  Really nice scent, too :) Smells like sea water.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and quality. I wanted to try this mask, but did not expect such good quality. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and stiff. My skin looks more hydrated and healthy, and I can tell a improvement of my complexion. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Got rid of my acne!! Still working on the scars but my skin looks great so far.very happy :)</li>
    <li> This was the greatest item that I was approved for for trying a product in exchange of a review.. I love it. My face has never lookd better or felt so soft. I used it on my hands and feet as well and the feel and look amazing.</li>
    <li> I have a combination skin type. The mask was great at soaking up the oils but it left my face feeling really dry for a couple of days. It was also messy and difficult to wash off compared to other clay mask products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many face masks and I can honestly say this one is the best one! Such a perfect spa feel like mask!</li>
    <li> Relaxing spa experience after a long day at work.  As a working mom life is demanding and I&#x27;m pulled in every direction.  This Dead Sea Mud Mask is a refreshing escape from reality.  It made my face so smooth and refreshed.  My 11 year old even wanted to enjoy the fun.  The next morning I still felt refreshed and had very soft skin.  I look forward to continuing to use this to relax and give myself mini facials. Thanks for letting me try this out for to review.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK FOR ME. ITS WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> wish I could use it more than just once a week.  It makes the poors shrink</li>
    <li> Amazing feeling after applying it in the face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the skin was softener</li>
    <li> I used this mask a few times and it makes the skin very soft. I expected miracle results for acne and blackheads by some of the reviews, and this product does not deliver that. But it does clean, soften, and tighten the skin. So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutly amazing face mask!! Like holy wow. My skin feels so soft and it smells amazing!! In love love love with this product. Will defiantly buy again when I run out. Which will be some time from now because while its a kinda small jar has a bunch in it and very thick. Over all. Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love this. I have used a lot of masks in my life, I love them!! This one is great. It is not clumpy at all, I would almost say it has a whipped feel to it but it&#x27;s not thin, you are definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to going on smoothly, it is also very light. I can walk around for the 10-15 minutes while it sets and barely notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight tingling but that&#x27;s to be expected with these types of masks. The tingling is not bad at all, much less than other masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good too. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in texture. This has actually broken me out</li>
    <li> I love using face masks. Dead Sea Mud mask has a nice subtle scent. It does&#x27;t have that chemical scent like most products do. The sea mud comes packaged in a nice plastic like jar. It&#x27;s dark grey in color and is pretty thick.You don&#x27;t have to apply a lot to cover your face. I applied the sea mud on my face and left it on for 15 minutes. By the way, you may want to warn people around you that you have this on so you don&#x27;t scare them.. lol... While drying I felt a cooling sensation on my face which I found was pleasant. After 15 minutes passed, I used a facial buff with warm water and used circular patterns to clean the sea mud off and patted my face dry with a towel. The skin on my face felt clean, tighter, and had a nice glow to it. Overall I really like the sea mud. Next time I&#x27;m going to use it on my husbands face and see how he likes it.&lt;br /&gt;**This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> Ive always wanted to try a mud mask but never got around to purchasing anything. This mask came up on a deal and I decided to act upon it. After applying the mask, you wait 10 minutes or so to take it off (wash). Once you wash it off with warm water, let me tell you, it leaves your skin feeling silky smooth soft! Ive read the reviews that it helps lighten scars and it helps release toxins and im excited to see these results too! Highly recommend and would most definitely purchase full price.</li>
    <li> THis is the best mask i have ever used. will last a long time since a little goes a long way. leaves skin feeling soft. LOVE THIS.</li>
    <li> I just received the product in the mail yesterday and used it last night. About 20 minutes after I removed the mask for my face, my face itched and had a burning sensation. I woke up this morning with my face puffy, red, and itchy! This is definitely not the product for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel so soft. I love this product!</li>
    <li> My face felt deeply clean and radiant with just one use. I have sensitive skin, I left it on for 10 mins, it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. Unlike most mud masks, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin a bit. After the mask, I put my light texture oil-free moisturizer on and nothing else, my face has never felt this soft and smooth in a long time. And the smell is so nice, love it!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this mud mask</li>
    <li> I loved that product i have been using it for 3 times till now and like it with good price and last long ♡</li>
    <li> I was worried that many of the reviews all published in June/July might not be accurate but this product didn&#x27;t work for my skin. It was very lackluster both as a mask and as a spot treatment. I have used better and I will be sharing this with my family &amp; friends to see if they have better results.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the mud mask and it left my face feeling so soft and smooth afterwards. Not to mention how a little bit goes a long way with this. I probably won&#x27;t have to buy another jar for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I was given a discount to try this product. Im so glad I decided to try it. It is amazing! I&#x27;m in my 30s and I break out worse now than I did as a teen I love mud masks so I finally decided to give this one a try. I used it as soon as I got it and I already see and feel a difference. My pores are so large I can see them with out the magnifying mirror and after removing the mask I saw a visible difference also I had a few spots were my acne hurt and as soon as I felt the mask start drying I could feel the pain starting to subside. I still am broken out but the swelling and redness went down. I can&#x27;t wait to make this part of my weekly regiment and see how much more my skin will improve. It was so relaxing next time I am going to leave it on longer and pamper myself.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Let me just say how fun this stuff is to put on. To me it so relaxing and thank goodness its has a good smell to it! I decided to buy it when I saw that it would help fight acne. Now I don&#x27;t have it as bad as a lot of people do, but I&#x27;m still self conscious about it. This is the only thing I have changed in my routine and now my skin is amazing. Acne gone, pores smaller, fine lines seem to be going away, and ole&#x27; boy what a great glow does my face have!!! I am so happy I came across this!!!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I went ahead and tried this Dead Sea Mud Mask. Unlike a lot of other masks that I have used, this one didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like it was in cement when I had it on. It was one of the most comfortable masks to wear that I have ever used. When I took it off, it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed, but not overly dry, which is a huge thing for me as most all face products really overly dry my face. I used this product before bed last night, and when I woke up my acne was actually better then it was when I went to sleep. Usually over night I end up with one or two new blemishes, but that was not the case after using this Dead Sea Mud Mask. This mask is also going to last me forever. Directions say to only use it once a week, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it when you are applying it either. The attached picture is after I used the mask last night, and honestly I put it on rather thick too. But you can&#x27;t even tell that I used it because even though I did put it on thick, I really didn&#x27;t need a lot at all. product was given for the purpose of review</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but I do have large pores and acne scars. My skin did feel softer after use, but the mask, for some reason, gave me more acne than before--the ones with white heads. It also caused redness for me. Despite the good reviews, the product is not for everyone. I have Asian skin, if anyone was wondering.</li>
    <li> Face feels softer and smoother after using it but I cannot say I have seen or felt miraculous results. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> already seeing positive changes</li>
    <li> Curiosity got the best of me due to the glowing reviews and pricing at $17.95 (now it has increased to $19.95).  I followed the directions applying to my face, and the first thing I noticed was a slight tingling sensation likely from the salts.  It does have a pleasant odor.  After washing off in the shower, my skin felt smoother.  That&#x27;s about it, it didn&#x27;t look any different.  However, when I followed through with the rest of my regimen (toning, then placing vitamin C serum, and lastly moisturizer) my skin gave off a healthy glow--not sure if this is placebo or the product.  I&#x27;ll keep using this weekly and may apply on other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/30/15 update:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mask for nearly a month now.  First off, I doubt this mask has any long-term changes to my skin but I do feel a difference in my skin after each use.  I follow the directions such as using only once a week and no longer than 15 minutes as suggested on the jar.  I have a combination oily skin, large  pores on my nose and cheeks, and occasionally will get dry patches but often blotchy after being exposed to water (washing my face, swimming, showering, etc).  For the remainder of the day using this product my skin feels smoother and appears more balanced and I notice that my skin is not as blotchy.  The pores remain but I do not expect any type of mud mask to reduce pores.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think there are any skin products that can reduce the size of the pores outside of sometime of medical procedure such as laser (although there are products that do reduce or mask the appearance of the pores, however that would be for another review).  I will continue to use this product weekly, I would re-rate the product to 4 stars given the relatively reasonable price compared to costly name brand products.</li>
    <li> Love this mud mask! It leaves your skin feeling very very smooth without a high price!</li>
    <li> Wonderful mask! My skin is soft and clean after using it. I am European and therefore facial/body masks junky lol; I give this one my approval wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask for myself and my teenage son.  I like that it is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a chemical or perfume smell, it smells clean &amp; earthy.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick &amp; creamy, easy to apply, and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I don&#x27;t think it shrunk my pores any, but it did exfoliated my skin some.&lt;br /&gt; My skin did get a dry tight feeling, until I followed up with a  moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;For my son, Is the one I really wanted to try this for, he has acne and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt; It does not do immediate visible results for his black heads. Maybe over time it would&lt;br /&gt; because it does exfoliate. But what it did help with was reduce redness of the regular acne.&lt;br /&gt; It didn&#x27;t make them disappear, but they went from red to pink the morning after using.&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be a great spot treatment for red acne.&lt;br /&gt;  This product was received at a lower cost for review and testing purposes. No&lt;br /&gt; compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based&lt;br /&gt;off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after just one use. I will keep using it and track the progress</li>
    <li> same as in spa....great product and not expensive at all</li>
    <li> definitely will purchase again</li>
    <li> This is an awesome mask. My daughter uses this every night and she loves how it feels and the results it provides.</li>
    <li> I love how soft and clean my face feels after using this.</li>
    <li> Received this a few days ago. I like any Dead Sea products. This made my skin feel so soft! Will see how it continues to change my skin. I did this as a review but this is my honest opinion. Love Dead Sea.</li>
    <li> This is an average mask. It is easy to apply, does not require wetting or mixing and overall it is somewhat effective and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for three stars is because it does not harden enough and as a result, it does not seem to extract as much as it should.</li>
    <li> This destroyed my skin. This product was hyped up by &amp;#34;unbiased&amp;#34; reviewers who received a discount on this product. I paid full price and found this mask to be one of the worst I&#x27;ve used, lower quality than drug store brands, in my honest opinion. My skin was left irritated and very red/dry.</li>
    <li> very happy, my skin looks great</li>
    <li> a very useful mud for cleaning faces and removing dead skins but be careful that the mud particle is sticky and should wash face thoroughly</li>
    <li> it has a very good smell, and it relaxes me...</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever!! My skin has never looked soooo good!! It is bright, soft and clear of those pesty blackheads! I will be using this once a week every week from now on!</li>
    <li> I have tried many other masks before, however, this is the first one that has left my skin feeling unbelievably soft. Great product</li>
    <li> It is scary looking to use, but this does the job.  I am older and have large pores, it tightens pores and give my skin a very nice feel.  Not dried out like most mud masks, MOISTURE..AHhhhh!</li>
    <li> This mask feels nice and cool while it is on. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face either so it will last a long time. My skin feels refreshed and clean after I wash it off.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. Glad to get it while on sale. I couldn&#x27;t afford to pay 50 bucks. There are products out similar to this but this one is good!</li>

    <li> This is a great product and leaves my skin really, really soft. You don&#x27;t need much and a little bit goes a long way, so even though this is one of the more expensive options on Amazon, it&#x27;s worth it because it will last a long time. It tingles a little bit when you put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> So far so good ! I had mud mask from other name brand. After applying my skin would feel tingling and tightening  up. However not on this one. I don&#x27;t feel anything. Maybe it&#x27;s the way supposed to be.</li>
    <li> One thing for sure is that it makes your skin soft. I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days so nothing else has really happened because I have blackheads and it&#x27;s not just gonna disappear after one use.</li>
    <li> Love this mud mask! One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used... not too drying and has a nice texture!</li>
    <li> This mask is really good. Did not have any allergic reaction after using it, which is great because I am super sensitive.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel like it did anything but make my skin soft after</li>
    <li> I have used this once to date.  I followed the directions and only left it on for about 12 mins.  It is easy to wash off.  There was a noticeable difference in how my skin looked and felt after using the Dead Sea Mud Mask.  It did not dry my skin out.  Even days later I think my skin looks clearer.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve used it and my skin is till the same! Welp!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome even though my 3 year old was scared to look at me lol</li>
    <li> This Product is hands down the best mask I have used! It is full of natural ingredients and not those nasty chemicals. I have sensitive skin and this has made my skin so much clearer and softer without irritating my skin. The only con I can think of is the weird looks that you get with it on haha. :) I definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for happy youthful skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and I really love it. I have sensitive skin and have had mild acne for years, and now that I&#x27;m getting older I feel like I really need to figure out how to manage my acne better. I&#x27;ve used this as per directions (once a week only) and it makes my skin SO soft and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has been much clearer lately. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if its just this mask or a combination of things but it definitely leaves my skin looking fresh and vibrant after I wash it off. And I do have a feeling its helping reduce my acne. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> it left my skin soft and clean and the smell is pretty good so I give this product a 5 star</li>
    <li> Excellent  Your skin will look better after the first use  I even give it as gifts</li>
    <li> This mask first off smells awesome!!!I have only used it a few times but it leaves my face feeling great and so smooth. a little goes a long way so the jar should last for a while. I have sensitive skin and usually have a hard time with products and this did not irritate at all. Great mask for an at home facial!</li>
    <li> Love it! This is my first experience using mud mask, I have no regrets smells great easy to apply comes off clean. Results soft smooth skin wow this is really good!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using 100% all natural mud from Newzealand for a long time but this one didn&#x27;t work at all. Get Aztec clay instead. I just wanted one that&#x27;s made already but very dissapp</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for something to help my blackheads and acne caused by pregnancy. This stuff feels great on the skin and smells nice. I noticed it did dry my skin after washing off so a light moisturizer is a must. Overall it helped quite a bit with smoothing my skin and drying out acne and clearing out my pores.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing new Deep Sea Mud Mask! It left my face feeling smooth and moisturized while shrinking the appearance of my pores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Amazing peed of delivery</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, is terrible if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I ordered and it is decent but I&#x27;ve seen no noticeable improvement. I would probably try a different mask next I need some more.</li>
    <li> Made my really dry skin soft and smooth for several days before needing to apply it again. I love this product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how well this actually worked because I used it with multiple other &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; but it reminded me of how the ocean would cleanse your face with all the salt in the water and such.</li>
    <li> I found something in the mud that looked like a piece of ripped fabric. I don&#x27;t know if I want to put it on my skin at all.</li>
    <li> did nothing to my skin. its a gimmick. and certainly not natural.</li>
    <li> Horrible product, through it away...</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, but it came in open and spilled every where. To the garbage it goes.</li>
    <li> The mud goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t make a mess, but it just fell a little short for me.  Other mud mask I&#x27;ve used have made me feel cleaner and skin tighter.  It says to only use once a week, but I would actually use this a little more often since it&#x27;s not really on the same level as others. If you are new to mud mask then this actually will knock your socks off and you will be hooked.  Mud Masks are awesome and make you feel great.  Especially if you are on a good diet and you work out.  This will only elevate how great your skin feels.  I get discounts for trying products out and this while a very good product is not as good as others I&#x27;ve tried, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this mud mask and wow I loved it with just the 1st use my face felt so smooth, no dryness, my face stayed oil free for the rest of the day, best part there was no nasty mud smell. I will make sure to post another review after I use it a couple of more times but as of now I love it four days later my face is still very smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about the dead sea mud mask so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.. using it once a week I can definitely tell my face is getting lighter. I do have a bit of acne, but that plays a part of me not drinking as much water or eating healthy like I should. This product is benificial though . It smells good. The texture is thick. It dries after putting it on. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
    <li> Actually noticed improvements</li>
    <li> Great cleanser for the face.</li>
    <li> hmmmm.... not liking it.  waste of money</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews.. seems to be a good product. I used it last night for the first time. I like that its easy to apply( isn&#x27;t like the thick clay) and doesn&#x27;r really have a smell. I bought this to see if it would help minimize my pores as well as help with my blackheads on my nose. When the mask was drying or dried it made my face super tight! It washed of very easily with warm water. So far, I like it! If anything changs, I&#x27;ll update this review!</li>
    <li> I was soo surprised on how big the container is and how full it is!  Shipment was fast!  I added photo&#x27;s of it.  This is my first time using a mud mask and the best way to describe it is it feels like I exfoliated (with a cream not professionally or with a machine).</li>
    <li> this is amazing makes your face feel refreshing and very soft. It does dry your skin out it actually makes it feel moisturized.</li>
    <li> Used it once so far and I like how my face feels after using it.  Leaves my face looking and feeling soft.  :)</li>
    <li> Okay when this stuff says the best it really is the best. It really worked for me, I&#x27;ve only used it for one day and I can tell the difference by far, my pores are smaller my skin is soft, free of oil. I don&#x27;t really get pimples but I do suffer from black heads and most of the small little  ones are gone. Let&#x27;s keep in mind I had really high expectations for this product because of the reviews.....and can I just say.....wow. I love this and I will buy another when I finish this one. Which I suspect will be a while because you use this once  a week  and a little can cover a lot of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-I&#x27;m honestly in love with this stuff. It&#x27;s made my skin soft and glowing. My skin problems are almost gone.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best mud mask or maybe I&#x27;m just expecting too much. It leaves my skin greasy which I have to wash my face 2x after using the product. Once to take the mudmask off and then again to get the oil off. I will use it so I don&#x27;t waste my money. But will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and leaves your face really smooth. Deff buying again!</li>
    <li> Very excited about this product. Have used 3 times (1/per week) and have not experienced any dryness or irritation. Goes on easily and leaves my skin soft and glowing. :) Great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. My acne is slowly fading away. I love the all natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 3 weeks now. Although I have not seen a difference in the amount of whiteheads I have on my nose and chin, the mask does make my skin feel softer. I will continue to use this mask for the next few months to see if it helps with my acne scars</li>
    <li> This product has done really great things for my skin. Most of my acne and scars are focused on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 and am now 19. Recently after calming down for a few months it&#x27;s come back pretty badly along my jawline. However, after a month of using this mask it&#x27;s almost completely gone. The redness and swelling has gone down a lot as well as my scars healing surprisingly well. I use it every night before I go to sleep and follow up by moisturizing with raw shea butter and leave the butter on while I sleep. This has left me with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that since I&#x27;ve been using this mask I have changed my diet to more fruits and veggies as well as drinking a lot more water. I avoid anything too sugary and fatty and when I do go out in the sun I use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful for some teens out there!</li>
    <li> Great mask ! noticed a difference immediately.  Me and my husband use it .... We love it. Good quality product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin soft first time I used it and I liked that it&#x27;s made out of natural ingredients, but made my face break out and did nothing for my pores. If you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin then I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Still trying to figure out how to get a refund.</li>
    <li> I got this product for a &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; I must say its Amazing! The minute you out it on your face feels cool and doesn&#x27;t feel very dry as well. I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This product has a nice smell it isnt a strong overbearing odor. It has a nice texture to it.It is gray in color and has a little tint to it. When I placed it on my face it was a little color changing. It made my face a little stiff while using it but I loved that it didnt have anything that made my skin sting. I loved that I could feel it working on my face will it was getting firmer I felt it change. It was great and easy to take off my face and didnt leave it grimmy .I received the item for testing and review purposes</li>
    <li> I saw a difference in my skin texture in just one application! I LOVE this product!!!</li>
    <li> I use this every Sunday as a ritual. AWESOME stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never spent this much on a beauty product. And I was expecting the jar to be larger for the price, however this was by far one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;First of all it smells amazing and despite the fact the jar looks small, the mud is super thick and goes a long way (it even says to only use once a week).&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how even toned my skin was upon rinsing it off. Normally warm water will change my skin color and cause it to become red and blotchy. Did not happen when I took off the mask, my skin was even and not red at all.&lt;br /&gt;My face didn&#x27;t feel dry like it normally does after washing and it was super soft as if I exfolliated with a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will be keeping this item as staple in my beauty pantry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this product really does anything. I&#x27;ve used it once a week and I just don&#x27;t see any difference. I think it&#x27;s just a gimmick</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend and she loves it she said it leaves her skin very soft</li>
    <li> I have slightly dry skin, so I&#x27;m careful with masks, they can make dry skin worse.  I have heard about the benefits of dead sea mud and I usually use 100% dead sea mud with nothing else in it.  I tried this because I couldn&#x27;t find my usual product anymore.  I&#x27;m not writing a review because I got a discount on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well, (but for full disclosure, I&#x27;m still hunting for my 100%, nothing else added, dead sea mud).  This does have some advantages over straight mud, with the other ingredients added it is more soothing to the skin, but if you have dry skin like mine you still need a good cream after.  If you are looking to clean your face, this is excellent.  Clears away dirt and grime out of your pores, and your pores are minimized.  It also diminishes fine lines and wrinkles because it does a good job of tightening your skin.  It also helps clear away sun damage, it exfoliates the top layer.  However, you will find your skin a little mottled, the tan damage doesn&#x27;t come off all at once - it&#x27;s the nature of skin.  By itself, it&#x27;s great for a facial, and it&#x27;s a great anti-aging tool, it really does help reduce lines and wrinkles.  Keep to a thin layer, more isn&#x27;t better, you&#x27;re just wasting product and it takes much longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend using a good cream with this.  Masks strip the oil from your skin, which causes your skin to produce more oil, so you end up with a cycle of over oil production, whether your skin is dry or oily.  The nice thing about this mask is that it takes everything out of your skin, so what you put on after will be absorbed wonderfully.  It does have some oils in it, but I find that my skin is still a little too dry after.  If you are looking for anti-aging benefits, the best cream out there that I use is [[ASIN:B00IIPI6CS Bel Essence Intensive Anti Aging Treatment - All-Natural Cream for Erasing Wrinkles. Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]  Best all natural anti-aging moisturizer made with oils, so it doesn&#x27;t cause excess oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used brand anti-agers, but didn&#x27;t get long term results.  This routine - mask and Bel Essence - does.  The mask clears your skin, exfoliates, clears out pores, and the cream give you soft and smooth skin.  And by smooth I mean the lines are GONE.  The mask reduces the lines and the cream finishes off the light lines the mask leaves - permanently.  Doesn&#x27;t just plump up the skin so they aren&#x27;t noticeable like other products, GONE.  With the two products, after a couple of months, even the deep lines on my forehead are smaller and almost unnoticeable under make up.  I&#x27;m going to keep going with both the mask and cream until they are gone completely.  The dark spots and sun damage are also so much lighter, a little make up covers that too, looking forward to that being completely gone.  If you want to hide your age, this combination (at a great price too!) is the way to go.made with oils, so it doesn&#x27;t cause excess oil production.    I&#x27;ve used brand anti-agers, but didn&#x27;t get long term results.  This routine - mask and Bel Essence - does.  The mask clears your skin, exfoliates, clears out pores, and the cream give you soft and smooth skin.  And by smooth I mean the lines are GONE.  The mask reduces the lines and the cream finishes off the light lines the mask leaves - permanently.  Doesn&#x27;t just plump up the skin so they aren&#x27;t noticeable like other products, GONE.  With the two products, after a couple of months, even the deep lines on my forehead are smaller and almost unnoticeable under make up.  I&#x27;m going to keep going with both the mask and cream until they are gone completely.  The dark spots and sun damage are also so much lighter, a little make up covers that too, looking forward to that being completely gone.  If you want to hide your age, this combination (at a great price too!) is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I received my mud mask today and after reading all these comments I was like: &amp;#34;I need to try this A.S.A.P. &amp;#34;... so as soon as I put it I started feeling the tightening and since the first use... amazing results :)</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING! I put it on my skin and scared my daughter because it turns your face completely dark grey/black. It was easy to remove and didn&#x27;t overly dry my skin at all. My skin feels smooth and a few of my blemishes are quickly disappearing as well. It left the scent on my skin until the next morning too. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time last night and wow. 2 stubborn blotches on my face are now gone and my skin feels so soft. Great product!!!!!!!!.</li>
    <li> This product did make my skin feel nice and soft. After using this my skin felt more rejuvenated although I do have very sensitive skin and it irritated my face a little in some areas. Overall, a good product just be careful with it and test it on small patches of skin before putting it everywhere.</li>
    <li> i received this to reveiw. It works really well and actually got rid of some of my black heads.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and I love it! It is helping to clear the stubborn blackheads around my nose that nothing seemed to quite clear up. I seem to be transitioning to a new phase with my skin as I approach 40, and this dead sea mud mask is helping keep my skin feeling soft and reducing breakouts. Will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Not so good for blackheads. I have been using it twice a week for about a month and  no noticeable improvement on my stubborn blackheads.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask. A little goes a long way with this product absolutely love it it makes my skin feels so soft. the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that you can only use it one day a week other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> Tried once, did feel a difference in skin, will be able to tell over time.</li>
    <li> Great mud mask, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Is not what I expected. Not deep cleaning at all. Oily finish even after use my Toner. Next day my pores are still the same, Clog. After using it you don&#x27;t see any unclog pores at all. I have to use it 2 or 3 times a week to fairly see some cleaning. Helping with acne....don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I really love this Mud Mask one of the best ones I have used. My skin is more brighter, cleaner and less breakouts i love this stuff. will recomend to anyone who is looking for a mud mask will be buying more soon!!</li>
    <li> Great mask. The product gives my face a nice glow/refreshing look after using it.</li>
    <li> like it but not love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. i have used it several times and it makes my skin fresh. Love it.. i got for discount price.</li>
    <li> I received this mask for the purpose of reviewing it. So far in the uses i have had with this mask i find it mild and soothing. Its not as harsh and strong as others i have used, so in the event that someone is a bit sensitive to mud masks this may be the one for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical of any product that has &amp;#34;The BEST&amp;#34; in its tagline, but in the case of this mask, it really is the best. I struggle with periodic breakouts and some shallow acne scars, which are not visible to others unless I point them out, but they bother me to no end.&lt;br /&gt;I used the mask for the first time last week. It&#x27;s smooth going on, not cakey, not thin. The fragrance is pleasant and light. I let the mask sit for 25 minutes (it&#x27;s recommended for 10 or 15, I can&#x27;t remember) and washed it off with warm water. My skin was glowing! The few pimples I had flattened and dried. There was a slight improvement in acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;The benefits were lasting, and I saw improved skin tone and no new acne developed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been a week, and I&#x27;m sitting here with the mask on my face again. I plan to make this a ritual.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried severals mud mask treatments at several spas over the years, and I can say that this is certainly one of my instant favorites. This is a spa quality product and the results are noticeable immediately after use. Highly recommend, not only to make skin smoother, but also to remove oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first use, I left the mask for 15 minutes, although it can be removed at the 10 minute mark. I immediately felt my skin to be softer and smoother to the touch. My skin remained soft and considerably oil free for the upcoming days. Really happy with the results. The effects of this product can be noticed instantly. Strongly recommend, and will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> No difference noted after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Works without turning your face red and irritated.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells amazing too</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WAY THIS MAKES MY FACE FEEL... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this and then two days later read a few more reviews. You can tell that all the people that reviewed the product were bribed in some way. They all sound like an infomercial and they all say the exact same thing. Now I do not trust this product or company at all. I wish i could get my money back.</li>
    <li> This is good for your face!!</li>
    <li> I am always looking for something to not only cleanse my face but help control the oil. This is the stuff. I am 44 years old and have always had problem skin. The mask makes my skin feel soft and more alive and very little oil. This is something I will buy more often and give out as gifts. I was given this product at a deep discount for my unbiased honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I got my mask, it didn&#x27;t take long to arrive.  I have only tried the mask once and so far is good. My skin feels soft,  fresh and very clean.</li>
    <li> Barely did anything to my face</li>
    <li> Skin is very soft after and doesn&#x27;t tighten up my face during use.</li>
    <li> Not very effective, but it&#x27;s ok. Don&#x27;t expect miracle though.</li>
    <li> So the scoop on Dead Sea mud; It&#x27;s known for its high concentrations of salts and minerals which include magnesium, sodium, potassium and calcium. It has connections with health benefits and is renowned for its healing properties. As far as for your skin it has been used as an over the counter treatment for psoriasis, eczema and acne. Cosmetically it can improve skin elasticity and minimize pores, wrinkles and lines. So now behind the science of this stuff, the mineral content accelerates natural exfoliation (the removing and renewing of dead skin) and restores your skin&#x27;s pH balance with regular use. When it dries, toxins from diet, pollution, and even makeup are naturally drawn out. Now I knew about these benefits and have been regularly using this mask, and can attest to these benefits. BUT I also found some other things this mask can help with while researching the Dead Sea. Are you ready for some craziness? It has been used as a preventative measure for hair loss, and cellulite. Because it increases blood flow and circulation it keeps hair follicles oxygenated and promotes the growth of proteins, for cellulite it prevents the bumps being accentuated and enlarged by fluids trapped in skin tissues near the surface. This mud comes from the Dead Sea where it is naturally formed. The Dead Sea boarders Jordan to the east and Israel to the west. It has been a source of health secrets for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, slather this all over yourself to look forever young. One day I will fill my tub with it and relax, and when I get out I will look 10 years younger, at least that&#x27;s what happens in my dreams ;)</li>
    <li> Good mask. Made my face soft.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to use this product in order to provide a review..n im glad i did choose it..im loving it! Ive tried other dead sea mud masks but it leavs my skin feeling dry n without moisture unlike this one..just after the first use i felt my skin feel soft n supple n not dry at all..&lt;br /&gt;You can check out my video review on Youtube.. https://youtu.be/uNk_AIWafns</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my experience so far with the Dead Sea Mud Mask by Pure Body Naturals. I have heard much talk about the benefits of Dead Sea mud and all of the skin care benefits it offer.  I have never used a product like this previously, so I jumped at the chance to purchase at a special discounted price to allow me to share my experience.  This product is full of minerals, vitamins and other natural ingredients, which is amazing for your skin and pure enough for me to not hesitate to put it on my face.  Surprisingly there is no unpleasant odor to the mask and is actually quite pleasant.  The texture is thick and creamy and left my skin feeling toned, refreshed and smooth.  I have developed many sun spots and blemishes as I&#x27;ve gotten older, so I cannot wait to see the results over time.  My son is beginning to get acne and he&#x27;s now excited to use it once a week; it&#x27;s our new tradition.  Since this is my first mask I&#x27;ve purchased, I do not have anything to compare it to, but I am very satisfied and pleased with the results I am seeing so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard finding a good mud mask out there these days. They either don&#x27;t mix well, don&#x27;t go on smoothly, or worse, don&#x27;t work! This one is awesome! I noticed my pores appeared smaller after just one use and my face felt so smooth.</li>
    <li> I like to keep this mask in the refrigerator because if feels so cool and refreshing. The first time I used it, I don&#x27;t think I kept it on for long enough because I didn&#x27;t feel like it did very much. I leave it on for about 20 minutes now and I notice a difference in my skin. Right after I wash it off, my skin feels very soft and smooth. The smell is also not bad, some mud masks that I have used smell too much like dirt. I like that you only have to use a little bit, this jar will last for a long time! This mask is relaxing and I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go a week without my mud mask. Its so good I&#x27;ve had a few friends and family hooked on this and they all have positive soft skin results after using it the first time.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels.My kids are not a fan of the way it looks on me though.</li>
    <li> Just received my mask today.  Used it and my skin feels Fabulous afterwards.  No drying at all.  Followed up with Vitamin C serum and Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel.  I will update this review in 2 weeks,  hence the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Purchased for $1 as a review item and love it!</li>
    <li> Bad for sensitive eczema skin! Within two hours of removing the mask I had red blisters, white heads and irritation from hell. My skin was so dry and painful that I couldn&#x27;t even put aloe Vera on it to sooth it! It has been 4 days and my face still hasn&#x27;t gotten better. This has only gotten me an expensive trip to the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin. Works well.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft</li>
    <li> I have skin issues, I always have, and always will. It is hard for me to get products to help with my issues without making my skin red and angry. I have been wanting to try a dead sea mask for some time, but have always seen the high costs and not been able to justify the purchase. Well, I finally decided that I needed to try the mask for my own good and see what results I had. This mask did not make my face angry, instead, it calmed down some of the dryness that I had been getting last week and made my skin feel really soft! The smell was much more pleasant than I had expected and the texture was so silky and smooth. If you have sensitive skin like mine, remember to test this out on a small area before applying to your whole face! This is a great product for people like me! It was refreshing and not heavy, I am grateful that I was able to get it at such a low cost and write a review about it.</li>
    <li> Truly does nothing. Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
    <li> Best Dead Sea mud mask I have seen and used plenty but this is my favvvvv. My face is so smooth after wards I love this can&#x27;t have enough.</li>
    <li> Vey good for your skin, I have tried others but this on was the best by far.</li>
    <li> This mask is GREAT!  On first sight I wasn&#x27;t convinced it would even work. It looked and felt thinner than other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried. It didn&#x27;t have that nice thick texture BUT follow the directions and give it the time it takes to dry! The instructions say to apply a layer to clean skin and leave on for 10-15 minutes to dry COMPLETELY! Then wash off with warm water in a circular motion. Mine was taking what felt like forever to dry so I just sat in front of a fan to help it along and that gave it a nice cool feeling as well!  This mask dried tighter than any other mask I&#x27;ve EVER used! It took longer than the 10-15 minutes for mine to completely dry but I honestly could have used a thinner layer than I used. I washed it off using circular motions with a warm wet washcloth. Rinsed with cool water and patted dry and my skin felt AMAZING! It looked brighter, cleaner, and healthier. I wish I&#x27;d taken a before photo, but all I have are my during and after photo. I really like this product!</li>
