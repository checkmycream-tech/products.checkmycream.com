### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and they are awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and this has the best texture (not greasy or too sticky), SPF, scent and color.</li>
      <li>But this is not that perfect product I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>The best part is the luxe packaging;  </li>
      <li>The color is great and my lips have been softer than ever before since I began using it!</li>
      <li>it keeps your lips moisturized, and 2) it gives a wonderfully finished look whether you&#x27;re going to the office or dinner.  </li>
      <li>They are all beautiful and so good for you!!</li>
      <li>and I know it will be great in the summertime.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe just how wonderful it feels on your lips and the rose blush</li>
      <li>I love it!!  </li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>It is very nice looking.</li>
      <li>Great product at a fair price</li>
      <li>Just to give you an idea of the type of products I like, I think Benetint lip balm is the most perfect just-kissed lip shade.  </li>
      <li>Great color and good keeps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
      <li>Until yesterday when I purchased Sugar Rose Lip Treatment!</li>
      <li>i think it would look good on all skin tones.</li>
      <li>This lipstick works really good</li>
      <li>I have been using this for years, awesome tint, so good for your lips, and doesn&#x27;t smell funny.  </li>
      <li>(why do so many lip glosses do that?!).</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product in Rose and waited a while for it to arrive.</li>
      <li>So ive really been looking for the perfect balm-sheer-color product and this one tops them all!</li>
      <li>The freh product gives a largerbsize in a nice screw cap tube but for $29, I say try an alternative.</li>
      <li>It came in a nice box and has a metal case.</li>
      <li>So, easy!  </li>
      <li>Great sheer color and makes your lips feel great.</li>
      <li>There hasn&#x27;t been a great lip balm like THIS one since Garden Botanika discontinued their great watermelon color back in the 90s.</li>
      <li>This is the most hydrating chap stick I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more results for the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
      <li>I love amazon.</li>
      <li>I also love that it never causes break outs</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and i have to say it was my favorite thing in the kit</li>
      <li>This lip balm is ok.  </li>
      <li>This is my most favorite lipstick/chapstick combo.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Glad Amazon had it but wish the price was better,</li>
      <li>Just that - OK.  </li>
      <li>And I love the color.</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>, it is very pricey for lip balm but it comes in a beautiful metal screw on tube, it lasts a very long time, the taste is pleasant, lemony with a hint of sweetness</li>
      <li>Initally when applying it, it feels good, but as time goes on I feel like it actually somehow makes the lines in my lips more prominent and</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about these lip balms are the lids: they screw on and off, which definitely comes in handy when it&#x27;s lost at the bottom of my purse!</li>
      <li>lip treatment itself goes on easily and smoothly without the waxy</li>
      <li>This is fine with me because I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot of color from the balm.  </li>
      <li>The metal casing of it is super fancy and stylish as well, so that&#x27;s always a plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>fast shipping, amazing product</li>
      <li>Everything arrived promptly and I love the Fresh lip products.  </li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and lasts for awhile.</li>
      <li>I really love every color (plain, rose and plum), but I think that Rose is the most fun and versatile.</li>
      <li>and i will DEFINITELY be buying it on its own!</li>
      <li>This rose tinted balm not only smells great but provides a natural look to lips, giving the wearer that &amp;#34;fresh, natural&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Rose is my absolute favorite color - it makes my mouth &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; while still looking extremely natural.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted gloss is as good for one fourth the price.</li>
      <li>Makes your lips nice and soft too.</li>
      <li>But again, it wears off so quickly.  </li>
      <li>But if you want that perfect holy grail of sheer lasting moisturizing lip color, this is not it.  </li>
      <li>I heard of this lip balm off of tumblr, and I&#x27;m so glad I was intrigued enough to research the product, because I love it.</li>
      <li>Great color for everyday, or even just using instead of lip balm.  </li>
      <li>I immediately applied it and it felt lush and lovely on my lips.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It smelled just like some pink lemonade lip balm I had in the 90s and LOVED.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to so many cosmetics and this one gives me NO TROUBLE at all.  </li>
      <li>It lasts well over six months, so definitely worth the $20 price tag.  </li>
      <li>I like Fresh products.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I got this product in a summer edition set by Ulta a few months ago that came with some bronzer, mascara, primer and some other nice things, but i had never heard of this lip balm and was like, ok that could be good too.</li>
      <li>It also comes in a plum color which has a little more color to it, and I like that one better, but it just wears off so quickly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this for years, and it provides just the right amount of makeup on and off camera.</li>
      <li>; look that is in right now.</li>
      <li>overall, I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>fragrance is sweet and lemony and I really like it, but when I lick my lips, I really don&#x27;t like the taste of this lip treatment.  </li>
      <li>It does not moisturize any better than my Burt&#x27;s Bees chap stick and the color is similar (pomegranite type BBs).</li>
      <li>the color is very nature and make me fresh complexion.</li>
      <li>It really is my fav product of the year!</li>
      <li>I plan to store mine in the cooler when its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Balm with a fabulous natural blush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a natural looking color, sheer but with a good tint, and light enough you don&#x27;t even need a mirror to put it on.  </li>
      <li>It is an ok product and you can find the same quality in much cheaper chap stick brands.  </li>
      <li>However, this is very overrated for the cost.</li>
      <li>It feels waxy and makes does not moisturize my lips very well.</li>
      <li>It really seems to moisturize my lips, not just make them shiny.</li>
      <li>It really keeps my lips feeling moist for hours.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t really care about color and don&#x27;t mind paying $22 for lip balm, go for it.  </li>
      <li>The color is really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t really care for the color either, but that&#x27;s something i struggle with...haven&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Really like it.  </li>
      <li>color, when worn, is much lighter than it appears in the picture.  </li>
      <li>To use what&#x27;s left in the tube, keep your lip brush handy -- then it will last MONTHS longer!  </li>
      <li>It feels more, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than &amp;</li>
      <li>highly recommend the Sugar Rose, the plain Sugar, and the Sugar Honey.</li>
      <li>Keeps lips soft and smooth with a tiny bit of plumping.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty packaging, and a nice color, but doesn&#x27;t do much for dry lips, at least not for me</li>
      <li>I use it every day, and it definitely keeps my lips moisturised for a few hours (more than the Chapstick I used to use before!).</li>
      <li>I was really looking for something that had a little more lasting power and that I did not have to apply with my finger.  </li>
      <li>My lips feel smooth and slipper for half the day (or until I eat or drink and need to reapply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great in this cold winter weather</li>
      <li>In the fashion industry, too much makeup is a big no-no.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seriously overpriced chapstick... I don&#x27;t get the hype. It does not moisturize any better than my Burt&#x27;s Bees chap stick and the color is similar (pomegranite type BBs). Yes, it&#x27;s smooth going on, but it did not prevent my seasonal chapping from the cold. I was hoping for more results for the price.</li>
    <li> the color is very nature and make me fresh complexion.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product.  I use it every single day.  It lasts well over six months, so definitely worth the $20 price tag.  Keeps lips soft and smooth with a tiny bit of plumping.  I am allergic to so many cosmetics and this one gives me NO TROUBLE at all.  My only unfulfilled wish is a smaller stick to carry around.  This one stays on my make up table.</li>
    <li> Sorry to be the outcast here but I don&#x27;t like this product. It feels waxy and makes does not moisturize my lips very well.</li>
    <li> This balm does two things:  1) it keeps your lips moisturized, and 2) it gives a wonderfully finished look whether you&#x27;re going to the office or dinner.  So, easy!  Making it organic would be the only way to improve the product!  To use what&#x27;s left in the tube, keep your lip brush handy -- then it will last MONTHS longer!  Worth the money.  There hasn&#x27;t been a great lip balm like THIS one since Garden Botanika discontinued their great watermelon color back in the 90s.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, amazing product</li>
    <li> For a long time, I couldn&#x27;t understand why anyone would pay over $20 for lip balm! Until yesterday when I purchased Sugar Rose Lip Treatment! I can&#x27;t believe just how wonderful it feels on your lips and the rose blush it gives your lips. I applied it when I got home at 4 yesterday and it lasted until I reapplied before bed.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is very pricey for lip balm but it comes in a beautiful metal screw on tube, it lasts a very long time, the taste is pleasant, lemony with a hint of sweetness and it keeps your lips moisturized so they don&#x27;t get chapped. Great in this cold winter weather and I know it will be great in the summertime. I&#x27;ve been told not to expose it to heat, such as carrying it in your purse in the summer heat as it will melt. I plan to store mine in the cooler when its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Sugar Rose, the plain Sugar, and the Sugar Honey. They are all beautiful and so good for you!!</li>
    <li> This product is not to be used as a sunscreen because it melts in the heat.  Too pricey to justify purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is ok.  Just that - OK.  I would not spend $20 for this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and this has the best texture (not greasy or too sticky), SPF, scent and color. Worth every penny. It lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Pretty good.I love amazon.I love the freedom and democracy of the United States, I hate dictatorship of the Communist Party.</li>
    <li> I got this product in a summer edition set by Ulta a few months ago that came with some bronzer, mascara, primer and some other nice things, but i had never heard of this lip balm and was like, ok that could be good too. and i have to say it was my favorite thing in the kit and i will DEFINITELY be buying it on its own! im not a huge fan of bold lipsticks or sticky glosses that ur hair sticks to (i have really long hair). So ive really been looking for the perfect balm-sheer-color product and this one tops them all! i think it would look good on all skin tones. LOVE IT! It really is my fav product of the year!</li>
    <li> Do not think that this product can suffice as a stand alone lip color.  The color of the product is misleading.  It just has EVER so slight of a hint of barely-there color, but mainly it is a lip balm.  If you think this is going to be a multi-tasker all in one product to moitsturize and color your lips, you may be dissapointed.  It also comes in a plum color which has a little more color to it, and I like that one better, but it just wears off so quickly it&#x27;s not really satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of sheer natural color, so it&#x27;s not like I need a LOT of color, I just wish it would stay on longer and not require constant re-application.  Just to give you an idea of the type of products I like, I think Benetint lip balm is the most perfect just-kissed lip shade.  But again, it wears off so quickly.  I was really looking for something that had a little more lasting power and that I did not have to apply with my finger.  But this is not that perfect product I was hoping for.  If you don&#x27;t really care about color and don&#x27;t mind paying $22 for lip balm, go for it.  But if you want that perfect holy grail of sheer lasting moisturizing lip color, this is not it.  Just another tinted lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even trying to rate it as just a lip balm, I am not impressed.  Initally when applying it, it feels good, but as time goes on I feel like it actually somehow makes the lines in my lips more prominent and my lips somewhat flaky. I prefer my $3 Burts bees lip balm...</li>
    <li> Everything arrived promptly and I love the Fresh lip products.  I have been using them for a while and they are awesome.</li>
    <li> I like Fresh products, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these Lip Treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color, when worn, is much lighter than it appears in the picture.  It give a very, very sheer pink color that is barely noticeable on my lips.  This is fine with me because I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot of color from the balm.  The color is really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip treatment itself goes on easily and smoothly without the waxy feel that you&#x27;d get from a chapstick like balm.  My lips feel smooth and slipper for half the day (or until I eat or drink and need to reapply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is sweet and lemony and I really like it, but when I lick my lips, I really don&#x27;t like the taste of this lip treatment.  Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels and the fragrance.  Don&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
    <li> This lip treatment smells just like nivea products but at 4X the price.  It is an ok product and you can find the same quality in much cheaper chap stick brands.  The best part is the luxe packaging;  It is very nice looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, awesome tint, so good for your lips, and doesn&#x27;t smell funny.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips moist and kissable!</li>
    <li> I live this and use it every single day or my lips tend to burn in the sun.  I have been using it for years but finding it harder and harder to find.  Glad Amazon had it but wish the price was better,</li>
    <li> I love this product. Great color and good keeps my lips from getting chapped.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite lipstick/chapstick combo. The color is great and my lips have been softer than ever before since I began using it!</li>
    <li> I usually am not one to buy expensive make-up since I don&#x27;t wear it regularly but I had a little extra money as an Amazon credit and decided to try something new. I ordered this product in Rose and waited a while for it to arrive. It came in a nice box and has a metal case. It smelled just like some pink lemonade lip balm I had in the 90s and LOVED. I immediately applied it and it felt lush and lovely on my lips. The color was subtle and I couldn&#x27;t stop pressing my lips together! It feels more, I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; than other lip balms or lip treatments I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pale skin and this complemented my natural look very well. Definitely would repurchase!</li>
    <li> I heard of this lip balm off of tumblr, and I&#x27;m so glad I was intrigued enough to research the product, because I love it. I use it every day, and it definitely keeps my lips moisturised for a few hours (more than the Chapstick I used to use before!). The metal casing of it is super fancy and stylish as well, so that&#x27;s always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it. I believe it&#x27;s made of all-natural ingredients as well (you can double-check on that on the website).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. I really love every color (plain, rose and plum), but I think that Rose is the most fun and versatile. It gives lips a light \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; of deep pink, but it&#x27;s very subtle. It goes on so smoothly and lasts for awhile. I also love that it never causes break outs (why do so many lip glosses do that?!). It really seems to moisturize my lips, not just make them shiny. It&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  Great color for everyday, or even just using instead of lip balm.  It&#x27;s a natural looking color, sheer but with a good tint, and light enough you don&#x27;t even need a mirror to put it on.  Makes your lips nice and soft too.</li>
    <li> Great product at a fair price</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re not a fan of lipstick, this is for you.  It&#x27;s very sheer with spf.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty packaging, and a nice color, but doesn&#x27;t do much for dry lips, at least not for me</li>
    <li> This is the most hydrating chap stick I have ever tried. It really keeps my lips feeling moist for hours. And I love the color. The color does not stay on well, though, and tends to wear off in a few hours.</li>
    <li> Balm with a fabulous natural blush.  Really like it.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, have to reapply, but it&#x27;s so pretty and looks so natural.</li>
    <li> Subtle color and texture, love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great sheer color and makes your lips feel great. Also doesn&#x27;t have a terrible taste like some lip products.</li>
    <li> got this as a bday present a couple years ago along with the coral color...i hate the way this feels on my lips..it feels heavy and waxy and nasty...i don&#x27;t really care for the color either, but that&#x27;s something i struggle with...haven&#x27;t met a lip color i like on my lips yet..sigh</li>
    <li> This lipstick works really good the color on the pic makes the lipstick look like its a really dark color but it&#x27;s not I went to sopora and tried a swatch on my hand there is barely any color they only make lips a little pink !!!!they make lips really soft the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the&lt;br /&gt;Contain  because it takes a little whole to open it</li>
    <li> In the fashion industry, too much makeup is a big no-no. This rose tinted balm not only smells great but provides a natural look to lips, giving the wearer that &amp;#34;fresh, natural&amp;#34; look that is in right now. I&#x27;ve worn this for years, and it provides just the right amount of makeup on and off camera.</li>
    <li> This lip treatment is a tad expensive, but trust me, it feels amazing. Rose is my absolute favorite color - it makes my mouth &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; while still looking extremely natural. All of the Fresh Sugar balms have a slight lemon scent and flavor, but nothing too overpowering. Glides on my lips like butter, and lasts longer than the average lip balm. My favorite thing about these lip balms are the lids: they screw on and off, which definitely comes in handy when it&#x27;s lost at the bottom of my purse! This stuff isn&#x27;t greasy or gritty, and I find it helps my lips feel soft at all times. Just wish the price was a little lower.</li>
    <li> I like Fresh products. However, this is very overrated for the cost. Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted gloss is as good for one fourth the price. The freh product gives a largerbsize in a nice screw cap tube but for $29, I say try an alternative.</li>
