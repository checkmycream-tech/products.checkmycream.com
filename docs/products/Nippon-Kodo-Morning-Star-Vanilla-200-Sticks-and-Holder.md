      <li>This is the best incense for people that don&#x27;t like incense.</li>
      <li>This is the best out there.</li>
      <li>people are great to deal with....</li>
      <li>It keeps you in the zone you need to have when you are concentrating in the mind to body experience in any stressful moment, or just to have a pleasant odor in a room of your house.</li>
      <li>I had these ordered based on customer&#x27;s good rating.</li>
      <li>This product is good to use during a bath, and even while doing relaxation yoga.  </li>
      <li>Cinnamon is also good, as are fig and lotus.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff for the price</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>My favorite incense in the world!</li>
      <li>but they smell so amazing and burn for 15-20mins before going out that I&#x27;m going to try more scents!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of these when I run out because they are so good smelling.</li>
      <li>They burn nicely but to me does not smell anything like vanilla.</li>
      <li>Warm vanilla smoke not obnoxious hippy herbs.</li>
      <li>and it is a very nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>They have so many lovely scents I want to try!</li>
      <li>These are my favorite incense sticks; they come with a nice holder, and they burn well.  </li>
      <li>I love that this gets the smell out of the bathroom but doesn&#x27;t overpower the room.</li>
      <li>There are better incense out there.</li>
      <li>The lavender is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Personally, I think these are the best smelling incense I have ever smelled.</li>
      <li>My favorite &#x27;vanilla&#x27; incense</li>
      <li>I received my order quickly and I am very pleased with this scent.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>The smell is fine but not vanilla.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few of the morning star scents and I find that the ones I like best are lavender and vanilla.  </li>
      <li>i got free shipping as well.  </li>
      <li>the smell is so great you can smell it in the entire house</li>
      <li>It might not smell like one of those cheap aresol cans of vanilla</li>
      <li>You get a great value in that there are 200 sticks with a holder and they last forever.  </li>
      <li>I meditate with this fragrance because of its light aroma.</li>
      <li>It is a soft warm scent, and the incense has a very clean, even burn.  </li>
      <li>These sticks are the perfect size and burn well making very little smoke.</li>
      <li>Being familiar with this brand I knew the size and burn time before purchase.  </li>
      <li>This vanilla incense has a unique smell</li>
      <li>A nice Japanese bowl full of silica sand or even rice works better.</li>
      <li>But, if you are interested in mellow scents with low amounts of smoke (compared to other types of incense), and very easy cleanup these are excellent.</li>
      <li>I wish if Nippon Kodo would make longer stick, maybe double the current length would be perfect.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t find these at our regular place but are just the same and work perfectly.</li>
      <li>The incense sticks aren&#x27;t as long as others, which for me is a good thing.</li>
      <li>They smell great and you get a whole bunch in the box, but honestly they are too thin.</li>
      <li>but when I opened up the box I smelt them and lit 1 right away</li>
      <li>same as above great products....</li>
      <li>Not to heavy, with just enough sweetness to make the room smell wonderful!</li>
      <li>It is very aromatic and came quickly -as</li>
      <li>Our large livingroom with vaulted ceilings doesn&#x27;t hold the scent very long, but in bedrooms the scent lingers and is very enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>However, they smell exactly like burning wood.</li>
      <li>Smaller than most incense</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered several scents, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It give off a great vanilla scent that is subtle but yet relaxing.  </li>
      <li>They burn too fast.</li>
      <li>Vanilla is nice, low key, everyone likes it.</li>
      <li>For a product like this, repeat purchases are frequent, so to see it packaged in this amount for less is nice.  </li>
      <li>The fragrances are varied; I particularly like the Vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>burning, this incense gives light smell, not exactly 100% vanilla but very pleasure.</li>
      <li>The incense are shorter than normal ones.</li>
      <li>for us, it smelled like the inside of a New York City cab.  </li>
      <li>The scents are subtle and not overpowering, but are definitely distinguishable and quite pleasant.  </li>
      <li>This was the first and will be the last order of this brand.</li>
      <li>i love the scent of this incense, it is mellow and never overwhelming</li>
      <li>I like being able to light a stick in a smaller room or bathroom, and let it burn down without having to put it out early due to the room being too smokey.</li>
      <li>I definitely prefer this non-wood based, pure incenses over the dipped incense.</li>
      <li>I do agree that everyone would have different taste, but I myself really like this one (Nippon Kodo - Morning</li>
      <li>I bought about 10 boxes (200-stick box) so far.</li>
      <li>They are strong enough for an average sized room.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy smelling the Vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;Included is a small ceramic square, for those that don&#x27;t have a burner.</li>
      <li>Japanese incense stick does not produce too much smoke like Chinese or Indian one, this is what I do like.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>We enjoy the subtle vanilla aroma this product offers.  </li>
      <li>only downside is the sticks are so small, they do not last very long at all, however they are great for small rooms that can get choked in smoke from larger sticks.  </li>
      <li>but it is made of pure vanilla oils and kindof smells like fresh baked cookies but not in a fake way.</li>

    <li> These incense smell no different than a burning punk. The different scents don&#x27;t smell any different from each other. There are better incense out there. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time on Morning star incense.</li>
    <li> The are way too thin. They smell great and you get a whole bunch in the box, but honestly they are too thin. They burn too fast.</li>
    <li> For a product like this, repeat purchases are frequent, so to see it packaged in this amount for less is nice.  It warms my frugal heart.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these at our regular place but are just the same and work perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is the best incense for people that don&#x27;t like incense. Warm vanilla smoke not obnoxious hippy herbs. I meditate with this fragrance because of its light aroma. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> I do agree that everyone would have different taste, but I myself really like this one (Nippon Kodo - Morning Start Vanilla). Japanese incense stick does not produce too much smoke like Chinese or Indian one, this is what I do like.&lt;br /&gt;When burning, this incense gives light smell, not exactly 100% vanilla but very pleasure. I bought about 10 boxes (200-stick box) so far. I wish if Nippon Kodo would make longer stick, maybe double the current length would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed at how small they were when I opened the box but they smell so amazing and burn for 15-20mins before going out that I&#x27;m going to try more scents!</li>
    <li> This vanilla incense has a unique smell and I like it a lot. I&#x27;ve ordered several scents, this is my favorite. I don&#x27;t use the incense holder though. A nice Japanese bowl full of silica sand or even rice works better.</li>
    <li> My favorite incense in the world! Not to heavy, with just enough sweetness to make the room smell wonderful! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> My family doesn&#x27;t like incense, but never notices when I burn these.  I love that this gets the smell out of the bathroom but doesn&#x27;t overpower the room.</li>
    <li> This item does not smell like vanilla at all. It just smells like generic incense burning. Wasted my money on this purchase :-(</li>
    <li> for us, it smelled like the inside of a New York City cab.  The seller would not take it back, so we threw it away!  We like Nippon Kod incense and we buy the Patchouli scent all the time and wanted to try something different.  If you like the smell of a taxi cab, then this is your product!</li>
    <li> Nag Champa take a hike. This is the best out there. Vanilla is nice, low key, everyone likes it.</li>
    <li> Personally, I think these are the best smelling incense I have ever smelled. They aren&#x27;t over-powering but not too subtle. Smaller than most incense but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference. Love them!</li>
    <li> No trace of vanilla in these sticks!! Was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was kindof worried when I read the reviews about the vanilla but when I opened up the box I smelt them and lit 1 right away and it is a very nice clean smell. It might not smell like one of those cheap aresol cans of vanilla but it is made of pure vanilla oils and kindof smells like fresh baked cookies but not in a fake way. I will be buying more of these when I run out because they are so good smelling.</li>
    <li> I received my order quickly and I am very pleased with this scent.  It is a soft warm scent, and the incense has a very clean, even burn.  My favorite &#x27;vanilla&#x27; incense so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the sticks are so small, they do not last very long at all, however they are great for small rooms that can get choked in smoke from larger sticks.

    <li> i love the scent of this incense, it is mellow and never overwhelming, i use it everyday and  i never get tired of it, there are 200 sticks in it and i halve them so in essence i get 400 little sticks.</li>
    <li> The incense sticks aren&#x27;t as long as others, which for me is a good thing. They are strong enough for an average sized room. I really enjoy smelling the Vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;Included is a small ceramic square, for those that don&#x27;t have a burner.</li>
    <li> This is the third scent I have purchased from Morning Star.  It is very aromatic and came quickly -as an add on to a prime order i got free shipping as well.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different scents. Lavender, Cedar and Vanilla. The lavender is my favorite. These sticks are the perfect size and burn well making very little smoke. I definitely prefer this non-wood based, pure incenses over the dipped incense. They have so many lovely scents I want to try!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of the morning star scents and I find that the ones I like best are lavender and vanilla.  Cinnamon is also good, as are fig and lotus.  One reviewer complained that the varieties don&#x27;t smell any differently from a burning punk or from each other, but I would disagree.  The scents are subtle and not overpowering, but are definitely distinguishable and quite pleasant.  These are not the eye-watering, or powerful and intense, incenses that some people are used to or expect, and if that is what you are looking for you may be disappointed with these.  But, if you are interested in mellow scents with low amounts of smoke (compared to other types of incense), and very easy cleanup these are excellent.</li>
    <li> A couple of things to know.. The holder for the incense is the size of a nickel, so there is no place but your counter for the ashes. The incense are shorter than normal ones. They burn nicely but to me does not smell anything like vanilla. The smell is fine but not vanilla. I would say it smells like when you walk into a hippie shop.</li>
    <li> same as above great products....people are great to deal with....the smell is so great you can smell it in the entire house and that is what we like</li>
    <li> I had these ordered based on customer&#x27;s good rating. However, they smell exactly like burning wood. Yes, burning wood!!!  This was the first and will be the last order of this brand. Well, If you want to waste your money, order it.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite incense sticks; they come with a nice holder, and they burn well.  The fragrances are varied; I particularly like the Vanilla.  Good stuff for the price - you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
