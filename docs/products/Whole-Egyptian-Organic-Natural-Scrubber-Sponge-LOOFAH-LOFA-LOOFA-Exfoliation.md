      <li>sponge is lovely though!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a good loofah for a long time and am so happy I found this excellent Egyptian product.  </li>
      <li>It was shipped fast and the quality excellent</li>
      <li>so I was happy to find another online seller with a great price for whole loofah&#x27;s .</li>
      <li>My order came very fast and there was anxiety upon opening the package but YIPPPEEEEEEE, MY LOOFAH!!!</li>
      <li>just wonderful and BIG!</li>
      <li>This is the type used at top spas around the world.&lt;br</li>
      <li>love this authentic &amp;#34;Loufa,&amp;#34; and you should too.</li>
      <li>So this is my second attempt to buy a loofa from Amazon and now I am happy!</li>
      <li>If it does, this will be the best economical natural sponge I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Looking at it in person, it&#x27;s easy to tell that it is a beautiful, natural product.  </li>
      <li>These Loofahs (or Leafies) as they are called in the Middle East are the best things you can clean yourself with.  </li>
      <li>Great flexible and soft</li>
      <li>Really gives your skin a good cleaning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found - natural, large size, great exfoliater!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original size, I make sure that I hang it after use</li>
      <li>The loofahs are great, but they arrived smelling of dung (sheep most likely).  </li>
      <li>Easy to cut.</li>
      <li>It is the best loofah I&#x27;ve had hands down.</li>
      <li>I can use any soap on it (even soap nut liquid works fine).</li>
      <li>It is the BEST sponge I&#x27;ve ever used since I was little.</li>
      <li>It is also huge.</li>
      <li>I am not opposed to it so much since I grew up in a country where we grew our own loofahs and had livestock, but I would still suggest giving the loofahs a quick boil when you get them.  </li>
      <li>But now it&#x27;s well worth the shipment from Egypt!</li>
      <li>It lathers well and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>It was clean.</li>
      <li>I would definitely advise this product to any loofah fan or those who like a good massage and silky skin.  </li>
      <li>and both seem to be of the same good quality.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal and cut to size gives more for the money.</li>
      <li>Clean, cut to size, and get inflated to correct size and proper scrubbing are what these authentic Egyptian Pharaoh&#x27;s and their fabulous Nubian women used to smooth the contrasts of their incredibly smooth skin, which you and your lady will experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The loofah sponge is huge and works very well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s invaluable and always worth the wait.</li>
      <li>the wait was worth it.  </li>
      <li>It does take a while to get here but its worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It is a great exfoliator without being stiff as a board.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product, its large and wide, exactly what is advertised.</li>
      <li>it was right beside me,</li>
      <li>Rinse thoroughly and put right into the dryer for longer-lasting and cleaner usage.</li>
      <li>But if you buy the real whole Loofah from a good source (like Amazon) - these ones come from Egypt, then you will not have any trouble softening them.  </li>
      <li>Very large - enough to cut into 2 or more large size scrubbers.</li>
      <li>Seller is amazing as there was a shipping issue - due to USPS - and it was resolved immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisified with the quality.</li>
      <li>You can scrub your whole stomach at one swipe.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses them.  </li>
      <li>This product really was postmarked &amp;#34;from</li>
      <li>This sponge really does come from Egypt like the others have stated, so be patient as it does take some time.</li>
      <li>It is just rough enough to have a good scrub in shower.</li>
      <li>All I use to wash for the past 2 years are Egyptian Loofah&#x27;s, and my skin has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I love my Natural loofah ant live with out it, i thought i left a review on this product already..</li>
      <li>love it, exactly the sponge I bought in Greece a few years ago.</li>
      <li>Now I just hope the piece I cut from the loofah can last a full month.</li>
      <li>It can wrap around and be molded to your arm or leg where you can uniformly exfoliate instead of just drastically exfoliating the high points and none of the low.&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using these.</li>
      <li>Other than that these are amazing, would definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>Unlike the ones that come from China, this one was soft, lathered really well but still exfoliated like a dream.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and flexible.</li>
      <li>When you get it, it will be flat, fill up your kitchen sink with hot water and let it soak, it will swell to 3-4 times</li>
      <li>Anywhere else expect to pay AT LEAST 4 times more - just be patient as it ships from Egypt.</li>
      <li>far as the loofah, throw away those inferior loofahs that take 6 months to soften.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t use this on your skin if you have a sun burn, no matter how soft it is, it can hurt.  </li>
      <li>Really natural loofah [seeds &amp; all].</li>
      <li>Biggest loofa i ever saw and it comes in a fed ex bag all the way from Egypt, complete with customs stamps and beatiful lettering.</li>
      <li>It bounces right back to form for that next morning before going to work.</li>
      <li>I was slightly skeptical upon ordering from you because most of the loofah&#x27;s shown online end up being the hard, bleached yukky kind.  </li>
      <li>I soaked in hot water before use and it took its natural round shape.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Excellent for face and other &#x27;delicate areas,&#x27; that require the &#x27;gentle,&#x27; touch with a complete clean.</li>
      <li>I love the full size - nothing like the small stiff material from previous purchases.</li>
      <li>They are long enough to wash your back (without help), they exfoliate your whole body.  </li>
      <li>They are so big, I just cut to size and when the water hit it, VOILA my old friend was back in my life.</li>
      <li>Took a few extra days to get it but worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I cut them to the size I needed later, only thing they come completely pure so seeds will fall out for a while the frist time you wet it.</li>

<li> This one feels like it will last a long time.  </li>
<li> Took a while to get rid the loose material, so it was a bit itchy for about two weeks with daily use.</li>
<li> gave it 4 stars because dry</li>
<li> this is not available thru prime, but not a big deal,  the thing arrives from Egypt and when it does, do take the time to soak in water and vinegar, it&#x27;s only to get the earthy smell out.  </li>
<li> Also it does have a slight musty smell  I mixed shampoo and apple cider vinegar to get rid of the smell.</li>
<li> It IS the real authentic thing, pliable and exfoliates the skin, but to send something dirty and dusty to a consumer is NOT smart.</li>
<li> Received it sooner than expected.  </li>
<li> , it was 17&amp;#34; and wet is was about 18.5&amp;#34;, and not as the advertised 20&amp;#34;-22&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
<li> loofah - feels like a rough cloth and conforms to your body.</li>

    <li> This sponge really does come from Egypt like the others have stated, so be patient as it does take some time. Also, because I had to sign for mine, it wasn&#x27;t left at my door.  Instead I had to pick it up at the post office.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because dry, it was 17&amp;#34; and wet is was about 18.5&amp;#34;, and not as the advertised 20&amp;#34;-22&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is lovely though! It is a great exfoliator without being stiff as a board.  It can wrap around and be molded to your arm or leg where you can uniformly exfoliate instead of just drastically exfoliating the high points and none of the low.&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I took pictures of the product and used a tuna can for scale...it was right beside me, so.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I have been searching wildly for this loofah, I used to order them from another site but unfortunately they closed(sad).  I was slightly skeptical upon ordering from you because most of the loofah&#x27;s shown online end up being the hard, bleached yukky kind.  My order came very fast and there was anxiety upon opening the package but YIPPPEEEEEEE, MY LOOFAH!!! They are so big, I just cut to size and when the water hit it, VOILA my old friend was back in my life. Thank you, thank you , THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> just wonderful and BIG!</li>
    <li> smelt terrible and was huge and had something gross in it, I didn&#x27;t use it, I just threw it away. not worth the trouble of returning it.</li>
    <li> It was shipped fast and the quality excellent&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I ordered it</li>
    <li> Great flexible and soft loofah - feels like a rough cloth and conforms to your body. Very large - enough to cut into 2 or more large size scrubbers. Comes with an earthy smell which soon wears off and a few seeds. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These were great quality, good sized.  Cut the size you need, rinse, and use.</li>
    <li> It is the best loofah I&#x27;ve had hands down. Doesn&#x27;t hold water, isn&#x27;t bleached and doesn&#x27;t build up bacteria! I wash with this and literally you can see the dirt washing away and off of my skin! I don&#x27;t wash with anything else. I&#x27;m going to buy a second one since these are hard to come across. It came in a week BTW!</li>
    <li> These Loofahs (or Leafies) as they are called in the Middle East are the best things you can clean yourself with.  Most people hate them because they say they are to hard and harsh.  And they can be if you buy them attached to something from a store.  But if you buy the real whole Loofah from a good source (like Amazon) - these ones come from Egypt, then you will not have any trouble softening them.  These are actually gourds, not sponges.  Sponges grow under water, these do not.  They are long enough to wash your back (without help), they exfoliate your whole body.  I have always cut about 2-3 inches off the tapered end and use it to wash my face.  I have done this since I was 10, I am now 62.  My whole family uses them.  One caution:  don&#x27;t use this on your skin if you have a sun burn, no matter how soft it is, it can hurt.  When you get it, it will be flat, fill up your kitchen sink with hot water and let it soak, it will swell to 3-4 times it&#x27;s original size, I make sure that I hang it after use so it does not get moldy or sit in water.  I highly recommend using these.</li>
    <li> Clean, cut to size, and get inflated to correct size and proper scrubbing are what these authentic Egyptian Pharaoh&#x27;s and their fabulous Nubian women used to smooth the contrasts of their incredibly smooth skin, which you and your lady will experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for face and other &#x27;delicate areas,&#x27; that require the &#x27;gentle,&#x27; touch with a complete clean. Rinse thoroughly and put right into the dryer for longer-lasting and cleaner usage. It bounces right back to form for that next morning before going to work. It&#x27;s invaluable and always worth the wait. It&#x27;s the real deal and cut to size gives more for the money. Almost two-feet. Cut four-inch lengths, let the thickness take car of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this authentic &amp;#34;Loufa,&amp;#34; and you should too. Great for all ages.</li>
    <li> love it, exactly the sponge I bought in Greece a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Very nice sponge.  Long enough to reach your entire back.  Good quality and value. Highly recommend. Took a few extra days to get it but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love my Natural loofah ant live with out it, i thought i left a review on this product already.. I hope this is the last review email on this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful well worth waiting for</li>
    <li> this is not available thru prime, but not a big deal,  the thing arrives from Egypt and when it does, do take the time to soak in water and vinegar, it&#x27;s only to get the earthy smell out.  Aside from that it is good to go.  I will say when it arrives its folded in half, but after you&#x27;ve soaked it, watch out, Its, ginormous!  Then when you need to just cut a piece off.</li>
    <li> The loofahs are great, but they arrived smelling of dung (sheep most likely).  I am not opposed to it so much since I grew up in a country where we grew our own loofahs and had livestock, but I would still suggest giving the loofahs a quick boil when you get them.  The loofahs themselves are exactly what I wanted, but it&#x27;s disappointing that they passed the smell QA before being sent out to me.</li>
    <li> Received it sooner than expected.  The loofah is just as shown online.  Looking at it in person, it&#x27;s easy to tell that it is a beautiful, natural product.  SO GLAD I bought it!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from bonballon and I&#x27;m 100% happy with it! Seller is amazing as there was a shipping issue - due to USPS - and it was resolved immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the loofah, throw away those inferior loofahs that take 6 months to soften. The BEST LOOFAH IS EGYPTIAN LOOFAH! This is the type used at top spas around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus of buying from bonballon is the price. Anywhere else expect to pay AT LEAST 4 times more - just be patient as it ships from Egypt.</li>
    <li> It Really so good . like the one i used to have back home</li>
    <li> Oh geez...This product really was postmarked &amp;#34;from Egypt&amp;#34;...the only thing it looks like it was sitting in a dusty sunny window, so it had dark brown streaks, there was some type of dead bug inside of it, and it looked like they dusted the shelf with it before sending it to me. It IS the real authentic thing, pliable and exfoliates the skin, but to send something dirty and dusty to a consumer is NOT smart. Pass on this seller...I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how anyone can flatten a loofah out?? Mine was. Anyway, I cut the bug out, and clipped away any spare parts I saw embedded in the holes. I sprayed it with Lysol, and set in Sun for 2 days to sanitize it. But I will never ever buy this again form Egypt.</li>
    <li> Came before it was supposed to. It was clean. (I cleaned it anyway) Easy to cut. East to use. It lathers well and rinses clean. I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> Good product as described and it arrived way ahead of the time indicated.</li>
    <li> Could not be happier! Best loofah I&#x27;ve found - natural, large size, great exfoliater!  Buying another for my sister!  (And don&#x27;t be put off by its appearance when it arrives.  Soak it and it&#x27;s perfect!)</li>
    <li> I cut this into 3 pieces and love it!</li>
    <li> allow time for delivery... the wait was worth it.  I cut in half, and  then cut a couple 1&amp;#34; rounds to use as pot scrubbers.&lt;br /&gt; Will order again !</li>
    <li> This is a great product, its large and wide, exactly what is advertised. It does take a while to get here but its worth the wait. I&#x27;m very satisified with the quality.</li>
    <li> Received the loofah faster than I thought. It is the BEST sponge I&#x27;ve ever used since I was little. It is just rough enough to have a good scrub in shower. I can use any soap on it (even soap nut liquid works fine). It is also huge. Now I just hope the piece I cut from the loofah can last a full month. If it does, this will be the best economical natural sponge I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really gives your skin a good cleaning.</li>
    <li> What a successful purchase.  I was looking for a good loofah for a long time and am so happy I found this excellent Egyptian product.  It cannot be compared to any... so called loofahs which are sold in stores.  I soaked in hot water before use and it took its natural round shape.  I would definitely advise this product to any loofah fan or those who like a good massage and silky skin.  I bought two (!!!) and both seem to be of the same good quality.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll not be disappointed.  And, it was delivered by registered mail two weeks earlier than specified during purchase.</li>
    <li> So this is my second attempt to buy a loofa from Amazon and now I am happy! Unlike the ones that come from China, this one was soft, lathered really well but still exfoliated like a dream.  And it is massive!  I just cut a portion of it to use and when it wears out, I will cut another piece.  I am buying one to send to all of my family.</li>
    <li> All I use to wash for the past 2 years are Egyptian Loofah&#x27;s, and my skin has never looked better! The place I usually get the from closed so I was happy to find another online seller with a great price for whole loofah&#x27;s . I cut them to the size I needed later, only thing they come completely pure so seeds will fall out for a while the frist time you wet it. Also it does have a slight musty smell  I mixed shampoo and apple cider vinegar to get rid of the smell. Other than that these are amazing, would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> The loofah sponge is huge and works very well.  We had purchased a small loofah locally and were very disappointed with it, it fell apart after a short amount of time.  This one feels like it will last a long time.  My husband has been very pleased with the scrubber. We will purchase one again when necessary.</li>
    <li> Very soft and flexible. Took a while to get rid the loose material, so it was a bit itchy for about two weeks with daily use. But now it&#x27;s well worth the shipment from Egypt! I love the full size - nothing like the small stiff material from previous purchases.</li>
    <li> Biggest loofa i ever saw and it comes in a fed ex bag all the way from Egypt, complete with customs stamps and beatiful lettering. Loofa is big enough to wrap around your ams or legs and  butt. You can scrub your whole stomach at one swipe.</li>
    <li> Really natural loofah [seeds &amp; all]. Buy with confidence.</li>
