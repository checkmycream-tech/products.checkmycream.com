<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with Tea Tree oil, it&#x27;s qualities and applications, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for. If you&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m sorry. You should research its many healthful uses. I keep a supply of this around for everything from bug bites to minor cuts.</li>
    <li> Great price, for a great item!</li>
    <li> Works great. Have to be able to tolerate the tea tree scent though, because it is strong when first applied.</li>
    <li> Excellent oil for my feet to avoid fungus and for the mold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had toenail fungus problems for over 40 years. The products available, including this one that I use, Tea Tree Oil,  all have one limiting factor in that they cannot penetrate the nail. The fungus lives under the nail and just laughs at you when you attempt to eradicate it. Nails are tough. You can attack the fungus at the tip of the nail, and perhaps on the sides, but at the bed of the nail, the fungus is about as safe and secure as the gold in Fort Knox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not recommending this procedure for anyone, because it is a bit radical, and certainly could have side effects. I&#x27;m only telling you what has finally worked for me after trying a whole lot of other things for many years. I use a small handheld Dremel Rotary Grinding tool to create, between two and 4, small holes in the base of my infected toenails. Perhaps a 1/8th of an inch in diameter. I&#x27;m not into S&amp;M and not thrilled with feeling pain, but it isn&#x27;t as gruesome as it may sound. Normally there is little if any damaging of the skin at all. I&#x27;ve done it several times so I&#x27;m used to it, and I&#x27;m always very careful. I stop when I feel a slight burning sensation, and that is mostly actual heat produced by the grinding tip of the tool that I&#x27;m feeling. I stop on that spot momentarily, and go to another, and then come back to the first one a bit later. Of course my goal is to penetrate through the entire nail, or at least very close to, if not all the way through. I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to go right to the skin, because it seems to work just as well both ways. Treatments will not go through the entire nail, but seem to penetrate a few thin layers just fine.  Being very careful, I&#x27;ve only drawn blood once. It was like a small scratch. The big toe needs the most holes ground into it, a total of 4 in each, and there are 2 holes in each of the smaller toes. I then use Tea Tree Oil to kill the fungus by applying it at least twice a day when I wake up and before going to bed. If it is convenient, I will use it at other times such as after working out and then taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned that there could be side effects to this procedure. The major one is that unless I actually do the treatments to my toenails, meaning &amp;#34;put some Tea Tree Oil or some other known fungus treatment on the nails&amp;#34;, I could be opening them up for some other little bugs or bacteria that can also cause problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that what is happening here, is that the fungus can&#x27;t retreat to the base of my toenails for protection any more. As the toenail grows out, of course the holes move up the toe with the rest of the nail, chasing the fungus ahead of it. Chasing may be an improper term for something that goes this slowly. In this last treatment session, the holes have moved up about an 1/8 of an inch in two weeks. It will take 5 to 6 weeks or more for the entire nail to grow out. Products that claim clear clean toenails in one to two weeks are lying to you. The fungus is pretty tenacious, and will try to come back and probably will again at some point. I just do the same process again. The moment I see any trace of the fungus I bring out the Dremel tool again and start over.t at other times such as after working out and then taking a shower.

    <li> Super Price, fast delivery,</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, won&#x27;t know how it works for a while but it is worth a shot.  I say try it!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that I&#x27;ll save some money but the oil does not smell as tea tree oil seem like it&#x27;s a weak diluted oil. I usually buy the tea tree oil from Plant Therapy (also Amazon) and can tell that it is strong and it&#x27;s a real deal. I found that pharmaceutical grade is the oil that they can add or take out things to fit the specification but therapeutic grade usually pure oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this oil for rash or something that is not main concern for real heavy lifting I&#x27;ll use Tea Tree from Plant Therapy (pay a little more but it works). By the way the smell of this brand will stay on for a long time but from Plant Therapy Co. will kind of dispersed fast (less add on carrier oil???)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit June 22: Upgraded from 3 to 5 stars after my friend used it on his wart and skin discolor. He told me that this oil work on wart and rash, within 2 days he could see the improvement and thanked me for giving him this oil. Guess one can&#x27;t just an oil from it smell.</li>
    <li> Like others that have reviewed this product I was unhappy with the toenail fungus treatments on the market.  I had heard of tea tree oil as being antifungal, and many of the &amp;#34;great, natural&amp;#34; treatments, that also cost lots of money, listed tea tree oil as one of the main ingredients.  My toenail is not clear yet, but it is definitely getting better.</li>
    <li> Best topical oil and cheaper than you can get at any brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> I have 2 year old grandson who loves outside.  I do not spray him with feet so I ,made a solution with tree oil for tick repellent.  We live in the country and so far it is working great</li>
    <li> Package came damaged, but no issues with the product itself.  Very strong smelling though.  You get a lot of oil for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great essential oil to use for household or beauty uses - it can be used in so many ways! I got it to use in a home-made all purpose cleaner which I read about in one of my gardening blogs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good quality product, and I received it very quickly. The price was good, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to use this on a daily basis because the scent is so strong but it does seem to alleviate my itchy skin when I can stand to use it.</li>
    <li> Bought it because I read somewhere that it kills athletes feet and toe nail fungus. I guess it is working. It&#x27;s been about a month and I have seen an improvement in my feet.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil just as advertised at full strength and a great value. this little bottle will last you forever.</li>
    <li> It works great for my needs...  A bit strong smelling at first, but no more than its suppose to, and it gradually goes away..  I would definitely recommend it as a way to fight bacteria on the face that promotes acne..</li>
    <li> Why not just buy the pure 100% Tea tree oil and save a lot of money, my whole family is using it now. After a while you will get used to the smell, not a big deal. Love it, do some good to your skin.</li>
    <li> This is great pure quality tea tree oil. I have been using it for a while so This is by far a great deal for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dry itchy scalp in the winter. Winter really does a number on my scalp and causes awful dandruff. I pour a cap full into my hair in the shower. Let it sit for a while. Keep your head tilted back so that it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes. Then I put my shampoo on top and rinse if out. My scalp feels amazing afterward!!! Like it is really breathing! No more itch and dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con- the smell is very strong! I don&#x27;t mind it because it feels so good, but my husband cannot stand it. Every time I use it my whole bathroom smells of this. Other than that, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I am using for toe nail fungus.  So far happy with product.</li>
    <li> Used it to inhibit mold growth. Seems to have worked!</li>
    <li> I love it works for my family diy skin I put it what&lt;br /&gt;other oils it is great but you skiing</li>
    <li> all it does is dry my toe nails out it has not help me at all</li>
    <li> If you have a nail fungus and are pregnant or nursing, I highly recommend this product.  I used a tea tree oil from a vitamin supplement store for about 7 months and hardly saw results.  I used this product for a few weeks and am already seeing results.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is cheaper for the quality than I could find elsewhere.  I&#x27;ve used it on my toe nails several times and don&#x27;t know the end result yet as far as how they will look over time.  As far as tea tree oil, this one is the real thing and high quality.  I believe if any tea tree oil will work, it will be this one.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I am using it to clear up acne and it does a great job. If you can deal with the awful smell, then you are good to go. My only complaint is that the oil leaked a bit when I opened it from the packaging. It didn&#x27;t seem to be as tightly packed as it should have been. The package smelled horrible because of the oil leak, but other than that I can&#x27;t complain about what the product actually does. If you&#x27;re looking to get rid of acne - this is a great product! Good price too for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Excellent if you can remember what the heck you are to use it for!Except it did not help to prevent dry scalp. Only drinking 3 tablespoons of \\&quot;Apple Cider Vinegar(with MOTHERS, must have the mothers version)\\&quot; *Try Braggs Organic* or health food store, this got rid of dry scalp and it also cleared my skin as well as making it super smooth! It tastes completely disgusting but is worth it!! It says drink it in water, but no way. Don&#x27;t stretch out drinking icky stuff. Take it as a shot, once, done. Have a coke or something ready to use as a chaser so you don&#x27;t gag! The Coke makes the taste disappear! Just have two gulps, works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Do not refrigerate your Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
    <li> This bottle is much bigger than I expected!  Neat! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Got this product to help with acne. Seems to be working so far. The smell was awful at first, but I am used to it now and it is not so bad. Overall very pleased. Received the product promoptly.</li>
    <li> Pure, medicinal quality Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with minor breakouts. I mostly wanted to try it because the chemical creams I&#x27;ve used in the past stain my pillows. This really does help, it&#x27;s a drying oil that I use on occasion. I had started using it all over my face and realized it works better as more of a spot treatment or it might over dry your skin and cause it to become more oily to compensate.   The only downside is the smell. Obviously it&#x27;s an oil, and it has a strong scent of eucalyptus. My fiance tells me I smell like a christmas tree when I put it on my face at night.</li>
    <li> A little of this pure tea tree oil goes a long long way! I bought it to use to kill mildew and mold....it works!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see results (1 week so far for mild acne) so I will just base my review on the misleading words on the packaging. On the front of the bottle it states, \\&quot;100% Pure Australian Oil\\&quot; - okay? What is Australian oil? I thought I was buying TTO.  Then on the side of the label it states, \\&quot;The Australian standards require that the oil of Melaleuca alternifolia must be composed of less than 15% cineole and over 30% terpinen-4-ol. Our superior grade of Tea Tree Oil is meticulously analyzed to ensure that it exceeds these levels of oil quality standards decreed by the Australian government. Our Tea Tree Oil is composed of less than 5% cineole and over 35% terpinen-4-ol which qualifies for \\&quot;Pharmaceutical Grade\\&quot;, as established by the Australian Tea Tree Oil Association.\\&quot;  Now, maybe that means it *is* 100% TTO but just a weaker concentration or maybe it means that it&#x27;s diluted; I&#x27;m not sure. What I do know is, it&#x27;s slightly confusing and as a consumer, I like to know exactly what it is I am buying. I have not purchased TTO in several years but I do remember it smelling stronger than this bottle does. I do believe I will be looking for another brand when this bottle runs out. I saw another reviewer mention Now Foods&#x27; TTO - I have purchased from them before and trust their products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a pure oil, something about it seems \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  I won&#x27;t purchase this brand again, I will pay more for a better quality oil.</li>
    <li> This product is supposed to be a serious arrow in your quiver if your fighting a bodily fungus infection. I&#x27;ve been fighting a life long losing battle with toenail fungus and tea tree oil is supposed to put a hurt on it. After 5 months of strict hygene and dedicated use applying directly under the nail using a glue syringe, the tea tree oil has had no perceivable affect on the fungus. I&#x27;ve yet to find a topically applied product that shows any sign of effecting toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> I wish it had a different top so you could add drops instead of pouring it.</li>
    <li> Bought this product hoping it would help with my toe fungus...didn&#x27;t work. Been using it for almost six months and I haven&#x27;t seen any results. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I love Tea Tree oil.... I mix it with other ointments sometimes; dilute with water for a facial tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps a bit with razor bumps for me if I&#x27;m growing out my beard and I find it can keep some zits/blemishes at bay or dry them overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is my cure all!&lt;br /&gt;This helped get rid of a keloid I was getting from a new nose piercing. It also helps dry out blemishes. Since it is so drying be sure to not use too much and maybe even use a q tip for spot application!</li>
    <li> I use the tea tree oil for allergic breakouts such as poison oak.  Also use when I am around high risk individuals who may spread drug resistant diseases as an antiseptic.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the smell its a great alternative non toxic way to kill head lice</li>
    <li> Smells a bit use it at night or others will avoid you..</li>
    <li> I guess its good- smells strong and medicinal, but no dropper top is more of an issue than I thought it would be!</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> headline says it all this is a waste of money I&#x27;eve been robbed and will never have that money back. this stuff stinks and was nasty smelled like an industrial toxin. I know tea tree and quality and this is not it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with water to sanitize my yoga mats. It is really hard to pour and just goes all over the place. I would recommend getting a dropper if you are needing to pour it.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is the real deal - nothing diluted about it.  However, this may not be the best thing for some people, becuase it&#x27;s so potent that exposure to the skin without dilution in oil may cause a lot of irritation.  One or two drops in a bath tub of water is about the maximum exposure you would want, to give you an idea of how concentrated this oil is.</li>
    <li> This is serious stuff. Please dilute it before putting it on ur skin because it can burn and leave redness behind. Helps with skin conditions</li>
    <li> Very pure. This is awesome just what i wanted. Use in laundry on body in bath in humidifier !! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for 10+ years. I have purchased many brands over the years.  Tea tree oil has a very,very distinctive smell to it.  The minute I open the bottle and smelled it I knew this wasn&#x27;t tea tree oil.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but there is no way this is &amp;#34;100% Pure&amp;#34; tea tree oil. I&#x27;m going to be throwing this away.  Wish I could give this 0 stars.  Very disappointed will not purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> For some reason (probably because I have never flossed) my front bottom teeth became loose.  This product, over a few weeks (one bottle), fixed the problem.  I will continue to use the product and give it my highest rating.</li>
    <li> The oil is very good, but the bottle does not come with an eye dropper and when you attempt to pour a bit out, it spills and dribbles all over the side of the bottle. Poorly designed bottle.</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree Oil is one of the best tea tree oil products I have purchased thus far and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle worker I put it on my daughters mosquito bites and they heal right up.  One note I&#x27;ve read that tea tree oil isn&#x27;t always great for males (apparently it has some sort of estrogen or estrogen like compound so I am wary to use on my husband and son much)</li>
    <li> I received this the next day which was awesome. I&#x27;ve never tried Tea Tree Oil before but when I heard how good it was I had to give it a shot. Mixed it with a bit of water and used it as an astringent. It has a very strong odor like Eucalyptus, but I kinda like it. It feels cool on the skin even though it is essentially *oil* which I had some worries about. But it gives a naturally medicated feeling, and I notice it smooths out any bumps I had very quickly. The only drawback is that this definitely dries out your skin so you WILL need a moisturizer. I used 2 parts water per 1 part oil, so maybe I need to water it down more to have less dryness. I think Tea Tree Oil is the stuff doctors never want you to know about. Why visit them when you can use natural and inexpensive things at home with better results!!!</li>
    <li> The smell takes a little getting used to, but overall a good product</li>
    <li> I have moderate-little acne, but I had heard wonderful things about this product, so I bought it to try out. I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell, and it didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference for my skin. My mother liked it though! She got the pads, however.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  I have used it on my dogs, my husband and myself for many purposes.  After cleaning my face, I apply a little on a cotton ball and wipe my face.  Amazing how much shows up on my face and now my face is showing no aging signs!!!  I&#x27;m 45 years young.  It&#x27;s great for any small wounds, multiple uses!!  I will continue to purchase this!!</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil not much to say.  I am not impressed with the scent, it seems too chemical smelling.  I attribute it to using one brand steadily for several years and then letting my wife pick this stuff.</li>
    <li> This did nothing on a skin tag. Several applications a day, over a month.</li>
    <li> Bottle leaked all over box.</li>
    <li> I got the tea tree oil 3 days ago with hopes of getting rid of my acne. So far it&#x27;s worked great. My face is clearing up! It is a little drying so you only want to use it where you need it. It also has a strong smell so it&#x27;s probably only something you want to put on at night. The smell will go away after a little bit. I think it&#x27;s a great natural way to clear up acne!! I&#x27;ve also looked on line and there a ton of other uses for it. I think that I will be buying a lot more of this product!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product and use this for scalp/dandruff problems. It cleared my acne caused due to dandruff.     My dermatologist recommend tea tree based products (known for its anti-fungal properties) and shampoo to clear scalp problems such as itching, flaking etc. and this product delivers good results. I suffer from dandruff only when I am stressed but once I get dandruff it refuses to go. So, at least I have something that can help me beforehand.    Try this regularly for first few days and then reduce the frequency and I promise it clears the scalp as no other dandruff or regular shampoo can do. I generally leave it overnight and wash it in the morning with a tea tree based shampoo (Giovanni tea tree shampoo) and alternate days with a keratin shampoo (sulfate free - Mirta de perales Keratin shampoo).    The product is not too oily, you can use it almost everyday. I have wasted money like crazy over dandruff shampoos with different ingredients in it which promise to clear scalp but only this one is a &#x27;value for money&#x27;.    Only thing disappointing is the bottle size, I wish they had a larger size but for product results/feedback, I still give it a rating of 5.    Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product, I read extensively on the uses and benefits of tea tree oil and was eager to try this out. The listed prices for tea tree oil though stopped me cold. Some were as high as twenty dollars for an ounce bottle...yikes. I&#x27;m a college student, full-time worker and am always looking a good bargain after finding out firsthand that every dollar does matter. I was happy to find this and at the same time, skeptical since I read about tea tree oil scams that advertised the oil for cheaper and gave you fool&#x27;s gold instead. My mother convinced me that if this would be the case, I could always return...so, I went ahead, and it arrived within the promised time. I opened the bottle....&lt;drum-roll&gt;...it was fabulous. The oil inside had the distinct scent of tea tree and was the right color, pure as promised. I used it to fade out an old scar and within two week, it did just that after religious use every morning and night. Word of caution, the scent is extremely strong and lingers, so I wouldn&#x27;t go crazy with it. You can be \\&quot;meager\\&quot; with this and still get results. It&#x27;s quite versatile. I also use it on fresh cuts, as a natural cleaning agent, and on my scalp since it greatly reduces itchy scalp. Truly great product.</li>
    <li> The order arrived very quickly.  It is plenty, just like the other reviews said.  It is not as potent as other Tea Tree Oil I have purchased, but it is still good.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my shampoo or conditioner or sometimes just put it directly on my scalp. My head feels great and cool as soon as I put it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it by mixing it with my body wash soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does not sting or harms the body in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update :-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a year now. I continued to be satisfied with it. whenever I have excess dandruff, I use i with my shampoo..it always solves the problem!</li>
    <li> The product is good and was packaged extremely well but there was some leakage through the lid of the bottle inside the package. I will reorder - I assume this was a fluke.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT ON MY HAIR! I USE IT IN MY MONISTAT STORE BRAND) MIX WITH PLENTY OF OTHER HEALTHY OILS. I DO THAT EVERY OTHER WEEK. THAT&#x27;S MY HAIR CONDITIONER!</li>
    <li> I have been using skin products all my life now, i&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne ever since i was 14; it got really bad in my late teens, I&#x27;m 24 years old now, and I still get bumps from time to time.  On my 24th birthday, kid you not, I probably had the worst outbreak of my life, people would walk in and ask \\&quot;what happened, did you get into a fight?\\&quot;...VERY BAD!  I kept using noxzema; but not only would i have breakouts, I would have \\&quot;painful breakouts\\&quot;, it would be like 2 pimples that freaking hurt.  I use this tea tree oil, wow.  This crap is amazing.  You feel it tingle, and like another comment said, the first thing to go away is the pain.  Next day the pimple is dry.  This thing reduced my acne in little less than a week.  I&#x27;M NOT SAYING RESULTS ARE TYPICAL.  But this Tea Tree Oil is straight from GOD!   As many people are saying however, make sure that you dilute, I used a tea tree oil cream (highest ingredients were water, tea tree oil in that order) so it was already diluted out the box; so make sure you do that.  Go to my profile or something, I don&#x27;t even write reviews for amazon, but this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is long recommended and praised as a natural anti-fungal. Tea Tree oil is long proven in its effectiveness for dealing with problems for nails and skin. Having purchased this product for half the size for twice the price from a natural store, I highly recommend the purchase from here at AMazon. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this product for this size.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment and very good products.I highly recommand this products for any kind of skin and nail infections with any known and unknown yeat.</li>
    <li> so i have been struggling with uneven skin tone for years but about a year and a half ago for the first time in my life i started breaking out  bad i tried everything you can think of during that time frame..even went to the dermatologist but all they say its because of the climat change since i have been in south korea for that time. i search and search online of a way of stoping it and finnaly i found out that tea tree oil can be a good solution then came here read some reviews about it and tought i might give it a try.. well i have been using this diluted in water as a toner for about a week now and OMG,OMG the result are freaking unbelivable no more acne not a single pimple and i can already see that the marks are fading away and ouFFF MY SKIN LOOKS ABOSOLUTLY georgeous......even, clear and healty....&lt;br /&gt;i really really recommand this product to anyone struggling with dark spot uneven skin tone and acne ...because THAT STUFF WORK AND ITS A MIRACLE OF NATURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. ( jst dont forgot to dilute it in some water because using it by itself can cause damages to your skin)</li>
    <li> The product arrived fine but did not work for toenail fungus.  If you are looking for something that cures toenail fungus this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Strong stuff. Just what we ordered</li>
    <li> I workout in between class and of course, shower before I head back. From using the public showers I caught a small case of ringworm and heard this was a good home remedy. I must say, its EXCELLENT at destroying the ringworm fungus. I used lotramin for 2 weeks and saw slow and steady improvement however, I applied this instead for TWO days and I already can&#x27;t see the fungus. Overall great product and its all natural too! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> I am never without tea tree oil and not loyal to any brand. Just make sure it&#x27;s undiluted.  Always buy 100% Essential Tea Tree Oil.  I buy it in 16 ounce bottles. It last a long time.     As long as it&#x27;s 100 percent tea tree oil I&#x27;m good. It works from everything to getting rid of fleas and mange on dogs to lice and ring worm on children. It even dries out a pimple fairly quickly. And if I were ever to have nail fungus I would treat it with tea trea oil before resorting to other medications.     For lice I place a few drops into a dime sized blotch of shampoo and wash kids hair as usual. Then I do the same with their leave in conditioner and then blow dry child&#x27;s hair completely. Both the heat and the oil kill the lice. To be on the safe side I treat everyone in the house.     Then I soak brushes and combs daily in a water/tea tree oil mix. 40 drops to every 8 ounces of water. You can reuse the water mix if you do this in a bucket.     I also make up the same solution of 60 drops to 8 ounces of water and place it in a spritz bottle so I can spray all our furniture, bedding, clothes, stuffies and whatever else you think might have a louse on it.     I even put 40 drops into my laundry soap and fabric softener. Not the whole bottle, but 40 drops for every wash and rinse cycle. Hope this makes sense.     Sadly, when my children where in elementary school lice was abundant and we had to deal with it on four occasions. The first two times I used the regular products. They are both expensive and not nearly as effective as the tea tree oil, nor as safe. The third time I did two regular shampoos with the chemical ridden shampoos and followed up with tea tree oil regimen that I listed above. That worked great. The fourth time I treated only with tea tree oil regimen and it was super easy to get rid of.       For mange with dogs it&#x27;s similar as the lice treatment. I place several drops into both their dime sized blob of shampoo and conditioner. I leave in the conditioner. Andthen spray them down with the sprintzer full of 60 drops of oil to every 8 ounces of water. In between baths I sprintz them down two times a day and rub the solution into their skin. I also spritz their bedding between washes and carpeting and anything they may lie on. I swear it works better than the mange dip I got from the vet and the over the counter mange stuff I bought at the feed store. Plus, it&#x27;s safer to use than what the vet gives you and smells so much better than what is at the feed store. And most importantly completely gets rid of it.     I also use it in my mop water and my kitchen and bathroom cleaning solutions. I place several drops into my hand soap dispensers. And I even use it to disinfect cuts and other sores. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> I had what turned out to be toe fungus on my left big toe. I had lost the nail three or four times over a period of a few years. Each new nail would eventually \\&quot;blister\\&quot; at the base then crack and spit and loosen to the point of falling off. I finally did some web research and found some \\&quot;hi-end\\&quot; fancy named fungus treatments, all quite expensive. What I noticed is that they kept touting that they had \\&quot;tree tea oil\\&quot; in them. So I mused, this seems to be the magic curing ingredient these fancy treatments were depending on. I wondered if this tree tea oil was available on it own. Seems to me that this \\&quot;tree tea oil\\&quot; is the stuff I really need. Sure enough, it was available, and for a fraction of the price of the fancy names that \\&quot;included\\&quot; it. I ordered bottle and treated my toe diligently EVERY morning with the oil, applying it with a Q-tip for about two months, and it is now completely cured with a strong clear normal new nail. And I only used about 1/6 of the bottle to boot! My thoughts are, just use this inexpensive oil, with the key being; treating it consistently on a daily basis until one&#x27;s nail grows back in normally and healthy again. :)</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with Tea Tree oil, and I have to say that, even being fore-mentioned, the smell is quite strong. Opening the bottle releases an overpowering and generally unpleasant smell. Having ordered this to make a salve, I should remark than when diluted with the other ingredients, the resultant smell is a sort of lemony-menthol smell. Which really seems kind of strange, to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, it does appear to work rather well, and I will probably buy from the same provider again in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazin. I have dandruf really bad and once I started applying this to my scalp, there was NO MORE DANDRUFF. And it didn&#x27;t make my hair oily or heavy. And it only have a small oder, but it goes away in hours. yeah! This is a must buy.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-great cleaner for dirt and oil on skin&lt;br /&gt;-great for superficial lesions that are possibly bacterial or fungal&lt;br /&gt;-use with new circle cotton cleaner pads they are cheap at walmart or cvs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-very potent smell, so use at night&lt;br /&gt;-pricey</li>
    <li> Great product and the best tea tree oil on Amazon - but they&#x27;ve raised the price by $4 since last week. They had an upsurge in sales and sold out, so naturally they assumed raising the price would be a proper way to compensate for demand. C&#x27;mon guys, it&#x27;s been $10 bucks forever.</li>
    <li> Using this to avoid getting lice. So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using for over 6 months now.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand Amazon&#x27;s presentation of this item.  It says \\&quot;($1.87/Oz.)\\&quot;.  When it is about U$15 per 2 Oz. bottle, how can it be U$1.87/Oz.?</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! and I use it for a variety of problems. I must point out though, I have been seeing some people asking or feeling dissapointed that there was no glass dropper...If you are referring to the one with the rubber squeezy thing on top, I would not recommend using it....I would not use it to store in a plastic container or bottle as well. The Tea tree oil seems to affect rubber and plastic as well foam....some tops to bottles have a foam like seal but the oil will left it or cause it to swell. I dont know, Just from my experience.</li>
    <li> Good for those pesky spots that irritate when aging.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong smell, that lasts forever. It&#x27;s hard to use it on skin unless you want to  wear the medicine like smell for days.</li>
    <li> The oil looks good, the problem is the pouring lid that is impossible to insert, leaving me to waste most of the oil. I had to carefully change part of the content to another recipient.</li>
    <li> So some time ago I lucked out on amazon and got a huge bottle of Tea Tree oil for very cheap, it was the first time I had used Tea Tree Oil and it worked great for shaving.   After that bottle was empty I hoped on and just blindly ordered another bottle after the same manufacturer was not available.  That was a huge learning experience, while it was advertised as \\&quot;Tea Tree Oil: 100% pure essential oil\\&quot; it was clearly a blend of \\&quot;essential oils\\&quot; and was not pure Tea Tree Oil, the smell was very off and it did not seem to be nearly as effective.   So back to the search, after some reading I found this product and it just arrived. Immediately I popped off the cap and sure enough this smells perfect, I used it to shave with this morning and it is fantastic. This will be my go to brand from this point on. Order without hesitation if you want pure tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This is just a life saver. I started getting pimples and whiteheads about a year ago after turning 19. I overreacted and ran to the drugstore and bought all kinds of things for my face. Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, fancy toners, special moisturizers and cleansers; everything. Of course my face got even worse, and my stressed levels soared, and accordingly my acne got even worse. So after 8 months I just stopped everything and went back to what i used in highschool: Dove bar soap and a soft towel for exfoliating. I went back to washing my face once a day again. I still had some pimples and clogged pores so I started looking for more natural things to add to my skin care routine. I discovered witch hazel as a toner and I love it. Then I read that Tea Tree Oil was good for pimples and clogged pores. I put this on my face, diluted, every other night before bed. This magical oil completely rid my face of those tiny annoying bumps and actual pimples. For some it only took a night, for others it took a max of 3 days. I use to get a new bump everyday, now I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil stinks but you&#x27;ll get use to it. If you have sensitive skin you MUST dilute this. I put this undiluted on a pimple to test it out at first, the next day the pimple was gone but I had a really dark spot in it&#x27;s place. It took weeks to go away. Mix about 3 drops of TTO into about 25 drops of water. This creates a 15% or so dilution. But it&#x27;s kind of a balancing act you have to figure out for yourself. Just know it should TINGLE but not BURN, if fanning your face doesn&#x27;t relieve the sensation you&#x27;ve put too much on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in no way cures acne especially if you have acne because of oily skin or hormones. However, if used consistently, just once a night, it can heal and somewhat keep breakouts them at bay. Also It Gets Worse Before It Gets Better. I know you don&#x27;t want to hear that but it does. This oil whiteheaded all of my active pimples and even drew out pimples that were under the surface of the skin. So it wont be a pretty site for a week or so.out pimples that were under the surface of the skin. So it wont be a pretty site for a week or so.</li>
    <li> I add a few drops into bath after the gym. Smells awesome. Tea tree relaxes you</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is a miracle in a bottle. It&#x27;s the best antiseptic I&#x27;ve ever used. Two of my greatest successes with the oil have been on a nail fungus and an infected surface piercing. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me but it is potent. If you have a condition that this is recommended for, buy it!</li>
    <li> Tea Tree is a wonderful oil</li>
    <li> So I purchased this to treat my adult acne. My previous experience with tea tree oil is only with Acne Barrier products (I believe it&#x27;s not available on Amazon, it&#x27;s a Japanese product) which worked really well for me, and I figured this would be something similar.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell... I guess Acne Barrier uses diluted tea tree oil, because this thing has a very strong smell. I got some on my hands when applying and I needed to wash really well with warm water &amp; soap to get rid of the smell. Although it&#x27;s a smell you can definitely get used to, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it can still make me a bit nauseous.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;ve been putting this on my acne (I get mostly white pimples) and this dries out the acne, pulling out the oil from it. I think it works just as well as the other product I&#x27;ve used, but again, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so it&#x27;s hard to tell. But has it had detrimental effects on my face? No, from what I can tell my sensitive skin is doing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3-star because of the smell. This is not a product for those with a strong/ sensitive sense of smell, but it&#x27;s a product that can be used well for acne. I might update and give it a 4-star if my skin condition improves (less acne, healing quicker).</li>
    <li> I have never used Tea tree oil before but I just love it I have used it in several projects now and it smells nice and work great</li>
    <li> my pimples were driving me nuts, until i started reading around that this was one of the best treatments for acne. i bought it and it has been nothing but happiness. there is no pimple immune to the power of this awesome oil. the smell is string at first but then you get used to it and the fact that is so effective overweights the smell. LOVED IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought tea tree oil to kill some skin fungus, it was amazing.  In less than a week the fungus is gone.  Over the counter meds didn&#x27;t work, this did.  Thanks... Angela</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  It&#x27;s not watered down.  It&#x27;s very potent. I like the smell but it&#x27;s very strong and may bother some. Use very little.</li>
    <li> terrible odor. I can&#x27;t leave the house when I use it. I smell too bad</li>
    <li> I am still using it to try cure my jock itch.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is working very well, like the jock itch is going away.&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is advertised to have anti-fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;Now I just wet a Q-Tip with the stuff, and apply it in my affected area, and it is working.&lt;br /&gt;So I am pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;Also I am doing all the other recommended things, like trying to keep the affected area as clean and dry as I can.&lt;br /&gt;Since I live in the rural country, and use to be a Marine, I know how to be dirty, too.</li>
    <li> i used this oil for about two months now on my stubborn keiliod on my chest. i havent seen any improvement for the two months i been using it.</li>
    <li> read reviews that people used for toenail fungus.  used twice a day along with DMSO first.  smells great.  nice product.  nails look better.  used for 2 weeks at a time and take a break from it for a week.  great oil.  great seller experience.  will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> Oh this stuff is nasty, It will blow open the toughest clogs.</li>
    <li> Could also be used as deer musk for hunting. I have no longer have a practical use for this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality tea tree oil and I highly recommend.  My only dissatisfaction, and the reason for 4 stars, is it doesn&#x27;t come with a slow drip dropper. No dropper may cause me to purchase elsewhere in the future.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel and look.  I will be purchasing this regularly.</li>
    <li> The bottle did not come with an eyedropper for application. The first time I used it I tried to pour a little into my hand but ended up with too much. I ended up transferring this to another bottle that had an eyedropper.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil for use on acne or other skin maladies! This definitely has the smell and tingle of pure tea tree. The only reason I did not make this 5 stars is because it has a strange after odor (like ammonia, almost) that I have never gotten from other brands of tea tree. Otherwise, it works the same :)</li>
    <li> i am so satisfied with this formula! I have very bad break outs and i was using proactive and it seemed to just make it worst so i decided to try the tea tree oil, it was easy to find and came in less than a week! i used it the first night and literally over night my face was almost completely cleared up...I use it as an astringent and i mix it(2 parts water one part teatree)I just love it! withing 3 days my face was completely cleared. Very good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I noticed almost immediate results and have already ordered a second bottle. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural antimicrobial/anti-fungal treatment.</li>
    <li> Smells strongly, but it&#x27;s a great tool for fighting acne.</li>
    <li> I have been told for years that Tea Tree Oil is used to treat Nail Fungus, and never tried it until recently......now I am SOLD! I have been using it for 3 weeks, and I believe that my toe nail is cured.  I am going to continue using it for a little longer though, since fungus is hard to kill.  My husband is now using it on his athlete&#x27;s foot!  The only downside is the oil&#x27;s natural strong strange odor.   This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I started to research on natural remedies for toe nail fungus, and decided to try it out. Every day after shower, I applied some tea tree oil straight out of the bottle onto my toe nail (used a Q-tip). And now I have no fungus at all. It had started as a small white spot on my toe nail, and when I used the tea tree oil, it stopped spreading. I basically \\&quot;grew out\\&quot; the spot, and now my toe nail looks completely normal again. It took like 4 months to do so. You just have to be very consistent and apply it every day and it works (considering it wasn&#x27;t a really bad fungus case yet; only a small bit of my nail had it).</li>
    <li> I started to break out a lot which resulted in some hideous black marks After doing some research I saw anything tea tree related is good for acne prone skin and decided to buy pure tea tree oil So far great results and my face is starting to clear up perfectly !</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product a few years ago I have since grown somewhat attached to it. That is a bit of an understatement...if I can&#x27;t use it for more than a few days I become depressed and a little bit listless. I go through withdrawals.      First of all, I use it to treat itchy scalp. If you have an infection or dry skin or just plain psoriasis it can effectively treat those conditions, perhaps even cure them. It can cure toenail fungus if you are consistent with applying it once or twice a day for a long while. I have applied it directly to my skin in liberal amounts for years now without any side effects whatsoever. After I get out of the shower I use a glass dropper (don&#x27;t use plastic, it&#x27;ll melt) to get enough to cover my entire scalp. Then I use a cotton swab to apply it to other more delicate areas. I sometimes use it for mild acne. It is great for that too because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most acne treatments.      The only negative thing I know about it is that I have to be careful when I put it on my face and other exposed areas of skin. Stepping into the sunlight for even ten minutes turns me bright red! Also, I read that it shouldn&#x27;t be put into the ears as it can damage the hairs on the eardrum, causing deafness. I still put it on my ears but am careful not to get any inside the ear canal.      It has a pretty powerful aroma. I guess it is sort of spicy smelling. I put a dab in my nostrils whenever I get an infection. In a few days, I am cured. I bet I could replace deodorant, moisturizers, and mouthwash (diluted of course) with this. It is sort of a panacea for me. Not sure what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I&#x27;ve used it as a remedy to acne, cuts &amp; scrapes, itchy/dry scalp (by adding a little to my shampoo &amp; or conditioner my dandruff went away after a couple of uses and left my scalp feeling tingly) and I know there are other uses as well. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it does have a very strong smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over six months for toe nail fungus. It has stopped the growth and spread of the fungus but it has not killed it. I have tried the different methods of application by other users but result is still the same. May have to go the laser route to rid the fungus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this to clear up my skin and some weird stuff going on with one of my toenails. My skin has cleared up wonderfully and it isn&#x27;t getting dry and scratchy like some other things I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s easy to use - just dab some on a finger and spread where you need it.  My boyfriend hates the smell though. If you don&#x27;t like eucalyptus smell (it&#x27;s similar) you won&#x27;t like this.</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit  overwhelming. I suggest using it at night instead of the morning.</li>
    <li> This oil is very potent. I love it. I use it on my skin and in my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great,I use it in place my salicylic acid serum on face and body,doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and controls my acne flair ups and it&#x27;s all natural,doesn&#x27;t smell the best but a great product😃</li>
    <li> works for pimples great</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing that it could help with acne, and this one underground pimple I had made me look like I had a witch&#x27;s wart on my nose. I have tried many over-the-counter acne cream and some of my sister&#x27;s medicated creams for severe acne, but none of them gave me the quick results I was looking for. But after using tea tree oil, I saw my HUGE pimple shrink down to the size of a sharpie dot. It was incredible how fast it works! If you have underground pimples, tea tree oil is the cure! Be careful though, when applying to the face, be sure not to get it into your eyes, nose of mouth. It really stings if you get it into your eyes. And tea tree oil can really dry out your skin. So if you have dry skin and acne, use lotion before applying tea tree oil onto your face.</li>
    <li> Aggg!! Tastes worse than most tea tree oil even!  So just beware if you use this with your toothpaste or mouthwash as I do!</li>
    <li> Very good product, love it.</li>
    <li> I first became aware of tea tree oil years ago through the melaleuca company which sold a couple of products that had the terponin/cineole percentages rated.  Although I could not find that information in any product, including this one (which is why I rate it a 4 instead of 5), I am very satisfied with the product for its intended use (i.e. to repel biting flying critters that left mosquito-like marks on my legs whenever I went out to water trees). It is good for my skin, does the job of repelling and also is good for existing bites.  I would do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son&#x27;s back acne - while it doesn&#x27;t smell great, it does the job and really makes a difference. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Should be an essential in every home. Will buy again and again. This is a great product for many home remedies such as skin rashes, ring worm, etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It can be used to treat so many different things. I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant and I&#x27;ve started to break out on the face and back. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks. My back has improved and my face....it&#x27;s like I have new skin. Word of caution: This particular bottle is pure tea tree oil, extremely potent. I make my own astringent. One part tea tree oil and about 6 parts of water. For my back I pour a little on a back scrubber in the shower after I soap down, it feels very cool and tingly, and I use it on a cotton ball on my face. Be prepared the first time you use it, it burns a little. But you feel so clean afterward. I&#x27;ve also heard you can treat bacteria infections, fungus on nails, my mother-in-law uses it as shampoo, and you can clean scrapes with it. I will always have a bottle of this stuff in my house from now on</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Very strong smell, and could cause allergic reaction on skin surface applied at full strength.  But does have overnight effect on skin lesions.  Also helped my scalp itch when put on comb and spread through hair. I also use it (diluted) to treat ear mites in my dogs ears.</li>
    <li> Has a great pure smell. Since it is pure, just a few drops of this stuff is very powerful. May still be effective if diluted.     I have been applying a couple drops every day to my big toenail with fungus, for a couple weeks now, and the fungus is almost gone, and new nail is growing out uninfected. In the past, the new nail which grew out, would be immediately invaded by the fungus, but now it&#x27;s not. I think I shall win the war soon.     I have had this toenail fungus for about a year, or more, and tried a few other antifungal creams and products before, but this newfound ally seems to have the potential to put an end to their occupation.     Since I had the toenail fungus for so long, it was deeply entrenched in my nail, and seemed to even be holding it together. After I started killing off the fungus, my toenail began falling apart. It split horizontally, the top layer pried and came off. Maybe I used too much? But it&#x27;s really not a big deal, because I still have a layer of nail, but the top really infected layer was sort of amputated away. Well anyway, I still have a great majority of this bottle left, and I think I will have some left over after this war. It&#x27;s plenty.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I bought this product to cure my toe nail fungus. So far no improvement but I have only had it for a month and I know it takes 3-6 month to see results I will update any changes in the months to come!</li>
    <li> My husband used this for small boils and a poison ivy rash. I like that it is natural. It burns the surface of the skin and dries it out. He thinks it helped the small boils. It didn&#x27;t dry out the poison ivy very well. It has a strong odor, even after it is applied to a cotton ball &amp; thrown away.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick.  Love the price for the quantity.  Works for warts, skin ailments, and much more!  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Ok ready??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an ongoing issue with fungus below my toenails and i waited to long to treat it.  After doing some research i found myself going onto Amazon looking for the tea tree oil remedy and i ended up using this product.  Well i have to say as soon as i started using it my toenails started clearing up.  The fungus initially had all my toenails white.  The very first day of applying this stuff it killed off about 1/3 of the fungus under my nail..amazing!  It seeps into the cracks and works its way under your toenail.  One thing that is very important is you need to buy a toenail file.  You need to work your nails down so they are thin and the tea tree oil will be much more effective this way.  It will soak into your nail easier so it can get a larger area of the nail bed below...very important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this stuff for months you need to keep to a strict regiment of applying the tea tree oil.  You need to apply it at a MINIMUM of two times a day if not three times a day.  It sounds like alot but you want to get rid of it right?  Its not really that bad once you get used to it.  I always put it on without diluting it...eventually my toenails started coming off so your probably going to have to expect that but they will get better.  This is what i did to rid my toes of the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Blow dry your nails after you get out of the shower for about 5 minutes on HIGH and ensure that they are completely dry.  Fungus loves water so you need to keep your toes dry at all times if you can.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  File all your toenails moderately.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Apply the tea tree oil with a Q-tip to your toenails and dont dilute it if you can handle it!&lt;br /&gt;4.)  Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this for about 2-3 months and it was pretty much all gone at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyday i would apply some of the tea tree oil to bandaids on my big toes so the oil would be constantly on the nail all day.  This seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing that is VERYimportant is tea tree oil will expire at sometime and can give you EXTREMELY bad athletes foot.  I know because it happened to me! Be very cautious of the expiration date and buy a new bottle if you need to keep applying the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whew that took some time but i hope this will help some folks out looking to get rid of this crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AS OF 4/16/12&lt;br /&gt;Well the fungus is back again so i&#x27;m trying FungiBan instead which is a little more expensive.  Really its my fault that it came back...you have to bleach all your socks and disinfect your shoes as well which i didn&#x27;t do the first time around.  In regards to the athletes foot you really shouldn&#x27;t put this stuff on if your feet are going to be sweaty during the day.  I&#x27;ve figured out that sweaty feet and tea tree oil do not mix well and will irritate your feet badly.  I know because the same thing is happening with the FungiBan.  So make sure that when you put it on your feet will be dry or delute the mixture.  I&#x27;ve had to cut back because the same irritation is coming back with the FungiBan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 5/3/12&lt;br /&gt;Once i feel the irritation coming back i leaned off on the Fungiban and used some Lamisil for a few days and the irritation went away.  You just have to be aware that the irritation can lead to very bad athlete&#x27;s foot so catch it and cure the irritation quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 9/13/13&lt;br /&gt;Seems I built up an allergy for this tea tree oil, what I would recommend it diluting the oil with water before application. I poured out about 1/3 of the bottle and filled the rest with water, this makes it much more tolerable and easier on your feet.</li>
    <li> This product smells REAL STRONG, to the point that it gives me a headache!! I got this with the hope that it would cure toe nail fungas, however it&#x27;s hard to say if it works or not because I stopped using it. It just wasn&#x27;t worth getting a headache everyday, and that&#x27;s with opening the bathroom window to air it out!!</li>
    <li> GOOD 4 Skin CareThe topical application of tea-tree oil is believed to have beneficial medical properties (\\&quot;Topical\\&quot; medications are applied directly onto the skin).</li>
    <li> how come all the reviews are great for this product? i&#x27;ve been using for a while. my first bottle is almost gone. i have fungi infection in my arms. but they haven&#x27;t gone away. it seems to be even getting worse.  (i like the smell though, it&#x27;s soothing-makes me sleep better.)  what am I doing wrong? does it take longer to work?</li>
    <li> this is the first time i&#x27;ve written a review for anything, and the only reason i am is because if this product works half as well for someone else as it has worked for me, this is time well spent   i&#x27;ve tried everything, multiple different medications from the dermatologists, dermatologist proscribed creams that make your face peel off, proactive (does nothing for me), and pretty much every anti-acne product sold in stores  i&#x27;ve altered my diet, i&#x27;ve tried washing my face every two hours everyday, i&#x27;ve tried NOT washing my face in case removing too much oil was causing my skin to over produce, i&#x27;ve tried praying to the holy heavens, nothing has ever worked for me  until i bought this, i had almost given up and figured i should just work on covering up my problems with healthy light makeup   it worked for me, weeks have gone by and i haven&#x27;t had a single \\&quot;problem\\&quot; on my face, it might not work for you, we might have completely different skin, but in the off chance that your just like me, figuring that no product will ever make a difference, give this a try, because it&#x27;s worth the risk ($13 vs. not feeling gross all the time)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a bottle of just pure tea tree oil, this is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect if you just want pure tea tree oil and not something else mixed with tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what I wanted so it works out great for me.</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil is excellent, but the package came in shady condition. The seal was loose so that the oil was all over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The price is really a bargain compared to other tree oil products.</li>
    <li> It is a nice oil.... has a very strong smell to it. Not a good smell, stinks. But I wasnt using it to smell good.</li>
    <li> This is good for a variety of things. It&#x27;s even in my toothpaste and I&#x27;ve had shampoo with it in it. It&#x27;s a good oil to have on hand.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected. I only have used it for a little while, but the results look pleasing.</li>
    <li> A good tea tree oil can be used for many many ailments or skin problems.  My mother uses it for just about everything so I must keep a bottle handy in the event we need it.  Tea tree oil is applied to the skin (used topically) for infections such as acne, fungal infections of the nail, lice, scabies, athlete’s foot, and ringworm. It is also used topically as a local antiseptic for cuts and abrasions, for burns, insect bites and stings, boils, vaginal infections, recurrent herpes labialis, toothache, infections of the mouth and nose, sore throat, and for ear infections such as otitis media and otitis externa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people add it to bath water to treat cough, bronchial congestion, and pulmonary inflammation.  It has a strong scent but that should not deter anyone from using it, the smell will subside after a bit and the results far outweigh the strong scent.  This brand of tea tree oil is great, it&#x27;s 100% and does the job effectively.  We used it the last time for ring worm and it cleared it up quickly, you must dedicate yourself to apply it multiple times a day otherwise it will take longer to remove ringworm.</li>
    <li> Works great, I will purchase it again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I only really use it for my yoga mat. I practice Bikram Yoga and my mat needs to be sprayed with this stuff after class!  It works for me!</li>
    <li> BEST product to apply to cold sores.  AWESOME!  Also keeps away bugs/fleas, etc.  Great on the scalp before washing hair.</li>
    <li> I love using tea tree oil, but if this had an applicator brush, I would rate it 5 stars.  It works well on toenail fungus, cuts and scrapes, and I like the smell, though others do not.  The fact that there is no applicator brush is a minus, however, because waste becomes an issue.  Using cotton swabs or cotton balls means more product is absorbed into the cotton than is usable, so that isn&#x27;t a sound option.</li>
    <li> This my first time getting &amp;#34;100%pure&amp;#34; tea tree oil, so the smell is a lot different from the regular diluted products I&#x27;ve used is the past.  I don&#x27;t find it to be unbearable.  I bought it because WebMD recommend it as a good treatment for dandruff.  I&#x27;ve been having a huge problem with dandruff along my hairline.  I&#x27;ve used it and it appears to be helping.  I apply it at night, and the smell is gone by morning.  A glass dropper, as many reviewers said would be helpful to avoid waste and ensure better application.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this tea tree oil and don&#x27;t find the scent too overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> I had heard that tea tree oil was great for helping with toning your complexion. When mixed with other items it makes a great toner and it is natural!</li>
    <li> I was starting to have success with this product the only bad thing is it irritated my toes and skin, so I stopped. I recommend fungunix.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!  Had a couple of raised freckle like spots on my head and went to doctor to check out.  He said he could remove with simple surgery but bought this and after an application a day for a couple months the spots are completely gone!</li>
    <li> I read several reviews on this product, some stating that it&#x27;s not as pure as the manufacture indicates.  I don&#x27;t know if this is true or not, however I purchased it to try and help with a toe nail fungus.  I used it for a couple of weeks and have stopped, no particular reason that I can point to this product but I did stop.  I&#x27;ve thought about going to a local chain drugstore and buying another brand to compare, but haven&#x27;t done it yet.  With all that said, I can say one of the toe nails I used it on is looking better, actually has a good bed throughout part of the nail (something it hasn&#x27;t had in several years).  However, the other toe nail I used it one still looks like it always has.  Don&#x27;t know if this product helped or not.</li>
    <li> Worked well for my husbands athlete foot problem.  Did not fully solve it though.</li>
    <li> Pretty harsh smell but you&#x27;ll get use to it. Keeps the keliods on fresh piercings away as well. Also great for nice skin. Put it on at night and you&#x27;ll love what you wake up to. Great product.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described/expected. Thanks!</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly. I use this for psorasis on my scalp and add it to my shampoo...not too smelly, but effective!</li>
    <li> Good product, but need the extra internal cap that lets drops of oil come out instead of the big opening on the top. I accidentally knocked the bottle and the plastic lid broke, spilling oil all over the floor. That extra cap would&#x27;ve prevented this mishap, as other tea tree oil products I&#x27;ve used in the past all had this feature.</li>
    <li> Hoo-boy you had better know what you are doing with this stuff.  Mercurochrome it&#x27;s not.  When after 3 rounds of antibiotics I STILL had my sinus and ear infection.  I grabbed my Neti pot, ( I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS)  filled it with warm water, dipped a toothpick in the Tea Tree Oil and dipped that in the Neti Pot.  Now this wasn&#x27;t even one drop folks, but you could see like an oil slick spread across teh surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Mother Courage for doing this.  I swear to all that it holy I thought I might die, but I used the Neti pot as I normally would and I tell you what, within 24 hours there was no infection left.  I&#x27;m sure I fried all my good bacteria too but this will kill bacteria AND fungus.  Who know what was baking up in my mucus regions.  Whatever it was, it is dead now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I say again, whatever you use this for, you had better know what you are doing.  It&#x27;s like bringing a shotgun to a pony show.</li>
    <li> Great oil very therapeutic.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, I almost did not purchase this product. However, the price for 2 oz. lured me in, and I&#x27;m glad it did. Yes, it does seem that the smell of this particular brand of tea tree oil does have a pine-sol kind of smell, like so many other reviewers stated, and that&#x27;s why I dropped a half star. Another half star was dropped because it&#x27;s not as strong as other higher quality brands. But let&#x27;s face the music here folks, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, and at less than ten bucks SHIPPED, for 2 ounces....I&#x27;m on board, especially if you use it for a deodorant substitute like I do. Regular deodorant/anti-perspirant is straight poison!!!!!!! with all the aluminum and other junk, and people need to sweat, so I discovered tea tree oil on a Q-tip rubbed into your arm pit hair actually works really good for stinky pits. GD hippies!!!!!! hahaha, Yes, it&#x27;s a total hippie remedy, but it really works, however, with this product you will have to use a little more, maybe 2-3 q-tip loads per pit, compared to one load (or less) of the good stuff. I then take the remaining oil and put it on the bottom of my feet, and SURPRISE!!!!!! No more stinky feet. I never noticed any sensitivity to skin, but I did not put it on my face which is super sensitive to lots of stuff, only in my arm pits and on the bottom of my feet. So for my review, I can only base it for what I use it for, and nothing else. For the price, it&#x27;s a good buy. If you have extra money, maybe go with the higher quality stuff, but my 4-stars are based on the overall buying experience, and price weighs heavy for me.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with rosacea and demodex mites on my forehead which causes painful swelling, itching, flaky scaly skin and redness on my forehead. I apply this, undiluted, after showers and right before bedtime with a cotton ball. It stings a little bit, but not as much as lotion does. The smell of this stuff is overpowering, so this is definitely the real deal. Within a few days the swelling and itching went away entirely! I am very happy with this product and recommend it to anyone with similar issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, going to order another bottle, works&lt;br /&gt;great on athletes foot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on what I thought was a skin tag growth. After using the stuff for several weeks, I went to the dermadologists and discovered the growth was a wart, not a skin tag. Since then, I&#x27;ve used a drop every now and then mixed in the palm of my hand with hair shampoo. It does a wonderful job on chronic dandruff.</li>
    <li> Use it diluted with witch hazel on my face. Love the tingle and really helps clear up bumps. Also put a couple drops in my shampoo to fight dry scalp due to hard water.</li>
    <li> tea tree oil.  not much to say about it.  i use it to  pour half the bottle into our conditioner.  smells good and helps deter lice!.  (which seem to run rampant at our school!!)</li>
    <li> This product has been a miracle regimen for me.  I ordered this initially with the intention of using it on a strange acne breakout on my upper back.  I noticed an improvement within just a few days of use.  I was so happy that I started reading up on this wonderful oil.   The sources on the web said in addition to being an anti-bacterial agent, tea tree oil is also anti-fungal.  Whoa! I&#x27;ve been suffering from TINEA VERSICOLOR for something like 20 years.  TV is a non-contagious yeast/fungal infection that bleaches out the skin in dime-sized round patches (usually in the trunk region of the body).  My dermatologist has prescribed everything, and nothing has worked.  Long story short, I applied the Tea Tree oil to my mid and lower back areas (TV infection sites) and 8 weeks later I am finally free of that utterly annoying and embarrassing condition.  Hallelujah!  I&#x27;ve thrown out all my one-piece, trunk concealing bathing suits.  Acne &amp; TV free back means I can now wear 2 piece bikinis!     My TINEA VERSICOLOR regimen:  Applied this 100%TTO nightly for 2 weeks.  At this point I noticed the spots much improved so I figured the yeast was gone.  I decreased application frequency to every other day for maintenance purposes.  8 weeks was when all traces of white spots disappeared and my back was one uniform color.</li>
    <li> i really regret buying &amp;#34;Sun Organic&amp;#34;.  i used up this Good N Natural one.  next i bought Sun Organic.  they are in extreme comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Good N Natural is solid, strong, real oil, couple drops is already good enough for a small warm basin of water for my dog daily wash.  Sun Organic is like an emptied tea tree oil bottle filled with tap water.  i&#x27;m trying to use it as fast as possible so i can go back using the real Good N Natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an ER doctor. Not the usual herbal remedy kind of guy. My wife had a nail fungus and didn&#x27;t tell me about it.  I saw it and told her to go to the Dermatologist.  She refused b/c she thought they would remove her nail - and her daughter was getting married in a month.  So I looked on Amazon and took a chance on this.  Wow, I&#x27;m shocked. It actually worked.  It takes awhile, but it does.  She just uses a Q-Tip and applies it directly each night.  Smells to high heaven, but does the trick.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I had a flakey scalp and was recommended by my hair stylist (really, my hair guru) to mix a few drops of tea tree oil in my hand with my shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been doing that for a few months and my scalp is clean as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used tea tree oil before, be forewarned: it has a potent smell!  That said, I would rather use this than a more intensive, more chemically product (commercial dandruff shampoos).  Once I&#x27;ve conditioned and sprayed on hair styling spray, my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like tea tree, so it&#x27;s worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my Desert Essence TTO and decided to purchase this brand instead. I received much more product for a much better price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This murders your zits. It doesn&#x27;t help with blemishes but will quickly become your go-to whenyou wake up with a zit on your face. I haven&#x27;t found anything quite as dependable.</li>
    <li> I had such great results with tea tree for my face that I bought this bigger bottle to use in my hair treatments. I LOVE the smell! I use this anytime that I have a protective style to refresh my scalp and occasionally use it in a spray mixture for my hair. I really like this brand and as with any essential oil, a little goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> I bought this to deal with a toenail fungus and also skin tags. The jury is still out on the toenail fungus but I think I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement. However, this did nothing to eradicate my skin tags. I tried it as suggested and I even put it on a bandaid and then place the bandaid over the skin tag and did this for several days. The pesky skin tags stayed there as if it hadn&#x27;t been touched with anything so not sure about the validity of those people who claim it work and those who claim it don&#x27;t. Maybe this is a product that works with some peoples chemistry and not with others. But it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> If you like essential oils this should be in your bathroom cabinet.  Has a bit of a strong smell but that comes with purity I am told... I love it</li>
    <li> ok people , why i review this as hate it .....my neighbor girl gave me and my daughter lice and i read this works . no, it doesnt ...i tried&lt;br /&gt;  mayonaise , this tree oil, vegetable oil, and these dont work sorry people but the only thing that works are the lice shampoo and the work getting the nits out&lt;br /&gt;as a mother i tried the other methods hoping i would save , and help our hair but just buy the lice shampoo at ur local store yes it is expensive but works&lt;br /&gt;the tree oil has a very strong pine tree smell to it and again dont use it for lice thanks so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few months. It takes a while for the new nail to grow out. It looks better at the base of the toenail and I hope it continues to grow out further as time passes. I will update as it hopefully gets better. I&#x27;ve found that hydrogen peroxide helps dissolve the buildup or thickening at the top of the toenail before I stated using tea tree oil. I&#x27;m not a doctor so try it at your own risk. It hasn&#x27;t hurt my nails.</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree oil works very well. I mix it with water and spray it on my plants to keep insects away. It kills mold. Takes the itch, redness and swelling from mosquito bits. I wish the bottle had a slow drip valve, but I think I can take one from my eucalyptus bottle when it is gone. Overall- great product for a great price</li>
    <li> Worked at first, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem so.............Or it could just be me, LOL.  Also I hate the smell.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and this one makes me dizzy.  Because of that, I only use it at night and on the weekends.</li>
    <li> i use it to oil my hair before shampooing. I notice a difference in my hair in a positive way. 3 stars because it smells kinda funny to me lol.</li>
    <li> Not all Tea Tree Oils are the same, this one is top of the line.</li>
    <li> Have had toenail fungus for at least 10 years. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried, including internal medicines, got rid of it. This was mentioned by people who should know as something worth trying. Might work with some; did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> so many uses for this.  It&#x27;s brilliant.  I love the smell but I don&#x27;t think everyone does!  only drawback</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for baths and to shampoo clean my carpet and furniture.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin and carpet smelling fresh and naturally cleans fungus and mold.&lt;br /&gt;Once I start getting low I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, smells great and works on all kinds of skin related things.  Perfect for bug bites or other itchies.</li>
    <li> Super strong. Make sure you dilute it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had mine long enough to try it, but my son and daughter-in-law like it to gargle, when you feel a sore throat coming on. Be very careful not to swallow any . They also use it on external parts of their poodle, which seems to have a healing effect.</li>
    <li> I am using this product to help with my acne I started to get after moving from the PNW to the South and it has been very helpful. I use a q-tip to dip it in the product, and apply directly to my acne areas overnight and find them drying out very quickly. Very strong smell though, not really the pleasant flowery smell, but does a tremendous job so well worth it.</li>
    <li> It is a good quality tea tree oil. I use it  for many purposes - for laundry; wound care; and for keeping my house free of bugs (i add it to a water in a spray bottle and spray it around the house).</li>
    <li> Well, I had an issue with my big toe. For the last two summers I have had a fungus that I haven&#x27;t been able to get rid of. I&#x27;ve tried to use every \\&quot;home remedy\\&quot; on the internet. I decided to try this out. Within a DAY, i already noticed a HUGE improvement. My nail was completely discolored, thick, and growing strangely. It was hard to even get clippers on it. Basically, pretty ugly and gross.  After just a week of using the product, I think my toe is almost completely clear now. I wish I would have tried this out a long time ago. I will say, I was rather unorthodox in my method. This may sound painful and you may not be willing to try this, but I put a small hole in my nail using a small bit (disinfected) utlizing just a twisting method and my bare hands. This wasn&#x27;t painful at all! You&#x27;ll know when it stop. Applied the Tea Tree Oil everyday in the AM and the PM with a Q-Tip around the entire toe nail. When finished, I tore off the tip and applied the cotton and a bandaid until the next application.   If nothing else has worked for you, try this. I am more than pleased.</li>
    <li> First things first. I was actually really surprised at how quick I received this product. Anyway on to the review.  Honestly there isn&#x27;t much to say. You can tell its really good quality tea tree oil right from the smell. I use it for minor breakouts (works like a charm. Just use it for 2 nights in a row). I also put a bit in my shampoo and body wash bottles. I&#x27;ll put in a couple drops just for antiseptic purposes. Great great stuff.  And the price is AMAZING. At my local health foods store, just the .5 oz bottle costs like $9.</li>
    <li> This is a good brand.  We normally go with Plant Therapy Essential Oils or occasionally with oils from Edens Garden or NOW foods.  This one was a good value.  Still all the Tea Tree strength and purity you would expect.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for a while now (don&#x27;t know what Id do without it) and this one has got to be my favorite. I use it for acne, scars, soars, ingrown hairs, just for healing over all. And it works! The bottle may not be that big but a little goes a long way and I can make it last for a few months or longer. I saw where other customers were complaining about the smell but that&#x27;s how tea tree oil smells! It&#x27;s not even that bad, but I&#x27;ve used it for so long that I guess I&#x27;ve gotten use to it..I love this product and I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have had acne throughout most of my teenage years and have continued to suffer from it into my early 20s. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve tried every product on Neutrogena&#x27;s line as well as a variety of other brands. I&#x27;ve also been to a dermatologist on several occasions and used various prescribed topicals/consumables, etc.. To clarify, my acne is fairly mild-to-medium in severity. The most difficult aspect is that I tend to get deep, nodular acne, so most over-the-counter topicals are almost useless. Needless to say after some horrific breakouts and after an annoying trip to the dermatologist to pay tons of money for products that don&#x27;t work and just irritate my skin, I tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using tea tree oil for a month now and my skin has no trouble spots whatsoever. I take a little bit of the oil and dilute with water and use it as a wash in the morning/night for about 1 minute. I then take a q-tip and use it for spot treatment where I normally get breakouts. The smell is pungent but I really do enjoy it, it&#x27;s a very refreshing smell with a cooling feeling. The chemical is very potent, and despite my skin being fairly resilient, you can create short-term chemical burns that reddens your face. It can cause some peeling, but my skin is starting to feel very refreshed and new; in fact, some of my old scars seem to be going away as if they were laser treated. Just be careful and make sure you dilute the product to your needs. In any case, this has been a raging success for me at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend at least trying this for a month because it may change your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re not going to use it for acne, there&#x27;s tons of other medicinal qualities that are fantastic. I&#x27;ve used it as a natural antiseptic on cuts before. I&#x27;ve also heard and will definitely consider using this as a steam product in the event that I catch a cold, I can immediately tell you this will probably clear your sinuses just based on the raw smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold, and this is my first review on a product from Amazon (I&#x27;ve been a regular shopper for 2 years now).</li>
    <li> It has a strong smell and should because it&#x27;s real tea tree oil!</li>
    <li> Super fast and exactly as described. Good value for the size of the bottle. Remember that the odor of tea tree oil is very strong and not pleasant, but it works for so many things. I&#x27;m using it on a few skin tags I want rid of. My kids use it on acne. I also use it on a toenail that was turning. Really good stuff and versatile.</li>
    <li> I purchased tea tree oil because it was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; means of treating acne.  Although many websites said not to use undiluated tea tree oil on face/scalp, I spot-applied the tea tree oil to my stubborn acne/budding acne. This tea tree oil was able to do what my many toners have NOT been able to do, and that was to dry out those annoying monsters on my face.  It smells horribly and I dread applying it anywhere near my nose.  However, you can dilute it with something else so the smell isn&#x27;t so noxious.  Good price for the amount, I use a few drops a nice, if even. I&#x27;ve even started mixing this with jojoba oil for my scalp, I think I have seborrheic psoriasis (undiagnosed, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what it is), and my first time using it has been completely amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to see result over the next couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> It works! Smell is a little strong.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought any Tea Tree oil it was from a large chain vitamin store. I paid about as much for 1/4 of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like pure tea tree oil and seems to be working well for what I&#x27;m doing, which is treating a foot infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that there is no dropper or other means of dripping out the oil. I didn&#x27;t expect a dropper based on the description but I did think it might have a dip stick or drip cap. It has neither.</li>
    <li> Just learned Tea Tree Oil causes early puberty. Just like Soy. Our pediatrician confirmed it. I was using it on my child&#x27;s toenails as the foot doctor told us their eczema was building up on their toenails. Actually to find out that the kids curl their toes under when learning to walk and the nails are sensitive and building up a little. should go away once a stable walker. At any rate all the tea tree oil was doing was drying their nails out anyway. The opposite of what it should have been doing for eczema. Bad foot doctor advice. Bad product.</li>
    <li> I use it for my skin (face) and it is really good. Those who do not like strong smells might not like it, but the smell does go away in about  five or ten minutes. Tea tree oil has a lot of benefits (plenty of material on internet). I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle with no effect on nail fungus. The only thing I got was unbearable smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away even if you wash it (only time takes care of it). The smell is like disel oil and its terrible.</li>
    <li> Smell was horrible, smells like turpentine.  Did not prove to be effective</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely FANTASTIC. I applied some to the infected area and I could instantly feel it working. It has a very strong smell, so definitely don&#x27;t use too much, (a dab with a q-tip is perfect) but otherwise, it&#x27;s very effective. I used it for about two and a half days and I was &amp;#34;healed&amp;#34; after that. The infection was 100% gone and I felt like myself and confident again! Definitely recommend this product. I will always use this.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this daily to my toe nails using a cotton swab and after 2 1/2 months it has dramatically improved! I have battling a bad case of toe nail fungus for nearly two years and made no headway using different recommended  soaks involving bleach, lemons, vinegar and garlic. I tried 4 different OTC remedies - one I think made the fungus more aggressive. I used a topical prescription recommended by my Dr for over a year with no relief.  Read a post from another Dr suggesting tea tree oil, which I had never heard of, and figured I had no where to go but up. The two worst toes are now about 85% resolved and the others are all in good shape. I live in the Deep South, golf 4-5 times a week and my feet sweat constantly, not a a good situation re fungus.  I am continuing to use the tea tree oil daily and plan to going forward as an easy, inexpensive preventative .</li>
    <li> Stinks that great stink!!! Works wonderful on what you want it to work on we use it for preventative measures against lice and it hasn&#x27;t failed us yet!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, good price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal, folks. I have bought tea tree oils previously and never had to water them down but this stuff is strong! It was packaged very well which is good too.</li>
    <li> I used it topically and it worked great. Also used on my scalp and am pleased as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has an extremely strong, room clearing, medicinal smell. Everything comes at a price I guess!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re probably thinking about using Tea Tree Oil for your acne because you&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s a great alternative to benzoyl peroxide. Just remember, you must dilute in a carrier oil or water!    I did my own study, and made the huge mistake of using 100% tea tree oil. I broke out in cystic acne! Do not make the same mistake I did. You wouldn&#x27;t slather 100% benzoyl peroxide all over your face, so don&#x27;t make the same mistake with tea tree oil.    Positives -  - Cool, Clean Feeling  - Diluted, potentially can work  - Natural    Negatives -  - Cystic Acne  - Strong Smelling  - Minor Itching  - Minor Redness    Remember, the dilution process is extremely simple. If you&#x27;re going to get 5% tea tree oil, simply do 95ml of carrier oil or water, and 5ml of tea tree oil to bring the total to 100%.    You can see my before and after pictures from my study here: [...]    Overall, I would use at your own risk. You will likely be more successful with tea tree oil if you do take the proper measures to dilute it down to the right percentage.</li>
    <li> I love love love tea tree oil. It heals everything so quickly. Hard to find a bottle this big for this price. Would buy from seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this natural tea tree oil. I should have purchased more than 1 if I knew my kids would keep taking it from me to use it in the shower.  We use a little bit in our shampoo too keep the scalp cleansed and not dry.  It&#x27;s good for a lot of things.  I will definitely buy very soon.</li>
    <li> Very effective for hypertrophic scarring &amp; piercing bumps.</li>
    <li> After several fruitless attempts to buy an over the counter wart treatment for one on my face, I finally&lt;br /&gt;resorted to the &#x27;natural&#x27; remedy. My dermatologist assured me it was a wart after having a melanoma&lt;br /&gt;removed from my arm, he also said it would remain the same so I was stuck with it.  A few months later&lt;br /&gt;after applying neat Tree Tree oil (completely safe) I am now pleased to say that it has almost gone, can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;wait to tell him at my next visit.&lt;br /&gt;Denise&lt;br /&gt;Derbyshire</li>
    <li> Good to have around for use on cuts etc.  I also use a few drops for mop floors and bugs don&#x27;t like it and also the Eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree oil was delivered quickly and in great shape. It seems to be a good quality oil and I have been very successful using it. I use the oil as a disinfectant, anti-fungal, and to clear some skin problems.  I will buy it again when I am out.</li>
    <li> Wow! my toe nail was getting these white scuffs from getting them done. within 2 weeks of applying this 1x day with cotton ball made  it clear again. awesome for scalp too.</li>
    <li> wonderful!!!!! READ : for years I had a skin- tag on my nose, it looked like a rice sized clear pimple ( sorry for detail) it bothered me but I never thought I could get rid of it until someone told me to put tea tree oil on there, I bought some tea tree oil from walgreens and put two trop on the skin tag twice a day, after 3-4 days I squeezed the skin tag and some stuff came out, and the skin started peeling off, now after just one week the skin tag is flat and healing up. I would highly recommend getting a tea tree oil for skin problems, just make sure to get 100% Tea Tree oil</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.I use tea tree oil for everything almost it has such an earthy smell  I love it.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  This met my expectations.  Your product is a much better offer than what I can buy in stores.</li>
    <li> I along with our granddaughter have skin problems, with itchy spots on elbows, etc.  This product seems to help with the rashes &amp; itching considerably.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tea tree oil for years. I use it for any sort of skin affliction and it&#x27;s great stuff. I&#x27;ve tried Witch Hazel and other things but I like tea tree oil better and actually like the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to get rid of some skin tags. So far it hasn&#x27;t helped. I can&#x27;t stand the smell either.As far as tea tree oil goes,it seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> It was good but too expensive for what it is. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. But the actually product worked very well.</li>
    <li> Im not sure what exactly this product is but im convinced that it is not tea tree oil. I have been using tea tree oil for years. Ive tried several different brands and not one of the smelled like this. This doesnt have the normal earthy smell of tea tree oil. It smells like pine cleaner. I threw my bottle in the trash right after opening it. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil. It has the wonderful scent that we&#x27;ve all grown to accompany with the oil. I love taking hot baths and adding at least 5 cap fulls of this oil to my water. This may be over kill for some, but perfect for me. I always feel very refreshed and renewed after baths with this oil. I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to remove some tags but gave up after a couple of months with little to no results.  I may try again but right now I have no plans to do so.  My biggest complaint is the smell, it is horrible!</li>
    <li> A good product for the use for what I&#x27;m using it for. The bottle did not come with a insert for controlling the amount coming out.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world.  I mix it with my dog&#x27;s ear treatment, just a few drops in the entire bottle and bye bye ear infections and yeast infections in their ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And bye bye $60 vet visits, PER DOG!  And we have 4.  Great money saver and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The Tea Tree Oil I ordered arrived quickly and was well packaged. I was concerned about potential leakage of the product, but it was tightly sealed and wrapped, and in excellent condition.  The oil itself is 100% pure and of the highest quality, and required dilution, but the instructions for doing this were clear.  I use this product on my skin and nails, and find that it is beneficial to the health of both.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use this seller again.  They care about their customers and contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for you face. I actually mix it with JOJOBA oil, and Lavender. The order is a bit strong, but mixes well with other oils. Great for any part of you skin.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this oil on my toes.  It will take some time to see the result.  The smell is strong, but appealing to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple years ago. Even wrapped up in bubble wrap AND in the box, it smelled VERY strongly from a good distance. I remember it clearly, even now. Worked wonderfully, and it took me those two years to use it up as it was so potent (and I used it a lot). *****FIVE STARS*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooo, I ordered the same one again. Nope. I could barely smell it even when sniffing the open bottle. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as last time, either. Such a shame. I didn&#x27;t bother returning it (too busy at the time to mess with that). It works to an extent, but its nowhere near as good as it had been the first time. *****ONE STAR*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So was it a fluke? Was it the seller? What happened? I don&#x27;t know. I just bought this and am almost out since it was so weak. I will be looking a little more closely to find the strong version I once had.</li>
    <li> To my continuing great dismay I have excessively oily and acne prone skin and as such part of my daily skincare routine involves treating problem areas on my face with a small dab of tea tree oil. While this liquid smells likes the tree teal oil I have purchased in the past using it has not bought me any desirable results. I am disappointed and in the future will just opt to purchase my tree tea oil directly from the health foods store. Consider this a warning.</li>
    <li> Helped tremendously with new nose piercing when sea salt soaks did nothing. Coconut oil helped a little but this tea tree oil fixed everything in just a few days. Amazing stuff.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t particularly pleased with this but my feelings were short lived when my husband knocked it off the vanity onto the ceramic tile floor.  Yup, it smashed.  The end result was that we lived with the memory of it since everytime we entered the bathroom the scent hit you in the face even after several moppings.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from cystic acne for over 3 years now. I never had acne as a teen, or even in my early to mid twenties but out the blue I woke one day to these monsters. I have tried it all, dermatologist, meds, creams, over the counter cleanser, toners, creams, everything and nothings has helped as much and as fast as this product. I have been using it now for 9 days and my acne has cleared. Don&#x27;t get me wrong now, I still got one new cyst yesterday but going from about 25 cysts to only one I cyst In less than 15 days is remarkable. I don&#x27;t delute the tea tree oil I apply directly only to the cyst about 2-3 times per day.</li>
    <li> Used in conjunction with the anti-fungal soap with tea tree oil is very effective.  I was finally able to clear up my ringworm caught from one of my students.  Use the soap three times a day on the infection.  Dry it and apply this oil on the infected area.  It takes several weeks to even a few months,  gradually bring down the usage of the oil to once a day then just use the soap for a while once the infection disappears.  Prescription pills did not work for me but using this oil with the soap did!  There are different fungus types so this may not work for everyone but for me I give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I think this worked really well for my complexion. It dried up my face, which is usually oily, but it was very refreshing. It did have a very strong smell and my dad thinks it smells like nail polish. I thought it had a far more organic and leafy smell, so I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.</li>
    <li> Came on time and meets my expectations. Currently, I&#x27;m using it to treat a wart and toe fungus. It&#x27;ll be a little time until I see the results but it&#x27;s a great antiseptic.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. Will be a a tree oil fan forever.</li>
    <li> I am an 18 year old female who is currently struggling with breakouts due to hormonal imbalances and I have tried many, many products to help with acne and nothing has really been too shockingly great for me. I started cleansing my face with coconut oil a couple months ago and that has helped a little, but I read about tea tree oil and it&#x27;s numerous beauty and health uses so I decided to try it out. I must say, after breaking out for 2 and a half months pretty bad (or at least I feel like it was pretty bad) I started applying it and within a week or two I started to notice a difference in my skin. A noticeable difference, might I add!!! My skin isn&#x27;t perfect yet, but it is getting there and I love this product. I will definitely continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night and in the morning after cleansing my face and drying it thoroughly. I only use it as a spot treatment; I dab a q tip in the bottle and apply it to current blemishes and even old ones (or scars). You can use this in many other ways as well, not just a spot treatment.For those of you who have super sensitive skin, you may want to dilute the product with a little water before using because it is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT apply to entire face! People can get serious chemical burns from this, thats why its best to use it only on the specific areas you need. If you see your skin starting to react, just dilute it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also put a little in your moisturizer or face scrub/cleanser as well!</li>
    <li> I really like tea tree oil. I use it mainly on break outs. The smell is VERY strong, which is normal. A little bit goes a long way. There are ways to dilute it, but I prefer not to.</li>
    <li> Great product that I use for lots of different things.</li>
    <li> I have used this religiously per directions on one small skin tag for 1 and 1/2 months now with absolutely no change. I will continue for awhile yet, only because I have it and have no other use for it.  I will change this evaluation if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/24/14. Absolutely useless for skin tag removal. Used faithfully for 2 months with absolutely no results. Save your money, this indeed is snake oil.</li>
    <li> Its not a good as I have tried before.</li>
    <li> I use this in my own environmentally friendly and safer cleaning spray.  Look up Merlin&#x27;s Magic Soap in a search engine to find a common recipe.  Works great, smells okay.</li>
    <li> Putting this on my toes is actually curing me of the nail fungus I&#x27;ve had there my WHOLE life!!!  I think it will take a long time, perhaps 6 more months, but already after one month or two of putting it on with a small brush after my morning shower I can already see a huge difference.  I&#x27;m excited!</li>
    <li> I used a work shower without flip flops... then got some funk on the bottom of my feet.  1 nail slightly discolored to yellow also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff cleared it up completely after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:  open and use the bottle outdoors; it stinks badly!</li>
    <li> Great anti-fungal, plus it smells great!  Burns the skin in a nice tingly way, use caution- can be painful, but it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I initially ordered this tea tree oil to put in my bath and get rid of nasty soap residue on my skin. While it works really well for that, I have also mixed it with my shampoo for when my hair is extra oily and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps with frizziness in addition to cleansing. It&#x27;s great for putting under hot running water and breathing in when I have a stuffy nose. I&#x27;m glad it has so many different uses! This is an awesome product that would suit many peoples&#x27; needs without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> It rid bacteria and virus on any surface. For example, it is great for cuts and skin inflammation, however it leaves a visual scar. The smell is a bit to high. Besides that its great and I think every household should have it in their first aid kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to make a solution to reduce ingrown hair bumps under my armpits. It worked but the downside to this is the smell. It has a strong odor but it isn&#x27;t bad once it starts to dissipate. And I no longer have armpit odor after using it for a month. I will only use it when I know that I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere like before going to bed.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product was the worst. It had my entire bathroom smelling like pneumonia and it I did not like the feel of this product amongst my skin. I am willing to bet that any customer would be better with a different brand of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This product really works for hypertrophic scars in the ear. Thank you!!! Really glad that I bought this! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this as a natural spot treatment, after using chemical spot treatments for acne. The smell is a little off-putting, but so far I have notice a small difference in how my acne looks. I would definitely try this if you&#x27;re looking for an all-natural way to treat acne.</li>
    <li> I tried this for about two weeks, using it is several ways--as a toner with water, as a moisturizer, and as spot treatment. Haven&#x27;t seen any changes.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase, and is better value than other tea tree oils I have purchased, which have been diluted with other carrier oils. I use it mainly for my feet, to keep fungus at bay, and my feet always have a clean and pleasant smell. Unlike many others, I love the smell, aromatic and earthy, although it is a little strong straight out of the bottle. I apply it daily to my toe nails and between my toes with a cotton tip applicator.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil helps with skin conditions and this product worked great.  If you can get past the smell Tea Tree oil has in general it can be a regular part of your beauty regimend.</li>
    <li> I have fungus on 3 of my toenails and two both thumbs.  Toenails are thick and discolored and thumb nails were not thick, but split from the bed to the tip of the nails.  Have been using the tea tree oil for about a month now.  See no change in toenails, but both thumb nails are now only split slightly at the tips, so will continue to use on all nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 and still have acne. It&#x27;s been a lifetime struggle so I&#x27;ve tried everything! I try not to use a ton of medicine that is not natural. I would compare this to the effects that benzoyl peroxide has. It&#x27;s pretty effective. It does burn when you put it on but my skin is very tough so it doesn&#x27;t have any other effect except it gets a little pink. If you have sensitive skin I would be careful though. Just test a small spot first.</li>
    <li> i mostly use tea tree oil for my face when I feel a break out coming. I apply it that night and by the next morning it is usually gone. this has given me amazing results for as long as a can remember. the only reason I am not giving it a 5th star is because it does not have a dropper of some kind which makes it run out faster.</li>
    <li> I lost my money! This product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell, but this stuff does wonders. I love that I have found something all natural that actually relieves my spots! I rub this on my face before bed every night and in the morning, my face is noticeably clearer!</li>
    <li> I LOVE tea tree oil! I bought this because my nose piercing wasn&#x27;t healing as quickly as I hoped. The oil in this product is GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4/5 stars because the cap is super cheap and doesn&#x27;t close all the way most of the time. It&#x27;s loose and because of that the bottles leaks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a big deal if you always store this upright, but I carry mine with me in my gym bag and it has spilled, and I&#x27;ve lost/wasted oil, numerous times.</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve used it on my piercings, hair and even bug bites. A little goes a long way and I love the smell of this stuff. Great to have!</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is very strong in terms of fragrance and use. A little oil and it gives a very strong scent.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other tea tree oil products before but must say this one has the strength of a true pure oil I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the single best solution I&#x27;ve ever found for getting rid of pimples. When I feel one forming, I slap this stuff on at night with a cotton ball and come morning, the swelling is minimized and it usually dries itself out within 2 nights of usage, 3 if it&#x27;s a really bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that tea tree oil is incredibly strong. Some people will want to dilute it if their skin is already dry, and others like myself use it very sparingly and compensate with coconut oil and exfoliation. If you use this excessively, your skin gets red and peels. It&#x27;s not cute. So while I highly recommend it, I also suggest that you keep it far away from your eye area and the outside corners of your nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and product was wrapped for safety. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is amazing. I use it (combined with organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar) to spot treat random pimples that show up on my face and it works wonders! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil accomplished exactly what it was purchased for; removing mold from my bathroom ceiling.  I can&#x27;t speak to the other uses of tea tree oil (there appears to be many), but for cleaning purposes, this tea tree oil from Good N Natural did the job.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering about the price...while I can&#x27;t remember the exact amount it was selling for, I do know that it was listed at a very reasonable price.  Overall, a very good buy.</li>
    <li> Basic Overview:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product looks a lot different then the picture and its a really big size bottle. It does not come with a dropper which was very disappointing but I had a glass dropper from another product and thats what I am currently using. The first day I got it I took a bath in it. Not knowing how much to put in the bath tub I just did two caps full (because at that time I didn&#x27;t have a dropper). I took my bath and went to sleep and when I woke up a few hours later to get ready for work I recked of it. The tea tree smell was so overbearing. I had a headache all day from the smell and I just knew everyone could smell it. I went home and immediately jumped in the shower. This stuff is so strong! All you need is 6-10 drops to your bath water and that will do the trick. I actually really love this stuff and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 days (btw it came a lot quicker then the estimated time which was very awesome!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laser skin clinic that I am getting my Microdermabrasion done from recommended that I take a plastic bottle and put water and 6 drops of Tea Tree Oil into the bottle. Shake well and then sprayed it all over my covers and pillows. I have done it and I love it. The smell actually does not bother me at all anymore. So I also started to use the spray bottle to spray my hands as hand santizer, I spray my chest to keep acne from coming and to keep bacteria away and I spray my face to keep acne away and to keep my skin feeling fresh and bacteria free. I spray my toes, my shoes, my socks, clothes and my hair scarfs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Tea Tree oil for my hair so what I really wanted to use it for was to put in my shampoo. To be honest I put a few drops in my head without diluting it before I washed. I don&#x27;t know if that was a bad idea or not but it didn&#x27;t harm me. I can honestly say, I have the most itchiest scalp and I have lots of dandruff and the day I washed my hair with tea tree oil my hair did not itch one bit. For the first time ever it felt really good. The itch just started coming back the other day but my next wash day is in two more days so that is not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a hot bath in the Tea Tree Oil which I had mention earlier. Its very smoothing and calming. My skin feels so soft and smooth and it looks 10x better!! Usually when I come out the shower I am so ashy, my skin is so flaky and I still feel super dirty. I do not feel dirty at all when I use tea tree oil! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel or look dry or ashy when I step out the tub now. I had lost my deoderant a few days back and was so mad but the tea tree oil helps eliminate the smell so even when I did find my deoderant I didn&#x27;t have to use it as much because the tea tree oil had solved the problem. I brush my teeth with the Tea Tree oil too. I put two drops of Tea Tree oil on my toothpaste and brush. If you decide to do this make sure you rinse your mouth out well because you are not suppose to shallow Tea Tree oil! It is super dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets just say in my last few days of having tea tree oil I have gotten use to the smell and its all over me because I use it for everything now LOL. Judging by how strong the smell is I decided to buy more essential oils and start using them as perfumes because the smell last. I will be back to do another review once I have had the oil for a few months. Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> Amazing! It got rid of my athletes foot with one application. Haven&#x27;t had feet this smooth in 10 years! Great product.</li>
    <li> This product will help minimize your scars when you use it regularly over a period of time (2-3 months). It doesn&#x27;t take much, just spread it on your scars and massage for a minute or so. Also it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these so far, and I go through them quickly. Excellent quality! I put it on face blemishes and I mix it into various essential oil concoctions.</li>
    <li> This actually gave me a headache because it smells so potent. And it gets real messy when applied to your face.</li>
    <li> Great products, loads of uses,</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and can be used in so many different ways for some many different things. I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now.</li>
    <li> It helped my acne clear up without drying my skin and it also has a nice smell almost like Vicks.</li>
    <li> Love this one! It works great!</li>
    <li> I use this for just about everything. Great product.</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my itchy scalp.  It was recommended for use when you have dermatitis.  It works well.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. I use it to spot treat white heads, and it works. I also add it to my green tea toner.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Quality. I used this for scalp irritation and did not mix it with anything. It worked wonders for the redness and dry scalp issue I was having. It seems very strong in scent. I used it for only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try to treat a bout of ringworm. I used it without seeing too much of an improvement and I had to use it sparingly as it stunk up whatever room I opened it in. It&#x27;s very medicinal smelling but I&#x27;ve heard it is useful for a lot of things so it might be a good addition to your medicine cabinet as this is 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of tea tree oil.  This product truly is stronger than other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but it works wonderfully.  I use it all the time for blemishes, scratches, etc.</li>
    <li> Within minutes of applying it, my face started to burn.  I had to immediately wash it off, and then wipe my face with a baby wipe.  Plus it smells AWFUL, like I was sitting in my car while having the oil changed .  I looked at the instructions on the bottle, and the very last word is &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34;.  ??  Very dangerous to place flammable liquids anywhere on your body.</li>
    <li> I use this oil as my toner in my facial regimen, and it sure does the trick. I use just a couple drops twice daily. It smells nice too! DON&#x27;T get it in your eyes or ingest.</li>
    <li> i used this to my zits but it burn my skin, it makes it so red in the morning. so im not really using this, but i guess that tea tree oil do to your skin so if you dont have a sensitive skin like i do you can use this product but for me, no i won&#x27;t use  it!</li>
    <li> Smell is pretty bad, so it&#x27;s hard to use without smelling like wood polish. Wish there was a dropper- have to dip in a q-tip to apply it.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  I probably should&#x27;ve ordered a larger bottle. :)</li>
    <li> Great value, excellent product with so many uses.</li>
    <li> I may have been a little spoiled when it comes to essential oils in the past, but I think that given the small amounts you usually use a dropper cap would have been helpful to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the oil seems fine, and I have no other complaints.  If you don&#x27;t need a dropper this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I being used this product a year round. It works perfectly and keep my plant healthy too. Don&#x27;t forget to read through the instruction. It tell you how to use this product in correct way.</li>
    <li> Love tea-tree oil. In addition to its uses alone, I use it as an additive to some of my soaps. Works great!</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil every day. It is good for so many purposes. Great buy on this multi purpose oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have a young, mouthy dog. I just have to reach for the bottle and he becomes the perfect pup.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about putting oil on my skin since I suffer from extremely oily skin.  It seems a little counterintuitive to be able to put this oil on your face if you are prone to breakouts.  I used it once.</li>
    <li> work for everything you need love it for skin, toes and everything...... I used it for a pimple as well amazing  stuff</li>
    <li> Ok; so who doesn&#x27;t worry about buying something online? This Tea Tree Oil is fine. I&#x27;m using it daily. Thanks!</li>
    <li> 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil Good &#x27;N Natural 2 oz Oil is a very good deal and high quality, nice-smelling Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff... the first lasted me MONTHS. I was using a small bit of it on a cotton ball each morning before putting on my shoes. I tend to wear flats &amp; heels to work w/ bare feet and it can get sweaty/smelly (the shoes), so the tea tree oil helps not only the smell... but hopefully stops of the growth of any sort of fungus.</li>
    <li> So after working long hours on my feet, I tend to want to relax and receive my usual mani and pedi. Well unfortunately; I started to notice the nail on my big toe turning darker. I started researching items on-line that would help with this problem &amp; read on many reviews that tea tree oil helped. To be honest I had not used this product for more than 3 or 4 times (only because of the smell) however it did clear up the discoloration. I still have a full bottle that I plan on mixing with shea butter. The only downfall it the smell. I never knew what pure tea tree oil smelled like until I bought this product. It will definitely linger &amp; will clear your sinuses!</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this particular tea tree oil, which was enough for them to get one fewer star. It does not smell like the other tea tree oils I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I like the tea tree oil. I had not problems with it or the brand. It smells just like other brands I have.</li>
    <li> Good price and shipped on time!</li>
    <li> Excellent for taking care of cuts and minor burns...apply it and by the next morning it&#x27;s practically healed...promise.</li>
    <li> Strong stuff! I use this on pimples when I can feel them forming and it makes them go away right away. Since it&#x27;s so strong, it can be drying. ***A little tip: use triple antibiotic ointment to heal dry, flakey skin spots (where the skin has flaked off from strong medications) or on pimples that you have picked/popped too soon! Heals it so fast! If you don&#x27;t have triple antibiotic ointment, dab a bit of honey on an open pimple wound. It&#x27;s a natural antiseptic and speeds the healing process.  Just a side note: tea tree oil can act like estrogen in the body, so be careful not to use too much on large areas of the body. It can increase your estrogen, which can be bad for people on birth control or with hormonal imbalances.</li>
    <li> many uses. just use with care and it works as expected.</li>
    <li> I actually love it, with one caveat.  I used it for cystic acne, and it worked wonderfully to bring down the swelling.  However, it did burn my skin.  I even used it with a carrier oil.  I&#x27;m really bummed because it did work so good on the acne.  I may have to try a different oil such as argan.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I do believe this would be a great product for you! The smell is very pleasant, though quite strong.  The price was exceptionally good, also.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s school has had a lice outbreak, and this has really help deter them from her head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been using for about a month and still have not seen results on a toe fungus.  When it works i&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree oil for a while to treat minor skin problems, and found this one works better (faster heal) than other two I used before.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased after receiving this product.  The larger size works for me as there are so many uses for tea tree oil.  It arrived well-wrapped and is exactly what I ordered and expected.  The larger size bottle is so much bigger than what is available to me locally and at a much better price, delivered directly to my door.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff.  Ive used Tea Tree Oil 4 years n this is the real thing.</li>
    <li> I needed some teatree oil to dilute and spray on my martial arts gear so it wouldn&#x27;t be so rank. This absolutely does the trick. Very very pleased.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this locally so picked it up online. Works for the intended purpose.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon tea tree oil by reading about the oil cleansing method, I have struggled with acne for years and bout every product you have seen advertised and non worked, been to several dermatologists and this so far has been my life saver, will continue following the OCM and update this review on my process.</li>
    <li> took the itch out of all the bug bite in Belize within a few seconds. Strong odor at first but it goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works great. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This item was leaked all over the package. I don&#x27;t know how to write or contact seller to inquire about the leak or packaging issues, and I haven&#x27;t heard back via the amazon suggested areas for contact so I have to only rate this as &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; I would rate it higher if I were able to have the entire product and it hadn&#x27;t leaked before I received it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, using it for soap.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Has that strong tea tree smell. I had to get an eyedropper to go with it though.</li>
    <li> Good quality and worth cost. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Another typical homeopathic &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; that simply does not work or do anything except stink up your bathroom.</li>
    <li> Same price as the stores but with double the amount of oil &amp; all natural! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted. This was new with a seal also. Great price too. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This brand of tea tree oil is definitely the best one I used, it soothes my skin and is so good for drying out those sudden pimples. I also use it as a deodorant and it never failed me.    You should try it.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
    <li> Hi, I&#x27;m 26 years old and I have been suffering from moderate acne since I was a teen. I never wrote a review on any website, but I think that this product deserves it.  After spending so much money with over the counter brands and organic ( Ex. Eminence), I decided to go natural with everything that I put on my body.  I found this product on Amazon and I was like: \\&quot;well let me try\\&quot;, but I was a little hesitated because is a oil and I didn&#x27;t want my skin be all greasy. Fortunately this is one of my top 3 products; this product has helped get get of my acne.   I mix 1 tablespoon of tea tree oil with 9 tablespoons of water -- because the product by itself is very strong and can dry out your skin,  but you can use itself as a spot treatment -- and then I apply on my face. The product is completely absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any oil residue.     I apply twice a day, after washing my face in the am and at night, and this product removes all the dirt that the soap couldn&#x27;t. The cotton pad comes out brown, as a result of the efficacy of the tea tree oil.  I also apply this on my scalp, because sometimes I get small pimples around my hairline, and this makes it disappear.  So stop spending your money with these other products, and buy this oil. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tea tree oil because of everyone else&#x27;s trusted reviews, that this is a safe - natural and effective way of getting rid of acne, and even fungus. I&#x27;ve since diluted this into a spray bottle and use it to help with my feet, keeping them clean and fresh while sitting in dress shoes all day. I figured i&#x27;d also try it on an area of my arm where i tend to get the occassional acne buildup, and addressed it there as well. The oil seems to be working so far, but i&#x27;m still waiting for effects to finish. The only drawback so far is the oil&#x27;s very strong clinical smell. it&#x27;s natural, and not reminding me of a hospital..but its still a smell that my cars don&#x27;t appreciate! I&#x27;ll continue to apply this oil liberally as i use the product and enjoy the cheap and effective benefit of instead going to boutiques where they&#x27;ll charge 4x the price that amazon sells it for &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months now, my toenail fungus (my big toe only) is almost all gone! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I didn&#x27;t have to visit the doctor, take some crazy meds or have my toenail removed (yikes)!</li>
    <li> Used on great toe after trimming back all the unattached nail and applied every morning and saturated the pad of a band-aide and placed it over the nail. Did this for Approximately 60 days. New nail is growing in and nail bed is growing up and in to reestablish a healthy nail. This is so much better than taking anti fungal medication for months and the associated risks and expense. Thank you &amp;#34;Good &#x27;N Natural&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> only thin that destroys fungus.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is good for pimples!</li>
    <li> PERFECT all around !  Quality, ship time, price !!</li>
    <li> it should be instructions o sort of recommendation to use it.</li>
    <li> This brand is not my favorite but it is a good oil but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my pinky fungy toe.. I put it on every night!!! still got that little booger... any how im sure this oil is good for other things.</li>
    <li> Does not come with a dropper!&lt;br /&gt;I probably would have purchased one that does. Now I have to purchase a separate one.</li>
    <li> Regardless of your intended use for this oil, ALWAYS dilute it win a heavier oil (like argan, castor or tamanu --which I don&#x27;t recommend because Tamanu oil is so smelly!) if you&#x27;re putting this on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, in addition for facial use, I also used this to help my nipple piercings heal faster. I&#x27;ve heard from pierced friends that the tea tree oil dries the piercing out, and quickens healing. You&#x27;re supposed to massage your piercings with a drop of tea tree oil and 2 drops of jojoba oil. I did this and within a week my poor nipples were so dry and scaly. DUH -- because tea tree oil is a drying oil. I had to stop using it and instead massage only argan oil onto my nipples to get them soft again. No one thinks about how nipples should be moisturized until they have dry nipples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgo the tea tree oil on your nips and just stick to the regular oil massages (increases blood and oxygen flow) and sea salt water soaks (dries out the piercing -- and not your nipples!!). Don&#x27;t forget to rinse your piercings out with water after the sea salt soak.</li>
    <li> Great Tea Tree Oil. I use it along with Pro-Vitamin B5, lavendar oil, and himalayan Sea Salt to keep my hair fresh and clean while dreading. It&#x27;s cool to have the bottle lying around for the plethora of other uses it&#x27;s known for as well. As someone who practices martial arts regularly, it&#x27;s great to keep around for fungal infections that are well known to be caused in such situations. I also use it on Acne flare-ups. The smell is strong, and won&#x27;t necessarily agree with everyone (I don&#x27;t like it), so I suggest checking out some better-smelling oils to mix it with if you&#x27;re using it for your hair or skin!</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of shopping online for Tea Tree oil and this consistently comes up at the best price. I have reordered a couple of times because I have also been 100% pleased with the quality. It&#x27;s pure and high strength. I have used it on sachets to remove mildew smell from drawers, cupboards and closets; have used it on leather to kill mildew; and have even used it on my skin to fight acne.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, it is great for many uses. Including the use of soap making, shampoo&#x27;s that kill Lice. I have even used it in different products that repel other insects that like to attack Dog&#x27;s. A very Earthy scent.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil a lot and something smelled off about this product.  I sent it back.  I dont know whether it was off or just smelled bad.</li>
    <li> NOT FOR WHAT I NEEDED FOR</li>
    <li> Had heard great things about Tea Tree Oil.  I love this for my dry skin...but didn&#x27;t realize how it would smell. (can anyone say: P-U??)  I liked to use it on my face as it is gentle (or you can dilute it as alternate instructions are provided on the bottle).  Never-the-less, the product is good, the price was nice, but i STILL have an issue with the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;.  But, I assume this is just how Tea Tree Oil smells...since i have never used it, i didn&#x27;t realize it.  Still, not unhappy.  Happy i was able to try it...and the price was great!!!  This tiny bottle will last me forever!  I was for some reason thinking the bottle had a dropper in it...and it does not.  Based on info provided on the back of the bottle, this is a higher than average concentration.  To me, the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; is similar to a very strong tree bark odor. (if that helps anyone....not sure how else to explain it.)</li>
    <li> the estimated delivery time was august 12-17 and it came august 10th so I am extremely happy with the delivery time, the actual bottle itself is exactly as shown in the picture and exactly what was promised. 100% happy!</li>
    <li> It smells correct, but doesn&#x27;t tingle or seemingly do anything at all-- even when used straight (undiluted). This bottle didn&#x27;t have a dropper top or any way to dispense.  VERY disappointed in the product for the price and will stick with my Walgreens brand from now on.  I&#x27;m afraid to try something else, not worth the risk.  Would have tried to return but unfortunately I&#x27;ve poured half the product into my Walgreen&#x27;s (empty and dish-washer-washed bottle) because at least that had a dispensing top. (SIGH).</li>
    <li> I love this. Excellent quality and it has so many uses. Adding a little bit to your shampoo helps with dry, itchy scalp and it works great on acne. I even use it to clean. I just mix a little bit in with some vinegar and water and put it in a spray bottle. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> My husband had trush and it cleared it completely.&lt;br /&gt;Check with your doctor first,if you have doubts&lt;br /&gt;about using Tea Tree Oil. Joyce</li>
    <li> I only started using this on toenail fungus for the first time about a month ago.  I think it&#x27;s going to take a while to definitively say that it worked for me, but I&#x27;m hopeful.  I&#x27;m seeing new nail growth without any fungus so here&#x27;s crossing my fingers.  I&#x27;ve also used it on a few zits and they were cleared up the following day.</li>
    <li> It seems to help with acne and other ailments but 4 stars because the smell is super strong and almost takes your breath away.</li>
    <li> This Tea Tree Oil is very concentrated and has a great scent.  I use it in everything from laundry to lotion and it really works.</li>
    <li> The literature with the tea tree oil says it is a medicine chest in a bottle and I would agree.&lt;br /&gt;It has many uses and functions and is a natural remedy used by the aborigines for centuries as&lt;br /&gt;an antiseptic. Overnight, it cured a swollen and very painful ingrown toenail.  Never had heard&lt;br /&gt;of it until a friend recommended it.  If you like Natural products that are inexpensive, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I bough this product for a foot fungus on one of my toes.  I will have to apply it twice a day for several weeks.  So far it is working well.  I took the cap off and put a dropper on it for ease to apply.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it after I wash my face and has really cleared up my skin, I&#x27;m also taking oral antibiotics for acne, so it&#x27;s really nice to have something that fights it from the outside as well. It also works really good as a toner. My complexion is more even and has a glow to it since I&#x27;ve been using it. I normally have very oily skin and since using this stuff I haven&#x27;t had any problems, doesn&#x27;t dry it out, and no shine!</li>
    <li> Very hard to pour out of the bottle. Most have a plastic piece so that you can use it by the drop.</li>
    <li> The smell is much stronger than other brands I&#x27;ve bought- not sure if this is a reflection of strength or not, but it works just as good at clearing my skin up as the more expensive brands in grocery stores.</li>
    <li> My Aussie cousins got me to try this stuff.  It did help with some skin tags but did not make them disappear completely. Perhaps I should have stayed with it longer.  In fact, I think I will start using it again.  I used it for a few other minor skin issues and even a bit of toe fungus.  The odor is a bit strong but not unbearable.  According to my cousins this stuff is the end-all cure-all.</li>
    <li> The oil is okay, but there is no way to get it out of the bottle without spilling or contaminating the contents. Wish it came with an eye dropper.</li>
    <li> While the tea tree oil itself in this product is good, you should know that the bottle doesn&#x27;t come with one of those plastic inserts inside to control flow. There&#x27;s just a cap and then the glass bottle. You&#x27;ll probably want your own medicine dropper to use with this.</li>
    <li> this is amazing. i make my own toner with this stuff. and if a zit pops up, i dip a qtip in this mixture and spread it on the zit. works like a charm. make sure you don&#x27;t use too much though, it will dry up the skin surrounding the zit!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this, along with Wedderspoon Organic Manuka Honey, to control eczema.  It has a very strong odor, and so \\&quot;aromatic\\&quot;, strong like unions, that it makes my eyes water.  So I use the Manuka honey on the breakouts close to my eyes, and the tea tree oil elsewhere.  These 2 products are more effective than other non-prescription treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love the product!  I use this AM and PM after cleansing (part water and part tea tree oil) on a cotton ball. The acne is certainly controlled after a month of using the product!  Only downside? The smell! LOL...but! you&#x27;ll get used to smelling a little like a medicine head! For your acne&#x27;s sake that is....  Great price and excellent results so far!</li>
    <li> Smells funny. Good s*** though.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff really works. It gets rid of pimples overnight or within two days. I felt one of those under the skin and painful pimples coming on and spot treated it. It was gone by the next day. I told my teenage daughter about it because she is prone to break out. She loves it, so I&#x27;m back to buy her a bottle of her own. I highly recommend this product. It does have an unpleasant odor but who cares. The bottom line is IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I get pimples every now and again and after I wash my face at night i but a little tea tree oil on my pimples, the next day my pimples have decreased in size.This seems to be the only thing that has worked for my pimples I just ordered another bottle I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is great for topical skin treatment. I dab it on adult acne and cuts. It stings slightly at first but the healing is evident by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I also add a few drops to some water as a mouthwash after flossing.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Excellent quility at a good price. Use as spot treatment on acne.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil. I mixed it with other oils to heal a horrible wound on my house.  It worked better then any other over the counter medicine. I mised it with Emu Oil, Tamuka Oil, Frankinsense, Lavendar, Coconut Oil, and a highly concentrated Vit. E oil and the wound that lingered for months was healed in a matter of 30 days.  It was a live saver. I could not believe how the swelling just vanished.  I know at one time it was as big as a grapefruit.  This oil does what it says, it really decreases inflamation.  You can even use it under a wrap with great results.  If you have a severe wound on you or your animals, I highly recommending going to a health food store and getting advise.  You just can&#x27;t beat really good oils for fast and safe results.  My mare&#x27;s scar is at a near minimum now, which it started out close to a 6x8 patch of her skin torn completely off.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, got rid of mild hand and finger skin peeling due to mild fungus, got rid of foot fungus in 2 weeks. Great for the face, keeps pimples at bay and feels clean. The smell is not that bad, sort of like Vicks vapor rub kinda smell but more planty. I just made up that word. Planty, to describe a plant odor.</li>
    <li> Compared to other pure tea tree oils, this product was inexpensive for the size of the bottle that you get.  I use tea tree oil for a variety of reasons but mainly for skin blemishes/breakouts.  I will continue to buy this product in the future once my current supply runs low!</li>
    <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> good quality, the brown bottle is much better than clear for protecting the oil.</li>
    <li> Smells like tea tree, and works like tea tree. Came early and exceeded expectations. I use it as an essential oil and a topical treatment, sometimes mixed with coconut oil as my carrier oil. This bottle does not come with a dropper but that&#x27;s ok, one could find a glass (not plastic b/c the oil will dissolve it) dropper for cheap.</li>
    <li> Good product mix it with many things I use, in my hair conditioner, shaving cream, candle warmer, cleaning a small wound, etc...</li>
    <li> Does not work on my acne.. and smells bad</li>
    <li> Used for multiple things!! put it in regular suave to help turn it into dog shampoo and it saves a bundle and helps keep the fleas at bay!! Love it...also for Moms with kids in school a little in your kids shampoo helps keep live away!</li>
    <li> by looking around I got twice the amount other brands had, for less but none of the oils seems to come with brushes or droppers so I&#x27;ll be using up my q&#x27;tips (which I actually think work better than some dropper bottles I bought) but nice and stinky like tree tree oil should be  and it&#x27;s good for your toe nails, and in some solutions acne, dandruff and more, Web research tells me I can dilute this and still get good results and get more to use that way.</li>
    <li> The truth is, what can&#x27;t you use TTO for? Our main use of TTO is in our cloth wipes. We prefer to keep our cloth wipes moist, in a warmer. As a result, if they&#x27;ve been sitting for too long they can start smelling a bit... funky. The TTO keeps them smell fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Point - A little of this goes a LONG way. Do not overuse. The smell is horrid.</li>
    <li> I mix this with water and use it to treat my acne. Great, effective, and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as the other tea tree oils that I have used in the past. Also, I don&#x27;t know why, but it is less drying than the other brands I&#x27;ve used (CVS).&lt;br /&gt;Great product, cheap and effective.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, waiting to see if it helps foot discomfort</li>
    <li> Great home remedies made with this and it keeps the lice away.</li>
    <li> Clears up my skin and smells so good</li>
    <li> Great! Works for what I need it to</li>
    <li> I have been using this for four weeks and I have very little results!!</li>
    <li> Got rid of my keloid !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my shampoo with no poo method. I thought my scalp was going to dry after I use baking soda so i added this tea tree oil to my baking soda. This makes my hair so oily. Now, I&#x27;m not using this. Maybe I start using this when my transition period is over</li>
    <li> Okay first off, within the first day of using this on my nails they were shiny and stronger, now after about a week and a half they are better than ever... even hair skin and nails supplements haven&#x27;t given me close to the results this stuff has! I massage this on my scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. I put it on my eyebrows to promote hair growth there as well. The other day I had a rash on my arms and applied this and it put a stop to itching. Its also great to use to reduce keloid scarring on peircings! I use it so often that I bought a bigger cheaper bottle at wallmart for a little over two bucks and it works just as well! It serves so many purposes, probably way more than what I&#x27;ve mentioned here :) I&#x27;ve told a bunch of people about it and everyone loves it, all have had amazing results just like me!!</li>
    <li> Well, I wanted tea tree oil and this product is definitely tea tree oil.  I primarily use it as an air freshener, I just add a couple of drops to a small spray bottle and I&#x27;m set.  But the health claims are interesting and possibly worth trying.</li>
    <li> The oil is potent and works wonderfully. I have used this on all sorts of occasions: ear aches, flea wash for dog, cold sores, skin boils/blisters, acne, cleaning, insect bites, laundry, hair care, in bath water, etc. I could go on and on. I use to be able to find this in an 8 oz bottle. The word got out about its uses and now you can barely find it in a 4oz bottle, geez!</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful for toenail fungus and diluted for rosacea of the face.  I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as an alternative to using benzoyl peroxide cream on my face. I&#x27;ve found that the tea tree oil is as effective or even slightly more effective than benzoyl peroxide at preventing acne. That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t get the occasional pimple, but the ones that do show up are less deep and usually don&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is very strong, but not necessarily unpleasant. It reminds me of the smell of a musty cabin--which I know is kind of weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the oil to my face using Q-tips. I dip the Q-tip in the bottle (I NEVER double dip), and spot apply to my face--especially the troublesome spots that acne forms like my forehead and lower cheeks. I then rub it in with my fingers to cover my face completely. There is a tingling/slight burning sensation after application, but that goes away after a few minutes for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about halfway through a bottle after 2 months, and I apply it every night so it does last a long time. I definitely recommend trying tea tree oil if benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid just doesn&#x27;t seem to do it for you or dries out your face.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very fast and effeciently. And i used th eproduct to treat my fungal nail.I saw instant improvement within a week. And it was healed within two months on costant application.</li>
    <li> This is strong stuff, which I have found to be very useful in a number of applications. A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You might have problems with skin irritation. Test out a small area first. I initially had a pretty powerful burning sensation when I used this, but I have since learned I could cut it with other oils. I use extra virgin coconut oil. The combination of the two create an oil that is effective, but with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is pretty strong. I would describe it as pine-like. Not altogether unpleasant, but be aware that it is potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This is very useful against fungus and bacteria. I have had great success after being consistent with its application.</li>
    <li> i cant say that this one is working coz its been awhile that i am using this but it does not heal my acne even if i applied it topically. its just burn my skin but does not helped in healing the acne. maybe it works for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the oil, but it does not have the strong tea tree scent I love. The bottle however, needs help. It comes with the drop dispenser top, but the top does not fit the bottle so it does no good. you end up using way more oil than necessary.</li>
    <li> strong, pure odor. i mix with food grade propylene glycol (also available on amazon) and use it on ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this to deal with skin tags and it also turns out to be a great insect repellent. If you like to trout fish like I do, then you understand how frustrating it can be to be swarmed while landing a fish.</li>
    <li> This can be used for anything.  It is a must in every home.  You can use it on burns and not get blisters.  Great for mouth ulcers.  The smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it is great for so many things.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time. Does what was promised. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of its specialty.</li>
    <li> A skin colored mole developed on my cheek when I was in college and I decided it was time to get rid of it sans surgery. I did some research for removing moles naturally and TTO kept popping up in my search. I decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s my 3rd day using TTO and my mole has shrunk and dried up. I am going to continue to use this oil until the mole falls off (hopefully). When the mole falls off, I will give this oil a five star rating!</li>
    <li> Used this in some make up remover wipes that I made. The smell is strong but it has great antimicrobial properties! Buh-bye acne!</li>
    <li> I love this smell more than anything on the planet.  It helps with acne too, although it burns a bit when put on directly, you can water it down and apply with some Qtips.  It can dry your face up too so I suggest putting a lotion or hydration solution on afterwards.</li>
    <li> Im using it to kill my toenail fungus but its not able to get up under the nail bed. Answer: I use my wifes Dremel tool and drill (VERY CAREFULLY) a couple of small holes in my toenails over were the fungus is separating my nail from the skin...ta daaaa the fungus even hiding under my toenail is being vanquished even as we speak.</li>
    <li> So many uses for this product - excellent product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great price! Exactly as advertised and it works!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother paying a lot of money on so-called &amp;#34;will cure&amp;#34; products. This stuff really works! It takes time, but if you use it every day any problem you had with toenail fungus will be totally gone once the affected part of the nail grows out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne issues for 3 years, and it left a lot of scars and uneven skin texture on my face. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things but nothing seemed to work for me.     Then one of my friends recommended tea tree oil so I decided to try it out. I bought this, and have used it for 3 months now, and omg! i cannot believe the results i got! my skin has improved so much that a lot of my friends compliment my skin now :)     here&#x27;s my routine and what has worked for me:    i changed up my entire skin-care line and face makeup (i didnt realize that i had SENSITIVE skin. i always bought products that were for oily or combo skin type cuz of my acne, but this is the common mistake people with acne... a lot of times the PRODUCTS you&#x27;re using could also be a factor of creating acne. So i invested in skin care products geared towards SENSITIVE skin)               **Make-up**:             - Fancl Twin cake Powder (ladies! this brand has no preservatives and is the perfect way to go for sensitive skin! also, their powder is AMAZING at concealing flaws and smoothing out the face)             - Nanoce BB Moist Cream in #2 Healthy Ocre(really good coverage and doesnt give me acne or blemishes! i use this more often now since my face got so much better!)                **Morning Routine**             - face wash: Japanese AHA face wash ([....])              - lotion/emulsion/moisturizer: i switch between Philosophy Hope in a Jar and SKINFOOD Carrot Emulsion             - Sunblock: HERA Sun Mate Daily(MOST AWESOMEST SUNBLOCK!! IT HAS MAKEUP BASE IN IT AS WELL!!)               **Night time routine:**             - makeup remover: Philosophy Purity             - face wash: Japanese AHA face wash ([....])             - Exfoliator/Face Scrub: Baking Soda (it&#x27;s safe and gentle enough to use every day!)              - then i pour a few drops of the tea tree oil in my hand and pat it on my problem areas on my face                    -ill leave it on for the night (some people wash it off after 15-20 mins on the face, but i got better results by sleeping with it on)                     **** WARNING: this has a very strong herbal bark smell! i got used to it and i dont mind it now. But if you&#x27;re sensitive to smell and can&#x27;t stand herbal smells, then this might not be so great for you.     Good luck and hope you also get the great results i got! :)</li>
    <li> Ordered this tea tree oil for nail fungus.  Although it did not work for some, it worked well for me.  I did file the top of the nail somewhat and used this more than twice a day but am pleased with the results.  Think I can wear sandals again next summer!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really over rated. I used it for 3 months on my bad toe and it did not change anything as far as clearing the fungus. Save your money. It also stinks to high heaven!!</li>
    <li> This product is 100% tea tree oil (unlike a lot of others), and is a great price for the quality.  I use it for eczema, acne, dandruff, ear infections - it&#x27;s good stuff!  Some people can have sensitivities to straight tea tree oil - be sure to test it diluted (in oil, water or other liquid) first, then work your way up to full strength.  I will DEFINITELY be buying this brand again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I was 15 years old. I am now 23 years old. Granted, I did not take care of my skin, nutrition, sleep and water consumption when I was young, but for the past few years I have done just about everything under the sun: retin-a, proactiv, maxclarity, and many more products. I even went to a specialized skin therapist and dermatologist to no avail.   Enter Tea Tree Oil (TTO). I have been on TTO, in conjunction with Neutrogena oil free acne wash cleanser and a Neutrogena 3 in 1 stress control acne spot treatment, for the past two and a half weeks, and my skin has honestly NEVER been better. It does take a few days to notice significant change, but boy once it starts, and you keep doing the treatment at Night and whenever new whiteheads form...your skin WILL get clear. I absolutely guarantee it. I have never been happier and I can see my confidence growing every day again. Remember to use MOISTURIZER, since it does dry your skin a lot. Apply TTO with Q-tips and use 100% non diluted TTO. Good luck :)</li>
    <li> Item shipped fast....no complaints so far.  Not sure why the system requires me to have to type more words but typing this to use of words so I can submit.</li>
    <li> it is not works so good compare that i used before.&lt;br /&gt;but it is alright with this price.&lt;br /&gt;cuz i don&#x27;t thick it is pure enough.&lt;br /&gt;i can feel it.</li>
    <li> High quality. Smells great. Blends well with Carrier Oils and creams. Highly recommend this product. Love this stuff. I use it on a daily basis!!</li>
    <li> This is the oil for all ails.  We use for everything, body oil, cuts, pimples, fungal problems, cleaning. Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> My 2 year old picked up ring worm from her daycare (sucks I know) and gave it to me.  Well I tried to ignore it in hope it would go away, well it spread COMPLETELY over my stomach and sides and on the tops of my thighs.  I went to the doctor and he told me to use over the counter topical cream which literally did nothing at all because the surface area was so large.  I used the tea oil, and it stinks... I wore it near my family and my brother said, \\&quot;What smells like mildew?\\&quot;  So be sure to shower after you put it on.  It&#x27;s REALLY stinky. So far it seems to be helping.  It&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s not all read and angry looking, now it looks kinda dry and flaky like it could be going away.  Definitely glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my son who has always had bad acne.He said he has been using it and it seems to be helping him.It smells like turpentine but as long as he is happy with the results I&#x27;ll buy it for him.</li>
    <li> I went to the MD to see if there was a prescription that I could have to address the fungus issue I was having with my great toe.  Needless to say, there is a prescription, but he said it would take about 6 months and it can put your liver at risk not to mention the prescription was very expensive.  Two years went by and I took no action until I did my own on line rearch and Tea Tree Oil kept coming up and I read all the testimonials.  I am a doubter, but I had nothing to lose.  One or the subscribers mentioned taking a nail file and reducing the nail down to a thin layer.  I did exactly that, but I took my nail all the way down. Pretty much a if I lost the nail. Don&#x27;t worry, it does not hurt until the you fail to reduce the file grit the closer you get to your skin.  I also read some of the readers who mentioned the fungus came back because they neglected to dissinfect their shoes and socks.  Do this!  Back to my process, I took a Qtip and applied the Tea Tree Oil to the top of the nail. Then I took a band aid and saturated the bandaid felt with tree oil and wrapped the bandaid around my toe for the day.  At night I did the same thing.  I did the for about two months and I kept the nail filed down to make certain I got all the fungus, as the fungus from 1 to 10 was a 10 for sure!  Then I allowed the nail to grow back and only periodically put Tea Tree Oil on the nail.  My nail looks fabulous again and now I take much better care of my feet because there is nothing like having distored fungus looking nails.  My wife didn&#x27;t want my feet near her with the nail looking like that and my kids talked about my like a dog.  Now, I can rub my feet up against my wife like she does to me and it is a wonderful thing and I shut the kids down.  This process takes a while, but remember, the fungus did not develop overnight.  It takes time to develop and if you are smart, don&#x27;t ignore it like I did.  I am totally satified with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of 1 oz at Whole Foods last year and as I got close to running out, I checked online and saw that Good N Natural on Amazon.com offered double the amount for a bit less than what I originally spent at Whole Foods. Great deal!</li>
    <li> It might be a bit too early to write a review. It only took a few days to arrive, and I immediately started using it. So far, after nearly 14 hours, I have not noticed too much. I mixed some tea oil with vasaline and put some on my feet last night. This morning, I noticed that my feet do feel a bit softer but I was hoping to notice more of a difference on other area of my skin as well. Yesterday, I did a tiny test on my hands (mixed the tea oil with vasaline) but so far I have not noticed too much. My hands look a bit smooth this morning but it&#x27;s not much different than from with the lotions and vasaline that I normally put on my hands. Perhaps it is too soon to tell. Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and have suffered from acne since age 13. I did a round of Accutane about 7 years ago which completely cured my acne. However, after getting pregnant last year my skin started to break out again and went from oily to extremely dry. Most products are too strong or drying for my post pregnancy skin. I decided to try the Tea tree oil after reading the reviews and it has really made a difference in my skin. I think the key is finding a regimen that works for your skin. I diluted my tea tree oil 10 to 1 with water. I wash my face with a lemongrass tea tree soap then soak a cotton pad with my diluted tea tree oil. I rub it over my entire face then use my daily moisturizer with about 5 drops of almond oil. So far this routine has worked extremely well for me. My skin is much calmer and I receive compliments from my coworkers about how bright and open my face looks (not quite sure what that means but I am sure it is a compliment). I would definitely recommend trying this product and finding a routine that works for your skin.</li>
    <li> It performs how all the other melaleuca products do, topical sterilizer, strong smell that lasts hours, it&#x27;s just how it is...</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for acne. I love it and it is all natural!  I mix a little bit in with my moisturizer before I go to sleep and spot treat in the morning. Of course it smells bad but that is what it is! I am used to it now. This is a really good product and was a steal with the price for the size</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil. I no longer wear deodorant, I just put a few drops of this in my armpit and I&#x27;m good all day.</li>
    <li> I can not say it&#x27;s bad, it may be the best, but the strong smell it has is terrible, my wife asked me if I used insect venom in the bathroom...</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this....does so many things! Read about it online! Great price.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to put in an oil wash for my face, to help with my acne.  I don&#x27;t think it helped but I used it for my daughter when she would get ear infections and it seems to have helped.  I can&#x27;t compare it to Meleluca&#x27;s(sp?) since I&#x27;ve never used it.  It was more in my price range though.</li>
    <li> it works on moderate level acne. it works on my acne but if i don&#x27;t have enough nothing can help. but tea tree oil helps dry up acne super fast.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried tea tree oil on your skin, hurry up and buy this!  It has so many uses, it is impossible to name them all.  A few of my favorites is clearing up zits, razor bumps and cuts.  My wife adds a few drops to her bath water.  If you use it on your face, watch your eyes.  I have been using tea tree oil for over three years and it is one of those things that cannot be replaced by anything else.  Just like anything, it will take a little while for things to start working, so use it for a week or two before making your judgement.  Oh and the yellow fingernail cure thing, that doesn&#x27;t work.  Go to the doctor and get the medicine; it&#x27;s not skin deep, it&#x27;s pumping through your blood stream.</li>
    <li> I used this product as foot fungus cure for about 2 weeks and nothing improved. Only a waste of time and efforts applying it on my feet nightly. Waste of money in my case.</li>
    <li> Ok so, there is noooo way that this is tea tree oil. I know tea tree oil and this aint it!! This smells more like the household cleaner known as Pine Sol. I opened the bottle one time and it stank up my house for a week and a half no lie, I had my parents smell it, my in-laws smell it, and anyone that came over had no choice but to smell it because I couldn&#x27;t get the smell out. The bottle in the picture is not what you will receive in the mail. The picture shows a bottle that says like Australian or Austrian tea tree, nope the bottle you get from the seller says....TEA TREE. Just to prove to myself  that this wasn&#x27;t tea tree, I went out to the local Walmart, (which, had i known they sold it, i wouldn&#x27;t have even bothered with this fake stuff) and bought some, opened it...ok now we are talking...soothing medicinal tea tree.....not nose hair burning Pine Sol oil!!  On the positive, i was able to get a full refund from the seller, no questions asked, all i had to do was notify them, and they asked me to send it back using usps, i took a pic of my receipt and emailed it to them and they refunded it and my intitial payment. DO NOT BUY THIS OIL FROM GREENALS</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve purchased pure tea tree oil and this company markets a good product. It smells great and a little goes a long way.  I bought this to add to my shampoo and it gives the user a slight tingly feeling on the scalp when washing and leaves the hair feeling extremely clean.  I also wanted to add this to the shampoo as a possible deterrent to lice, since my daughter has come home with several lice notes from peers having lice in her classroom this year. So far it has been working to deter the lice too.  The only improvement the company needs to make is a more user friendly dispensing system.  An eye dropper attached to the cap in the bottle would be wonderful but the current design requires the user to have a steady pouring hand.</li>
    <li> read that it is great for getting rid of skin tags but I didn&#x27;t see in any of the reviews just how bad and how strong the smell is.  Your suppose to apply about 3 times a day but if you have to be in public you certainly don&#x27;t want to be in public smelling like that, but because I wasn&#x27;t able to apply like recommended I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
    <li> This oil does not seem to be pure, compared to other tea tree oils I have purchased.  It is very thin and has a strong pinesol smell.  I think they must cut it with something else to make it cheaper.  I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition. Seems legit--doubt it&#x27;s been cut in some ill-lit favela in São Paulo (I hear that&#x27;s a big problem these days).  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Hi guys if you are wondering about Herbal Authority quality of products, well don&#x27;t wonder any more;  I&#x27;ve  recently ordered the Tea Tree Oil I have no complaints. I use it for pimples, cuts, and burns ie. everything really. Give it a try you will not be disappointed. PS their shipment was on time too</li>
    <li> This came very quickly, is very clean and effective oil. Size is right for the price. Economical. Nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> I found no benefit to using this product. It really smells bad and did not help with any my moles.</li>
    <li> Good oil very strong smell works well with other oils</li>
    <li> My ex husband has toe fungus and athelete&#x27;s foot. tea tree oil soothes the itching and flakiness. ultimately he needs antifungal meds but in the meantime, tea tree oil has done wonders in the healing process of his toe nails. you have to be patient and diligent but it works.</li>
    <li> Not concentrated enough and not potent at all - I used it in a heater diffuser and it just didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
    <li> Works as recommended for treatment of athletes feet. I saw great results after first treatment. Severe case of athletes feet almost gone after second treatment.</li>
    <li> excellent, soft smelling, good quality oil.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand ffor awhile now and I like Tea Tree oil for its many uses so will continue using this one.</li>
    <li> I use it to cure my acne scar. Seems it works good to them</li>
    <li> Not the best smell but it worked great on the toenails. No more painful ingrown toenails!!</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil for years.  I am not sure what this is, but it is not tea tree oil or if it is it has a petro chemicla extender.</li>
    <li> Tried this once a day for over 1 month and all it did was get my daughter to comment on the bad smell and discolor my skin (temporarily).  Also purchased similar product from (Mason) with the same result.  Don&#x27;t waste your time for skin tags.</li>
    <li> Good so far. I use several drops of this when making cloth wipe solution.</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is authentic and it works!  Great for psoriasis, which is what I use it for!  Prevents the itching and the scaling.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face morning and night to keep my skin clear. I use a Witch Hazel cleanser to dilute it  It stinks so very bad, but it&#x27;s worth it when your skin is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I am a true believer of tea tree oil and this product fits the bill.  I definitely would order this again.  Packaging was great.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this product I use it on my ache and also for my shoes for odder, I put some on a cotton ball and insert it in my shoe over night and the odder is gone by morning.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old and this is the first product that I have ever used that is effective on blackheads.  I put a little on with a q-tip and the blackheads disappear after just a few applications.</li>
    <li> Using this product to combat a toenail fungal infection so we will see how well it works.  The product itself is potent, matching other high quality oils I have purchased in the past.  Definitely has a strong scent but dissipates quickly.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really help to much with the acne.  Perhaps it just couldn&#x27;t overcome the power the chocolate ice cream induced pimples.  But it did feel refreshing to shower with.  I poured some into a spray bottle with water and shook it up and sprayed it on  a towel, soaking it frequently and then washing myself down with it.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it stinks, but it is very strong smelling.  Smells similar to Pine-sol but not as much.</li>
    <li> I tried it for a few weeks already and it does not really remove the tags.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again</li>
    <li> Perfect.  It works great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!! Before using this, I had breakouts that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Acne scars, brown spots, little breakouts that lasted for months...this has been going on for about 3 years. I finally had it and decided to try a natural approach. I did some research and decided that tea tree oil was the way to go. For two months, I have been using this as a toner on my face. I use Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Tea Tree Oil face wash in the morning and at night. Then I put this tea tree oil on a cotton ball and apply it across my entire face. The scent is strong but after about 2 weeks you get used to it. There is a cool, tingling feeling that follows and it makes you feel so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only have my breakouts - that haven&#x27;t gone away in so long - cleared up but my scars and brown spots are fading too! I have had minimal breakouts since and people have begun complimenting me on my clear skin. This does moisturize my face fairly well, but I use a moisturizer with SPF 15 on after I have applied the tea tree oil for sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried everything else for acne then please try this! I recommend a combination of the tea tree oil face wash and this as a toner. Give it at least two months for results. I&#x27;ve finally found a solution to my acne. I hope it works for you too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other people reviewing this product, but I only use it for hair. I have African textured hair and it almost completely changed my hair to a more soft and straight look leaving me to style it in ways only a texturizer can do, but without all the damage!! This is now a product I will be using for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Great product...stronger than I&#x27;ve had before.  I would definitely recommend to family or friends if they needed it.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I caught a bad case of ringworm on both of my legs and the steroid cream I was prescribed didn&#x27;t seem to be working. After some research I started using this Tea Tree Oil in conjunction with the steroid cream to really attack the ringworm, and soon the fungus was gone. It has a distinctive, but pleasant smell as well.</li>
    <li> Your typical tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil for years for lots of things.  Has the chemical smell like the other brands, but isn&#x27;t too bad.  My wife can&#x27;t smell it when I put some on.  The only issue I had with this order was it had leaked out of the packaging.  Not too bad, but enough to fade the label somewhat.</li>
    <li> Very happy with item and seller</li>
    <li> Great oil. Very effective and strong. Very well wrapped with bubble wrap, however the cap was broken. As if it had been closed too tightly. Some oil leaked, but thankfully the bubble wrap prevented it from spreading all over.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to take care of some scars resulting from my industrial piercing.  This one really helped to shrink them.  Other Tea Tree Oil products i tried first ( that cost more ) were not as useful for my purpose.</li>
    <li> It works slowly but it works. I use it on skin tags but it is slow in getting rid of them. Wish I had something that works faster.</li>
    <li> It helps keep my psoriasis down when I dilute it</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I hate this product due to the smell. It&#x27;s horrible. I have a small skin tag on my neck and can not use this product do to the horrible smell of it. So I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. A little goes a long way. I mix it with other oils and use it for my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Better than some of the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin it does have somewhat of a strong order, but all tree tea will, I really like this product</li>
    <li> Great value.  I just wish it came with a dropper or brush.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to help my acne. I diluted it and used it as a toner. When I had used it for months and saw no results, I even increased the ratio of tea tree oil to water, but still, it had no effect on my acne. I was disappointed because I have read other reviews that say that this helped their acne, and I would love to find a natural product that does.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and price, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this after reading that it can help cure foot fungus, and after ordering it and trying it out i can say with confidence this stuff WORKS. Just dab it on, and it absorbs into your skin in a couple minutes. it didn&#x27;t cure it overnight; however, its effect was intently noticeable, and a couple days of use it&#x27;s completely gone. i couldn&#x27;t be happier. it beats the $350 cream my dermatologist was trying to push on me.</li>
    <li> Works very well for skin tag removal. Be very careful to apply with a q-tip directly on the skin tag for this will make your skin very dry. Shipping was super fast. Will order from this vender again.</li>
    <li> This requires many months of daily application when the toenail is soft.  The clearing has begun but I am patient.  Nothing else has worked (I&#x27;ve had laser treatment when it was experimental, systemic medications which I&#x27;d prefer to avoid).  This looks hopeful.</li>
    <li> delivered as promised and expected--Thank you</li>
    <li> Huge fan of tea tree oil in general and this is the first I&#x27;ve tried of this brand and company. Very, very pleased with both. Not only did my package cone well wrapped and protected (the bottle is glass) but it arrived several days earlier than predicted and you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I mix this with Terminator 10 benzoyl peroxide acne treatment and it has been the best thing for my oily/acne prone skin. Like others have said it has a strong scent but you get used to it after a while. Even though it&#x27;s only 2 oz the product lasts for a long time. You only need 2-3 drops of the oil to coat your face and neck. I&#x27;ve also heard tea tree oil is great for stimulating the scalp to promote hair growth and to cleanse the scalp of sebum. Tea tree oil has so many benefits, everyone should have a bottle of it in their house especially the Good N Natural tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> This Australian tea tree oil is not as good as NOW Tea TreeOil.  It has somewhat of an odd odor mixed in with the tea tree oil.  I prefer the NOW brand however, I cannot say the other isn&#x27;t as good I just prefer the odor of NOW.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery! I didn&#x27;t have any issue with the bottle cap. I am using it as a hair mask, and I see the results already.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil! Always need on hand to use in cleaning.</li>

    <li> Excellent price good oil a dropper on the bottle would make it easier to use otherwise very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased from Seller:Health Supplement Wholesalers&lt;br /&gt;Received wrapped tighly in a bubble mailer. It was also in it&#x27;s own retail box. This stuff is strong. I use it in my Vornado Evap 2 humidifier tank to keep the Filter Wick from molding up. I wish there were a dropper or something. Using the cap for measurement is not practical, in-fact I can&#x27;t really pour this out in any way without it getting some on my hand or the exterior of the bottle or the cap. But hey, other than getting the product out of the bottle, it seems fine....quite a strong smell to it. I don&#x27;t use it for anything else.</li>
    <li> Stinks very bad and didnt work. Ended up just cutting off my skin tage with scissors.Would buy again due to smell</li>
    <li> Great product! Works perfect. Super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great product and value!  I use this daily in just about everything</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s a quality tea tree oil.  That being said, the plastic around the bottle top came undone during shipping and I could smell it for days once the leaky bottle was removed from the packaging.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought tea tree oil but having read other reviews on this product and reviews from other name brands it seems to be legit! The smell nearly knocked me over but apparently it should smell like that.</li>
    <li> I have a fungal problem on my toes. This takes care of it. Good price too. Wish it came with a brush in the cap.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!! Good buy for the size of the product!!!</li>
    <li> I found out about this product online and had read a bunch of reviews.  I decided to buy it and I am so happy I did!  This product cleared up a skin rash I have had for years, in just about three days!!!!  I have used it on my toenails because my nails had started to get white funky spots on them after I had put nail polish on them and the nails where not quite totally dry after a shower.  The spots are clearing up!  I had also had a blemish wanting to surface and I put a dot of the tea tree oil on it and the next day it was gone!  Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a lice &amp;#34;preventative&amp;#34; for our daughter (preschool) and will continue to use it throughout her elementary years.  I have diluted it with water and put in a $1 spray bottle.  I do her hair and just spray it on. The scent is very powerful (even diluted), but I just spray a nice smelling hair spray over it so she doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;.  :)</li>
    <li> hopefully, this will work well.  I am trying to rid myself of toenail fungus but I have to be patient as in 60 or more days!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used tea tree oil, I truly suggest for you to do a little research.  This is really a &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; type of oil for your skin which can heavily help with anything from pimples to hemorrhoids to warts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to go in-depth with what the oil can do for you, as I can agree it probably varies a bit for each individual, however, I will say that it has done wonders for both my wife and I.  I rarely get pimples, however, as most people I certainly dislike them.  So whenever one starts coming out, I just wash it out with soap and water, dry it completely and dab some tea tree oil on the spot.  I can definitely say healing time using tea tree oil is remarkably faster than if I didn&#x27;t use anything.  Plus, there are zero noticeable side-effects.  Skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, there is no discoloration on your skin of any sort, nothing.  The only thing is the smell.  For some people, the smell can be quite irritating since it is VERY strong.  My wife and I personally kind of like the smell so it never bothered us, but for some friends they have a hard time to put it on when it involves their face.  The smell does recede away a bit (or perhaps your nose is just getting used to the smell) but you&#x27;ll still notice the smell until you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note though, never use it on any internal areas.  It can burn and in some cases cause you to feel a little sick if the body does absorb it internally.  You should come across similar warnings when you research it.  Neither should you ever give it to your pets and if I remember correctly it is not recommended for children either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep a bottle around the house, you won&#x27;t run out too quickly at all even if you use it everyday.  Last thing to note, however, is that my in-laws bought a off-brand (I believe Wal-Mart) small bottle of tea tree oil as our success with the oil led them to pick it up and it seemed to not work as well.  We were visiting them when I had a pimple I wanted to use tea tree oil on, however, since we didn&#x27;t bring our bottle, I used theirs and it seemingly did not do anything.  Coincidentally, the smell from their bottle was not nearly as strong the smell from this bottle.  I&#x27;m not going to make any conclusions on what I think the problem is, so this is merely for me to say &amp;#34;watch out.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a toner. I like it. I dilute it with water and I use maybe twice a week at the most to avoid drying. Would I buy it again...? Probably. Would I recommend it....? Sure, it is a pure and potent tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Great quality. No complaints</li>
    <li> My middle toe nail had gotten discolored, was chipping, flaking, bad shape to it, wavy top.  It had over the course of about a year only gotten worse and worse.  Then I started using this product.  I had read about the oral Rx medications available, but that they had some potentially nasty side effects, and I didn&#x27;t want to take the time off work to go see a doctor if this could work. I figured it was worth the gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I took the chance!  In summary, 4 months after starting treatment, a new nail has grown out and it looks as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer summary....&lt;br /&gt;After my morning shower, I took a q-tip and dipped it in the bottle, then applied to affected nail.  I made sure to work it in between the skin and nail from all four sides of the nail as much as possible, pushing the skin back lightly.  Put on my sock immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did that every morning for the most part - perhaps forgetting to do it 1-2 days a week.  I did not have any skin irritation as I read in a couple people&#x27;s reviews.  My suggestion is that you do it every other day if you get redness or irritation.  Based on my experience I think that will be enough to still clear things up for you.  My skin is very sensitive in general, so I don&#x27;t think a reaction is likely to the majority of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about one month, I could tell the oil was breaking down the fungus, stopping further damage.  After the second month, some of the old nail peeled away, and I could see the first signs of healthy nail emerging from the cuticle.  Some people might say \\&quot;oh that happened naturally, not because of the oil\\&quot;.  I tend to doubt this because as I mentioned, I had newly growing nail get ruined immediately for a year or longer, as soon as it would grow, even before clearing the cuticle, the fungus would attack it and all I saw growing was sick, bad looking nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the third month it was clear that new nail was coming in healthy and I cut back to abouta treatment every other day.  4 months down, and its just about grown in fully, looks great.  I do an application every other day, and will start cutting back further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cost me less than a Rx would have cost.  And whether using a Rx topical cream, or a Rx internal medicine, would still have required a new nail to grow out as you can&#x27;t fix the existing damaged nail.  It&#x27;s all about stopping the fungus in its tracks and then letting your body heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me much though it is strong, its a mix of mediciney and minty.  Once you put your sock and shoe on, nobody will notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably used only 1/4 to 1/3 of the bottle, so if I see any other nails starting to show yellowing I can treat them before things get out of hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+!</li>
    <li> This seems to be quality tea tree oil to me. I have been trying it on my acne. I have not decided yet if it really is working though.</li>
    <li> This was the lowest price I had found for tea tree oil.  I was delighted at the larger sized bottle too.  It works very well on removing skin tags.  I have used it on myself, my granddaughter and even on our 12 year old dog! (The vet said that the small, black growths he had were benign tumors that are common on older dogs.)</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil to treat acne &amp; for scrapes &amp; sores that get infected. My son had an insect bite (possibly a spider bite) that swelled &amp; hurt him. After treating with tea tree oil for 3 days it is almost gone. I love the stuff! Too bad they can&#x27;t do something about the smell though. Not pleasant at all but I will deal with it since its so great for bacterial infections.</li>
    <li> When I received this oil, it did not have a dropper attached to the cap for dispensing.  I have to use cotton balls or q-tips to apply the oil where needed.  I think a dropper should be provided with the removable cap.</li>
    <li> A bit stinky but does what it needs to do. Using in scars and slowly they are going away.</li>
    <li> I like these oils.  I initially purchased them due to some &amp;#34;fungus issues&amp;#34; I was having, and there was some improvement.  I also found out that there are MANY different uses for tea tree oil and that was good to know.  I occasionally also put this in my diffusers as well.  I would recommend these oils.</li>
    <li> TEA TREE OIL RECOM MENDED FROM MY DOCTOR FOR TOE NAIL HEALTH SO FAR IT IS HELPING NOT SURE HOW LONG IT TAKE JUST KNOW NEEDS TO BE USED FOR AWHILE.</li>
    <li> After bruising my toe and developing nail fungus, I tried every home remedy and prescription treatment known to man (including two courses of Lamisil, three months each time). No help. When the pain got bad enough, my doctor surgically removed the nail, but it grew back the same. Hearing about tea tree oil, I started applying it once or twice a day with a Q-tip. Two months later, the bottom half of my nail is healthy and pink, and the pain and ugly color are gone. It&#x27;ll take a few more months, but this toe is on its way to being normal again. Hallelujah!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for toenail fungus and may but anther bottle for occasional acne. The smell of this brand is not as stinky as my last. Once I have applied it and waited a bit, I don&#x27;t smell it (another brand smelled so strongly I could smell it for a good hour later).&lt;br /&gt;It takes time, but works. Several nails are much better. I use qtip to apply--soak one end in the oil then swab around the based of the nail, wipe over the nail, and then squeeze oil under the nail--once to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The pedicurist I use recommended this while I was pregnant/breastfeeding as I could not use the prescription meds.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I was using it to heal up the hole that I had a nose piercing at and it worked great.  Considering it was infected, it healed up great with this.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> he tea tree oil was expired and you could see where the date had been strached off the bottle!!!!  I could not believe it!</li>
    <li> Did not do what I thought it was supposed to do, or perhaps my expectations were higher than the product could deliver.</li>
    <li> Looks like it is working well. Time will tell, but so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used this oil, be prepared for a strong scent. Not unpleasant but there is a scent.</li>
    <li> This product is good. My only complaint is that it has a very strong oder and there is no dropper in the packaging which makes it hard to use for when you want just a little bit.</li>
    <li> I used this for many skin troubles and always found the healing properties work on my heat sensitive skin. The rashes are soothed and when I have a Hemorrhoid Flareup this soothes. I was first introduced to this product in the 80&#x27;s when I helped a friend reduce his premature ejaculation by using a tiny drop to desensitize his penis.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest healing oils ever.  Wish I had gotten a larger size.</li>
    <li> Bought this to deal with a recurring yeast problem I have and I must say it works fantastically</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and was told Tea Tree oil helps. I have been using this in conjunction with Glytone body wash and lotion for the last week. My skin is the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> Strong smelling stuff first off, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s supposed to have a strong odor but was disappointed in the results that the tea tree oil claimed to have. Tried it for itching and it didn&#x27;t do much except smell and found ever single tiny cut I had on my hands. If you want to find a microscopic cut or a splinter in your hand, this stuff will find it, just rub on your hands and where it burns like hell, yep, that&#x27;s either a cut or splinter.....</li>
    <li> I bought this to clear up a toe nail issue that I have had ongoing for several years. I even took Lamasil for several months to no avail. I used it for a couple of weeks and it appears that the nail is beginning to grow in normally.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Packaging was good and the product has tons of uses. Just a few drops in the vaporizer resevoir during cold season makes breathing so much easier. The smell is a little different than I am used to but still works the same.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells very strong. I cant say how well it works on acne because I haven&#x27;t used it very much (too drying during the winter), but be prepared to smell like pine or cedar.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oil every for my face. I also use it as an antiseptic&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;SKIN INFECTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A common use of Tea Tree Oil is as a natural Acne treatment.

    <li> A staple for this family. Ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> i like it but not the smell, but its good  for a lots of things</li>
    <li> when I used it with the nexcare sticker, it works so good. and i can see how it fix the pimple and the pimple marks.</li>
    <li> It was everything I wanted except the only thing I was disappointed in is that it doesn&#x27;t have a built in dropper. You will have to purchase one separately or be very careful when pouring.</li>
    <li> This is my second order but a different brand. This doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as what I purchased before, which leads me to believe it may not be as pure. It works but it does smell slightly more chemical than my previous brand. The smell isn&#x27;t quite as pleasant but it also isn&#x27;t nearly as STRONG and doesn&#x27;t linger as long.</li>
    <li> a great relief, thanks</li>
    <li> Had developed skin tags around my chin area. After persistently using it for about three weeks, the tags were totally gone. No marks on the skin afterwards, as if the tags were surgically removed!!</li>
    <li> I find myself adding drops of this all over in natural home remedies. To my shampoo, sometimes my soap, sprays, etc. It keeps the bugs away too!</li>
    <li> This product smells terrible and it worked about as good as products from the drugstore. I thought this would be a more natural alternative, but I would recommend a product with benzoyl peroxide. The strength of the two are similar. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything for acne, and this was not some magic cure.</li>
    <li> Love Tea Tree Oil.  Great product for nail fungus and everything else.</li>
    <li> I forget why I bought this stuff</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. It&#x27;s keeping my sinus problem, under control.  I have a really bad sinus problem because of the polluted environment I have to live in, right now.&lt;br /&gt;I put about 3 drops of Tea Tree oil and some Himalayan Salt in a 6 oz. plastic bottle with a spout, fill it with distilled  water and then gargle and rinse my sinuses. It burns some but not for long and works great. No more post nasal drip.</li>
    <li> I have cystic acne on my chin. One after the other.. just keeps popping up. Hate it. Like everyone else.. too desperate I have been trying a lot of things and this being one of them which hasn&#x27;t worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I still give 4 starts because the product is good. Not its fault if it doesn&#x27;t work on me.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a dermatologist and she prescribed me Duac. Its been only a week and I see a change. I have a very sensitive skin but duac doesn&#x27;t dry it up. See your Doc!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for a lot of things. Works well</li>
    <li> exactly what it says for a good price</li>
    <li> This appears to be a very high quality tree tea oil. It smells great.</li>
    <li> This stuff has cured any skin problem I&#x27;ve ever had! From ringworm to keloids on ear piercings, it even helped clear up my dogs mange! The smell is unique, not in a good way, but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a number of bottles of tea tree oil recently, but they all generally come in small, 1-oz bottles. Because I use it so frequently as part of my skincare routine, I was looking for a larger bottle, so I bought this one. Very pleased with the quality of the oil and I like the larger sized bottle.</li>
    <li> I Have recently begun the process of switching over from using toxic commercial products to using all natural products for my face and body. Oils whether they be carrier oils, healing oils or essential oils are by far the best thing you can do for your skin! This oil is no exception it is high quality, fairly priced and the seller delivered it very promptly. I would definately reccomend this oil and seller. Breathe deeply &amp; enjoy life we only get one chance!</li>
    <li> Stopped my no-see-um bites from itching immediately</li>
    <li> If you havent used it, Tea Tree Oil is MAGICAL and this is the cheapest you&#x27;ll get it. great for rashes, blemishes and general skin issues</li>
    <li> BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS PSORIASIS AND IT MADE IT WORST.HER SKIN HAD GOTTEN INFLAME  FROM USING THIS,AS A MOTHER OFF AN 8 YEAR OLD I LOOK FOR NATURAL MEDICINE FOR HER BUT IT GOTTEN MY DAUGHTER MORE MISERABLE.WOULD NOT BE USING THIS EVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Very potent, works well in everything I&#x27;ve used it in so far.  Mine did not come with a dropper.  I get the feeling from other reviews, this and similar essential oils are commonly sold without.  I think that&#x27;s like marketing a brand new car without a gas cap.  Oh, in my analogy, the car runs on gas.</li>
    <li> Great to kill acne over night!</li>
    <li> Great product to mix with face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. I took off a start though because it needs a dropper or something as it is hard to use.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. I just wish it came in a larger bottle...maybe I just didn&#x27;t notice. It has been an excellent item to heal skin infections without antibiotics. It also helps control my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I always put a nice layer of extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil on her skin first, as tea tree oil can be strong. However, even as sensitive as her skin is, she has tolerated it with little or no oil barrier in between. I am VERY grateful for this product. If I can find it in a larger size, the review would move up to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Highly potent tea tree oil that works wonders on skin rashes or infections!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of tea tree oil from this supplier in the past and was extremely satisfied. Tea tree oil is an amazing product with a multitude of functional uses including several effective home remedies. This review, however, is for the distributor/shipping as I was unable to use this product (more to come on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package I noticed a faint odor of the oil before I even opened the package (generally not a good sign). Once I opened the package, my eyes and nasal passages were immediately overwhelmed with the extremely overpowering fragrance of the oil. Having used this product in the past I fully expected the smell but not before I even removed the bottle from its packaging. My initial thought was that the bottle was broken during shipping but as I peeled back the layers of tightly packed bubble wrap I noticed that the bottle was intact. Upon further inspection I realized that the leak came from the lid not being securely placed on the bottle so during shipping about 1/5 of the oil leaked out and drenched the bottle/packaging (as well as my hands) with pungent oil. Not only was the bottle unbearably odorous, it was also very oily and dirty as the oil caused the ink from the label to run. The mess was extensive that I made the decision to throw the entire bottle and its remaining contents away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will be purchasing this product again, I will NOT be purchasing this brand or anything from this distributor again. Save yourself the headache and do the same.</li>
    <li> There is a little plastic insert in the bottle that allows you to drop oil from it. Well, guess what happened to mine? The first time I tried to shake a few drops into a bottle with mixed liquids for cleaning, the insert fell off and one third of the bottle poured into the cleaning mix and on my hands! The smell was so strong that I had to get rid of the mix and start all over again. And my hands had a super strong smell of tea tree for some time.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with Shea butter and cocunut oil and wow it works awesome on my skin and hair.  I love this oil</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing... I use it several times a day.  I decided to make my own hair tonic, by combining coconut oil, almond oil, peppermint oil, and tea tree oil.  After I wash my hair I put this tonic on my scalp and let it sit while I do my other shower duties.  Rinse afterwards and you&#x27;re done!  I&#x27;m not sure why, but I love that cooling sensation on my scalp afterwards.  Plus my hair looks and feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very dry itchy skin behind my ears, so I put a dab behind each of my ears and it helps sooth the itching and no more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the smell... I actually enjoy it, maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the potency, it&#x27;s pretty strong in my opinion, and I am quite happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing.  Use it all the time in my bath.</li>
    <li> It stinks, which means it must be the real thing.  I use it for acne and toe fungus, the very enjoyable things about life.  This quantity goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Has a toenail fungus that funginail would not touch. So decided to try this Tea Tree Oil for this and in about 6 days, it is very much improved and almost gone. This is some strong stuff and it does have an odor, but it works and fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to use this for other things such as a rash etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good I use it on my toe nail fungus is that enough info? It did cure it I use it as maint.</li>
    <li> doc said I have rosacea, light case. Meds are $286 for one month. I prefer to treat topically than systemically. Not advising, just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;I &#x27;summer&#x27; in WA and left my Tea Tree Oil in AZ! This was easier than driving back for it!&lt;br /&gt;also, Australian 100% is the best!</li>
    <li> I used to have a lot of acne all over my face when I was 15 and 16 ( I am 17 now) and it eventually all cleared up with the help of benzoyl peroxide but there were so many red marks left behind. I didn&#x27;t have acne but the marks made my face look as though it was still covered in acne. My sister recommended that I use tea tree oil because a co worker of hers mentioned she had been using it and my sister noticed the results on her co worker. I ordered a bottle and have been using it for a few months now and I am so happy to say that the marks have clear up about 85 % and I have been getting so many compliments on my skin. Not only are the marks clearing up but any surprise break outs I get clear up over night using this. My skin is also glowing and soft. Best product I have every used, hands down.</li>
    <li> Awesome tea tree oil. I received this product at a discount for review. i absolutely love it. It works really good to heal any acne pimples quickly. Its 100% pure tea tree oil because i have tried other tea tree oils in the past and none of the other oils have worked so good.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping. Item as described. Picture as described. Great product! Would purchase from again!</li>
    <li> Really really strong scent. It seems to work well I guess. I use it on my feet mostly and keeps it smelling and looking nice. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> I used this in making liquid soaps and for facial steam treatments. Very refreshing, and the bottle is secure, so no leaking during transport or while I moved.</li>
    <li> Works great on wicker.The wicker must be cleaned first, let dry, spray outside this is oil, it will stain,use gloves if needed, check the wind,spray away from you.DO NOT SPRAY DIRTY WICKER,or it will never come clean.</li>
    <li> I contacted Amazon and the seller.  The seller refunded my money promptly and sent a pre-paid envelope to return the product.  That was fantastic and I thank the seller for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness I can&#x27;t say I hate this product but I do hate that I received something I believe is lesser quality by the smell and different label.  Again make sure you get what is advertised on the website!</li>
    <li> we received the item very quickly! and are satisfied with the quality of the product. Will show with this vendor again!  hope it does what we think it will. strong odor but i kind of like it</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my acne, while following the acne no more system, when I opened the  bottle I found that the plastic dropper was detached and sticked to the cap. The smell was really strong, I tried to fix it while opening the large window in the kitchen for fresh air and I kept standing near the window, also the oil on the cap reached my fingers. I didn&#x27;t succeed fixing it, it didn&#x27;t fit in the head of bottle and kept detaching. After this I felt I had no energy in my body, I couldn&#x27;t sleep well all that night, my heart was beating very fast in few times, it took me till next day noon to recover.&lt;br /&gt;This happened to me again, when I put a diluted solution of it with Jojoba oil (less than 20% of tea tree oil) on my face.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, this oil is strong (which was a negative point for me), and it&#x27;s very effective for acne, when I used it that only time, the red spots on my face really improved a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Now I decided I won&#x27;t use it again, unless someone would put for me a single drop in a big amount of jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to purchase tea tree oil, make sure that you don&#x27;t have allergy on strong smells, and that the item has a guaranteed fixed dropper cap.</li>
    <li> Okay not sure if it worked for me reason being i have very low imune system i was eating junky while applying this. Solution use this, eat alot of raw garlic! Yes google it garlic consumed raw..chop up garlic cloves in small pieces drink with water and it does work for sure. Consume alot of greens, eat raw Garlic, and also apply raw garlic w/ Apple Cidar Vinegar with this on the fungus infection directly and you will see a difference faster than prescription medictions which didnt work for me for 5 months straight.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with overall purchase and quality of item.  Would definitely purchased from this company again in the future!  Highly recommend...</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;m not going to sit here and write this review and say it&#x27;s some type of miracle product because those simply don&#x27;t exist unless you&#x27;re Harry Potter. But after two uses (last night and this morning) I c an say my face is significantly less oily.  Last night I mixed 5 drop with my Aztec Healing Clay and this morning with my moisturizer. No complaints, to irritation to report. Strong smell for sure! Currently I have mild acne that&#x27;s guaranteed to turn into post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation on my olive colored skin. But this product I can tell is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This is an ok tea tree essential oil. The value is certainly there, especially  for a liberal user like perhaps a teenager or bath soaker . Some people put a tree tree oil  like this in their gym clothes wash.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy it again for those types of users.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  So many uses!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the Tea Tree Oil did not work for the purpose in which I purchased it for. I am, however, able to use it for another medical aide.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face diluted with a little witch hazel.  The smell is a little strong, but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> Love tea tree oil I have a lot of piercings and it helps them heal faster than anything(although i don&#x27;t recommend using it the first week you get your piercing as it will burn quite a bit use salt water products such as h20cean but after a week i was ready to use tea tree oil works wonders its only been about three weeks and is almost healed), i also make a mask using a few drops to clear up acme.</li>
    <li> High quality tea tree oil. Good for fighting acne by keeping pores clean and your skin moisturized. I have had some breakouts and this oil gets the job done by cleaning my skin. Its also an anticeptic so it fights infections which thats what zits essentially are. So its good at keeping your skin clear! Great stuff will buy again!</li>
    <li> Item works well. No complaints about the tea tree oil. Even helps toe nail fungus, but it does have an odor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was suffering from HORRIBLE hormonal acne.  I am also taking things for it, but as a topical treatment this works really well!  I put some on each individual pimple with a Q-Tip and it shrinks within a couple of hours.  The smell and feeling aren&#x27;t very pleasant but I am very glad I bought this!</li>
    <li> I bought this to dab onto skin tags, having read in numerous places on line that it&#x27;s a fine remedy.  I&#x27;ve sprouted a few little ones in the last coupla years.  This stuff works much as others said.  It does sting a little, but not enough to be a real problem.  A drop onto the offending tag twice a day, and in two weeks or so it starts to shrivel and then just falls off.  Indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... to ensure that it wasn&#x27;t some crazy placebo effect at play, I&#x27;ll be testing a few other substances on the other tags before applying more of this TTO.  So far I&#x27;ve decided on Ovaltine, diesel fuel, and cheap vodka.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post results once they&#x27;re in.</li>
    <li> I love this Tea tree oil better than the once that in the pharmacy! I will def buy this again. And recommend this brand to every one. It heals my acne so fast. So it&#x27;s a life savor!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this essential oil. I&#x27;ve used it in a foot soak and I absolutely love it. Great value for a great product.</li>
    <li> I gave this a low rating based on ease of use for me and not based on the tea tree oil itself.  I was very disappointed to see it doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper on the bottle as my other essential oils I have do.  Makes it tough to accurately measure in drops when pours out.  Very inconvenient!</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used this as teenager, and I remember how well it worked, but I didn&#x27;t know what it was (I think my mom bought it for me) so I could buy it again. Now at 22 my acne has been worse than it has ever been in my life, I googled natural remedies, and tea tree oil was a very popular suggestion. When I first opened it I recognized the smell immediately, I FOUND IT AT LAST! I have a few really bad cystic pimples, and without diluting it, I took a Qtip and rubbed it on the affected areas, I woke up this morning and have not seen my skin this clear in Months. My cystic pimples are extremely reduced and my forehead bumps are gone. Yes the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but who cares; go to bed with it and wake up with fantastic skin, I really don&#x27;t get why people are complaining.</li>
    <li> Pretty good so far. I purchased this for a friend of mine who has bad acne. Within a week his face had clear up a bit. He was putting it directly on his face with a Q-tip, and had said it was burning. I researched &amp;#34;Tea Tree treating acne&amp;#34; and found out a direct application of Tea Tree oil is bad! I mean...it was burning his face. And people in the reviews mentioned after a while of direct application it not only burned their faces but it left permanent red marks. Long story short, If you&#x27;re going to use this for acne, you MUST dilute the product some way. I mixed it with a facial cleanser for my friend and myself and it oddly works the same way, it&#x27;s just safer and doesn&#x27;t burn lol I figured it since its a natural product, it would be okay to do what my friend did, but it was lesson learned. Thankful I found out soon enough to not do a direct application before anything bad happened. Other than that, the only bad thing I have to say about the product is that it has a VERY strong smell. Open it and use it, almost your whole house will smell like it. It is VERY strong. That&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil has a very strong scent. Out of all the brands of TTO I have tried, this brand smells the best.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, if you use TTO on your face twice a day, the smell DOES matter.</li>
    <li> This is great to kill spiders. Just mix with soap and spray and it will kill them, thanks for a smooth experience</li>
    <li> Great Buy 2oz will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Great natural antiseptic. It def has a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was bad. Just very earthy and woodsy. I&#x27;ve started using it instead of neosporin. It def prevents infection and promotes healing.</li>
    <li> Good for drying out zits.  A few drops in bath water with epsom salts is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Very strong, pharmaceutical grade. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have always used Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil, which is pharmaceutical grade, 100% Tea Tree Oil.  I use it for every type of skin condition on humans and pets and its the only product Ive ever found that cures toenail fungus!  MAKE SURE you get HERBAL AUTHORITY.  Some vendors on Amazon use a photo of Herbal Authority and then send another brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, INSIST ON HERBAL AUTHORITY!</li>
    <li> I saw that this was a common naturalist remedy to handle skin tags. With that in mind I have been using this product to treat a few tags on my person. Of the 3 that I&#x27;ve been treating only one has come off and another seems to be beginning to take effect after a week. But the one that came off was painful for about 2.5 days before it finally turned black and fell off. This was really uncomfortable, I think in the future I&#x27;m going to use freeze away if I have a tag sure it&#x27;s uncomfortable but just for a day vs. a few days with this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is good and the bottle is as shown,as another post alluded there&#x27;s no dropper in the jar or any other type of applicator so you&#x27;ll have to use something to apply the oil for whatever of the many purposes it has. I just ended up using Qtips. Good product I just wouldn&#x27;t use it again for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
    <li> This stuff works good on my nail fungus and this is a refill for my empty bottle, but I still don&#x27;t like its smell. Oh well, sometimes you have put up with the small bad for the greater good!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for tea tree oil! Nice size bottle. It&#x27;s very pure and so strong. A good buy.</li>
    <li> I applied tea  tree oil on skin tags, moles, acne, and toenails for two weeks.  I saw no improvement or change on any of the areas I applied the oil.  Will keep whats left maybe it will work for something someday.  But miracle cure, IT WAS NOT.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil came in the mail with a cracked lid, so naturally some of the product leaked out and evaporated---its highly volatile oil.  Bummed and disappointed.</li>
    <li> It said after using for some time I would see an improvement in my toenail fungus.  This is my  second bottle purchased.  Nothing good has happened ---- in fact they are harder and more yellow.  I WISH I HAD NEVER TRIED IT!</li>
    <li> I always keep tea tree oil in my medicine kit because it has so many uses. It will kill off anything from bacteria to fungi. If I get a pimple, I put a drop on it, and it dries up very quickly. It is also great to open the sinuses when used in a hot bath. I gave some to my grandmother also to use on her foot fungus, and she said it was effective.</li>
    <li> Great price for great quality product with multiple uses for all your skin care needs. Portable and effective and I recommend tea tree oil</li>
    <li> This oil arrived on time, as described and well packaged. It&#x27;s clearly a high quality oil and has that very strong trademark tea tree scent. So strong in fact that my boyfriend won&#x27;t let me apply it at night before climbing into bed, haha! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this on hand for its powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this if you have acne prone skin as I do. I mix a little drop in with my moisturizer in the morning. Just keep in mind you&#x27;re going to smell like it for awhile after applying. Any tea tree oil can be a tad irritating to skin at first, so I&#x27;d suggest easing into it if you&#x27;re doing an all over face application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this company&#x27;s tea tree oil. :)</li>
    <li> Handy to have around.  Has many uses. Have used it successfully for nail fungus and warts as well as eczema.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re shoppiIf you&#x27;re shopping for tea tree oil you probably already know all the things it&#x27;s good for, so I won&#x27;t even get started with that very long list.  I&#x27;ll just let you know that this is a very pure, good-quality source of it, at a very good price, and that the bottle did not leak on the way here.  I buy it in the 2 oz. bottle and no, that size does not have the drop-at-a-time dispenser (I can&#x27;t say whether the smaller bottle does or not.)  Since I usually apply it with a cotton swab anyway, I&#x27;m kind of glad not to have that dispenser top to deal with.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree oil is good for almost everything!!  This is a great value on the oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now, and it has helped my face, scalp, and scars.  I love adding it to coconut oil :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived fairly quickly, but I was shocked at how it was shipped. I received a small manilla envelope and upon opening it discovered it contained a glass bottle wrapped in bubble wrap. I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t break during shipping! If you&#x27;ve ever seen how packages get loaded onto trucks and thrown around then you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try the actual product yet but I have no reason to believe that it won&#x27;t work for its intended purpose. I did open it and smell it and it seems pretty strong.</li>
    <li> Even though there was a seal around the lid of the bottle it still leaked out some during shipping.  Other than that I LOVE this product.  Used it on my sunburn and it made it stop burning and my skin hasn&#x27;t peeled either.  :-)</li>
    <li> By far the best tea tree oil I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s strong, so test before using on your skin. I used it as an astringent.</li>
    <li> I had a case of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease and for those of you whom are unfamiliar, you get painful, itchy blisters everywhere mainly, your hands, mouth and feet. I tried everything I could think of and days in, I remembered I had this in my bathroom cabinet. It had been sitting in there over a year. I opened it up and shook it all over my blisters. It stung and it burned yet 5 minutes later the pain was to the point I could sleep for the first time in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it may smell a bit strange but boy does it num up those sore spots! Handy for bee stings, mosquitoes, or anything that makes you itch! Keep some handy.. you never know!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 of these for my wife and she loved it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy more of them in the future.</li>
    <li> good to have around for skin conditions(if you have them, not that i do, not that there is a problem if you do, but i don&#x27;t, ok i do.)</li>
    <li> We use it for insect bites and it provides fine relief.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for many things, this is a nice size bottle for the price and is 100% pure, and delivery was very fast!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  This is the second brand of tea tree oil that I&#x27;ve tried and I don&#x27;t kjnow how different that they can truly be.  I love using tea tree oil for all kinds of things.  I use a drop or two in my baths for extra protection against germs that may be lurking.  I also like to add a few drops to my shampoos to add a layer of protection against lice or any other mites or creepy crawlys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have found it great for ridding my face with acne, I just feel as if I&#x27;m giving myself the most possible protection when I use tea tree oil as a part of my skin regimen.  I recommend it for people who have skin conditions and are looking for a way to combat bacteria that is lurking EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my daughter as she uses it for a solution for diaper wipes.  product arrived as promised.  thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is marketed for Toe Nail Fungus.  It Does Not Work!!  It does have a REALLY BAD ODOR.  IT STINKS</li>
    <li> This product is very strong and definitely help with problem skin. Just remember to dilute it or you may give yourself a burn! 95% water is a good place to start.</li>
    <li> We primarily use this to clean my son&#x27;s cloth diapers. He got an infection that caused blistering in his diaper region, and we didn&#x27;t want it to spread or remain in the diapers; this did a great job of killing all the fungal bacteria. The smell is strong and woodsy. Once you get used to it, it&#x27;s really kinda nice. (Better than that ammonia smell cloth diapers get after a while, anyway...) I&#x27;ve since started adding this to my homemade cleaning products and using it to destinkify shoes as well. Pretty versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to just use a drop or two--this is very strong and very concentrated. We&#x27;re still on our first bottle, months after we bought it.</li>
    <li> I wanted tea tree to add to a mix I put on my scalp.  This oil works very well for that purpose.  It was packaged securely.</li>
    <li> This product deserves ZERO stars, but I had to provide at least one star in order to process and submit  the review.&lt;br /&gt;I have smelled other tea tree oils and while not exactly my preferred  scent of choice, they are  manageable.  This brand, on other hand, is far beyond acceptance. The smell is kind of hard to describe, but it reminds me of a blend of a strong commercial disinfectant, turpentine and camphor. I tried a few drops of it in my odorless blend of essential hand oils, and as soon as applying it, the medicinal / disinfectant smell was absolutely intolerable. I washed and scrubbed my hands to remove the powerful odor and discarded the oil blend into the trash. The smell lingered in the trash until I brought it outside. It actually smelled like I had sprayed some powerful disinfectant into the garbage. I rarely write a product review, but this product smells genuinely toxic and I would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> The package is good , and goes faster, it&#x27;s also a good tea oil, i want to buy it next time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my toes. My feet tend to sweat and I notice the beginning of what seemed to be athlete&#x27;s foot. With consistant use of this product you will see results within the week!!!! I learned that it also works swell for any skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for a lot of things. It works great. This brand I had not tried before and I will order more. It came fast and in a bigger bottle then the one I normally buy from whole foods.</li>
    <li> Good packaging, this is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Acne be gone! Mold be gone! Smells good too so many uses. Cleaning, skin conditions, wound healing. Come on and get some.</li>
    <li> RRAL Tea tree oil, will fight fungal infections ....if you use it regulary. Particulary good on scalp e.g. seboreaha dermatis</li>
    <li> Great for treating fungus nails and as a powerful antiseptic!</li>
    <li> This is not real.  And if it is in fact 100% real, you&#x27;re doin&#x27; it wrong.  It smells like lemon scented wood cleaner with a little tea tree oil mixed in.  And not working as REAL tea tree oil does.  Only bought it because the product picture is misleading.  I will learn from my mistake.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal: my poor boyfriend suffers from severe dandruff. When I say severe, I mean it, all dramatics aside. We&#x27;ve tried several remedies ranging from baking soda to coal tar, but nothing has been able to permanently end the problem. This is the next and hopefully last stop in the road for us, and so far he&#x27;s feeling pretty good about it. Upon opening the bottle, the first thing we noticed was the smell. Several people have mentioned it in their reviews, and although it is certainly pungent, I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all, although I see how it could bother someone less partial to the scent. It reminds me of minty pine needles. The original plan was to just mix it in with one of his basic zinc dandruff shampoos, but his scalp was bothering him so much that we decided to put a dash right on his damp scalp. I used about a tablespoon in small increments and gently massaged it in for about 10 minutes (apparently this stuff is good for your nails too... added bonus?). His initial reaction to having the oil on his scalp was that it had a cooling sensation, which relieved the itching. It&#x27;s about an hour later now and the itching hasn&#x27;t come back. I will update this review as he continues to use the oil/shampoo blend, and hopefully help out some other people dealing with this affliction :)</li>
    <li> smell ok. nothing to complain.</li>
    <li> This product was okay. I originally bought to relieve the exterior part of my yeast infection as I read on so many review that it was considered a solution. While it provided temporarily relief (5-10 minutes) it did not last long and the smell was strong (which I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it worked.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree is one of those items that you have to continue shopping around for.  At the time this was the most economical and  heavy duty.  Great Brand, Great Product - but now not so economical in relation to NoW Tea Tree oil 4 oz.</li>
    <li> this was a good deal and i am very happy with my purchase!! i suggest this to anyone interested! Bravo!</li>
    <li> As described -Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> magic in a small bottle !</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. used on athletes foot that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. Tea Tree oil did the trick.</li>
    <li> does not seem as strong (concentrated) as other brands</li>
    <li> Tea tea oil is a great product. However, i bought this for toe fungus/jock itch and it did nothing. If you want to cure those conditions stick to over the counter anti fungal sprays/creams those work exponentially better.</li>
    <li> Very strong product. I was scared about ordering this tea tree oil since a lot of people make it weak. This product is very powerful and gets a 5 star from me.</li>
    <li> Works great to treat my daughters acne.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. Smells kinda funky at first but you learn to get use to it. I poured some in my body wash. It helps to use a body wash that can offset the smell, I combined the tea tree oil with a citrus one. My skin cleared up nicely.😄</li>
    <li> Would be better if it had dropper type lid so that application was easier</li>
    <li> quick shipping and I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> Product came with a plastic dispensing insert on top of bottle which was too small and not tight, when i tried to dispense one drop, the insert came out and there was a mess of tree oil to clean up. and lost half the volume of the bottle. DEFINITELY BAD PACKAGING. The product however was as stated.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is another must-have household product that I always keep in stock.  I dilute it in water for use as an antisceptic/anti-bacterial application on bites and scratches.  I&#x27;m a big outdoor gardener and I live in Charleston where chiggers are a big problem.  I spray this stuff on my legs before I go out each morning and I have no problem.  Great mosquito repellent.  I have five dogs and--you guessed it--I spray this on them to help with flea prevention.  It&#x27;s like having an anti-bug elixir but healthier than over-the-counter remedies.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of skin tags around my neck that were getting irritated. Applied just enough oil to coat my fingertip to each one morning and night and they both dried up and dropped off within a week. The stuff smells strong like furniture polish, but it did the job.</li>
    <li> Every time I use product it broke my skin out. Unsure if it works haven&#x27;t seen any results so far.</li>
    <li> wife used for the first time today is a very strong overpowering smell but is supposed to work correctly and does not smell bad just smells like strong tea or oil we&#x27;re waiting to see what happens</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Just as described.  Arrived in the time specified!  Pleased with this purchase and would suggest it to anyone else!</li>
    <li> I wasnt too sure what to do with this oil, so I feel I wasted a lot of it, just trying it out in different ways. I bought to battle a AF fungus infection that spread through my bedsheets in the laundry and infected almost every inch of my body! I had AF for years and had never had a problem such as this, so I was desperate to get rid of it. Can you imagine having an intense itching over your entire body and nothing over the counter is working???? H*LL on earth!  This TT oil is the only thing that made life bareable again.</li>
    <li> Have used other oils but this item has a much better aroma than the other product and the price was lower. Very fast shipping also.</li>
    <li> please before use this product, check on the internet about&lt;br /&gt;what is Tea Tree Oil exactly. This is actually really dangerous one to&lt;br /&gt;put on skin. I of course did not know about it and put on my face&lt;br /&gt;I literally felt that my skin is on fire. it was so painful.&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;ve got some rashes still. I am not saying that this is bad.&lt;br /&gt;I am saying that have to be careful. please check thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;what is this and how to use it well. it could be very poisonous for your skin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but feel it should be a good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!I have been using it for awhile to see if it would work and it does.Once you get past the smell.</li>
    <li> This will ae you smell like you washed in turpentine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Postal code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Map data ©2012 Google - Terms of Use&lt;br /&gt;Map&lt;br /&gt;Satellite&lt;br /&gt;Hybrid&lt;br /&gt;5 mi10 km&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need further assistance?

    <li> Works great, the strong smell just tells me how potent this really is!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and on time. Was packaged nicely and carefully. Will be reordering as this stuff is addicting. I use it mostly for my hair and scalp because i deal with dandruff.  I mix a few drops with my shampoo (along with some peppermint oil) and wash regularly and I have noticed a difference in my hair. Recommended. Also, if ingested can be poisonous for adults and pets so keep away from pets.</li>
    <li> This tree oil is not a watered-down version so many other companies pass off as tree oil. Very strong aroma.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty large bottle of tea tree oil, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I learned about tee tree oil&#x27;s functions from a friend. I have not used it as widely as she recommends since my only concern is I have middle-aged acne on my forehead. I applied tee tree oil diluted with water every day. There has been some changes but it is very slow. I also think that maybe I should tackle my problem from within, i.e. the hormones. But I think that this is a very good product for antiseptic and a must-have at home.</li>
    <li> I hope you like the smell of near gasoline on you, because that is what you have when you put this on.  Seriously folks, this isn&#x27;t the cure you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The product I received does not match the picture as advertised.  The brand was not Good N Natural, and the label was half peeled off of the bottle.  I compared the product&#x27;s smell with another bottle of tea tree oil, and based on that it is not 100% tea tree oil. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> Great product, I bought it for my daughter skin. She gets a skin fungus every summer and nothing the Dermatologist gives her helps. This products gets rid of it for her. It also works great on acne. Yes, it smells strong and dries your skin up. But that down part doesn&#x27;t compare to the good.</li>
    <li> I opened the bottle to pour some into an empty bottle to be diluted when I spilled some on my table. A few minutes later I noticed a really funky smell from my fingers. The smell of this tea tree oil is unbearable! I&#x27;ve used several brands of tea tree oil including the body shop brand and generic store brands (cvs); they smell nice and refreshing, almost minty. THIS one however, smells gross. I can&#x27;t explain the smell but it&#x27;s not something I can use on my face every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work great, but I don&#x27;t think I can give it a chance since it smells so bad. That&#x27;s all I can say about this product.</li>
    <li> I use it to clean my wounds or insect bites, it&#x27;s effective and the quality is good, smells good too. I bring it a long wherever I go, just like a first aid kit. Recommended to have one when you are traveling.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this for my dry scalp (don&#x27;t get confused with dandruff especially during the winter).  I had some big flakes that I thought were dandruff till I researched it.  Then I saw several recommendations for tea tree oil and saw this on amazon.  Gave it a try since it was cheap.  I did try by putting a couple drops of this oil plus a small container of water which they sell @ walmart for a $1 or so.  It worked okay, but, the thing is you have to constantly do it.  I guess my scalp was pretty dry.  I also tried it on my pimple and I read you have to put a drop on your finger and dab it on your pimple.  Works not bad too.  The only thing is, I prefer coconut as it works faster than the tea tree for my dry scalp.  Cleared up my flaking by massaging the coconut oil (cold pressed)  into my scalp and in one day, my flaking was reduced by 75% and by the next day, about 90%.  Days to follow it cleared it up and I didn&#x27;t have dry itchy scalp.  Sorry, just saying even though it&#x27;s not about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very potent as it&#x27;s in its natural form.  So, this is a better buy than it being mixed with other ingredients.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product from fantastic store.  I use this for everything: every scrape and boo boo, in the bath, you name it</li>
    <li> contemplated between 4 and 5 stars, but thought there was no reason to give it less than 5. exactly what i expected when i ordered it. haven&#x27;t used it too much yet so not a lot of experience to report on.</li>
    <li> The package looks good and the amble glass bottle is really good for the oil. The oil can be absorbed very quick and feels good. The only thing you have to be aware of is that the oil has really strong smell and it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
    <li> The product that came to my door was not what is shown and  smells like pine cleaner. i will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! If I have a cold I boil water with a few drops of this and clears me right up!</li>
    <li> Awesome, can&#x27;t say enough, very strong pure tea tree oil. Bought it to help with toe nail fungus, only been a week, however product is as described and a good deal!</li>
    <li> Its very stinky but its showing me results and its only been a few months. I would order another one just to have around.</li>
    <li> I use this product to treat my acne and it works great! If you have very sensitive skin you may want to combine this with either grapeseed oil or jojoba oil though.&lt;br /&gt;They also shipped it very quickly which was very appreciated.</li>
    <li> The dropper was sealed and fell off so couldnt use the bottle for drops.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good- I use it diluted with water everyday to thoroughly wipe the residue off my face and kill bacteria.  It smells really strong and the scent makes my eyes tear up.</li>
    <li> We were a little hesitant to purchase this Tea Tree Oil (\\&quot;Good &#x27;N&#x27; Natural) because of the negative reviews on Amazon. However, most of the negative reviews were focused on the \\&quot;odor\\&quot; (or \\&quot;scent\\&quot; from our view) of this particular oil, some on the \\&quot;oiliness\\&quot; (it IS an oil!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Amazon reviewer was courteous enough to further describe his/her view of \\&quot;odor\\&quot; as being a mix between pine and paint thinner. With that informative description and from experience using tea tree oil, we imagined that tea tree oil could be construed by some as having that kind of scent. From our interpretation of that feedback, we purchased several bottles of Good N&#x27; Natural Tea Tree Oil. As we suspected, this product has a scent almost identical to other \\&quot;higher\\&quot; quality (at the very least, much higher priced!, if price is to be an indication of quality!) tea tree oil we&#x27;ve been using. I would liken the scent to more of a strong mint/pine scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Tea Tree Oil COULD possibly have a very strong scent to some folks. It is an antiseptic, albeit a NATURAL antiseptic, and most antiseptics do have strong odors. However, Good N&#x27; Natural is excellent quality (especially for the price), works just as well as much more expensive tea tree oil and does NOT have any more strange or strong odor (scent) than other higher priced tea tree oil. Not unpleasant at all, especially when considering the benefits of 100% natural tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback we can see is that, at this low price, Good N&#x27; Natural will probably take the path of other successful products by raising its price as it gains in popularity and sells more! :-)</li>
    <li> It really helped y severly afflicted toe nail.  Unless the salt water on the Atlantic cured it.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seems ok.  But wished I got a bottle with a dropper since I put it in my hair and on my scalp.</li>
    <li> Love it! Ive used it for a few things. Started out using it for my face to help with acne(which it does and its awesome) then i had a cyst that broke open so i mixed it with a little jojoba oil and it helped keep it clean and heal pretty fast, then i got some braids that were tight and my scalp was tender and getting those itchy hair bumps. I put a drop along the back of my head and it instantly felt so much better. Im trying to find more ways to use the tea tree oil cause its so good lol</li>
    <li> This is great for problems with the scalp, not just dandruff but&lt;br /&gt;other irritations and such.  Just add some to your favorite&lt;br /&gt;shampoo for great results.</li>
    <li> Great for treating a variety of skin ailments, but this stuff stinks! lol</li>
    <li> My son told me about this product for a wart I had. It took about two weeks / applied twice a day and now it is completely gone. The odor is minimal and the value is great. Absolutely would recommend this as it was recommended to me!</li>
    <li> These books feature great old style writting. I love the old stuff. I like to touch up on my youth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for athletes feet and it&#x27;s working.  You have to be consistent, but even with my inconsistency, it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> GREAT product, only need a drop or two, the smell is overpowering otherwise!</li>
    <li> I used this for 6 months as treatment of foot nail fungus. I ended up seeing a doctor who prescribed that pulse medication therapy that eventually cleared the fungus problem.</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product and I love the aroma it has.  Smells like the &#x27;stronger scent&#x27; of inner trees.  I just wish it came with a small brush attached to the cap to make the applications faster.  Anyway, I use a cotton Q-Tip and it works fine.  I&#x27;ve been using this product hit and miss now for about 4 months and my faith is growing.  It seems to be working to kill off the toe nail fungus on my feet.  Don&#x27;t know how it works on hand nails.  Likely about the same I&#x27;m guessing.  I soaked my nails 2 weeks ago and for the first time in years, I was able to cut the nails using only the large size toe nail clippers!  Wow!  I am a lot more motivated in my faith than when I first started this process.  And, I don&#x27;t have to constantly consult with Doctors to make sure that my liver isn&#x27;t being destroyed!  Thanks Tea Tree Oil people...</li>
    <li> This tea tree oil is amazing!  It has helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s acne quickly.  Even after we visited her dermatologist, this product is helping her more than what the doctor prescribed.  She just applies a little each night to her face with a cotton ball after washing her face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m most impressed with how quickly it removed a tick from my dog.  He had a tick on his neck and for years, I would try anything and everything to remove them...after reading reviews that the tea tree oil also aides in removing ticks from pets and humans, I thought I would give it a try.  Just one drop of the oil and the tick immediately released and was scurrying.  It was easy to pick off and flush down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more soon!  For the price compared to what I pay for acne medication and tick repellent, this is more cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t really bother us.  You get used to it.  It does have a strong pungent smell, but honestly once you see how great it works, the smell doesn&#x27;t factor anymore.</li>
    <li> This oil has fully met my expectations.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in excellent condition. This is a great oil for a lot of skin conditions.  It removes skin tags, it is good for eczema.  It helps to clear up eczema, faster, at a great price.  Will definitely use this seller again.</li>
    <li> Large 2 oz size lasts longer and allows for more uses.</li>
    <li> Good price, works well. Only complaint I have is that it didn&#x27;t have a dropper top like most and is easy to spill</li>
    <li> The inside part of the cap, that I am under the impression helps contain the smell, falls off the cap all the time for me.</li>
    <li> So when I ordered this, I fully assumed it would be tea tree oil and it turned out to be oregano oil. I was disappointed, until I read the uses for the other product I got. But in the future I&#x27;ll just buy the oils from the store to ensure I do not have issues like this again.</li>
    <li> Great product, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;The top seal was broken and they had it replaced within a few days!</li>
    <li> I use this for acne- which i really struggle with on my chin.  I use it nightly during breakouts; dip a Qtip in it, and put it on the pimples.  Has worked for me better than drugstore products!! :)</li>
    <li> When I use this on my acne. It actually dries after putting some using cotton swab one to two times a day. I just put small amount that will cover my acne and it dries easily. I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, while researching natural ways to help get rid of black heads. I can definitely say, that this works wonderfully on my skin!! I will say that you MUST mix with a carrier oil ( I use coconut oil) before application, but within a week of using it everyday just before bed, the number of black heads visible has decrease by at least half. I does have a somewhat off-putting smell, at first but it&#x27;s something that I very easily got accustomed to, and when mixed with a carrier oil the smell dissipates fairly quickly. I also put on my Aveeno moisturizer immediately afterward, so that helps as well. It&#x27;s definitely worth it after seeing the results!!  After seeing the results of this and of the argon oil I use on my hands, I&#x27;m very close to tossing most of my pricy cosmetics in the trash and using a more natural route for skin care!</li>
    <li> This is my 4th purchase of Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil. I am fully aware of the strong odor normally associated with this product. However, this bottle had a distinctively different, foul odor. I am not sure if the product was contaminated or if formulation had been changed, but I will not order this oil again due to this experience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for a hot oil treatment for my hair and it smells like feet. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s healthy but that smell is the worst!</li>
    <li> It seems to work ok but smelled worse than other tree tea oils I have bought. I bought two bottles and one of them leaked in transit so it was kind of a sticky mess as the label ran.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is practically a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected</li>
    <li> Was not tea tree oil, I had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> dont buy oils from anyone but amazon.  you get larger bottles for less money. they work the same and I found they smell better since they have not been filtered 100 times like do terra oils.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste very good and gives me diarrhea when I do drink it. Great for hair treatment but strong smell. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff originally to use in my conditioner. Little did I know there were so many more uses.&lt;br /&gt;A quick search on Google will net many more uses for this wonderful smelling oil. I personally use it on my face now instead of other chemical based anti acne creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of this oil is very good and the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to start an essential oil collection or just enjoys the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is very strong. I have used another brand in the past but this one had great reviews too and a bit cheaper. I think I will use this one for the DIY household cleaners, wound antiseptic purposes. I use tea tree oil for many products for our family-facial toner, acne remedy, natural deodorant, shampoos etc but the smell of this one does not seem suitable for the hair/body/face products that I make.It smells like gasoline!I prefer the KIS OILS or Auracacia brands, more expensive but definitely better smelling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, but extremely toxic to cats and dogs. Go online and research it, if you have indoor pets. Deaths have been reported from just putting drops of this oil on the pets bedding. One of my cats vomited from the fumes when I attempted to use this product as a cleaning agent in the bath area. I am using it for toe nail fungus and so far it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> What can I say. WORKING! WORKING! And again it&#x27;s working! I tried a lot of stuff. Tea Tree oil is the best. It&#x27;s almost gone. I&#x27;m recommending for everyone who has nails fungus.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil will eliminate all mold. Had black mold on furnace room walls in basement which had spread to a little used room next to it. Worked very well to eliminate all the mold. Just takes work and ability to get use to smell of the tea tree oil which was not too bad.  Also been told if you get a headache you can put a drop on each temple and it will make it go away. Also good for mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> As a physician, i live hmr remefies. This works great for myriad of things. I tell patients to use in fungal rashes, bugbites and especially good for toenail infections</li>
    <li> Now this stuff is magic in a bottle, so many uses. A little of this product goes a long way. As for the smell it&#x27;s really strong, but the results are more than enough to make me overlook that fact. Worked on my nails.</li>
    <li> Bought to make flea spray.</li>
    <li> smell strong but work well on the skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing.  I had mold spores all over our cloth luggage. I put just  A few drops in a spray bottle with water.  Spayed luggage and all mold was gone.  Impressive!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see any effects..</li>
    <li> Works great for my dandruff among other things.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Use on blemishes on face.  Really heals</li>
    <li> Great quality. Good for treating those dreaded &#x27;piercing bumps&#x27; and when diluted with some coconut oil, a great spot treatment for my acne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to use cleaning around the house and in the wash. Only need a few drops so the 2 fl oz will last months for me. Loved the smell and use it often.</li>
    <li> i have been using tea tree oil in my home made tooth paste for years. i decided to switch from my normal brand because this was 50% cheaper then what i usually buy. when i added this tea tree oil to a new batch it made my tongue numb. im not sure if thats a sign of good quality or bad quality but it was unbearable so after a few uses i threw it out.</li>
    <li> Was shipped in a timely manner. This oil is pure, didnt think it would be until I opened the bottle and got a whiff of it. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Smell really strong .</li>
    <li> tea tree oil is working great but I would have like to have had a dropper or dropper cap with it.</li>
    <li> I have severe inflamed acne and this product made them worse. Note to self: never use a product that feels like it is burning your skin. If you don&#x27;t have inflamed acne but just small ones, this will probably be a great product for you. For those few people who suffer from severe acne like me, this is not for you. I would get Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel Maximum Strength. It REALLY helped with my acne. Check out my review for the product!</li>
    <li> Almost didn&#x27;t buy because of other reviews. Smells like tea tree oil, DUH. Smells like every other bottle of 100% tea tree oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and works like it too.</li>
    <li> Bought it to dry up skin tags.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it long enough, but I didn&#x27;t like smelling strongly of tree sap.</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree oil for a while now but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as the other ones I have tried so far. The smell is a lot less and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I am wondering if it is watered down?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price and a good size but not as good as I thought.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST product I have bought for acne. I have hormonal acne due to PCOS. I have used all kind of expensive product. Ever since I started using this my acne has gotten sooo much better. Best thing is that its natural. The smell is very strong so you can only use it at night but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
    <li> oooooh ooooh ooohhhhh. i am using this on my piercing i got back in the en of November, which happened to swell up. OMG! i promise this stuff is sucking the mucus or whatever the heck is in there right out. been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and i am definitely seeing the difference. it is not completely healed, but it is getting there. i wont stop using it until the swelling gone and the piercing is completely healed.</li>
    <li> Amazing results this really helped my dandruff go away. This product is awesome but has a stong scent it&#x27;s  also a very good thing to use to unblock your stuffed nose</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to the smell of tea tree oil and actually have grown quite fond of it. When I got Good N Natural - 100% Pure Tea Tree Oil in the mail I was certain it would become a staple for my skin regime. And so far this product and I are going strong. I wash my face at night and then apply tea tree with a cotton ball to my entire face avoiding more sensitive areas like soft tissue near the eye. It&#x27;s improved my skin so much and it glows! I have extremely typical hormone filled teenage blemishes but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s effective to treat it so harshly like with face washes or toners you find in a drug store. Definitely go for something more natural and actually cheaper because a little goes a long way. So eat well, drink water, and cleanse with tea tree oil :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using tea tree oil to clean around the house and use less chemicals. I love the smell. Many uses...Google it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil a while ago, it last pretty long. I use it for several different things, it has a strong smell that lingers.. But I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I received water with strong scent...Isn&#x27;t it supposed to be oily?  Just curious if I got right product. Awful product.  Seller doesn&#x27;t even respond to my email.</li>
    <li> Hiqh quality product, works as expected for a high concentration/high quality extract of tea tree oil.  Good value for amount and quality of product.</li>
    <li> The puritan brand is the worst smelling tea tree oil, is not effective, and does not absorb well. This can&#x27;t possibly be 100% pure and real. Can&#x27;t even feel the tingly feeling i normally do with tea tree oil and again it has a strong awful odor. I notice Amazon shows the same picture for different companies. Order the one from the seller Greenals, it&#x27;s the real deal, it&#x27;s not Puritan brand.</li>
    <li> This is how it should smell. Trust this product. Good value.</li>
    <li> love it my skin is getting sooo much better</li>
    <li> I wish I saw this earlier, before my podiatrist sold me a bottle for twice as much for half the size!  This is a good product and helps with those issues related to scalp, feet, etc.  Multiple applications, comes in a great bottle and is worth it.</li>
    <li> Many uses! i got it to cure a fungus on husband toe nail, which it did after applying it for about 3 weeks. I have use it since on my scalp which was flaking and on my dog shampoo for the fleas.. well overall i recommend it to have it around</li>
    <li> I received an e-mail from Health Supplement Wholesalers asking me to review my purchase from them so here I am.  The only part of my order that came from them was Good N Natural Tea Tree Oil.  This is my first time trying it.  I purchased the oil to use as an antibacterial ingredient in homemade cleaning products.  It seems to be a popular ingredient in many homemade recipes although I did see a few warnings concerning cats and Tea Tree Oil so do your own research on that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived separate from the rest of my order very quickly and well packaged so I&#x27;d say the company gives excellent shipping service.  The e-mail I received this morning was from the founder of the company and said to contact them if I had any issues so I consider that a plus in dealing with them.  As for the Tea Tree Oil itself, I&#x27;m not thrilled with it but I really think it&#x27;s a matter of personal preference.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell at all but understand that might not be as important as it&#x27;s qualities for certain uses.  I also noticed this oil left an oily residue behind in my sink which I had to wash away.  It was an ingredient in an antibacterial dish soap recipe I found on eHow.  I won&#x27;t use this again in dish soap.  If you like Tea Tree Oil I recommend this company for it&#x27;s service and the fact they&#x27;re part of the Free Shipping program Amazon has.</li>
    <li> After you get get used to the smell of it, it does work okay.  It takes time.  I apply it every day (x2) and it has been over a month now.  As the toenail is growing out, the bad part of the nail is going with it.  If you don&#x27;t have patience, this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I use tea tree oil for everyything from cleaning to treating wounds.  It&#x27;s a staple for any household.</li>
    <li> Seems to be very good.  Pure as far as I can tell.  Quite strong.  2 oz. may seem small but it&#x27;s actually quite a lot...  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil at a good price. Just be careful, it pours out fast! I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t dropper style and spilled a bunch on my first use, still a good value, good product.</li>
    <li> So many uses around the house, I use it for skin issues and to clean with. A few drops in my mop bucket and I know I have a super clean floor without any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love the way this smells...very minty.  I use this in my oatmeal lotion for dry skin.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Works on hair, skin, mold treatments, etc. Great natural product.</li>
