      <li>This product worked good for my wife&#x27;s tattoo.</li>
      <li>Good gel ...</li>
      <li>This product too away a good deal of the stinging/burning sensation.</li>
      <li>I did my own eyebrow tattoo at home because I fade</li>
      <li>Quite effective.</li>
      <li>I should have known better</li>
      <li>Just need a lot more of it for the price.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>/&gt;there was no way i was going to be able to get my chest piece finished without it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does absolutely NOTHING!!!!</li>
      <li>But still would probably buy it in the future unless I fine another product that works best for me.</li>
      <li>but some more later it was a great product</li>
      <li>Tattoo soohe is just perfect...AND STRONG.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It totally numbed and worked great</li>
      <li>I bought it inconjunction with the &#x27;during&#x27; ointment (which I really liked and appreciated).</li>
      <li>Okay, so knowing that this product did an awesome job at suppressing the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for an OUTLINE on my left arm-chest-shoulder piece (finally finishing my sleeve).</li>
      <li>Numbing cream does not completely numb the area getting tattooed, I know this.</li>
      <li>This product worked great, and helped on sensitive areas especially (nipple, armpit, spine, collar</li>
      <li>AGAIN, it did not completely numb it</li>
      <li>Bought it for tattooing myself, did exactly what I needed it to.</li>
      <li>started my sleeve, I did the outline first then applied this creme</li>
      <li>If it lasted longer I would give it a higher rating.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s stay first 20 mins after that need to reapply if still needed.</li>
      <li>Which a tattoo goes deeper than just the first layer/surface of skin.</li>
      <li>This is better than the gel made by the same company.</li>
      <li>There have to be better products than this that actually work well.</li>
      <li>It worked great just kind of expensive fir the size/duration period it last.</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
      <li>but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work really well.</li>
      <li>I have used triple anesthetic creams only available by RX or used by doctors and they are a bit overkill for some uses.  </li>
      <li>I saw no numbness effects that really mattered.  </li>
      <li>and honestly I just wasted my money.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I had my neck blasted by a good clean artist.</li>
      <li>It seemed like when he would first start the tattoo my foot was nice and numb, then when he would pause to add more ink to the needle it felt like the foot instantly woke up.</li>
      <li>I would advise anyone to use Super Numb because it works SO much better!</li>
      <li>It only lasted about an hour and a half but let her sit easily for that period of time.</li>
      <li>I found this to be more of a waxy texture and hard to actually rub on your face.  </li>
      <li>When I received my package, one jar was empty &amp; the other was filled with something like hair gel, not numbing gel.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but very worth it</li>
<li> When I couldn&#x27;t keep my foot still anymore (and we were moving onto the other foot) and he applied cream to where he had worked</li>
<li> A little bit goes a very long way.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely not worth the price for such a small container.</li>
<li> First off, you need to know that nothing out there is going to COMPLETELY numb a tattoo during your sit.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even waste your time with inferior OTC numbing creams or products.</li>
<li> What a waste of money</li>
<li> For the price(I paid $14.98), the small amount you get and how badly it works for tattoos, I don&#x27;t feel that this is worth it at all.</li>
<li> it hurts a million times worse</li>
<li> so I ordered this gel to numb my eyebrow for 30 mins</li>
<li> , the foot felt numb to the touch.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it didn&#x27;t numb nothing I guess it don&#x27;t work neither</li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t numb before during or after.</li>
<li> Didnt even numb at all.</li>
<li> , I still felt some pain...but not as bad as it could have been!</li>
<li> (for me shading is the worst part of the tattoo).</li>
<li> Horrible!</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used the product myself and never got the numbing sensation. I felt everything and honestly I just wasted my money. It wasn&#x27;t numb before during or after. I would advise anyone to use Super Numb because it works SO much better!</li>
    <li> This product worked good for my wife&#x27;s tattoo. It only lasted about an hour and a half but let her sit easily for that period of time. If it lasted longer I would give it a higher rating.</li>
    <li> This product dont work at all. Didnt even numb at all. followed directions to the T, and nothing happend at all. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would work but it really didn&#x27;t. It took a lil of the sting away but not enuff:(. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Way overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work well at all. There have to be better products than this that actually work well.</li>
    <li> This product is so so. Not sure if I psyched myself up for the tat first or that this product took the edge of or if im just a savage and can tolerate pain. Im a tattoo artist and I decided to try this out. I had my neck blasted by a good clean artist. All steps were taken to ensure cleanliness. The container didnt have a seal when I opened the lid. I should have known better but I still decided to use it. My neck is now infected. Hoping I can return whats left for a refund.</li>
    <li> Good gel ... I did my own eyebrow tattoo at home because I fade so I ordered this gel to numb my eyebrow for 30 mins .. it&#x27;s stay first 20 mins after that need to reapply if still needed.</li>
    <li> First off, you need to know that nothing out there is going to COMPLETELY numb a tattoo during your sit. Okay, so knowing that this product did an awesome job at suppressing the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for an OUTLINE on my left arm-chest-shoulder piece (finally finishing my sleeve). This product worked great, and helped on sensitive areas especially (nipple, armpit, spine, collar bone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONCE AGAIN, it did not completely numb it, I still felt some pain...but not as bad as it could have been!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the way I rated it &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay.&amp;#34;  Deeveeant Numb cream I&#x27;ve found has a better texture and faster acting numbing ability. I found this to be more of a waxy texture and hard to actually rub on your face.  I saw no numbness effects that really mattered.  I won&#x27;t buy again, but maybe it works great for tattoos.</li>
    <li> This along with the during tattoo soothe anesthetic takes away all pain during an 8 hour session. Used as applied and will work as directed.</li>
    <li> I applied this stuff like it said on the directions and it didn&#x27;t numb nothing I guess it don&#x27;t work neither but you got to try it tho</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!! When I received my package, one jar was empty &amp; the other was filled with something like hair gel, not numbing gel. Horrible! The packaging &amp; seals seemed legit but the product that you think you are buying is not what is in the jars.</li>
    <li> This definitely eased the pain of tattoo removal quite a bit. Trust me... it hurts a million times worse then getting on put on so think twice, heck think about 100 times before you get a tattoo. Great product though. Only minor skin irritation after leaving it on for 20-30 minutes prior to treatment.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work really well. I still felt pain as I got my back tattooed and it still hurt a lot. But it could have been that I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
    <li> Got this for stiches and is great to have around the house for bites scrapes and whatever comes along. This is better than the gel made by the same company. Lasts for about 3 to 5 hours too.</li>
    <li> Quite effective. Just need a lot more of it for the price. Only about 8 applications in the container they send</li>
    <li> I used this for a quote tattoo on the inside of my foot from my heel to my big toe. I&#x27;ve had two previous tattoos on my feet prior to this one and never used anything like it for either of them. This product too away a good deal of the stinging/burning sensation. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had to put on extra layers just to feel a difference. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the price for such a small container.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream to touch up some tattoos I have on the sides of my feet(the design runs from the knuckle of my big toe to my heel). Numbing cream does not completely numb the area getting tattooed, I know this. In the case of my feet, it just makes it so that I can keep my feet still and not twitch uncontrollably while they are being tattooed. When I read the ingredients on this product I thought it would be great, three numbing ingredients &#x3D; awesome! Not the case at all. I went the way of applying this 7hrs ahead of getting my tattoos done, re-applying every 1hr-1 1/2hr. This way the cream has plenty of time to work. When my artist began his work, it was the strangest thing. It seemed like when he would first start the tattoo my foot was nice and numb, then when he would pause to add more ink to the needle it felt like the foot instantly woke up. When I couldn&#x27;t keep my foot still anymore (and we were moving onto the other foot) and he applied cream to where he had worked, the foot felt numb to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;So it seems that this cream only numbs the fist layer/surface of the skin, literally. Which a tattoo goes deeper than just the first layer/surface of skin. For the price(I paid $14.98), the small amount you get and how badly it works for tattoos, I don&#x27;t feel that this is worth it at all.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for me. I bought it inconjunction with the &#x27;during&#x27; ointment (which I really liked and appreciated). This took a while to dry on (which it does mention on the label), but it messed with the stencil. Probably can be applied before the stencil but we were experimenting. Either way, I noticed no relief once the needles hit. So, the same brand sells another product that is a DURING ointment. Buy that and have your artist apply that instead. This is a one star item for me, but I am giving it an extra star because it does contain a drug, drugs affect everyone differently and this is only my experiance.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and i would and will but some more later it was a great product so thank you</li>
    <li> Save your $$$$.. This product DOES not work at ALL!!! It does absolutely NOTHING!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! I am going to have to try another numbing cream.</li>
    <li> started my sleeve, I did the outline first then applied this creme (for me shading is the worst part of the tattoo). It was a breeze, recommended it to a couple friends and they say its great. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i love it i didnt think that it was going to work and it did!!!&lt;br /&gt;there was no way i was going to be able to get my chest piece finished without it.&lt;br /&gt;It totally numbed and worked great i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Worked great! I used the before and during ointments together and felt like I was being colored on with a crayon!</li>
    <li> It worked great just kind of expensive fir the size/duration period it last. But still would probably buy it in the future unless I fine another product that works best for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it for tattooing myself, did exactly what I needed it to. It&#x27;s a little expensive but very worth it</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best and strongest anesthetic creams you can get without a prescription.  I have used triple anesthetic creams only available by RX or used by doctors and they are a bit overkill for some uses.  Tattoo soohe is just perfect...AND STRONG.  A little bit goes a very long way.  Don&#x27;t even waste your time with inferior OTC numbing creams or products. This is what you want.</li>
