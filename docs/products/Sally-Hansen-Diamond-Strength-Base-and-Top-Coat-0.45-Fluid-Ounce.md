### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the best one for sally.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>LOVE it!!!!!</li>
      <li>Best product for your nails.</li>
      <li>This is the best base/top coat I have ever used.</li>
      <li>be wonderful; after all, I did read some good reviews.  </li>
      <li>great product and deal</li>
      <li>This is a great accessory to nailcare.</li>
      <li>Great shine for about seven days on a manicure  to the nail or nail polish over product.</li>
      <li>thank you for an amazing product!</li>
      <li>&quot; the 30 seconds Dries is more than perfect...</li>
      <li>but the diamond is a good product too.</li>
      <li>I was using good polish over it</li>
      <li>I have used and loved Sally Hansen nail products for years.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and I am very impressed</li>
      <li>You can see the shine from a distance that is amazing....</li>
      <li>Years ago I used to use this product to extend the life of my salon manicures and it worked amazingly.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it does have a nice shine.</li>
      <li>To name some pros, however, it does have some good staying power and the packaging is kind of cute.</li>
      <li>Everything was fine!</li>
      <li>I redid my mani and then used this product as a top coat.  </li>
      <li>I must say that I love all Sally Hansen beauty products.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t go on well on top</li>
      <li>I used this product as a top coat.</li>
      <li>Every time I apply the sally Hansen top coat I get bubbles.</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>Also, I never put anything near my cuticles and they have always been beautiful.</li>
      <li>Drying time may take up to an hour or two, so it maybe wise to use a nail dryer or fast drying top coat.</li>
      <li>She listed off the different brands/types that they had and I chose the \\&quot;diamond strength\\&quot; one she named because well, it sounded cool... and diamonds are a girl&#x27;s best friend, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I change my nail polish a lot, so I usually buy fairly cheap color polish, but wanted something really great as a top coat to keep everything looking good.</li>
      <li>But it was cheap</li>
      <li>use Sech Vite Dry fast top coat which is the absolute best top coat</li>
      <li>It really helps the nails grow, and strong!</li>
      <li>Luckily, my mom was at the grocery store</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend as a top coat if you&#x27;re looking for high shine as it&#x27;s as shiny as the name would lead you to believe</li>
      <li>Takes forever to dry, looks good while it is, and then, bam, it bubbles out of nowhere.  </li>
      <li>And as a top coat, this polish is EVEN LESS EFFECTIVE.</li>
      <li>Upon finishing, I realized my old top coat was out.</li>
      <li>polish isn&#x27;t even worth a $1.</li>
      <li>This top coat gives your nails a shine like no other!!</li>
      <li>I also use it as clear nail polish when I don&#x27;t have time to do a full manicure, and it looks nice and shiny and lasts for nearly a week.</li>
      <li>Good thing I can return it, but I&#x27;m just mad about my beautiful marbled nails being completely soiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On top of that, it gets tiny, wart-like bubbles.</li>
      <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally normal for a top coat to have a couple of micro sized bubbles on a nail or two, but when I woke up the next morning, all of my nails looked and felt like a smooth/round version of sand paper...</li>
      <li>I used good polish and a good base coat and made sure each layer was dry.</li>
      <li>I like the shiny chrome bottle, but it does not allow you to see how much of the product remains.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen nail products are they best drug-store items out there and this base and top coat is no different.</li>
      <li>Also, the top coat takes a longer amount of time to dry than some of the 2 dollar top coats I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>Again, the same thing happened when I applied this as a top coat: emulsified nail polish and tiny bubbles.</li>
      <li>Such a waste of time and good color polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also do not write many reviews, but this product is so crappy I wanted to inform others not to waste their money.</li>
      <li>I usually buy the quick dry top coat (black bottle), which I love.  </li>
      <li>I just bought this bottle, it&#x27;s brand new, so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used revelon clear coats and they have zero bubbles.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a clear coat that wouldn&#x27;t leave bubbles in my nails afterwards</li>
      <li>&#x27;n&#x27; Wild polish</li>
      <li>I know that it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s old.  </li>
      <li>, I washed my hands several times and still no chipping normally</li>
      <li>and I have to screw it back on firmly, sometimes several times, so that the brush embeds itself in the top.</li>
      <li>The bubbly surface is definitely from the top coat, I still have the older version when the base and top coat were sold separately, which is also a problem.</li>
      <li>ive tried all kinds of base and top coats, this one by far is fantastic, my nails feel and look like i have gel nails on, it took a few minutes to dry, i put my sally hansens polish over it even though it felt just about dry, worked fine, put it on as top coat, looks amazing, not sure why it took other people 4 hours to dry?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in years and when I recently purchased a new bottle, it RUINED my manicure.</li>
      <li>I use the base &amp; top coat frequently with a pale colored nail polish and have always found that it goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I generally like Sally Hansen polish, so</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the brush separates easily from the applicator lid</li>
      <li>So many bubbles, it&#x27;s the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>first when the bubbles started to form after applying my 4 layers of all-around polish (base, 2 coats of color, then top), I thought it HAD to be the new $2 Wet</li>
      <li>Tried the other new $2 polish I&#x27;d bought -- happened again!</li>
      <li>I always let them air out a few minutes between coats, and this usually doesn&#x27;t happen, so again the blame goes to the top coat.   </li>

<li> I thought the duel base and top coat would be worth the investment.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s shiny, yeah, but it&#x27;s like clear coat for a car and probably takes as long to dry (24hours?).  </li>
<li> and I have used both cheap and expensive polish with it.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Finally, today, I tried it without the base coat (thinking that maybe contributed) and I used some of my good O.P.I. polish.</li>
<li> I agree that it takes WAY, WAY too long to dry.</li>
<li> in reading the reviews, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m using an entirely different product than what the other ladies are talking about.&lt;br</li>
<li> I used this as a basecoat as advertised and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
<li> I just need to be patient and not plan on doing anything but sit and read or watch television for a while after completing my manicure (maybe 20-30 minutes for the nails to completely dry and be smudge proof).</li>
<li> I won&#x27;t buy this one again because as others have stated, it bubbles if your polish underneath is not bone dry before applying.</li>
<li> takes forever to dry ....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s dry on one hand by the time I finish the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I also know that it shouldn&#x27;t take four hours for my nails to dry!  </li>
<li> but it dried in the bottle very quickly and was difficult to apply.</li>
<li> completely ruined the marbled nails that I worked so hard to create.</li>
<li> I have convinced my husband that nail polish takes a minimum of 4 hours to dry, but this stuff really does take that long - AT LEAST!!</li>
<li> /&gt;Not only is this product a waste of money, it&#x27;ll ruin any manicure you use it on.</li>
<li> I just wish I had read the reviews before I spent a lot of money on this.</li>
<li> This product stays wet forever - it never hardens up, even if I knick my nails against something</li>
<li> The base coat serves a completely different purpose than the top coat.</li>
<li> Also, it seems to have encouraged bubbles in the nail polish on my finger nails, which usually happens when layers of polish accumulate without enough time to dry.   </li>
<li> Well, my manicure has a scratch on it and several of the nails look dull not shiny because it takes forever to dry.  </li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t have any of the problems other people seem to be having with it.</li>
<li> But other than that it is an awsome product,</li>
<li> I re-did the whole process, thinking I&#x27;d done something wrong.</li>
<li> It never really fully dried, and it seemed to almost emusify the polish underneath.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ll invest in a quality separate base coat and my 2 dollar top coats.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I&#x27;m so disgusted with this product that I had to warn potential buyers away.</li>
<li> Each time I kept suspecting the Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild polish, thinking it couldn&#x27;t be the expensive Sally Hansen stuff!&lt;br</li>
<li> It seriously looks like my nails are covered in tiny little warts or bumps.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s shiny, yeah, but it&#x27;s like clear coat for a car and probably takes as long to dry (24hours?).  I finished my pedicure and manicure literally four hours ago and my toe nails are getting imprints in them from fabric, etc.  I just bought this bottle, it&#x27;s brand new, so I know that it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s old.  I also know that it shouldn&#x27;t take four hours for my nails to dry!  Also, it seems to have encouraged bubbles in the nail polish on my finger nails, which usually happens when layers of polish accumulate without enough time to dry.   I always let them air out a few minutes between coats, and this usually doesn&#x27;t happen, so again the blame goes to the top coat.   Save your money!</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen nail products are they best drug-store items out there and this base and top coat is no different. I use exclusively as a base coat and it keeps my nails from getting stained by polish and works like a charm. I don&#x27;t recommend as a top coat if you&#x27;re looking for high shine as it&#x27;s as shiny as the name would lead you to believe but as a base you can beat this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times, and despite taking care about drying the layers of polish, when used as a topcoat this thing creates bubbles. It&#x27;s terrible and disappointing. Use anything else!</li>
    <li> I must say that I love all Sally Hansen beauty products.  This top coat gives your nails a shine like no other!! You can see the shine from a distance that is amazing....The strength protection is also a plus for this product but it definitely gives a UV shine...I must have this always in my supply!!</li>
    <li> ive tried all kinds of base and top coats, this one by far is fantastic, my nails feel and look like i have gel nails on, it took a few minutes to dry, i put my sally hansens polish over it even though it felt just about dry, worked fine, put it on as top coat, looks amazing, not sure why it took other people 4 hours to dry? did only my hands though, i even used my finger nail to pull apart a split key ring to put keys on it and it left no dent scratch or chip! thank you for an amazing product! will recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It is my base coat, everytime. It really helps the nails grow, and strong!</li>
    <li> I use the base &amp; top coat frequently with a pale colored nail polish and have always found that it goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I just need to be patient and not plan on doing anything but sit and read or watch television for a while after completing my manicure (maybe 20-30 minutes for the nails to completely dry and be smudge proof). I also use it as clear nail polish when I don&#x27;t have time to do a full manicure, and it looks nice and shiny and lasts for nearly a week. My only complaint is that the brush separates easily from the applicator lid and I have to screw it back on firmly, sometimes several times, so that the brush embeds itself in the top. I like the shiny chrome bottle, but it does not allow you to see how much of the product remains.</li>
    <li> Every time I have tried to use this product, it seems to me that my nails get weaker.  It should protect the nail, but that is not what it does.  Also, I never put anything near my cuticles and they have always been beautiful.</li>
    <li> takes forever to dry ....the best one for sally.H is  \\&quot;Dries instantly\\&quot; the 30 seconds Dries is more than perfect...this one is a waste of money ...Mira</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading these reviews then you already know the gist: bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this base/top coat last week. I change my nail polish a lot, so I usually buy fairly cheap color polish, but wanted something really great as a top coat to keep everything looking good. I generally like Sally Hansen polish, so I thought the duel base and top coat would be worth the investment. (I think it cost me around $7.50 at CVS!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first when the bubbles started to form after applying my 4 layers of all-around polish (base, 2 coats of color, then top), I thought it HAD to be the new $2 Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild polish I had just bought (a brand I&#x27;d never tried). The nails looked disgusting and I was really disappointed. Tried the other new $2 polish I&#x27;d bought -- happened again! Each time I kept suspecting the Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild polish, thinking it couldn&#x27;t be the expensive Sally Hansen stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, today, I tried it without the base coat (thinking that maybe contributed) and I used some of my good O.P.I. polish. The same thing happened, though a little less intense -- due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t use a base coat, I suspect. Such a waste of time and good color polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish isn&#x27;t even worth a $1. Should have read these reviews. Who knew.</li>
    <li> This is a great accessory to nailcare.</li>
    <li> I doubt I&#x27;m doing anything wrong in the application. I put a normal layer as base, wait till dry, put 2 coats polish, wait for 6-8 min then add this as a topcoat. Problem is the topcoat creates visible tiny bubbles on the surface of the polish which dries and looks terrible. Yes, its shiny and probably makes the polish last longer, but why would I care if there are bubbles on my toes.</li>
    <li> Thx!! Best product for your nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this but it dried in the bottle very quickly and was difficult to apply. Too thick - and not a very good base coat in my opinion</li>
    <li> So many bubbles, it&#x27;s the worst top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! As a base coat, doesn&#x27;t seem to be bad, but as a top coat, it always dries with bubbles, and I&#x27;ve used it with Essie, OPI and the high end L&#x27;oreal polishes. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I usually buy the quick dry top coat (black bottle), which I love.  I won&#x27;t buy this one again because as others have stated, it bubbles if your polish underneath is not bone dry before applying. On the plus side, it does have a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved Sally Hansen nail products for years. This, however, is the worst stuff ever in the history of nail stuff (as my daughter would say). Because of how badly this stuff bubbles, my fingernails look like I went out and played in the sand while they were still wet. I&#x27;m still a big Sally Hansen fan...I just wish I had read the reviews before I spent a lot of money on this. P.S. I agree that it takes WAY, WAY too long to dry. When I do my nails, I make it an all-day affair. I have convinced my husband that nail polish takes a minimum of 4 hours to dry, but this stuff really does take that long - AT LEAST!! And that&#x27;s just crazy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this all the time for the last couple of years.  I have never found it to be too thick and it&#x27;s never caused bubbling of my polish and I have used both cheap and expensive polish with it.  It&#x27;s dry on one hand by the time I finish the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they changed the formula, I don&#x27;t know but in reading the reviews, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m using an entirely different product than what the other ladies are talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Sech Vite Dry fast top coat which is the absolute best top coat there is so maybe that has something to do with it.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007U90J5U/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A10QGLOP845J6Q&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do one coat of Diamond Shine, 2 coats of polish (depending on the polish maybe 3 coats,)I wait about 5 minutes between coats.  After the last coat, I wait another 5 minutes then apply the Sech Vite and done.  The Sech Vite dries your manicure hard in 10 minutes.  You could bang it against the wall and it wouldn&#x27;t dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I don&#x27;t have any of the problems other people seem to be having with it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a clear coat that wouldn&#x27;t leave bubbles in my nails afterwards and unfortunately this still happens with this polish. But it was cheap so it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst top coats I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used revelon clear coats and they have zero bubbles. Every time I apply the sally Hansen top coat I get bubbles. It&#x27;s very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I used this as a basecoat as advertised and it takes forever to dry.  I used it as a base coat and the polish didn&#x27;t go on well on top and I ended up having to redo the manicure afterwards.  It had come out all bumpy.  Yuck.  I was using good polish over it (OPI) so it definitely was the base coat.  I redid my mani and then used this product as a top coat.  Well, my manicure has a scratch on it and several of the nails look dull not shiny because it takes forever to dry.  It&#x27;s definitely this product - again, I have OPI polish on.  I will definitely NOT be using this product again.  After doing 2 manis in one day, my nails are still not presentable.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get this product from amazon, I purchased this nail polish at my local walgreens.  I used it for the first time yesterday and I am very impressed, I washed my hands several times and still no chipping normally my nails would have looked horrible by now. Drying time may take up to an hour or two, so it maybe wise to use a nail dryer or fast drying top coat. But other than that it is an awsome product, oh and I almost forgot to mention that it made my nails feel a lot stronger I have naturally weak nails.</li>
    <li> Great shine for about seven days on a manicure  to the nail or nail polish over product. I was a nail technician and would recommend this product and its seller.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEMAND IT SEEMED TO BE USED, IT WAS WAY TO THICK AND WENT ON CLUMPY, I DONT RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it wound be wonderful; after all, I did read some good reviews.  But, I must have missed the bad ones!  Takes forever to dry, looks good while it is, and then, bam, it bubbles out of nowhere.  So bummed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t understand bad reviews, either.  Have NEVER had a problem with this product.  LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I&#x27;m so disgusted with this product that I had to warn potential buyers away. As a base coat, this polish takes forever to dry, which means that if you don&#x27;t wait at least an hour (yes, I&#x27;m serious) before starting with your colored polish, you&#x27;ll get draggy smear marks. And as a top coat, this polish is EVEN LESS EFFECTIVE. Not only does it stretch the drying time from the standard maybe 15-20 minutes to over an hour or two, it also dries bubbly. It seriously looks like my nails are covered in tiny little warts or bumps. And it&#x27;s not the nail polish underneath either, because I have tried it with three different colors, all different brands as well. The worst part is that when it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s not even that hard. It squishes when I press another nail into it, meaning that I&#x27;ve sacrificed the shiny smoothness of my manicure without even getting the promised hard protective shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this product a waste of money, it&#x27;ll ruin any manicure you use it on. Please, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I also got a bubbly surface, and it does take upwards of 4 hours to harden enough to put shoes on.  The bubbly surface is definitely from the top coat, I still have the older version when the base and top coat were sold separately, which is also a problem. The base coat serves a completely different purpose than the top coat. Why combine them?</li>
    <li> I was bored yesterday and decided to marble my nails. Upon finishing, I realized my old top coat was out. Luckily, my mom was at the grocery store so I called her up to ask her if she could grab me a bottle. She listed off the different brands/types that they had and I chose the \\&quot;diamond strength\\&quot; one she named because well, it sounded cool... and diamonds are a girl&#x27;s best friend, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This completely ruined the marbled nails that I worked so hard to create. Within minutes, bubbles began to pop up. All over the place all over every nail. I cleaned and buffed my nails before doing them, so that is not the reason why I had the bubbles. It&#x27;s totally normal for a top coat to have a couple of micro sized bubbles on a nail or two, but when I woke up the next morning, all of my nails looked and felt like a smooth/round version of sand paper... if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible. Good thing I can return it, but I&#x27;m just mad about my beautiful marbled nails being completely soiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that unless you are a person who likes bubbles as much as the yellow tang fish from Nemo, you will absolutely hate this product. End of story.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews first. I used this product as a top coat. It never really fully dried, and it seemed to almost emusify the polish underneath. On top of that, it gets tiny, wart-like bubbles. I re-did the whole process, thinking I&#x27;d done something wrong. I used good polish and a good base coat and made sure each layer was dry. Again, the same thing happened when I applied this as a top coat: emulsified nail polish and tiny bubbles. Hours later, it was still a sloppy mess. For a product that cost $9.00 a bottle at a local store, I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and will be returning promptly. Could this be a bad batch? I don&#x27;t know, but please don&#x27;t waste your money. Try something else!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. This is the best base/top coat I have ever used. It never ever bubbles or looks bumpy. Maybe people that have had issues with it have paired it with poor quality nail polish? I almost always use China Glaze or OPI and have no problems.</li>
    <li> Everything was fine! Thanks</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re going for that bubbling look, this is not the nailpolish to purchase. I made the mistake of going in and getting this as a blind purchase (no research beforehand). My thought was, \\&quot;Hey, it&#x27;s a two-in-one and only 7 bucks. Why not?!\\&quot; Well... This is why not: first, as I have already said, it leaves this horrible bubbling (from my personal experience at least). Also, the top coat takes a longer amount of time to dry than some of the 2 dollar top coats I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I&#x27;ve tried using this on two different nail jobs and it&#x27;s the same result. To name some pros, however, it does have some good staying power and the packaging is kind of cute. Ha. Overall, I&#x27;m just a bit disappointed and I&#x27;ll invest in a quality separate base coat and my 2 dollar top coats.</li>
    <li> great product and deal</li>
    <li> I also do not write many reviews, but this product is so crappy I wanted to inform others not to waste their money. This product stays wet forever - it never hardens up, even if I knick my nails against something hours later I have ruined/smudged my polish underneath. Even worse is the fact that little bubbles form underneath and look awful!! One of the worst products ever. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Years ago I used to use this product to extend the life of my salon manicures and it worked amazingly. I haven&#x27;t used it in years and when I recently purchased a new bottle, it RUINED my manicure. I put it on my nails about a week after they were done using OPI and it caused the polish on my nails to wrinkle, forcing me to take it off immediately.</li>
    <li> I used to use another one which is transparent packaged and i still prefer that one. but the diamond is a good product too.</li>
