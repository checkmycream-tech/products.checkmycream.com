      <li>I am loving this.</li>

      <li>That said, it is a great item and does the job very well.  </li>
      <li>I have been sleeping better</li>
      <li>I make sure to apply moisturizer immediately after steaming my face to keep my skin from drying out.</li>
      <li>The unit is super quick and easy to fill and starts steaming literally in seconds which is great.  </li>
      <li>Panasonic does a good job giving you literature/marketing that explains how ionic steam moisturizers better than normal steam.  </li>
      <li>To start with, it was easy to start using and is attractive enough to leave out if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You can sit comfortably watching TV or a movie while using this.</li>
      <li>This steamer isn&#x27;t cheap but if you think about it as part of a routine to replace facials at the spa then it&#x27;s not so</li>
      <li>and I find this is a quick and easy way to get relief from them.</li>
      <li>The directions are straightforward, and I was able to use it straight out of the box with no troubles at all.</li>
      <li>and I find this works wonders if used right before that!</li>
      <li>That way you can bring your face closer to the steam and get the full effect</li>
      <li>thanks to the clearing and ability to breathe so much better.</li>
      <li>I then go on to apply a mask etc and it ends up being as good as spending a lot of money on a facial.</li>
      <li>my face over time looked more dewy and stayed more hydrated than just using facial creams alone.  </li>
      <li>I was sceptical at first, but it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>It seems like a great product; however, only time will tell if it is worth that much more than the very similar Ivation unit.</li>
      <li>cheaper steamers spouting hot water on people&#x27;s faces YIKES!</li>
      <li>For the value, easy of use, compact in size...I live it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this about twice a week, and while I haven&#x27;t yet seen any difference in my skin, the steam is very soothing and my face feels clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>The machine itself is small and compact, and looks great with the pink/purplish chrome interior of the steaming area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is also more penetrative at the same time as it is effectively being shot upwards than just rise up from the traditional steamers.</li>
      <li>They provide a little ruler guide that you can use to make sure you are keeping the appropriate distance from the steam.  </li>
      <li>It may smell like tin at first</li>
      <li>The steam isn&#x27;t hot.</li>
      <li>I originally thought this would be a nice addition to use before doing facial masks to open up the pores</li>
      <li>Quite pricey but worth the buy, I can&#x27;t really live without it.</li>
      <li>For one, it was so easy to use, fill the water capsule, seconds for the steam to rise, and each water hold will provide over 7 minutes of constant level of steam.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use and really does work.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really opens up your pores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
      <li>Very gentile steam flow.  </li>
      <li>Quite pricy for this type of item and more than I would have expected.  </li>
      <li>I really think this will help.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, you could always put a towel on your head if you really want</li>
      <li>also found the steam to be gentler than the older steamers as this is pure steam</li>
      <li>They were just little better than a saucepan with hot, steaming water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a real improvement over my old face/sinus steamer, and something that should be useful both to people who want to steam their face as part of a beauty routine, and people who want to clear out their sinuses.  </li>
      <li>Still not a big deal and always now use it on full.  </li>
      <li>but I would highly recommend this for sinus issues as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Those who did not purchase this item might want to check out the price of it, and revisit the question of how much better it is (or isn&#x27;t) than other facial steamers out there.</li>
      <li>Well this little machine is fantastic.</li>
      <li>In fact, the only downside I could find is that you need to use distilled water in the resevoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam that this device emits is super-fine and very soothing.</li>
      <li>I keep it next to my bed- use steamer very often</li>
      <li>3 minutes when you fill the reservoir half way and 6 minutes when full.  </li>
      <li>I got maybe 2 minutes at half and 5 at full before it would start petering out and just puffing here and there.  </li>
      <li>steamer heats up in seconds, not minutes - 30 seconds to be precise and directs steam upwards towards your face from a small hole.</li>
      <li>I filled the water container to the half-way mark, and got not the very few minutes of steam the instructions suggested I would, but over 10 minutes of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Home maintenance for the face is made easier with this new facial steamer.  </li>
      <li>The steamer comes with a little guide to show you how far away to keep your face from the opening, but I haven&#x27;t found the steam to be so hot that I might burn myself.</li>

<li> This small steamer works very well.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s made in china, hopefully it will last long.</li>
<li> worth mentioning, though, that very small amounts of water go a very long way.  </li>
<li> I have not had this steamer long, but I expect it will last a long time.</li>
<li> I called Panasonic and after speaking to four different people found that I have to ship the unit back at my expense to a service center and IF they determine that the cracked cup isn&#x27;t my fault they will send me a replacement.</li>
<li> Expect your face to break out a little for first couple of use, lasting for a few days..just the skin purifying.  </li>
<li> At this price it is going to have to hold up a long time</li>
<li> The projection isn&#x27;t wide enough to cover all your face, so some rotation of the face is required.  </li>
<li> I offered to simply pay for a new water cup as it&#x27;s small (about the size of a shot glass) and would probably cost less than shipping the steamer back to them.</li>
<li> I am using it for past month or so (daily) and definitely has improvement in my sinus</li>
<li> This Panasonic Ionic Facial Steamer is a luxurious little product.</li>
<li> so I rubbed some passion flower oil on the pink part of the structure.</li>
<li> Your face never feels wet or damp while using this.</li>
<li> I found that it worked exactly as expected.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not really needed as the steam is automatically directed upward and you can align it based on your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> And be careful not to overuse!</li>
<li> It seems like might just have to believe them, because I cannot see any reviews/mentions of that on any other place other than people selling you ionic</li>
<li> So simple to use, just add distilled water to the small reservoir container, slip it in, plug in the unit and turn it on.</li>
<li> /&gt;Having this little steamer on hand makes me feel like I have a spa at my fingertips.</li>
<li> Well, that&#x27;s how my mom always did it when I was little.</li>
<li> Fill the little bottle up, put it in the machine, turn it on and a minute or so</li>
<li> It&#x27;s small</li>
<li> Living in the bitter cold Northeast where we are being hammered by freezing temps and insane amounts of snow, this just feels so good.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There are machines that will probably do the same thing for cheaper, but they&#x27;d probably be of questionable quality.  </li>
<li> The winter allergy season here is something that I find hard to cope with.  </li>
<li> After my third use of this steamer I removed the plastic water cup to find it cracked into pieces and leaking into the base.</li>
<li> A negative is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
<li> Base ona weekly use, 7 minutes are sufficient before a facial scrub.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This small steamer works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now, still works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Quite pricey but worth the buy, I can&#x27;t really live without it. When I have the time, I sometimes use it twice a day. I purchased this steamer because at the time, steamers seemed quite dangerous, I&#x27;ve seen reviews of others cheaper steamers spouting hot water on people&#x27;s faces YIKES! So I decided to go with this one. A negative is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> Strong steam and perfect for weekly facials. It may smell like tin at first so I rubbed some passion flower oil on the pink part of the structure. Also works if you have a sinus headaches.</li>
    <li> Panasonic does a good job giving you literature/marketing that explains how ionic steam moisturizers better than normal steam.  It seems like might just have to believe them, because I cannot see any reviews/mentions of that on any other place other than people selling you ionic steamers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it still provides good quality steam.  Fill the little bottle up, put it in the machine, turn it on and a minute or so later you have steam coming out.  The machine itself is small and compact, and looks great with the pink/purplish chrome interior of the steaming area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are machines that will probably do the same thing for cheaper, but they&#x27;d probably be of questionable quality.  Panasonic has a track record of building great products, not buying junk and relabeling it.  Fit &amp; Finish is great as well.</li>
    <li> I am loving this steamer! I was sceptical at first, but it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> After my third use of this steamer I removed the plastic water cup to find it cracked into pieces and leaking into the base. The cup was NOT cracked when I put it into the steamer. I called Panasonic and after speaking to four different people found that I have to ship the unit back at my expense to a service center and IF they determine that the cracked cup isn&#x27;t my fault they will send me a replacement. I offered to simply pay for a new water cup as it&#x27;s small (about the size of a shot glass) and would probably cost less than shipping the steamer back to them. But they don&#x27;t sell that item individually. Between Panasonic&#x27;s product quality and customer support it&#x27;s amazing they are in business. I will not buy this type of item online again.</li>
    <li> This is a real improvement over my old face/sinus steamer, and something that should be useful both to people who want to steam their face as part of a beauty routine, and people who want to clear out their sinuses.  The winter allergy season here is something that I find hard to cope with.  I really think this will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth mentioning, though, that very small amounts of water go a very long way.  I filled the water container to the half-way mark, and got not the very few minutes of steam the instructions suggested I would, but over 10 minutes of steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who did not purchase this item might want to check out the price of it, and revisit the question of how much better it is (or isn&#x27;t) than other facial steamers out there.</li>
    <li> I did not get this for the facial skin benefits but had been told that for sinus and allergy problems something like this would help. Well this little machine is fantastic. So simple to use, just add distilled water to the small reservoir container, slip it in, plug in the unit and turn it on. I have been sleeping better than I have in years thanks to the clearing and ability to breathe so much better. It might be good for skin but I would highly recommend this for sinus issues as well.</li>
    <li> I am loving this. To start with, it was easy to start using and is attractive enough to leave out if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a kit to suck out blackheads and I find this works wonders if used right before that! It really opens up your pores. I then go on to apply a mask etc and it ends up being as good as spending a lot of money on a facial. This steamer isn&#x27;t cheap but if you think about it as part of a routine to replace facials at the spa then it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use and really does work. Your skin feels great afterwards. I also have allergies and I find this is a quick and easy way to get relief from them.</li>
    <li> I originally thought this would be a nice addition to use before doing facial masks to open up the pores and it does work great for that.  I also ended up finding that using it every night after cleansing before bed, it was so soothing and relaxing and my face over time looked more dewy and stayed more hydrated than just using facial creams alone.  Living in the bitter cold Northeast where we are being hammered by freezing temps and insane amounts of snow, this just feels so good.  The steam is so warm and soothing.  They provide a little ruler guide that you can use to make sure you are keeping the appropriate distance from the steam.  The steam is supposed to be ionic which can penetrate the skin with nano-sized particles.  The unit is super quick and easy to fill and starts steaming literally in seconds which is great.  The only reason I took a star off was because I did not get the amount of steam specified: 3 minutes when you fill the reservoir half way and 6 minutes when full.  I got maybe 2 minutes at half and 5 at full before it would start petering out and just puffing here and there.  Still not a big deal and always now use it on full.  Another issue is the price.  Quite pricy for this type of item and more than I would have expected.  That said, it is a great item and does the job very well.  Very enjoyable and pampering.</li>
    <li> Gone are the days of boiling a pot of water and steaming your face that way. Well, that&#x27;s how my mom always did it when I was little. I&#x27;m not a patient person, so having a timer on this for 3 or 6 minutes is so perfect. Your face never feels wet or damp while using this. The steam isn&#x27;t hot. It&#x27;s very soothing. You can sit comfortably watching TV or a movie while using this. It&#x27;s small so it thankfully doesn&#x27;t take up my room in my bathroom. The only downside is the distilled water you have to use.</li>
    <li> Home maintenance for the face is made easier with this new facial steamer.  For one, it was so easy to use, fill the water capsule, seconds for the steam to rise, and each water hold will provide over 7 minutes of constant level of steam.  The projection isn&#x27;t wide enough to cover all your face, so some rotation of the face is required.  Base ona weekly use, 7 minutes are sufficient before a facial scrub.  I suggest two lots of steam if you have not treated your skin for a while.  This is terrific to use in the harsher NE weather.  Expect your face to break out a little for first couple of use, lasting for a few days..just the skin purifying.  For the value, easy of use, compact in size...I live it.</li>
    <li> I have had good experiences with Panasonic products. I have not had this steamer long, but I expect it will last a long time. It does seem well made.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use steamers myself, so I had my daughter use it, and she told me it works well.  She uses it once a week to add moisture to her skin, and it does do that.&lt;br /&gt; It does make a &amp;#34;weird sound,&amp;#34; which is not a problem. And the instructions do note that it makes a sound.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice steamer!  Too bad it&#x27;s not made in Japan, and it&#x27;s made in china, hopefully it will last long.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I keep it next to my bed- use steamer very often</li>
    <li> It seems like a great product; however, only time will tell if it is worth that much more than the very similar Ivation unit. I don&#x27;t use the unit but the person who does is very happy with the amount of steam and the temperature. At this price it is going to have to hold up a long time but I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic Ionic Facial Steamer is a luxurious little product. The directions are straightforward, and I was able to use it straight out of the box with no troubles at all. I found that it worked exactly as expected. In fact, the only downside I could find is that you need to use distilled water in the resevoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam that this device emits is super-fine and very soothing. The steamer comes with a little guide to show you how far away to keep your face from the opening, but I haven&#x27;t found the steam to be so hot that I might burn myself. I have been using this about twice a week, and while I haven&#x27;t yet seen any difference in my skin, the steam is very soothing and my face feels clean afterwards. I make sure to apply moisturizer immediately after steaming my face to keep my skin from drying out. In the future, I want to experiment with combining the steam with different facial masks to see if it helps to boost the efficacy of the masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having this little steamer on hand makes me feel like I have a spa at my fingertips. It makes me feel pampered, and I&#x27;m very happy with that.</li>
    <li> This steamer is a big improvement over the unwieldy steamers with cone shaped upper that you had to sink your face in and put a towel over your head. They were just little better than a saucepan with hot, steaming water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This steamer heats up in seconds, not minutes - 30 seconds to be precise and directs steam upwards towards your face from a small hole. That way you can bring your face closer to the steam and get the full effect, you could always put a towel on your head if you really want but it&#x27;s not really needed as the steam is automatically directed upward and you can align it based on your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the steam to be gentler than the older steamers as this is pure steam and you don&#x27;t have to bring your face closer to the bubbling or boiling water which could potentially have different temperatures in different spots. It is also more penetrative at the same time as it is effectively being shot upwards than just rise up from the traditional steamers. Recommended product, but needs to be used with caution so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always remember to rub ice on your open pores afterwards to close them up and get tighter skin. And be careful not to overuse!</li>
    <li> This steamer is wonderful.  Very gentile steam flow.  Notice a great difference in my skin.  Would definately give this steamer two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Helps my Sinus... I am using it for past month or so (daily) and definitely has improvement in my sinus</li>
</ol>
