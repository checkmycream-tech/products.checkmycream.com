      <li>Great item, exactly what I was looking for.</li>

      <li>The instructions are easy to follow.</li>

      <li>I am satisfied with the service and quick shipment.</li>
      <li>If only I had gotten one that had some suction to it I would have been happy.</li>

      <li>DO NOT do this the day of an important event</li>
      <li>w no charge and free shipping.</li>
      <li>not as good as a professional one</li>
      <li>It seems to work just as good so far.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>If it has no suction, I&#x27;d be better off just getting some sand paper and scrubbing my skin, LOL, not really, but really I did expect it to do better.  </li>
      <li>This one is so much better because it is portable and in a pretty case as well 😊.</li>
      <li>It gives more than enough section than what you need and really polished my skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, you can see the result right away.</li>
      <li>But it has way more gadgets than you really need.</li>
      <li>I have really improved my skin by being able to do it more frequently and it has already paid for itself.</li>
      <li>It really works as it says it will, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>it was totally worth</li>
      <li>but they replaced it right away</li>
      <li>Great for an at home or mobile business, because of it&#x27;s small compact size.</li>
      <li>Mary from New Spa was VERY apologetic, and super friendly.  </li>
      <li>My advice for the first time user like me - always start on a lower speed to prevent bruising your skin.</li>
      <li>I could see a difference the very 1st week!</li>
      <li>Item is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I would suggest that ya go get a real one first because i think i may have gone a wee bit over board.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used to work at a place that had a large machine like this one.</li>
      <li>do much for this.</li>
      <li>so maybe it&#x27;s all I really need.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay not much suction.</li>
      <li>Never had a real treatment by a spa or doctor before.</li>
      <li>and I see a nice result already, getting rid of the dead skin.</li>
      <li>I love the tiny tips for around your nose and the larger tips for my arms and legs.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have used this about 5 times ( once a week) it does make you face smooth, but then you are dragging a rough surface across your face.</li>
      <li>so you dont hurt yourself and if at all possible,  go get a real treatment first</li>
      <li>and I can definitely see and feel results after first use.</li>
      <li>First off im 44 and just starting to see signs of aging.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s listing clearly says a new item</li>
      <li>New Spa customer service contacted me this morning to clear up this issue.  </li>
      <li>I think I will stick to unblemished.</li>
      <li>Not as powerful as I expected.</li>
      <li>I was offered a new machine sent directly from them, but I already placed an order for a different machine somewhere else.  </li>
      <li>Low mode doesn&#x27;t have any suction and high mode barely does the work.</li>
      <li>This is a microdermabrasion technique manual that shows treatment sequence (which area on the face to treat first) and treatment approach (direction to glide the wand, in or out, up or down).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for an at home or mobile business, because of it&#x27;s small compact size. But the suction isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
    <li> Customer service was excellent.  The package came w wrong size tips but they replaced it right away w no charge and free shipping. My skin feels amazing after 3 uses. Scars are fading too. Great investment. I&#x27;m a physician and this is an affordable machine for home use. Not strong as medical spa grade equipment but I wouldn&#x27;t want it any stronger. Great suction.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! The do it at home is the same as a salon treatment! It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
    <li> I guess we are ALL wanting a miracle. I have used this about 5 times ( once a week) it does make you face smooth, but then you are dragging a rough surface across your face. I will keep using after all it isnt doing any harm</li>
    <li> Got it for her for Christmas. Good quality, strong suction, nice packaging, and the case it is in is really convenient for her. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect perfect perfect</li>
    <li> Im satisfied!!! Its worth it!!</li>
    <li> this was awful. i immediately returned it. there was literally no suction at all. maybe it was defective?    buy the Rejuvaderm MD instead (Rejuvaderm MD has literally worked wonders and been life changing!)</li>
    <li> ****EDIT*****  New Spa customer service contacted me this morning to clear up this issue.  It is not their policy to send out returns, and it is an issue with Amazon putting returns back into stock.  Mary from New Spa was VERY apologetic, and super friendly.  I was offered a new machine sent directly from them, but I already placed an order for a different machine somewhere else.  If that one turns out to not be so great, I&#x27;ll happily give this one another shot.  It looked like a great kit, and I would&#x27;ve loved to try it out.  *******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item&#x27;s listing clearly says a new item and I would NEVER purchase an item of this nature that was used.  If it was in better shape, I would have maybe just cleaned it and kept it, but the case was dented, chrome was tarnished, greasy fingerprints everywhere and the divider inside the machine where the power switch is is ripped away from the machine.  The cleaning pad that came with the machine had dampness inside the baggie, there was a couple of hairs in the box, one wand had tarnished chrome and finger prints, the boxes with the cleanser and lotion were ripped open.  Come on guys.  This was a lot of money to plunk down on something in such bad shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this machine twice and I love it. You will definitely see a noticeable improvement in your skin.</li>
    <li> the product is great and really works. But it has way more gadgets than you really need. Look for one with fewer heads since you won&#x27;t use them anyway.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, you can see the result right away. I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved it.... The best investment that I could do it. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this machine, it has enabled her to her own dermabrasion instead of going to the office</li>
    <li> I love this microdermabrasion system! It&#x27;s fabulous. Has great suction and a great set of diamond tips with it.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a return policy for &amp;#34;just don&#x27;t need/want&amp;#34;...Only used for a few minutes and decided it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d use. Using a buff puff with exfoliator is easier and doesn&#x27;t cost $190.  Didn&#x27;t research product thoroughly and got SCREWED out of $190...</li>
    <li> This is a microdermabrasion technique manual that shows treatment sequence (which area on the face to treat first) and treatment approach (direction to glide the wand, in or out, up or down). Check out page 13, 14, and 16. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.skinforlife.com/instructions/Manuals/MicroDerm/micro%20manual%20-%20nov07.pdf</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about this, then when it arrived I was confused because the instructions were not very thorough.  I went on YouTube and saw a demonstration, then went online &amp; found the manual. Initially used it just once a week because some of the reviews were scary.  I progressed to twice a week, got a &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; for the suction strength and WOW - my skin is smooth and it does a great job on the pores.  You will know this works when you check/change the filters.  The instructions state to sanitize every time - I just wipe the diamond heads with alcohol and then throw the heads in boiling water once a week &amp; also look &amp; change at the filters at the same time.  It isn&#x27;t as if a massive amount of debris is being sucked out.  Use the SMOOTHING head at the end - it removes the exfoliated flakes &amp; feels good.  I apply a Hydrating Mask immediately and picked up one by Aubrey which was $11 &amp; lasts about two months.  This is a great product &amp; I might do this 3x a week.  DO NOT do this the day of an important event - I did this the morning of a wedding I had to attend.  I looked fine but this does cause some slight redness which you can cover with makeup.  Also, use SUNSCREEN !  I use Murad Moisturizing Sunscreen because it doesn&#x27;t turn your face white like the others</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the service and quick shipment. I bought this product based on the costumer reviews.I am happy with this machine, the size is perfect for all the stuff that came with it. The instructions are easy to follow.My advice for the first time user like me - always start on a lower speed to prevent bruising your skin. I always wash the diamond tips after using to restore its roughness and prevent my skin from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Microdermabrasion Machine... I use it on my face and chest and I can see a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money going to a salon and getting it done but never got the same results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok machine, but suction is very weak.. Turned it to max and still not much power. Plus side machine is very quiet.</li>
    <li> not as good as a professional one</li>
    <li> Just delivered today. I have spent months shopping and researching and finally made this decision, with low expectations on the suction. Happy to say the suction is good! Even had to turn it down. Used once and I see a nice result already, getting rid of the dead skin. This winter in Michigan has been rough on my skin. I think this is going to just what I was looking for! Happy!</li>
    <li> Just got this today and couldnt wait to use it. First off im 44 and just starting to see signs of aging. Krinkles and larger pores, wasnt having it so, watching an infomercial, i found this one and got it. Never had a real treatment by a spa or doctor before. I would suggest that ya go get a real one first because i think i may have gone a wee bit over board.&lt;br /&gt;I do like it though.  Im only giving it 3 stars because the instructions are kinda poopy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did some comparison shopping. Its actually a really good unit for the money. Whatch some YouTube videos so you dont hurt yourself and if at all possible,  go get a real treatment first so you know how hard to work this thing.</li>
    <li> Great. I&#x27;ve had this machine for two years. It delivers. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not much suction. I think I will stick to unblemished. I can&#x27;t believe I paid do much for this.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It has great suction, very easy to use, it was shipped to my door in just 2 days and I can definitely see and feel results after first use. I definitely recommend this product it works great!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I bought this unit, but I am very happy with my choice. It gives more than enough section than what you need and really polished my skin very nicely.</li>
    <li> I sent this back, because it had hardly any suction and the suction was the same on all levels.  If it has no suction, I&#x27;d be better off just getting some sand paper and scrubbing my skin, LOL, not really, but really I did expect it to do better.  I gave it 2 stars because they do come with extra pads and the packaging was nice.  If only I had gotten one that had some suction to it I would have been happy.</li>
    <li> This is the closest to the Dr&#x27;s office you can get.  I&#x27;ve had several hand held microdermabrasion devices and this one has the strongest suction and the best diamond tips.  I love the tiny tips for around your nose and the larger tips for my arms and legs.  For the same price as those wimpy hand held machines -- this machine makes them look like kids toys.</li>
    <li> Great item, exactly what I was looking for. Item is exactly as described. Arrived within their shipping dates.</li>
    <li> very good , fantastic</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I expected. Low mode doesn&#x27;t have any suction and high mode barely does the work.</li>
    <li> This is really an incredible device. It really works as it says it will, and it&#x27;s easy to use. Plus, it does the same job as those from a doctor&#x27;s office or spa. Highly recommended. And, the price is awesome too.</li>
    <li> Works really good, i&#x27;m happy so far.</li>
    <li> Great machine! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Really great machine for home use.  My only complaint is the suction power on it.  But I am not a professional so maybe it&#x27;s all I really need.  It seems to get the job done.  I have really improved my skin by being able to do it more frequently and it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a place that had a large machine like this one. This one is so much better because it is portable and in a pretty case as well 😊. It seems to work just as good so far.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love.  Friends want to buy too now.</li>
    <li> love it !! it was totally worth it I could see a difference the very 1st week! I will be saving time and money from this purchase!</li>
</ol>
