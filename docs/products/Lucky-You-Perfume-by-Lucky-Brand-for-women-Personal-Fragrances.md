    <li> I needed an inexpensive gift for me wife. Nice sweet but clean smell. Good price point when on a tight budget.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It is mild and smells amazing. I regularly purchase this perfume from various stores in Utah. But this time I ordered it through Amazon. It being summer, the perfume long lasting fragrance is effected. I am trying to figure out if it is the summer effect or the perfume not being strong. Will see.</li>
    <li> Great perfume and very fast shipping.  The perfume lasts for a long time, so you do not have to re-apply through out the day.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>

    <li> Great product,  fast shipment</li>

    <li> I have a bottle of this, it smells okay, when you first spray it, it smells like hairspray. you have to wait like 30seconds for it to claim down and settle on ur skin then it smells good..it&#x27;s very floral, smells like summer or spring time flower. it&#x27;s not sweet, but if you like floral you&#x27;ll like this</li>
    <li> I keep a little mini spray in my purse for when I want to freshen up during the day. It&#x27;s such a nice fresh and clean scent, and one that I have not gotten tired of over the years. It&#x27;s one of those fragrances that almost everybody likes, so it makes a good gift too :)</li>
    <li> No problem with the seller.  Just didn&#x27;t especially care for the perfume.  Guess I wasn&#x27;t so lucky...😔</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this perfume in a few years and was so excited to get some again! Its got a fresh summery kind of smell. My husband likes it too! I was really happy about the price! Way to go Amazon! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume, bought it for a gift, so got myself one to try, and I&#x27;m a fan</li>
    <li> I was afraid to order perfume without smelling it....buy was pleased when my daughter used it and she lovedIt smells great</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as part of a two-for-one deal, where both the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s versions came in a gift set for $12.00 total. (It was a post-Xmas promo sale.) After trying out both, I concluded that the women&#x27;s fragrance is not for me. It&#x27;s not a surprise, and it may be particular to my body chemistry - I have a lean, athletic build and find that only men&#x27;s deodorants work for me, despite advertisers&#x27; claims that I NEED something \\&quot;pH-balanced for a woman\\&quot; - but on my skin, this perfume smells really cheap, overly floral, and borderline tacky. One reviewer mentioned that she found it reminiscent of Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth perfume, and I think that about covers it. The first time I smelled Lucky for Women, it reminded me of the cheap \\&quot;teen girl\\&quot; perfume I used to wear as a young&#x27;un in the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like dry, extremely floral perfumes, and find that you can wear most women&#x27;s scents, give this a whirl. It&#x27;s usually on sale at least a couple times a year to make it worth your while. I give it two stars because it smelled REALLY GOOD on my husband, whereas Lucky for Men smelled like burning plastic on him!</li>
    <li> This is the perfume my girlfriend wears. I love how it smells on her I will continue to buy it until she tells me not to</li>
    <li> The scent is my preferred cheap scent which I wear after I take a shower and know that I am not going anywhere.  The scent disappears soon after and is just ok, but pretty good for the price I should say.  I think this would make a great gift to a high-schooler.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light and easy on the nose. I used to take my sisters&#x27; I liked it so much! Definitely a necessity for me. I only use one or two sprays and this just seems to last a long time on my body and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it (1 spray is plenty).</li>
    <li> thought I would give it a try, but it is just ok.  I actually think it smells more like something the 50+ crowd would enjoy as it can be a little overpowering with just one spray</li>
