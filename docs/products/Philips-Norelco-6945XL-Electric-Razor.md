<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed! No mention in ad that no trimmer on shaver.. Would gladly have paid more for model wwith that feature whch is usually standard on any decent electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Shaver shaves as well as any other Norelco I have owned which is good.</li>
    <li> This was a step down from my Cool Shave.  Wished I had spent more and got a better model.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it very much. It was a gift to him on his Birthday :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shaver, it shaves.  But it has so little power that my two-day growth sounds like it will grind this poor guy to a stop.  It really is, IMHO, underpowered.  This is my third or fourth Philips cordless shaver and this is the only one that I feel like just doesn&#x27;t have the internal power needed to keep its blades spinning fast enough under anything more than a routine daily shave.  I do wish I&#x27;d spent $10 more and gotten a better shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought this some time ago, for my father, who cannot shave with his old razer and shaving cream anymore.  He has used it for about two years, everyday, fantastic purchase.</li>
    <li> I love norelco or noelco during Christmas time. They do the best job and last the longest. A proven product since I grew fuzz. Why fight sucesss. I do believe that the cheapest are as good as the most expensive so do as you wish with that info.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a razor guy for years - with a beard and stash an electric can be a pain - literally. Snagging a stray hair, etc.  But I thought it was time to give an electric another chance. For daily stubble - up to about four days worth - this razor works great. Anything longer and it tends to get painful - hair snags instead of cuts. The cutting heads move independently out - but not inwards.  Push one head inwards and all three move. I suppose this is a feature, but I find it annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cut and trim closely, and for a quick, non-messy shave, it&#x27;s nice. It does feel cheap - but it&#x27;s also very light. Flying with this would add almost no weight. If you have a beard, stash or prefer some longer facial hair, I&#x27;d skip this razor and pick one with a trimmer and more flexibility. When I got too close to my beard it snagged - not a good feeling. But it&#x27;s not designed for beards, so my bad.</li>
    <li> I am a shaving cream and razor guy but I got this because with my back it is getting harder and harder to shave. This razor is so-so at best. It is light which is a good thing but has a very cheap feel to it. It charges quickly and at the same time does not hold a charge for very long. If I let things grow for a couple of days (and I don&#x27;t generate that much facial hair anyway) the razor seriously bogs down and has trouble doing its job. Not to mention the fact that the shave is not close at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done but only good enough fro around here. If I still had to go out to a dayjob this shaver would be unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Reliable long battery, just doesn&#x27;t shave very close</li>
    <li> This razor is simple and direct... no frills or trimmer but is very durable and works extremely well.  I use it 4-6 days per week and I am thrilled.  It is the second Norelco that I have owned and they have worked to my satisfaction going on 7 years now.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time. It is ok for shaving but really doesn&#x27;t get a close shave and makes a lot of in grown hairs. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smooth and and powerful. Does a great job every time.</li>
    <li> It is cheap. I don&#x27;t look forward that it would be as good as those at prices of 100 or even more.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and shave well. 100% recommend it because it gives me a perfect shave in a few minutes. Their blades last a year using it daily. I like!</li>
    <li> I ordered this the other day and I have been very pleased with how close it cuts. I was looking into replacing my old shaver&#x27;s battery and heads, but that cost more than just buying this shaver. As much as I like my old Norelco, its just not worth fixing up with shavers like this costing less than the parts. I paid about $30 and it was well worth the money My old shaver was apparently so very dull. I&#x27;m actually enjoying shaving again.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic razor, and it is just worth buying this one! Great customer use and I like it.</li>
    <li> Battery last quite a while. Item as described. Fast Shipper. 10/10</li>
    <li> This one is very easy to use. Just charge it, and use it. The shaves are very comfortable and sharp.</li>
    <li> But it does its job in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a base model so there is not much to expect other than hoping for it not to fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking over the reigns for my wife on this one. And I have to say that the 6945 is not for men with thick facial hair. I can probably grate cheese with my five o&#x27;clock shadow that I have by noon, so I tend to rely on an extremely close shave with a minimal amount of passes. The 6945 didn&#x27;t pull it off. Even after softening the hair on my face in the shower, I had to make way too many passes to even produce a reasonable shave.</li>
    <li> I received this razor for free via the amazon vine program, and I am using it to shave now. It does a good job, providing a reasonable, smooth shave in a short amount of time, without creating any facial trauma. The battery holds enough charge to last a week. You can shave even if the battery is dead, by plugging into the wall socket, which I appreciate. Nothing is worse than a dead shaver when I have five minutes to get out the door to work. My old razor would not run at all until the battery was recharged. That is why it is my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reservation about this item is the cheap construction. The plastic is thin and insubstantial. The shaver head is loose on the body, so it shifts around while you shave, with a clicking and clacking sound that is disconcerting. I usually wrap my fingers around the head to keep in in place while I shave in circular patterns. I don&#x27;t see this as a long term solution, because it seems highly prone to breaking. If it does I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an inexpensive razor, but I think you will be better served by buying something with higher quality construction.</li>
    <li> Some will prefer blade over electric, while others prefer electric over the blade. It really depends on what you prefer. But if you prefer electric shaver, then you might want to skip this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. POWER. I was actually surprised by how weak the power was. I fully charged the battery over night and used it in the morning, but the motor sounded really weak. Weak power means weak shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. CLOSENESS. I didn&#x27;t expect real close shave from this price range. But even then, I was disappointed by its shave. It wasn&#x27;t really close shave. My [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun M90  Mobile Shaver, Silver, 1]]does better job in closeness!&lt;br /&gt;3. WASHABLE. It is NOT washable. This means that you have to clean the shaver with brush often. Yet, Braun M90 is washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this is an entry level and inexpensive shaver, but with similar price range (even cheaper) Braun products give you closer shave and water washable option. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This basic &amp;#34;close cut&amp;#34; shaver is the first electric shaver that is almost as close as a blade and yet is comfortable and easy to clean. While it has no trimmer I use a razor for that and the pop up trimmers never thrilled me anyway.  Another great feature is the fact that the entire head lifts off for cleaning. Initially I thought this was a bad idea and then realized that with a simple turn of the small grey colored internal flat screw the head and blades come apart for thorough cleaning of the heads and area around the blades. While the motor should never be put under water the disassembled head and blades can be washed dried and reassembled quickly. Just remember to screw the grey plastic flat screw into the locked down position clockwise (to the right) before re attaching it to the body which hopefully you have already used the small brush to clean.  A final touch is a very small amount of light oil over the top of the assembled blades. As the blades are self sharpening they say you can get 2 years before replacement.Follow what I say and get more!</li>
    <li> This electric razor is my first electric razor and although it is very convenient to dry shave, it does not shave very deep.  I still have black specs around the bottom half of my face that you can see even after shaving.  It does not come close to my manual gilette power razor, which I still use when I want the deepest clean shave.  I just use this electric razor now only if I&#x27;m in a hurry and not going to important places.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this razor would perform as well as the norelco my grandfather had for years.  Alas, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s adequate, but the blades are not as effective in removing all hairs, especially thin or thick ones the first time over.  It doesn&#x27;t even catch them all the second time over.... it took me 4 to five times across the same patch of skin to get it to cut my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this razor \\&quot;adequate\\&quot; and beg Norelco to improve their manufacturing design and implementation process before they go out of business.  All this razor did, is make me swear that I wouldn&#x27;t buy Norelco again.</li>
    <li> I have owned and used Norelco electric razors for many years and would never buy this model again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery indicator is completely inadequate and the cutter head is poorly designed.  I guess the old saying that relative to the price, apples; \\&quot;If it is too good to be true; it&#x27;s too good to be true\\&quot; or \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo15MTQ0SWE1YD6]]In this video I use the razor and review its pros and cons.  PROS:  + Close shave, no pinching or pulling on my face  + Quick use, plenty of charge left over  - CONS:  - High maintenance to clean razor heads  - No sideburn trimmer attachment  (NOTE: The 6955 XL model does have the sideburn trimmer attachment)</li>
    <li> This razor is okay, but for $10 more you can get a better razor. It&#x27;s the one with blue on it. It gets a closer, smoother shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. This razor does the job but since the other one is only $10 more, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the portability and the power.  I haven&#x27;t charged it for a few days and it still is cutting without any problem.  Easy and quick to charge too.  Graet value!</li>
    <li> Bought as a present. Great value and very reliable piece. Have only good things to say. Shaves close to  skin and does not irritate. Easy to use and reliable quality of proven manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  had the opportunity to use the Phillips Norelco rechargeable razor for the past five weeks. The razor is very straightforward to operate and works well with the contours of your face and is quite simply the closest thing to a blade shave I have ever used. This razor offers a close and comfortable shaving experience and is very reasonably priced. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> If your facial hair is already very short you can get a good close shave to most areas. After a few days the hair is too long and the shaver just rips a lot of it out. On my neck it leaves red sensitive areas like a rash if I press too hard. Not too hard to clean if you do it every week or every 4th-5th shave.</li>
    <li> Norelco razors last me a couple years and I have some pretty tough whiskers.  I would buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> good price, decent product!  very good enough for me! i loved it!  Tho the shaving efficiency is not very strong.</li>
    <li> It is good item. I like this item and I &#x27;m satisfied. I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> works great...wish it had a sideburn attachment!</li>
    <li> Hey, this unit works great.  I use my electric razor for well past the life of the blades and forget how well these shavers can work  I start shaving with a blade again and then decide to buy a new electric.  The replacement blades are not a good alternative for the cost of the units I purchase.The new blades in this bargain priced unit are as good as more expensive units, best I can recall, and shave very well.</li>
    <li> Good, I like it better than my old razor. Battery life is not as good as I hoped but it&#x27;s not bad. Wish it had a beard trimmer but I can&#x27;t complain because I knew it didn&#x27;t when I bought it. Gives a decent shave and good for the price I got it.</li>
    <li> I have two homes and have one of these in each. Use to use my old electric for touch ups and rely on a razor for the best shave. No more. I get the best shave from this shaver - better than a blade. The bargain price makes it an unbelievable buy.</li>
    <li> I dislike the electric razors for women (not rotary head) and I get tired of shaving in the shower with a manual razor plus the refills are so expensive!  So I purchased this to shave my legs. It does the job - not as silky smooth as a new razor blade but good enough for a swimsuit or shorts and without the burn that the electric razors for women usually give me. Recommend!</li>
    <li> For $21.00 this shaver does a good job. Still an irritating feature of Norelco is no warning when the battery needs recharging, the shaver just stops.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 6945XL Electric Razor and after charging it, used it for the first time.  I am very happy with this product for what I intended it for.  I wanted an electric razor to use on my legs between regular safety razor use.  Being female, I wanted the 3 head system because it is flexible.  Service was great from the seller.</li>
    <li> A complete scam. Motor is too slow, pulls hair, there is no beard trimmer, you realize that only when you buy it as the package made cleverly so you do not see there is no beard trimmer! Replacement blades are more expensive than the shaver! I bought this \\&quot;hair puller\\&quot; for under $30 and it pulls hair while new, motor too slow and 2 weeks later the blades are completely dull, so I went to purchase replacement blades and surprise... the replacement blades cost - $32.99!! The replacement blades are sold as \\&quot;replacement head\\&quot; expecting the entire clean head of the shaver, but when you unpack it, it&#x27;s only the metal blades enclosed in there. What a scam. In the past in early 2000s I remember owning a 1995 $200 Philips shaver and called Philips Norelco asking for replacement parts. They were rude to me and told me they got no replacement parts for me on a shaver that was just 6 years old! No more Norelco Philips for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile ago for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. So far he absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to his previous razor when he shaves with this now his face actually feels pretty smooth. There is no stubble in random places that the razor has missed. He also loves that he can use it with or without the cord. It is also fairly easy to maintain, as cleaning it is super easy.</li>
    <li> I just shave my under-beard area about once a week, so I didn&#x27;t need anything elaborate or expensive.  I used to have a plug-in Norelco that I used every day all over, and it had much more power than this one does.  This one is about 1/2 to 2/3 of the RPMS of my old one.  Although it&#x27;s slower, it seems to do a decent job, given enough time.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAVER COULD SPIN A BIT FASTER AND HOLD A LONGER CHARGE BUT ALL IN ALL FOR THE PRICE I AM SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> Summary:  Good shave, little fuss.  Durability is suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using blade razors like the Gillette SensorExcel for a long time and gotten good shaves.  But the hassle of daily shaving and cleaning up the mess meant that I shaved less and less and finally settled on a short beard.  Gave this review copy of the Norelco 6945xl a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on a small section of the full beard (about an inch long) just to see if it would work under adverse conditions.  It did.  But that&#x27;s unreasonable usage (and painful!) and I hacked off most of the beard with scissors before trying again.  Since there was an unusual amount of beard to slice off, I emptied and cleaned the razor a few times.  But that&#x27;s a one time deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a good shave.  A bit of irritation but the manual said to give it 21 days for the face and razor to adjust to each other.  I kept at the daily shaving and after a week there&#x27;s no need to wait.  It works just fine with hardly any irritation.  The shaves are approximately as close as the SensorExcel and it takes much less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual had a key bit of advice - use one hand to stretch out the face where you&#x27;re shaving.  I had not tried that before with electric razors and it made a big difference.  No more stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual says battery will last for 30 minutes of shaving.  I&#x27;m on my 9th day and it&#x27;s still going on the initial charge.  That&#x27;s more than adequate.  You can leave the cord plugged in and shave if the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual suggests replacing the head every year.  I was surprised at how expensive this is - replacement heads are about $22 on Amazon.  But this seems to be a normal type of expense with the other electric razors I looked at so that&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has not broken or malfunctioned in any way BUT it does feel rather flimsy.  I don&#x27;t expect it to have a long life.  The rechargeable battery isn&#x27;t replaceable so you&#x27;ll have to discard the razor when it no longer takes a charge anyway.  I guess that&#x27;s comparable to many other razors in this price range.  Manual says you shouldn&#x27;t use it as a corded razor once the battery no longer holds a charge.  I don&#x27;t see why not.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the battery outlasts the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 years... it&#x27;s still working!any other razors in this price range.  Manual says you shouldn&#x27;t use it as a corded razor once the battery no longer holds a charge.  I don&#x27;t see why not.

    <li> It is a very quiet and smooth shaver. However, it does not have a side-burns clipper. The battery is great!</li>
    <li> for the price in all i love it doing a good job and holds a long charge its alsome&lt;br /&gt;it work</li>
    <li> It is perfectly fine.The charging last as long as it is supposed to and gets the shave done. I have no probs.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco razor and I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true is not very powerful, but considering my baby face hair is a blast!&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are just like me, with a sissy face hair, this is the one to buy.&lt;br /&gt;God bless you.</li>
    <li> I have never had a good experience with electric razors, so I was leary to try another. However, this razor actually does a good job. Most electric razors either don&#x27;t shave close enough or give me razor burn-especially on my neck. This one has not done that after two months of use. I have to say, I am impressed. Now granted, nothing shaves as close as a good, old-fashioned razor, but this comes as close as any I have tried - AND it doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn. I would recommend this razor to those who have not had much luck with electric razors before.</li>
    <li> The 6945 is crap.  Stopped working after 4 months.  Wo8ld run for 30 seconds when plugged in, then stop..avoid this or any subsequent model</li>
    <li> I shave quite a lot. My facial hair, obviously, but I also shave my head. I can only use Mach 3 blades if I want a close shave and not to bleed everywhere, but these die after only two uses. So I&#x27;ve been looking for another option. Have I found it with this? Somewhat. It does a great job of getting rid of the facial hair and head hair, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as close as I&#x27;d like. It&#x27;s also worth noting that unlike with my razors, I can&#x27;t take this into the shower. It also ends up very warm to the touch after a fairly short use time, and the process of cleaning out the stubble accumulation zone isn&#x27;t as smooth and easy as I&#x27;d like it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are minor complaints. This thing is inexpensive and gets the job done. What&#x27;s more to ask for?</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about a Norelco three head shaver, after having Brauns and Panasonics.  However, the very first shave finally cut some persistent hairs right under my jaw on the neck.  For years I have never been able to get that portion of beard cut close.  Just for that I am giving it 4 stars.  I like the fact that you can use a cord or go cordless.  It seemed like every time I picked up my Panasonic it had to be recharged and of course you cannot recharge them and shave at the same time.  The Norelco is very quiet almost silent compared to the Panasonic.  The reason for 4 stars is that this shaver feels very big yet very light in your hand.  The lightness is not bad but doesn&#x27;t make it feel sturdy.  Time will tell on that.  Plus there is no pop up trimmer, which I don&#x27;t care about anyway.  Not a bad shaver for the money.</li>
    <li> cheap plastic. no trimmer on top. bad collection system. does not shave as well as any of my past razors</li>
    <li> Apparently I don&#x27;t fully pay attention sometimes when I buy an item.  This Norelco Razor is a case in point.  I completely missed the fact that it does not have a set of clippers to even sideburns.  Guess I never gave that a thought as all the Norelco Razors I have ever owned came with that.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a vibration when in use that seems a bit harsh.  All electric razors vibrate some and it is just something that goes with shaving but on this one the amount of vibration caused me to take notice and remark that this is afterall a cheap razor&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have used only Norelco razors for +/- 35 years and intend to continue that even after this unit wears out - which will not be all that long in my estimation.  This razor has sharp blades and does work fairly well although I believe that the heads don&#x27;t follow the contours of my face as well as my last Norelco razor did.  Recommend it? No.  Buy another one like it? No.  Recommend a higher quality Norelco razor to a friend?  Yes.</li>
    <li> I have had two Philips Shavers previously to this one, and they always did the job. This time I wanted to to try a different shaver so, I bought a Remington roller type. Which was awful and I had to return it. So, stick to what you know it works do not change!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy new heads for my old razor but I came across this new razor.  it was only a few dollars more than buying new heads for my old  faith full  Norelco  and it works perfect.  I recommend this model to anyone interested in a new Norelco.</li>
    <li> that razor work really well it really gilles you a close shave i like it  and will buy  anotherone thank.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband to care for a new colostomy.  It charged for the first use, but soon went dead and upon subsequent charging won&#x27;t supply sufficient power to shave a small area without discomfort.  I&#x27;m sure it is defective and I had hoped to replace it.  Due to his decline in health, other things took priority and its no longer able to be returned.  It&#x27;s very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The 6945 is good shaver for the price. It is inexpensive, lightweight, and shaves nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two concerns/comments regarding the 6945.  One is it lacks a pop up trimmer!  Why?  Every Norelco I have every owned has included this feature.  Some people may use it to trim side burns, others longer facial hair, or on the back of the neck.  But I have to believe most Norelco rotary razor owners like this feature.  The other concern is it is not washable under a faucet, meaning you can&#x27;t get it wet and have to clean it solely by brushing it out, wiping it etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is your basic Norelco rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At several hours, charge time is longer than on the more expensive Norelco razors and there is no quick charge.  However, you can also use the razor while it is plugged in, so if the battery drains, plug it in, shave, and then leave it to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this writing, better Norelco shavers (the soon to be discontinued 7310 and 7340) can be had for the same price or a few dollars more.  They provide the same shave, but also includes a pop up trimmer and it may be cleaned by rinsing the heads under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what the 6945 includes, it is the razor, the charger (cord, not a stand/station), a small cleaning brush, and a thin cap to snap over the heads when not in use.  It lacks a case, as do most Norelco razors nowadays.  Even the more expensive rotary shavers like the 8200 series include a soft case, so if you have a molded case from an old Norelco, hang onto it, as some of the newer rotary razors will fit in it.  I have a case from about 5-7 years ago and this razor fits it, as does my 8240.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most, if not all, Norelco razors below $65-$70, the 6945 is made in China.  My personal opinion, given all the questionable manufacturing issues in China recently, from poison dog food to toys with lead paint, is to spend about $30 more and get a Norelco 8200 series razor, presently produced in the Netherlands.  While I haven&#x27;t found any operational or performance issues with this razor, if where a product is manufactured concerns you, it is something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a decent product, but does lack some nice features which can be had for maybe only $4 or $5 more.al or performance issues with this razor, if where a product is manufactured concerns you, it is something to consider.  All in all, it&#x27;s a decent product, but does lack some nice features which can be had for maybe only $4 or $5 more.</li>
    <li> After 19 years with my husband I had the pleasure of learning a lot about MANY razors as I believe he owned every single one ever made at one time or another.  I also sneakily used many of them on myself so I feel well qualified to evaluate this razor.  My husband always had to use rotary style ones because he had sensitive skin and blade razors broke his skin out.  There is nothing groundbreaking about the 6945.  It is inexpensive at around $40.00.  I don&#x27;t know any information regarding replacement blade availability since this particular model has not been publicly released yet but if the prices of the other 6800+ series is an indication this is pretty well going to be a \\&quot;throwaway model\\&quot; when the blades are done.  Of course, careful maintenance with the included brush and protective blade cover are key to keeping the blades in good working order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a wet/dry shaver.  So, if you are looking for one you can conveniently use in the shower look further.  This model is extremely lightweight.  It charged as stated in the instructions.  It held a charge for at least 6 days (that is only how long I have been using it).  I normally keep my razors plugged in at all times however but unplugged this one for evaluation purposes.  There is also no sideburn/back of neck trimmer built-in.  My husband would have never been happy without that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver seems toylike.  It might be a good one to get your 14 year old son as a \\&quot;starter\\&quot; shaver but I can&#x27;t see a mature man who has been shaving for years being happy with this model.  It would probably make a good travel shaver however.  A lot of men who travel for work like to keep an exclusive travel kit they can just toss in their bag  at a moment&#x27;s notice so I think this would be a good addition to that.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight, small, and charges up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;-Have to go over spots twice or more to get a decent shave&lt;br /&gt;-Not waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, i wouldnt recommend this product at all, as anything that makes mornings harder than they have to be isnt worth it.. But if you need a cheap electric razor and dont mind the hassle due to the weak shave, go for it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Philips Norelco. My husband has been tempted by inexpensive razors in the past, but they do not give as close a shave and they don&#x27;t last very long before you need to toss them out. He also says they often pulls hairs more than shave them, which is irritating. This Norelco has been giving him a very smooth, close shave and he says it is very comfortable to use as well. I&#x27;m finding that Philips Norelco is a very reliable product. It gives a nice smooth shave with ease. It&#x27;s become my husband&#x27;s preferred brand for razors.</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric razor since the 1980s, when I got frustrated with the way in which the razors available then would stop working, would irritate my skin, or just not do what they said that they would do.  I have a beard and tend to shave the edges with a plain razor.  Although this razor looks very similar to the older ones by Norelco from the 80s, I decided to give it a try.  It works much better!  Without prepping my face, it cuts cleanly and well.  I prefer the way it works to the straight razor, and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shave is smooth and quiet.  I like the fact that it operates via the elec. cord but could still run without if you need.  I do not like cordless.  Wouldn&#x27;t have minded having a beard/mustache trimmer (also gets the nose and ear hairs) like my previous Norelco.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver was delivered in a timely manner.  It met my expectations.  Key points: 1. Superior to shavers of a couple of decades ago, 2. Suprisingly light in weight, 3. Battery charge exceeds expectations.  I recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent device for the money. It&#x27;s not the closest shaved i ever had as they said, but it works great for day to day shaving.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know until I bought this that this model does not have the sideburn trimmer in the back like my previous Norelco did. It&#x27;s a feature I always used each time I shaved, and I miss it. I guess leaving that feature off is why the price is low.</li>
    <li> I took this razor to China and forgot to pack the power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In three months of use it didn&#x27;t run down. I was suitably impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it give the best shave ever? No, you need a wet shave for that. But this thing will do the job when you need the job doing.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and son.  My husband does not like it at all, but my son thinks it is okay.  Next time I will buy a better quality one.</li>
    <li> The convenience of this rechargeable razor makes shaving on the go a fast and easy task.  No more stretching the cord to reach that poorly placed electric outlet.</li>
    <li> It is working fine.  My husband uses it frequently.  We have  had not problems with it yet and am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It bites my lips so that causes blooding!&lt;br /&gt;So its difficult to shave around lips as i am afraid of biting again!&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a pop up for line trim :(&lt;br /&gt;Also needs too much time for charging again(8 hours to work 30 min!)&lt;br /&gt;I am not gonna offer it any more!</li>
    <li> A pleasant surprise. Like it in a pinch.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes how very close it shaves. It&#x27;s just what he wanted. He&#x27;s very  much pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The razor works great. It holds a charge for several days, in fact, I&#x27;ve never lost a charge even when I forget to plug it in for a few days. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> OK, everyday razor.  No trimmer and does not wash clean.  But hey, for $17 one can&#x27;t gripe too much.  Not a long term razor.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;d rather keep using disposable razors. This product misses hairs frequently so more than two repeats/attempts are needed, which in turn really scratches us you&#x27;re face. Also, using this razor on other spots on you&#x27;re body, public and chest for me, means you&#x27;re gonna get cut up. You can&#x27;t use water to clean it either.</li>
    <li> Norelco is  always great and just what I needed to retire my husbands old norelco that he has had for 25 years.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good played clean effect is good Is bigger, is not convenient to carry Overall is good, the five-star Worth buying</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin has never been on good terms with electric razors, yet I always seem to try them with the hope that one day we&#x27;ll get along.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of advancements in shavers in the last 20 years, tried many versions (both expensive and inexpensive) but unfortunately my sensitive skin has never been able to adapt.  When the Philips Norelco 6945 Cordless Razor showed up on Amazon Vine my face mustered its courage and I decided to give it a try.  Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Lightweight, perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Good for shaving those tricky areas of your face that manual razors can repeatedly cut (nose and chin) if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Still pulls and nicks the hairs on my face.  NOT good for sensitive skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement blades are expensive and cost half the price of the razor itself.  Recommended replacement of blades is once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No charging stand, just a plug-in cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof or resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaver head must be completely removed in order to clean the inside reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Small motor with low power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 6945 Cordless Razor is an inexpensive cordless razor that&#x27;s perfect for guys whose face can handle the daily lashings of an electric shaver.  It&#x27;s also great for those who travel as it&#x27;s incredibly lightweight.  The razor is not particularly suited for tougher beards or those of us with sensitive skin.  I still use it twice weekly to shave the tricky areas around my nose and on my chin so I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor cuts.  Other than that my skin isn&#x27;t cut out for the Philips Norelco 6945 Cordless Razor.  No pun intended.</li>
    <li> This a perfectly decent cordless razor. It shaves hair reasonably well and if all you are looking for is a serviceable bare minimum, you will be happy. However, this is really the bottom of the rung of the Norelco Razors and it is missing many little perks that seem to come standard on Electric Razors nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the charge on this Razor leaves a lot to be desired - you get 30 minutes of use time from 8 hours of charging! This compares very unfavorably to our older 8171 SpeedXL which not only gives you 50 minutes of shave time after an hour of charging but also has the ability to give you a quick top up charge in 3 minutes. Extremely useful if you are on the road and aren&#x27;t able to leave your razor plugged in for 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head on this razor does not do as good a job as the 8171 and the shave is nowhere near as close to the skin. The manual states that you skin will need to adjust to the razor. I found that a little ominous.  The replacement head for this razor is a HQ56 as opposed to the HQ8 or HQ9 that are on the slightly higher end Norelco razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is not waterproof and, even if you don&#x27;t shave in the shower, being able to pop the head open on the 817XL and clean it under running water is a big time saver. This razor requires a bit more energy to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer available on the higher end models is a really useful tool in trimming up your sideburns to give the shave a crips look, even if you don&#x27;t sport a moustache or beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the speed XL models are fairly pricey, the price between the different models of the basic Norelco razors is really not that much - the AT810 has many of the frills that the 8171 speedXL does and only cost $70 at the time of writing this review. If the Speed XL&#x27;s are out of your range I would take a chance on the AT810 instead of wasting my money on this extremely basic razor.</li>
    <li> I like this electric razor. It is very convenient to use. I felt comfortable when I use it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> shaved every day in Afghanistan well worth it</li>
    <li> Great raiser for the price no trimmer wish I looked at that before I purchase it</li>
    <li> I bought an electric razor because I was tired of getting cuts from my manual razor. I have gotten cuts every single time I&#x27;ve used this razor. Seriously. It&#x27;s a badly designed product, hard to clean, and I&#x27;m constantly getting ingrown hairs from it. DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver yet it&#x27;s kosher to use by orthodox jews.</li>
    <li> need to order new blades!  lol</li>
    <li> Husband likes it well enough, uses regularly, no complaints. Doesn&#x27;t rave about it.</li>
    <li> I have had many models ranging from $5 disposables to $140 Panasonic four stage water proof. this is by far the best shaver FOR ME. I do not shave wet, and shave often - which is the best fit for this device.&lt;br /&gt;when my beard gets long I use the Panasonic as this one will pull the hair, however when I only have a one or two day stuble this gives me a far closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is Okay (not lithium) so it lasts about one or two weeks, and there is no trimming tool which is fine with me (I have many). The cable is a little annoying but other than that its the perfect shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Another pro is the replacement head price - other devices heads alone cost almost double the price of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt; BTW I have extremely dense and rough Stubble, my face is like sand paper after one day - I have been using this for six months now and it still gives me a close shave - hence even if I have to pay $15 for new heads the old heads already paid for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are one circle. I have had a higher end Philips Norelco with triple lines in each circle, and this one is somehow better (the fancy model had holes instead of lines in the inner circles and it pulled my stubbles ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - this is one of those rare occasions where cheaper is better. but if you are on the go all the time I suggest you look for a similar model (the close shave heads like here) with a Lithium battery (and as I mentioned if you like to use the shaver in the shower... look elsewhere); but if you just look for a shaver that will give you a perfect close shave before a meeting look no further.</li>
    <li> I like it. And the price is suitebal. It is very comfutable to use it. But clean is too differecult.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  Didn&#x27;t get a close enough shave. Rather just use a regular razor.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase another, or recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it with a coupon. So I think it is a good buy. And it is used very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Daddy who is in an assisted living home.  I needed something he can do easily since he doesn&#x27;t have full range of motion of his arms.  He/we are all pleased with this razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this  Shaver for my son he is thrilled to pieces finds it an easy machine to use we recommend this very highly</li>
    <li> My friend recomman it to me. The price is lower than that in China. So I bought one. It worth. It is comfortable.</li>
    <li> This razor works well, including with or without a cord.  However, it does lack a beard trimmer, so if that is important to you then you should look for a more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for, no lies in the description, its a good product and arrive at the estimated time.</li>
    <li> The build quality is not as good as my previous Norelco razors. The heads seem to slap around more in the holders than in previous models and there is no pop-up trimmer on the back. It does provide a good shave for a low price.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.  Had one similar to the one and this one is the same quality as the previous Philips Norelco that I had.</li>
    <li> good shaver. I have owned several of the 3D flexhead shavers.. I bought them because I thought they were the best that norelco had to offer.. but I kept thinking that my old norelco was better - with less flexibility, I had better control and better shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and a few fixed head shavers. For me, they work better than the flex head 3D shavers</li>
    <li> This razor does not provide a smooth shave  as have previous Norelco shavers that I have owned In the past</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to the faster motor of the Norelco plug-in, but this little shaver gives a real nice shave. Perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> I think this is very good for me who are using manual razor all this time, and it is so fast and smooth.</li>
    <li> I prove it and i like it. Excellent!, quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this electric razor. Excellent service and timing also.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the price I paid. The only negative comment I have is that it makes my neck itch sometimes and this is when its clean and used rubbing alcohol on the electric razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor to replace my older 6940 corded razor that I bought in 2011. I really don&#x27;t need a cordless razor, but the 6945XL was around the same cost as I paid for the 6940. I figured that since the model number was a few steps up that it was a better model. NOT!&lt;br /&gt;This model is CHEAPLY constructed, doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer, and just doesn&#x27;t cut as good as my old razor. I guess I ended up paying for an expensive set of replacement blades for my old 6940. It&#x27;s a shame that you have such little choice between lower-end razors and upper-end razors. I recommend staying away from this model.</li>
    <li> first one I got was broke I got next one works good so far</li>
    <li> SIMPLE FOR MY HUSBAND TO USE---- CLEAN SHAVE</li>
    <li> a product that works as advertised.  useful to everyone and will be appreciated for it&#x27;s functionallity.  an item worth having.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that is the third one I buy, I gave it as a present, they works very good, blades last one year or more, very easy to clean. Battery last years and don&#x27;t have to recharge very often. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i vought this for my grandpa and he is so happy with it! now he doesnt cut himself! it very easy to use!! gonna buy one for my bf</li>
    <li> This razor is very nice indeed. It performs well in every way, and my husband is extremely pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift last year and it worked just perfect for my brother, so when it is on sale again, I get the other one.</li>
    <li> for this price , it &#x27;s good enough and really comfortable too.what else do you want?  if it could be anti-water, it will be better</li>
    <li> It is a bit more basic/weak than I fought but does the job. It is very light and feels as if it was hollow. I don&#x27;t like that the batteries takes 8 hours to recharge and there is no indication of charging completion. There is a little blue light saying charging. But it will not go off after the charging is complete. The batteries are NiCads so have all the memory effects associated with NiCads. Eight hours of charging for 30 minutes of use. Better off charging when the batteries are almost empty (to avoid memory effects where the batteries will not hold a full charge, so less than 30 minutes of use if you charge often before battery depletion is near). Overall the power of the razor when operated in battery mode leaves something to be desired. Gives the sensation of being underpowered when spinning the blades. But does the job with a little insistence around the beard/mustache surfaces. Operating with the cord plugged has significantly more power, but with the side effect that battery is charged often before depletion so it will show memory effects and not last long. Overall works reasonably well for the price. But I was disappointed to see about same/lower price at local stores and the fact that it does not have a sideburn trimmer (which was not advertised but still). Also the local sot ores have a similar model which last for 35 minutes instead of 30 minutes on battery.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD COMMODITY, JUST AS WHAT I EXPECTED, AND WITH LOWER PRICE. IN A WORD, IT IS A CERY GOOD DEAL.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t put under faucet to wash heads--didn&#x27;t see this information when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;No trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to not leave plugged in-not good if you are forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;My prior Norelco could be left plugged in, had a trimmer, and could be rinsed in the faucet.</li>
    <li> I had an older Norelco that got to the point where it would simply stop when I applied it to my beard, even with a full charge. I had replaced the cutting heads so I knew it had to be the motor at fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this new Norelco, I was delighted to find it can use exactly the same cutting heads, and even the same cutting head holder as the older unit. It is lighter in weight, quieter and charges faster than my old machine. Even the on-off switch is improved, sliding much easier than the one on my old electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASE NORELCO RAZORS AS THEY DELIVER THE PERFORMANCE THAT I LOOK FOR.  HAVE USED NORELCO THROUGH THE YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPOINTED.</li>
    <li> The package was dropped in the front door on stairs, and who&#x27;s responsibility for the item if someone take it? I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Liked it a lot. Have always used Norelco razors. Only disappointment was that it did not have sideburn trimmer. Other than that it was excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver for the $$.  The motor seems to run a little slow, but it gives a pretty good shave and it certainly didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> Light Weight and does a wonderful job.  Glad we purchased this item. First electric razor in a long long time.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my dad. He loves it much! I may order one for my brother next year.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about a year now and I like using it rather then a blade. The battery stays charged for several shaves (since I forget and leave it sitting in the bathroom after I shave, I don&#x27;t have a plug in the bathroom that works with the light turned out). It gives a close shave so long as you use it daily, if you wait a day or two you&#x27;ll be basically shaving twice with a lot of pulling on the longer beard. So use it daily or keep a bladed razor for those days when you have gone au naturel a few days for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I used Norelco since the 1960s and while the heads are always great, the batteries had problems a few years back with the switch from Ni-cad.  This model seems to have solved the problems as it runs at a very good speed.  I tore the thing apart and the parts, battery, and electronics are good.  Workmanship and assembly look top notch and I would bet you get tired of it long before it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, if you have an old 6940, the trimmer parts are interchangeable and it is a pretty simple matter to swap out the original parts to convert this model to the trimmer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works with the older HQ55 heads as well as the HQ56 versions and amazingly, uses the good old fashioned cord from the original models, without the external transformer issues from some 7000 and 8000 series models.  However, the heads that come with it are a much cheaper version called \\&quot;CloseCut\\&quot;.  I haven&#x27;t seen these anywhere for sale separately, and I would guess they are cutting costs like the printer people do when selling a printer with a partly filled cartridge.  The CloseCut heads DO NOT have Lift and Cut which has been a standard since the ancient HQ3 heads from 40 years ago.  I have a set of HQ56 heads and these are not the same at all.  So don&#x27;t judge the quality of the shave from the cheaper blades.  Lift and Cut makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the above listings are wrong.  This has a NiMH rather than Lithium Ion battery (no big deal) and it is not from the Netherlands; it is made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have found that the battery dies off rather fast and as it does the speed of rotation slows down as well.  After just 2 shaves, I can clearly hear the difference and after 4-5 shaves it is unusable and needs a charge.  Ni-Cad batteries never had this problem.  I have to assume that the newer batteries are just not suitable for driving motors at a constant speed without better circuitry, especially when they try to get by with a single battery (Norelcos in the good old Ni-Cad days used 2 batteries).  I suppose that charging this thing every three days would solve the problem, but I just plan to use it with a cord.</li>
    <li> far superior to a Remington rotary, this is the best shaver on the planet, Norelco makes the finest shaver. Period</li>
    <li> After surgery, I was required to return to an electric Razor.  I hadn&#x27;t used an electric razor in about 20 years and wasn&#x27;t looking forward to having to use an electric razor.  I was really surprised to how good an electric razor was and I was completely satisfied with my Norelco Razor.  The shave was as close as my blade razor and was much easier to accomplish.  I have retired my blade razor as I am getting a close shave without all requirements of a blade shave.</li>
    <li> I purchase this as a Christmas present for myself.  Merry Christmas to me!!&lt;br /&gt;The one time I used it, it worked excellent! I did buy it to save time on shaving my head.. and it didn&#x27;t really do that.. in fact, it took me longer.  On the other hand though, I much fewer nicks, so it was definitely making for a much more enjoyable experience!&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice though.. when taking apart the head to clean it, DO NOT do so over a toilet. Apparently the blades come apart in multiple pieces (for better cleaning I assume).&lt;br /&gt;So yeah.. when I took it apart and flipped it upside down to shake the hair out of it, that was the last she wrote of the Philips Norelco 6945XL Electric Razor.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to picking on up for myself on my birthday to replace this one though as that experience has spoiled me!!</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and can only get a real wet shave in about once every seven or eight days. This is really helpful and for such a great price - you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve used it three times in the two weeks since I got it delivered and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. Easily one of my top purchases of the year.</li>
    <li> Economical, lightweight and gets the job done. I am not a very hairy guy, but generally do shave daily. This Norelco is saves me time and makes me do a quick shave when I otherwise might not.</li>
    <li> my husband lovessss this thing he is so glad to be finishhed with manual razors and literally uses it two to three times daily JUST BECAUSE he is happy to be able to get such smooth skin wit hhis shave.</li>
    <li> very nice~ola~&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very affordable and very easy to use.I&#x27;m so happye to buy this one!&lt;br /&gt;I think I will buy things often!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver - shaves close, is quiet, is fast - what more can I say! three more words</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this razor and I love the feel of his face :-)</li>
    <li> It feels really cheap when I hold, but it cuts pretty well for not spending over 100 bucks for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> The Razor was defective so I returned it. I was disappointed because it was a Christmas gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> good razor, holds a good charge,OK ,OK, OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK. what else to say? good product. black. cuts in circles. my head is oval.</li>
    <li> good cheap razor, but it gives me irriation on my neck if I try to get close.&lt;br /&gt;Will use it for light touch up work after wetshaving, but will not use primarily on its own.</li>
    <li> I had a higher end Norelco shaver for years and until recently, always got a &amp;#34;close as a razor&amp;#34; shave. For the price of new shaving heads, I decided to chuck the shaver and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will just not shave close. You are always left with stubble you can feel. If you want something reasonably close, you have to spend 5+ minutes going over the same areas over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my old shaver, the recommendation for this shaver is to not use it while plugged in. I don&#x27;t understand that restriction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation for charging if 8 hours. Why? Plus, there is no indication that charging is complete. They couldn&#x27;t make the light blink like my old shaver. My old shaver charged in one hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I tossed my old shaver and I probably am going to return this product.</li>
    <li> An excellent close-cutting razor and bargain-priced.  Only thing missing from this model is the lack of a sideburn trimmer, but another model is available.  Shaves very closely and without irritating the skin.</li>
    <li> This did not work well at all Not for my husband. didn&#x27;t give him that close shave he was looking for.Not for my husband.</li>
    <li> this shaver was great I got it for a xmas gift for my boyfriend he love it and it works great</li>
    <li> Charging it is a razor, the philips brand is trustworthy, beard clean shaven for me, in general it is a fast, convenient and reliable quality of the razor</li>
    <li> This shaver will not win any awards for power, if you have a heavy beard, you may not find it strong enough. but for myself it works well enough. I have not used it enough to comment on battery life. it has given me a pretty good shave the few times I have used it though. considering its price it is defenitly worth the price I paid THANKS AMAZON...</li>
    <li> definitely takes a while to get used too... and it does not cut as fast as i&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> great item.  exactly as described</li>
    <li> Great performance for not a lot of money! Stays changed a very long time and shave is very close and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this Razor for my boyfriend, for Christmas.  The price was right and boyfriend uses it every day, so think he likes it.. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old-school and personally think electric shavers in general are a perfect example of planned Obsolescence.  The batteries go dead or the heads/blades are so expensive you end up just throwing them away and buying something else.  If I could still get new heads for it, I&#x27;d continue to use my dad&#x27;s old Norelco from the 70&#x27;s.  It shaves me fine with power from an outlet and the heads seem to spin way faster than these newer battery-powered models.  Plus lots of things like this just aren&#x27;t built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to reviewing this shaver.  It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard or if you shave every day.  If you go even two days such as a weekend without shaving, it&#x27;s going to be like trying to cut wet grass with a lawn mower.  Not too great.</li>
    <li> If you are not picky and have a beard that isn&#x27;t too tough, this will probably do for you but you might have to shave again at noon.  Takes a bit to find a method to remove the beard more like scrubbing across your face so if your skin is sensitive you may end up with an itchy area.  However, the cost is very low and it is easy to clean out.  Plus either a battery or A/C use is good.  Bottom line it equals the price you pay to buy one.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t notice the fact that it didn&#x27;t have a trimmer or i would have bought something else, but the price was right so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
    <li> My husband hates this razor. He&#x27;s always used Norelco, but this one takes him forever, it doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave and it is difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Looking at the price of these I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I ordered them thinking they would leave some light stubble, which I&#x27;m fine with. After using them, I was impressed at how close the shave was, almost like using a razor. One thing I would say is that you should look for a different model if you have thick facial hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor for my friend. He said that it is good enough for the payment. and it works well</li>
    <li> excellenr for the price,cheaper than replacing heads,close enough shave price point very affordable,ordered $100 blades online,best shave for me love a good hot lather shave,got the brush at amazon</li>
    <li> The consumer reviews were right when they said how close the razor cut.  With the price of this it was cheaper to buy the razor and not replace my heads from my other norelco razor.  The only drawback is not having a trimmer but my other norelco takes care of that. I am truly impressed with how close this razor shaves. It by far outshaves my norelco model 7340 XL as far as closeness.  This is my 4th norelco because of durability.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver with low price!! I got this to replace my old old (15-20 years old) Philips  shaver, and just like my old one at his young age,, it works great!!</li>
    <li> Good product, especially given the price. Work well. Of course the appearance is not as great as the spendy one.</li>
    <li> It was not new stuff they provided</li>
    <li> Got a great price on it,works great,no problems.</li>
    <li> Highly rated,  almost bought it at Kohls,  glad I didn&#x27;t as it was $90. Gotta love amazon. For less than $40 bucks,  it can&#x27;t be bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for several months now and it does a great job while for the price.  Hard to find a nice cheap electric cordless razor for the price.</li>
    <li> It has no trimmer or indicator to charge or charge complete. Considering the low price it does give a close comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Works very well and gentle to the skin.  The price is also very attractive.  If the manufacturer can add a small brush for clean up purpose that will be perfect.</li>
    <li> simple to use easy to maintain somtimes less is better hope you  can keep it at an afordable price JK</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never liked an electric razor because they didn&#x27;t get close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t tried one in years so I gave it a shot since the price was right with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts close even when using dry.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco electric razor when I was a kid and it lasted 15 years before giving up the ghost. I have had this for several months and i t does a great job.  I am happy with this</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery! Can&#x27;t  really  say much about performance  since I ordered this for an elderly  man in the  nursing  home  where  I  work. He uses it independently and it does the job as far as I know. Without knowing  more I didn&#x27;t  feel  I could give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> ANOTHER GOOD PURCHASE!</li>
    <li> It works fine. It&#x27;s very basic, no bells or whistles and kind of low-powered. For the price it is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This is a very basic electric shaver. Basic as in no frills what-so-ever. The only real feature to speak of is that it&#x27;s rechargeable. I hadn&#x27;t used an Norelco electric razor in many years. The last one I had borrowed from a friend, and the blades were dull. I vividly remember it feeling like it was pulling the hairs out rather than cut them. So I bought this with a little bit of trepidation. But I figured with the coupon, it&#x27;s actually cost about what a pack of refills cost for my blade razor, plus I wouldn&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no trimmer - never used it on the Braun I had years ago anyway, so didn&#x27;t miss it. And it doesn&#x27;t have the upgrade features like swivel head (I can turn my hand). Not sure what &amp;#34;comfort cut&amp;#34; is do I don&#x27;t miss that either. Likewise for the other 2 &amp;#34;cutting systems&amp;#34;. The one thing I think I could use that this doesn&#x27;t have is being water (or shaving cream) proof. I think I&#x27;d like it even more. I know I just said I like not buying shaving cream. But the one downside of every electric razor I&#x27;ve tried is that they work best if you shave everyday. They do better with short stubble over longer hairs. And I really prefer not to shave on weekends if I can. Come Monday, that first shave seems to take a long time. I&#x27;m thinking (just a guess really) that being able to use in the shower or with shaving cream would make Monday mornings a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re debating about a shaver, this is a great way to try one out, especially if the coupon is still on.</li>
    <li> In this price range it&#x27;s one of the best electric razors . I woks well and does it&#x27;s work .</li>
    <li> Something very good, with coupons, very good value, and I love it.The next will come back to buy bath just sound big</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old Brown brand. Though initially I was kind of doubtful because the price was too good. But it turned out to be an excellent choice. It shaves well, much better than my old Brown.</li>
    <li> I think this product worth its deals. I used my razor just once. Just like it. Hope it can be in good condition in future.</li>
    <li> This is the lower end Razor with rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally satisfied with it. Bought several as simple gifts for friends.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Basic rotary razor no trimmer. Gives a good shave with minimal iratation at very competative price. Plus bonus of free shiping.</li>
    <li> Just what he wanted and for less than local purchase. We love online shopping.  Finding the right item at the right price is great.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and he love it! it&#x27;s very useful and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my Dad, and he&#x27;s pretty happy about it. Quickest shave he&#x27;s had in years. Heck, its pretty affordable too! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and It does the job .The only thing I wish it had was a sideburn trimmer.I have always used Norelco and have never been disappointed. I would recommend this to anyone and the price was right.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have purchased.  Shaves very close and very quite.  Charge lasts about 1 hour.  Would recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> not very good at cutting light growth no trimmer</li>
    <li> VERY VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT I AM IN INJOYING THIS VERY VERY VERY  VERY MUCH  HAVE A GREAT DAY/WEEK</li>
    <li> Merry Christmas to my hubby!  I purchased this for my hubby for Christmas &amp; he was/is thrilled.  It was a replacement for a similar Norelco model.  He is very happy with it, does a nice job on his face, gentle on his skin, does a nice job around the ears also.  Happy with it, and with the price I was able to pay for it.</li>
    <li> Shaver gives a clean close cut.  Only draw back, there is no sideburns clipper.  Overall, a great shaver for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fact, this razor was not that much more than the replacement heads for my old one - duh. It don&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles, but it &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Every few years I succumb to the advertising and buy one of these.  I can confirm, electric razors still suck compared to a blade.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 6945 electric razor is a bare-bones electric razor that delivers a close shave at a reasonable price. For that point, I give it 4-stars. There are limitations, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objective in getting an electric shaver was to cutback the need for those expensive replacement disposable blades for my traditional shaver. Because the Philips Norelco 6945 doesn&#x27;t have a flip-up trimmer for sideburns, however, I still need to use my traditional razor every couple of days to keep them neat. That&#x27;s not a big deal, but it is worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco 6945 electric razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Low cost&lt;br /&gt;* Provides a close shave&lt;br /&gt;* Light-weight&lt;br /&gt;* Long battery life: a couple of weeks per charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* No flip-up trimmer for sideburns&lt;br /&gt;* The head must be removed and then cleaned using a brush&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is not waterproof -- makes cleaning a bit harder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, for the price, the Philips Norelco 6945 electric razor delivers what I need: A close shave that is fast and convenient. A very good emergency razor or one you keep in your travel bag, in your car, at your vacation home... etc.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver.  I never tried one before because I am not a very hairy guy, and I didn&#x27;t think my every other day or three shaving style needed a more expensive habit.  I am, however, very lazy about such things.  I used to just dry shave, but later used a kind of dry face wash instead of shaving cream because it was more comfortable.  It&#x27;s the ease of use (i.e. - the ability to be lazy) that made me really love this thing after just a few uses, although I waited about a month to do the review because the manual urges you to give it a 21-day try to overcome any sensitivity you might have to a new shaving style (which wasn&#x27;t an issue for me, btw).  Indeed, assuming my face is recently washed, it really only takes a few seconds to get a shave.  A few passes make me mostly presentable, and a few more give me as good of a shave as I&#x27;ve gotten with any type of razor (from 1 to 5 blades).  And it&#x27;s more comfortable.  My one concern was that I have two small moles in my shaving area - not large enough that I think anyone even recognizes I have them, but just barely raised so that I&#x27;ve occasionally hacked into them with a razor, which is always a nasty mess.  I am happy to report that my Norelco has not caused them any damage or discomfort.  It will take some minor maintenance, and they want you to spend ~$25 on a blade change every year (although I will change mine far less), and you might feel compelled to buy a new razor instead after a couple of years, as the battery is NiMh, likely to develop a memory before too many years.  I am grateful for the battery, though.  It would be awesome if the cleaning brush could fit in an on-board compartment, and were I buying now, I might consider the model above this one that has an integrated straight-shaver.  Thankfully for travelling, there is no AC adapter - just a curly (telephone handset style) cord that is said to accept dual voltage.  I&#x27;ve heard some shavers can charge off 12V DC, so I&#x27;d like to see a model, if possible, that can charge via USB to further reduce the amount of cables I have to travel with.  All that said, I&#x27;d recommend this shaver as a good quality, reasonably priced product.  I like mine!</li>
    <li> I have had the expensive norelcos and the cheap norelcos.  This is the cheap Norelco and honestly I don&#x27;t find any difference from the expensive ones with the swivel head.  It has no trimmer but I don&#x27;t use that anyway.  I also don&#x27;t wet shave which this does not do.</li>
    <li> The item is good but I lost the charger few days ago and when I tried to get the replacement for the charger, they were pretty expensive.</li>
    <li> i gave this to my 18 year old grandson who is quite pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt; he appreciated his birthday/graduation gift.</li>
    <li> I have always liked and used Norelco razors since the military.  I thought the ones that were made in Holland were better, but since Norelco sold to Phillips they are now made in China...........so what&#x27;s new!!  That being said, this is actually a nice razor with smooth and close shaves.  The price was better than I had always purchased Norelco&#x27;s before, so I will be able to buy another one for almost the price of replacement blades in about a year.  Build quality is not bad, feels right in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job either plugged in, or rechargeable.  I like it, and if you have used Norelco&#x27;s in the past, I have a feeling you will too.......</li>
    <li> This is simple, Phillips manufactures the best electric razors on the market, those are well priced, durable, very handle and easy to use, and gives you the closer shave without much irritation. Choosing one or another depends mainly in the way you use it, dry or wet shave, constant traveling or just home use, full shave with trimmer or just the razors, etc. I can only suggest use those models with the flexible heads because they will adapt better to the contours of your face. Don´t think twice, Phillips razors are the best choice.</li>
    <li> it can cut my hair even,,and i cant find any black hair in my head after using it, so it is very useful for me</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because it is cheap.  I regret when I received it.  It is base function only with a very weak power, do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco for many years and my old one was worn out. This replacement works fine, Great serbice from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves good until the heads become dull. Which usually occurs within the 1st year. Unfortunately, replacement cost of the head almost equals cost of complete razor and heads if on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would comment on a money saving solution to this problem which has worked for me. It involves reverting to the old shaver technology prior to floating heads. Many of us have had the older norelco shavers. I first watched a traveling guy who would go to towns and \\&quot;tune up\\&quot; their old norelco shavers. This consisted of light removing of hairs and a drop of oil along with the most important task of sharpening the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did he do it? Quite simply by pressing the metal screen against a hairless finger tip or palm of this hand. Now you just need to apply this to your shaver. But wait. You have a floating head which prevents the force needed to push metal against metal (screen and rotating shavers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: Remove the plastic that isolates the 3 heads, rinse in water, dry, apply glue of choice (I used cyanoacrylate) and then I waited 30 minutes and reinserted into shaver. This prevents the heads from moving much. Next turn on the shaver and apply finger pressure to one head at a time. After a few minutes all 3 heads are close to as sharp as new and your finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is a risk and your walk may not end as well as mine. Hope you have a good journey and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If I were a manufacturer of shavers. Putting in floating heads to prevent sharpening while flaunting the virtues of going around facial obstacles with less chance of nicking skin is and was a brilliant idea.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my husband as Christmas gift. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Great value and performs very well.  Smooth operation, easy to clean and complete with case, brush and shaver head cover.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. He says it works nicely, which was nice for me because I got this product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> When I first used this razor, it was so quiet that I thought it wasn&#x27;t working.  My second thought was that it was so comfortable it obviously wasn&#x27;t shaving my face.  I was wrong on both counts and found this to be the quietest, most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> The razor is a simple shaver. Don&#x27;t expect a trimming attachment or being able to run the razor without a charge and just use the power cord--it must be charged. The cut is close and outstanding. If your looking for a trimming attachment I would suggest you just get a full grooming kit as that works much better than a shaver attachment anyway. If your looking for a razor to give you a close shave that won&#x27;t tear your face up in the process, then this razor is perfect. I think the Norelco brand has always produced quality products and this razor proves the legacy of quality continues within the company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Norelco shaver user, and recently the shaver I&#x27;d been using for approximately 7 years gave up the ghost.  I shopped Amazon, got an amazing deal (much better than any of the local discount stores), and within 24 hours had a brand new razor!  Interestingly, this is the 4th week I&#x27;ve used it and I have yet to recharge the battery!  I&#x27;m not only super-pleased with my new Norelco but also REALLY super-pleased with the great service I received from Amazon.  Thanks!  And keep up the good work![[ASIN:B006GQYSDC Philips Norelco 6945 Cordless Razor, Black/Grey]]</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as spare to have handy in case my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; isn&#x27;t fully charged, and I&#x27;m in a mad rush out the door. Well it came in handy! and boy was I surprised! I was a bit concerned since it was a \\&quot;downgrade\\&quot; from the regular Norelco lift and cut shaving system (this shaver has no lifts and cuts) - but hey, it gives a great shave!! I now suggest to all my buddies to always have a spare shaver, and for this price tag, it&#x27;s not that big of an investment to be on the safe side. price is right, and shave is close - in short, a inexpensive shaver that gives a nice shave, without the whistles and bells!!</li>
    <li> It works great for my husband</li>
    <li> This product satified my needs</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day, not because his old one was broken, but because when we travel we have had problems in the past finding an outlet that was convenient to plug the old one in.  This razor is absolutlely amazing.  It holds a charge for a long time and now we don&#x27;t worry about where the outlets are!  We love it.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it to be.  The price was very competitive.  I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> My new Phillips razor does as nice a job as any phillips razor that I have owned and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I only had it for 2 weeks, I thought I ordered the wired model, but as it turns out, works without AC attachment since the battery hold the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic shave is very good, much quieter and more efficient than older Norelco.  I was going to just replace the head unit, but turns out this model is cheaper.  No regrets at all.</li>
    <li> I just got this razor and already it&#x27;s fallen apart. It&#x27;s a good thing that I don&#x27;t mind fiddling around with things; it went right back together. I do have to rather careful with it though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He said he liked the coiled cord. The razor works well and the price was right.</li>
    <li> i like it it is very nice .very well.a good gift to my friend.it is really very good.the item is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought it for 22$ (it was 50% off), and it worth it with this price, but I think its blades are pretty expensive, but I am looking for a good deal also :-)</li>
    <li> i like it . this product doesnt have &amp;#34;back trimmer&amp;#34; for that i didn&#x27;t give to him  five stars s!</li>
    <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for more than 40 years and this one is by far the cheapest quality i have ever seen in one  of their products, BUT that said, even though it doesn&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer and the head isn&#x27;t a tight fit, it works flawlessly. Because it is so cheaply constructed i would imagine it will have to be replaced in probably 2.5 years plus 2 days (and yes, 2 1/2 years is the warranty length. I would recommend this razor to anyone who want a nice close shave and is willing to recognize that this razor is more like a Yugo than a Mercedes. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I should have known from the price that it was muh less than I expected. Does not have a pop-out trimmer. Could not tell that from the product description.  I will give it away, unused.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son... it was his first shaver and does everything he needs for a shaver.  I like the sideburn trimmer and how portable everything is...  I would recommend this as anyones first shaver on a tight budget!</li>
    <li> For the last 20 years I&#x27;ve used the Norelco  electric razors , and this one was no disappointment either . Because my face was used to the old Norelco razor it was easy for my face to adjust to this new one . I was really pleased at the delivery time and the super price I got . I give the seller and razor  the highest star rating . Thanks for the opertunity  to make this statement</li>
    <li> $18 plus tax for CA resident. Shaves close and quite comfortable. Hold charge for a long time. Not foe wet application and not washable. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> The head is loose, does not do a closes shave. The built is cheap.It fails the Philips Norelco quality and reputaation.</li>
    <li> does everything it says it should do...good product at a good price and very easy to use...my foster son has no problem using it</li>
    <li> I try several brand names including Norelco in the past. In my opinion, no one can beat Norelco so far. This&#x27;s my 3rd Norelco, the cheapest one. But, it&#x27;s working fine like other two. Why not to get the brand Razor every a couple of years w/ the similar price for replacement of blades only?</li>
    <li> Great service in receiving product quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I got this razor for my wife and she loves it. It does a close job with great comfort, This razor is not just for men. It works great on knobby knees and underarms.</li>
    <li> My son love this gift and began using it the day he opened the package. Very good gift. A huge success.</li>
    <li> I still use the regular old-fashioned twin blade razor, and shaving cream method at home. But I wanted to have an electric razor I could use for work and when I travel. This was perfect for what I needed it for and at a inexpencive price.</li>
    <li> Recomiendo fielmente esta maquina, representa una buena afeitada, comoda en el manejo, facil limpieza, buen estilo muy completa...Solo le faltaria un buen estuche para cargarla en momentos de viaje....excelente articulo....</li>
    <li> SOme bad things were said on another site about this razor...this was probably due to the low price.  I bought this for my son (30yrs old) so he would not have ANY excuses for not shaving..&lt;br /&gt;He tells me he likes it.  Good enough for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED as a basic razor..</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for some times. should have spent another $10 for a Norelco. Shaves ok by you have to keep going over the same areas.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean shave for an elderly man who has to be shaved by his daughters.  We just have problems getting close under his nose.</li>
    <li> the power is sorely lacking. it might be able to handle a baby&#x27;s butt but not much more. it is has an awkward feel in the hands. i got mine for under18 at amzn, so at that price i will keep it as a back up or afternoon touch-up. but at any price above that, it is an insult to norelco and the user.</li>
    <li> A couple of notes: this razor is identical to a newer branded \\&quot;6945/XL\\&quot; which is what mine actually came labeled. Also, I paid $22 at the time ($28 now as of this writing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at the $28, it&#x27;s a good, budget shaver that will get the job done. If you are expecting a shaver you can use in the shower and that gets as close as a blade in one pass - look elsewhere. Also, don&#x27;t look at $28 razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a few negative reviews have noted, it isn&#x27;t the most powerful or aggressive razor, but I was impressed considering the staggeringly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update [12/2013]: Still going strong on the original blades. I typically only shave above twice a week because I&#x27;m lazy about it, but still working fine. I can&#x27;t imagine how much I would have spent on replacement blades for my old Sensor in this amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I now see this available in many brick-and-mortar stores for the same price as Amazon if you don&#x27;t want to wait for it.</li>
    <li> I cost $17.5,so cheap it is,I belive the Brand，Philips is a great Brand,and it accompany me more than 5 years.</li>
    <li> It will make a great gift to my uncle.it looks great in a very reasonable price,I may get another one for my dad if this works well for my uncle.</li>
    <li> Cannot rinse with water, no side trimmer, feels cheap plasitc when you hold it, Spend little more to get better model.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as always from Norelco. Quieter than most. Well constructed. Long battery charge. Can be run plugged in and power cord serves as charger.</li>
    <li> Ordered a Norelco for my brother because he had one for years.  This is a very cheap shaver.  Within 2 weeks after Christmas, it broke.  Only 1 of the 3 heads turns and it makes a loud noise.  Since my brother is disabled I shave him every morning.  We did not drop the shaver or press too hard or in any way damage the shaver.  In comparison to the other Norelco&#x27;s we have had, it is ligher plastic and the pieces do not fit together as well.  I have tried to return this item but I threw out the box with the other Christmas boxes.  I would not recommend this shaver and, especially if they do not accept my return, I would not recommend buying a shaver online.</li>
    <li> Bought the 6945 for an inexpensive backup to my 3 yr old Artic. Have used Norelco shavers for 20 yrs  and they shave well and run indefinitely. I was surprised to discover NO trimmer. Buy the next model up.</li>
    <li> I would give this razor 5 stars, but it does not come with a triming blade. It may have been in the description, I don&#x27;t remember seing it. The razor works great,nice close shave, but not haveing a way to trim my sideburns with the razor is a pain. I would  buy a better razor with a trimmer, if I did it over again. I will live with it,not worth returning.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the worst electric razor I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got cut all over my face and neck from attempting to use it.&lt;br /&gt;A complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Zero out of ten is my review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to using my old reliable Braun and throwing this in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have believed the other reviews on this razor. They were right, Useless junk.&lt;br /&gt;?</li>
    <li> Got another as a gift so I didn&#x27;t need this one.  However, it was a good weight for the razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at the quality of this razor given is under $30 price. It rivals my costly razor before it. Only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this gift, it is really good, at a cheap price, 20 us dollars. It can clean my .. in a clean way</li>
    <li> For the price, I was not expecting much but wanted to try an electric razor to see if I liked it better than using my straight edge everyday.  At first it did not give me as smooth a shave as I wanted but, the package said it would get smoother over time so I gave it a chance.  After using it for about a month, I am very happy with the results.  It comes real close to the same shave I use to get with my razor and is less messy and time consuming.  I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Women after hitting past 40 their faces start getting hair more pronounced on their chin and lower face area. So instead of using a razor I just use the philips norelco rotating heads. This clears off the peach fuzz and thicker hair in seconds.  I get the men&#x27;s shaver because it works better for the face. A man&#x27;s shaver is for the face and neck area.  I had bought a women&#x27;s shaver - it was only for the legs. It did not do a close shave as the man&#x27;s shaver. This is my 2nd one. The other one lasted over 5 years. Th rotary allows for no pinching or cutting on your face.  Why have it lasered off? I did once and 2 years later it grew back. This is an easy way to remove unwanted hair from face.</li>
    <li> good very good.&lt;br /&gt;dda dadf adfa dfasf adfadsf adfasdf adfasdf adfasdf adsfasdf adsfadsf adsfadsf  afsd fadf adf adf adf adsf</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR DOES A VERY GOOD JOB - WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANYONE&lt;br /&gt;IT IS VERY QUIET AND GIVES A NICE SMOOTH SHAVE</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. Just as described. Good buy thanks.</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco electric shavers since I began shaving over many decades.  My last one is still like brand new, but needs new heads.  I bought the new one because it is cordless and was cheaper new than at this time the heads.  Also, I have a summer lake house and needed another one.</li>
    <li> It is working very well for my husband!  After much reading of reviews and price matching this is what I gave him for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Basic razor.  Certainly not the weight and power of the older Norelco products.  Even with a full charge it seems to be lugging along.  Not sure how this one compares with the next ones up the totem pole.</li>
    <li> At first, I ordered Philips Norelco 1150X, and later cancelled it and ordered this one. I have to say I should not have changed my idea, this one is cheap, but when you use it , you know it just worth its price. My last razor bought in China at about 10 dollars feels better than this one.</li>
    <li> This razor is very nice. I am happy with its performance and it is very quiet. It keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor for reasonable price! My husband claims it is much better than he expected! It also shipped super fast, which is appreciated!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby and it arrived within a week and he really likes it.  It is also rechargeable so it is convenient for him to take on the go.</li>
    <li> My husband expected an inferior razor when I told him the price. He is pleasantly surprised with the close shave he is getting. He&#x27;s a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Got this for $17 and it works decently well.  I&#x27;ve learned it works best if I shave everyday.  When I get lazy it tends to pull on my hairs a bit which hurts some.</li>
    <li> This thing does a horrible job shaving facial hair. I have to run the shaver over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave which causes razor burn on my face. I bought it as an alternative to buying razors and shaving cream so often but it definitely is not a good alternative.</li>
    <li> Not very powerful , I dont have alot of facial hair and many 30ish dollar price range philips has been able to do a good job. This shaver soemtimes hesitates and I&#x27;ve noticed it does a slightly better job when plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the lack of the trimmer tool is unpleasant. Its a barging device but come on these things should be standard for tier 1 brand.</li>
    <li> It does the job, not more, not less. A little blade to design the beard would have been a plus.</li>
    <li> Used it for nearly a year and no problems.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the razor was both wall outlet and battery powered.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to friends or relatives.</li>
    <li> - Holds a long charge ( I usually need to charge it about maybe once after two weeks of continual use)&lt;br /&gt;-  Blades cut very decent&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean and replace blades if needed</li>
    <li> ..for teen. He thinks it&#x27;s fine. His expectations are low and his needs are minimal. The cord is a nice extra to have.</li>
    <li> We bought this as a Christmas gift to Dad and he says he likes it.  This was actually my mom&#x27;s idea.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with this Norelco and have had several previously that were much better. Barely holds a charge!</li>
    <li> Gives a close cut where my beard is even as expected but no my neck where the beard grows zigzag. Also, it cuts off on the uneven grounds, may be its just me. Overall, quite satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT NICE PRICE WORKS WELL.  YEAH  GLAD TO GET IT AND GOOD FOR BUDGET AND FILL MY EXPECTATION. SO GOOD .</li>
    <li> Not very powerful and does not have a pop up trimmer. Sufficient for a light beard but heavy growth may be problematic.</li>
    <li> I bough this norelco shaver because I had one that I loved but stopped working after almost 10 years of use. This one is even better than the older one. I use on my legs and it gives me a close shave every time. Better yet, I&#x27;m moving to Europe and I just found out that I will be able to use it there because it has automatic dual voltage. Yes!!</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby, he couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He use it everyday, works great on his chins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not as noise as the Brauns!</li>
    <li> It feels comfortable. I like it and its charge system is OK, but it does not work on 220v that I ignored.</li>
    <li> We purchased this several months ago, and so far it has kept working well.  There&#x27;s not much else to say about it, but it does its job and we have no complaints.</li>
    <li> the best price for an expensive item. the razor is excelent brand and functions. it is very resistant and great traveler mate!</li>
    <li> Although its not the most comfortable, this razor does the job and allows you to shed that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow each day.</li>
    <li> Very Cheap heads. feel like shaving with sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;Philips-Norelco refused to do anything about this razor when I contacted them</li>
    <li> I give it for a gift to a relative and he like it very much. Good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked OK initially but lost it&#x27;s sharpness after about a month.  It may need another better replacement head.</li>
    <li> First time in my life time i wasted $20. I cant believe Phillip Norelco could fix a cheap product that does nothing but vibrate.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace and older Norelco razor that I&#x27;ve used for over 20 years.  Every two or 3 years the batteries would no longer accept a charge and I&#x27;d replace them.  This way for about $7 more I&#x27;ve got a new razor.  Now I get to find out how long it takes to have the batteries run down in this one.  Right now this razor is great.  It&#x27;s starting on the third week of use on the first charge.  The old razor had to be plugged into the wall to shave for the past couple of months.  All in all I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and the only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a pop out side burn trimmer or height adjustment that the old razor had.</li>
    <li> A very good Value!&lt;br /&gt;I  have used this electric razor for over a month and have found it to be easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a satisfactory shave</li>
    <li> Got this for my 15 year old son.  His first razor.  So the price and quality are perfect for him.</li>
    <li> these shavers save you money on a long run. They are great for travel, even international as they work on dual voltage.</li>
    <li> for under $30 its a great razor and cordless too.  holds charge for 10 days and runs strong for 32 minutes of continual use.  I used it on me, for 2 weeks now its 4.25 staRS OUT OF 5 ITS JUST MISSING SOMETHING BUT ITS NEAR PERFECT</li>
    <li> the quality of the razor is decent. i would have preferred it to be of a more heavy duty material. but it&#x27;s great considering the price i paid for it.</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoyed having a great razor that shaved&lt;br /&gt;his whiskers so wonderfully!  He was really, really glad to have&lt;br /&gt;received it!</li>
    <li> It is quick and simple to use.  It gives a close shave.  It is nice not to have to use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> the price is cheaper than buying blades. i got one from another vendor $2 cheaper but i grabbed this one also. great shave. been using these all my life and don&#x27;t figure i need the $100 plus models. all ego.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone. It is unable to hold a charge for any reasonable length of time, and the blades felt less effective on my second shave. The price should have given me a clue - spend more and get something that doesn&#x27;t feel and work like a pretend razor.</li>
    <li> good performance and good price  very satisfied. the razor was smooth cutting  even on longer beard growth.a;nd battery life seems good.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas for my husband.  It was delivered on time and in good condition.  He uses it every day.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m familiar with two basic types of electric razor.  There&#x27;s the Braun type, with one or more horizontal foils with blades that move side to side, and there&#x27;s this type, with three heads with usually are somewhat mobile.  The Braun type shaves closer, but had more difficulty with long hair (that escape the screens) or thick hair.  This type of razor, instead, can shave very thick or long hair, but will not shave quite as close.  I often neglect to shave on weekends and I have extremely thick, curly facial hair.  For me, this type of razor is superior and more than worth the trade off.  In recent years, they&#x27;ve cleverly designed these heads to better match the contours of my face and somehow pull the hair up a bit when cutting, making the cut a little closer to the skin, but that tradeoff still exists.  If I use the Braun type, I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow until 9 pm.  If I use this razor, you can see it at 4-5 pm (of course, men have different beards).  This razor in particular is also pretty comfortable to use.  It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair so long as I shave at a reasonable pace.  I have quite a collection of electric razors... over a dozen, and this one competes very well, frankly only clearly surpassed by another Norelco.  Replacement blades for this brand are quite expensive.  [[ASIN:B004Q8I6LC Philips HQ56/50 Replacement Shaving Heads]]  Keep that in mind.  In my experience, you do need to change them every year, just as they say you do.  Battery life seems superior to the other cordless razors I have, perhaps due to the lower RPM of the motor.  After using an electric razor, always rub a little dab of lotion on your face.  This is especially true if you are switching from a conventional razor and your skin needs to adapt.  I miss the ability to rinse the razor in water and the lack of that trimmer function most razors have, but in all practicality, this razor offers a good shave at a good price.</li>
    <li> My husband who lives with Alzheimer&#x27;s Dementia resides in a secure facility.  He&#x27;s worn out several electric razors largely because he doesn&#x27;t clean them and care managers don&#x27;t think too.  And the other Philips Norelco razors have come apart during cleaning.  This one is perfect.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 6945 is a middle-of-the-road electric razor. To put it bluntly, you&#x27;ll neither get the cleanest nor closest shave from this razor, especially after a weekend of not shaving, but the convenience and low cost mean its well worth having around. For the past few years I&#x27;ve kept electric Norelco razors like these for the times when I&#x27;ve been in a rush (or just too lazy to lather up), and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of great use out of them. And since the blades need only to be replaced every 12 months, it&#x27;s not a big investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to what other reviewers have said, this razor is not very difficult to clean. Yes, it does require some effort, but most of the time you just need to pop the head off and toss the hair trimmings. About once a month or so it&#x27;s necessary to actually remove the individual blades. This can be a pain, but it&#x27;s really not difficult after you&#x27;ve done it once or twice (and it even comes with a tiny brush to help clean it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love and use electric razors often, I&#x27;d definitely suggest avoiding this particular model - invest in a more expensive one. But for anyone else, I think it&#x27;s definitely worth having around.</li>
    <li> I tried the 6945 and I must say it worked fine.  It wasn&#x27;t a spectacular shaver, but it did the job with a little finesse from myself.  My normal shaver for the last three years have been a Norelco Arcitec. Admittedly I have been spoiled.  With the 6945 I found myself moving my head around to get at spots that the Arcitec normally reaches.  This was the main difference for me between the two razors.  While the blades are flexible in the 6945, it just doesn&#x27;t pivot enough to match the range of my arcitec.  That&#x27;s what a couple hundred dollares more will get you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a basic entry level razor this work is very good.</li>
    <li> My husband has really thick hair so no electric razor really gives him a close shave. It had been awhile since he tried an electric razor and we found a good deal on this one with associated coupons so he figured he&#x27;d give it a try. It works to keep him straightened up in between his manual razor shaves, but doesn&#x27;t get a close, clean enough shave to be the only option.</li>
    <li> it is useful for most person.&lt;br /&gt;it owns basic function and best price.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is your best choice.</li>
    <li> The product is great. I have purchased it for my husband and he likes a lot.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I faced was unable to register the product.</li>
    <li> Great clean shave with no pinching or chaffing of the skin. I had to have it because of a heart attack and cannot use a hand razor for fear of nicking myself while on blood thinners. This razor does a great job on ladies legs and under arms as well. I am sure I will get good use of it for a very long time.</li>
    <li> while the shave is not as close as another brand it does a great job at removing those pesky soft hairs that the other brand wont get and it looks like the shave heads and foils will last a lot longer, overall well built.</li>
    <li> Does not shave well. Will have to return</li>
    <li> I bought 2 different models of Norelco last year, and filled up all forms for the rebate. Only the card was returned saying the rebate was not valid. I will never go for a deal with rebate . Be careful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact, quiet and efficient -- perfect!</li>
    <li> good close shave and and at very low price. I was happy to find Norelco finally made a new shaver without the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; and it still provides a great shave.  I would definitely reccomend this shaver .</li>
    <li> This razor shipped right away and was received in new condition. It was offered on a promotion and I was reluctant at first to order a razor that I had no experiece using in spite of the return policy.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly suggest reading the operation guide it comes with. It addresses best use and battery charging. I charged the battery for 8 hours as suggested and when I started to use it the razor sound was so low and slow I thought it was defective. After two full charges I am starting to believe that this normal. I am not sure what a reasonable time is to shave with it but after about 5-10 minutes it provides a pretty close shave and it gets better as your beard gets accustomed to the razor.</li>
    <li> There was no hair trimming feature - I have used Norelcos for decades - all have included this feature. The battery did NOT charge - Duh!</li>
    <li> It works well, and its price is attractive. I cannot tell any wrongs now, and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a shaver for awhile had a norelco back in 71 was okay did have the popup side burn trimmer. So saw this on Brads deals from Amazon used it once and never again selling it to a friend who likes Norelco shavers.Did not cut close and face felt irratated after use will go back to throw away shaver. May look @ another brand must be something better then this that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. Give it 3 weeks it&#x27;ll do the job like the instructions say. Im very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The razor is a very fair price and a good value. It is however missing a mustache trimmer. I got this for my husband and he used it once. He was happy with the results, but has not used it since because of the missing trimmer. It is a decent shave though for the money.</li>
    <li> The electric motor seems underpowered compared to my old Remington Electric Razor.  The Norelco&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my beard as close as I expected.</li>
    <li> I got this Norelco razor for almost half price.  It shaves close.  The battery life is not terribly long, so you would not want to use it unless you charged it.  Also, there are no trimming accessories.  It is a great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelcos for about 20 years and there always some improvements as I go along. This one is even esier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for years including several models of Remmington and Norelco.  This Norelco model 6945 is the best one yet.  It is quiet, shaves very close (nearly as close as a blade shave), and it does not require going over the same place on your face multiple times to get all the stubble down.  I can shave in about 1/2 the time using this razor as my previous Norelco model which probably should have had a head replacement quite a while ago so perhaps not a totally fair comparison.  I especially like that this model 6945 can be used either cordless or corded so it gives you maximum flexibility even if your batteries slow down during a shave.  It takes 8 hours to fully recharge which is sort of a long time, but you won&#x27;t be using it again most likely for another 24 hours anyway so paying a lot more for a model with faster recharge time does not seem necessary to me.  It is comfortable to grip, and light weight -- actually slightly lighter than my previous Norelco which was corded only with no battery.  The price is quite reasonable, especially since it was just a few dollars more than buying a replacement head for my old Norelco model, so I upgraded to a brand new shaver and added cordless cabability for very little money.  My shaver was missing the cleaning brush that was supposed to be included in the box, but I have several on hand already.  I supposed if I called Norelco they&#x27;d probably send me one.  Besides that one issue, I highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I needed a new blade for my older Norelco and bought this one for price. BUT, i missed the facts on my purchase and it does NOT have the trimmer on back.&lt;br /&gt;My bad, but it still shaves good!</li>
    <li> wish I had this years ago. cuts close and does not leave my skin burning. best buy at a great price</li>
    <li> Does philipe degenerates like that?&lt;br /&gt;10 years ago I bought a basis model of 2 heads from philipe, which I used for 10 years, it works still well.  It needs 2 AAA batteries which can be changed as I wish. The razor can make itself sharp, doesn&#x27;t need to change the head every year.&lt;br /&gt;The new one with a battery which can not be changed, 3 heads is crowned with each other, the hairs cut are hard to be removed, it is suggested to change the head every year.&lt;br /&gt;Any way, philipe is making something for a short term use.</li>
    <li> PROS: cost, quietness, long run time per charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: No trimmer, doesn&#x27;t cut very close, somewhat hard to disassemble and clean compared to my older Norelco.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t love it is because it doesn&#x27;t have the capability to trim up my sideburns. But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Its a pretty cool razor don&#x27;t get me wrong. I just would have to say it does an okay job. Maybe it is because it is my first electric razor and it leaves me wanting for more or what. I would say that it is a great pick-up for a spare/alternate for shaving. I did like that about it. I just find myself sometimes going over areas a few times. I don&#x27;t know but I just feel like it is an okay product and not something that is just calling me to purchase it on a whim. This would have to be complimentary to another shaver or alternate for when you are not able to use a blade. I do not recommend picking this up for a dedicated electric razor. You might be better off looking around first before you decide on this one, or unless you need something really cheap and a must need for that moment.</li>
    <li> this device does not have a clipper/trimmer i will have to buy a separate trimmer and i could have had both in one device/shaver</li>
    <li> My husband works out of town and it&#x27;s hard to remember to bring everything when he comes home so I bought this for one less thing to think about</li>
    <li> Good Quality.  But I feel  It doesn&#x27;t have enough power to a good shave.</li>
    <li> the only con portion is the cover of the blades.  It is quite tough to unopen it.  Any it is cheap and useful. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. It cuts whiskers very well. It gives a very smooth shave. I am going to purchase another to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome and quiet operation.  best one I ever bought so far. highly recommended, my wife didn&#x27;t even notice using while she was sleeping.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years and this has all of the features plus that I need.  I would recommend the product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a rotary electric shaver and I prefer it over the foil style which I have used which irritated my skin. With a freshly washed face it gives a fairly close shave good enough for ordinary purposes. Even reaches some areas more easily than twin-blades. Since it lacks a trimmer a blade shave is needed for a clean cut of sideburns. I was surprised at how slowly the rotors seem to cut with very quiet operation. But it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life between charges is at least 30 minutes as claimed. I have no idea how long the battery will last nor how long the blades will remain sharp. But since I can shave while drink coffee at my computer it is a nice break from the twin-blade routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean just by removing the blades and tapping lightly. Occasional brush cleaning is a good idea. The only minor quibble is that the blade cap fits a little loosely and jiggles slightly when shaving. Doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I returned this shaver  because I did not think it shaved very well compared to other shaves I currently use. it may be O.K. for someone else but not for me, I have a very heavy beard.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive that does a decent job this is it. Granted it&#x27;s not the best but you aren&#x27;t paying a whole lot like those other fancy brands. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It isn&#x27;t broken. It just doesn&#x27;t cut hair. I bought this for my son and I might as well have just thrown my money away. It doesn&#x27;t matter if he&#x27;s shaved in a week or just a day, this razor doesn&#x27;t work on his stubble no matter how long it is.  My husband has a 7617x and we would have bought another for my son if they still made them, but we went with this instead. Big mistake. The 7617x works like a charm on both my guys. We&#x27;re going to try the 730 and hope that one is better. I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting around to returning this 6945XL sooner. Now it&#x27;s too late to get my money back.  Boo!</li>
    <li> My son loved it.  Works well for the money.  Very happy with the product.  Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a razor.</li>
    <li> Does the job in shaving and has a long battery life. It would be nice if it had a trimmer though like most other bargain models have.</li>
    <li> Price goes like this.&lt;br /&gt;This product features the best price Philips line, there is little&lt;br /&gt;Make Select this if no features affordable.</li>
    <li> however the charging wire is too small in case you are runnning short of charging and you wana use it while charging.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great. It shaves much closer than my manual razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is also really easy to clean. Just a matter of popping off the shave head and washing it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it could shave around my chin better but i&#x27;m 125lbs so I have a pretty sharp jawline and cheekbones.</li>
    <li> Did not realize it didn&#x27;t have a pop up sideburn trimmer until I used it.  Disappointed I did not realize that when I ordered it although it does say that down towards the bottom of the description.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> This is really good one. Very confortable to use.</li>
    <li> Razor is great. Doesn&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the discription closer. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> At $28.00 or so it&#x27;s a good buy for the money conscious.  I don&#x27;t think the blades in the head are the same quality as the 60-80 dollar price ones.  It gets the job done but with not much comfort to the face.&lt;br /&gt;The battery holds a charge for at lease 10 days of use for me.  That&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 1 week now, have to say it is doing its job of shaving my facial hair. It can be angled to shave the jawbone area and neck without much difficulty.</li>
    <li> This is actually a darn good little razor - holds a charge all week long, provides a good close shave, and cleans easily. Light, and well-built.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver some time ago...it has worked well and continues. I use it to trim around a full beard...actually, I use the shaver part, I do not care for the pop-out trimmer.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;First year it worked fine but now charging battary not working I have to plug it to power and do shaving.</li>
    <li> This is the most basic of Norelco shavers, but works very well.  I have always found that it is cheaper to buy a new Norelco than a new set of cutting heads.  This one has no pop-up trimmer, but the shaver works very well and is the most comfortable Norelco that I&#x27;ve owned over the decades.  Great price...cheaper than new heads.  BTW, it will work as a corded shaver if the battery is low.</li>
    <li> Basically a replacement of a worn-out Norelco, this one is a great performer at a reasonable price.  Received within a week or ordering it.</li>
    <li> I went back to an electric razor after years of using BIC shavers. My medical condition got to the point where I can not stand at the bathroom sink and shave. So, my whiskers grew, of course. I saw this on Amazon and liked the brand and the price. Tried it and got a VERY close shave with no aggrevation. I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and a half now ... love it. I figure that if I only get a year&#x27;s use out it that amounts to about three bucks a month. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> just got this razor and i must say im very pleased with it. i had my last norelco 12 years.hoping for same life outa this one</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Would purchase again. It has worked flawlessly for almost a year now. Should have bought more.</li>
    <li> shaving heads were dull. I had to go to K-Mart and buy new heads before I could use it</li>
    <li> Does the job very well for me</li>
    <li> There are so many models of the Norelco electric razors that it is difficult to know what features are in a particular model.  I thought the one I ordered had a light to remind the user to charge the razor, but I found out it is simply a light to show that the razor is plugged in to be charged.  The cleaning of this model requires much more attention than is required by models of the razor which I used in the past.  Unfortunately, the consumer can&#x27;t handle the actual product or ask questions of a salesperson as in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic electric razor.  My beard is a bit tough, and I always get a better shave with a blade except when I have to go over the beard with an electric razor multiple times.  Doing that with this razor, provides a decent shave.  It holds a decent charge and works well.  No frills or fancy trimming attachments, just a good solid electric razor.</li>
    <li> This is bought for my friend, he said it&#x27;s good! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;The protector is also very well btw:)&lt;br /&gt;Shipping speed not so slow&lt;br /&gt;And the shaver is good</li>
    <li> This is the first kosher shaver out of the box since it is the first shaver made by Norelco/ Phillips in a long while that does not have the Lift &amp; Cut feature which needs to be removed to make the shaver kosher. This is according to the opinion of HaRav Dovid Feinstein and others.</li>
    <li> I never thought an electric razor could shave this close and so fast.  I had always used Braun until now, but I am sold on Norelco.  Great product and good price.</li>
    <li> This gives a really close shave with no irritation and charges up very quickly. The battery also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The plastic attachment for the blades broke  the first time I used it.  I did not abuse it as I only removed it after the first shave to clean it.  I carefully attached the blades and noticed the plastic had broken.  I didn&#x27;t find the broken part so I might have arrived like this.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This is very simple style, and no other functions, but that is simple but nice, I like it, and it is cheap.</li>
    <li> VSHIPPING WAS FAST.VERY NICE FOR THE PRICE.WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> Very good for the price. The only way to know when you are out of battery is when it stops working.</li>
    <li> Does not have all the bells and whistles, but a great value for the money! I like Norelco products. k</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my brother, he keeps his head shaved, to replace his disposable razors. He likes it.</li>
    <li> great price .They are good looking and great qualities.I will use them as gifts for my friends.good luck.Hope have a better case for them next time</li>
    <li> This unit appears to be an update to the older, corded 6423 LC. The older model has a beard trimmer which this unit is missing but makes up for by being battery powered. The heads (HQ56) are backwards compatible with the older model.</li>
    <li> Lightweight &amp; barebones for sure but I purchased this to use at one location (I&#x27;m spending time sleeping at 2 different houses.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the trick so I do not have to carry my main razor back &amp; forth between locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the smoothest/closest shaves available but so far no complaints for a ~$20 razor after ~2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If I did not have a dedicated straight trimmer to use at this location I would not have opted to get this.  That IS something pretty essential to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Venezuela live good morning good quality product widely recominedo,  the product verna promocionan.comprelo and quality. see you later ok. good night</li>
    <li> This is a great razor for the price. I didn&#x27;t need all the fancy features just a good razor. This is the one.</li>
    <li> It shaves me smoothly and it is very lightweight - great for traveling. I have noticed that my beard seems to be noticeable a little sooner with this razor than with my previous more expensive Norelco.</li>
    <li> I am african american male  i waited a few weeks before i wrote this review basically its a good razor for the price but it doesnt give me the clean cut i need without pressing hard in my fgace whic results in razor bumps for african americans probably going to nee some with a little more juice</li>
    <li> she was very helpful to me with submit my order.this is very good quality.i love philips razor.it is working very smoothly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price and acceptable in an emergency but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a primary shaver. As the title says, the head moves. Unlike other Norelco shavers which have a spring to keep tension on the cutter assembly head, this model does not. When you move the shaver, the head will move back and forth like it&#x27;s not fully secured.</li>
    <li> after charging for the amount of time it stated, went to use it and it barely shaved, left a lot of hair behind and felt it was tugging at the hair at times. Not worth the money I paid for it. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I expect it to last for many years as all previous ones have done that. Good purchase</li>
    <li> I do not know what Philips call close shave. It does not give you even close to smooth shave. They have 45 days return policy but say that use it 7-8 weeks so that your skin will be used of it and then It will give you close shave. If you are not very frequent shaver, you will spend 45 days to make it used of your skin.</li>
    <li> Overall experience was good,i liked the product very much.performance was awesome.will recommend to my friends also.&lt;br /&gt;want to do more business.</li>
    <li> Just a great product!!! Gives a baby bare smooth shave with no worry of cuts and nicks :)). Love the length of time between needed re-charging.</li>
    <li> it looks well, but do not know whether it can be used under 220V, I am not sure it can works</li>
    <li> I got it for a back-up razor that could take on trips, but my wife got to it first and she uses it all the time. She likes it.</li>
    <li> Really nice product, I  bought this weeks ago and have used it every since. Sharp and easy to use. A must have shaver for men</li>
    <li> This razor worked OK on my light beard, but the action seemed so weak, I kept expecting it to pull hairs.  It did not.  The action just seemed wimpy.  Then it quit working.  I don&#x27;t expect to have to go to the trouble to mail back it or mess with the dysfunction of a relatively inexpensive product like this, especially since it was free through the vine program.  I&#x27;ll have to admit, it did the job while it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DB</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to shave my head and are totally happy with it&#x27;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco razors are still the best&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can use it cordless and plugged in</li>
    <li> Seemingly well made... doesnt come with the trimmer that typically flips open on the dorsal side of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, not a close shave at all, and it leaves my hairs and skin irritated. I have never had this problem with my previous Philips Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> The speed and power of the motor seems barely adequate to give a good shave.  Does not replace the closeness of a razor.</li>
    <li> This razor seemed to be weak, the action just seemed wimpy. At first I thought I did not charge it fully, so I had it charged overnight, same thing. Price is good tho, surely not an awesome buy.</li>
    <li> bought for my son in law. he really liked it the shipping was very fast.very happy with product.worked well as stated</li>
    <li> THIS IS A NICE RAZOR FOR THE MONEY DON&#x27;T LEAVE RAZOR BURNS SHAVES PRETTY CLOSE I SHAVE EVERY DAY SO WORKS FINE FOR ME</li>
    <li> This is a cheap razor and produces cheap results.  I highly do not recommend this razor.  Spend $60 for the better version, the blades make thie razor and this one has very cheap blades.  Sticks to your face and does not cut very close.</li>
    <li> For my 14 yr old grandson and he has been delighted.  It works for him but I don&#x27;t know how it will do in the long run.  Norelco has a good reputation so I hope lives up to that.</li>
    <li> At first you think it is running low on battery but it keeps on going.  Does the job for a low price.</li>
    <li> I bought this with great expectation, but it is taking lot of time to shave and the cleaning is also taking time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says to use hot water, but when used blades become hot and hence I use only normal water on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my traditional shaver is fast and clean.</li>
    <li> gift for others&lt;br /&gt;cheap&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;..&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.GOOd</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give a completely clean shave. You know like in the anime where it sparkles. But buy it anyways if your have a hairy chin.</li>
    <li> made in China.but good for this money</li>
    <li> Delivered in time,  as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various versions of the Braun foil head for 30 yrs. This triple head is 1/3rd the cost, much quieter and gives a much faster, close, clean shave. No more Braun for me.</li>
    <li> This is cheap and effective solution if you don&#x27;t want to use razors. I personally have found the best way to use it is by lightly pressing it against your face and circling it over the areas you wanted shaved for about 45 to 60 seconds. I would recommend the one with the edge trimmer though if you need to shave edges such as beard shaping or sideburns.</li>
    <li> Bought the razor as a gift to replace one. Works well and came in as planned. Norelco is a good brand.</li>
    <li> The price is great. It is very nice small electric with the top quality. Also it is good for world wide travelers.</li>
    <li> Bought it for $27--so didn&#x27;t expect much.  It does its job though, nice quick shave.  I&#x27;d have to make a couple of passes but that&#x27;s all fine.  Hope this lasts for at least 2 yrs.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend love it! he wants to buy another for his father! it is a good deal! we all love it!</li>
    <li> FOr the money it works fine and the battery lasts long. I use it every day and rarely charge it,</li>
    <li> This works great.  The only thing I would like to see changed is a longer recharging cord (the one that came with it was only about two feet long).</li>
    <li> Used this shaver for a couple of times and I am in love with it.... Fast and close shave that too without any skin irritation...</li>
    <li> It cuts really clean. Impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Remington before. It worked good for 4 years (and it still works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to replace blades. Since they cost a fortune, I shopped around and found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it is better than Remington. I love it.</li>
    <li> I replaced my 15 year old Norelco with this shaver found on sale.  It works fantastic; i honestly didn&#x27;t realize the quality of my old shaver had slipped so much.  Received the item quickly and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> For under $20, this done a great job. While not too close, it definitely makes you presentable. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> A little bit NOT very clean  Maybe my skill in use this item is not very good  ha ha haha!</li>
    <li> Hi there, the razor work great, how ever I also get your ink for my Kodak Pinter which  ink was so bad I  only printed 10 copies I WONT buy anymore ink from you guy anymore..</li>
    <li> It works great in any condition, its easy to clean, and you can take anywhere. Worths the money you pay for.</li>
    <li> Whilst purchasing this product... failed to note that it does not include a trimmer?&lt;br /&gt;I was actually stunned by that lack of product feature?  Not as powerful as a prior&lt;br /&gt;Phillips Norelco product I&#x27;d been using.  They have just drummed this down to the&lt;br /&gt;cheapest common denominator going, and I took the bait... hook, line and sinker.</li>
    <li> Arrived in very good condition and on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Very well packed for shipping, the quality is excellent and comes as described.&lt;br /&gt;Reliable and secure transaction, the free shipping is very good for the value of the article.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended as product and as seller.&lt;br /&gt;Very very satisfied and happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> it is with easy use and low noise when it is working to shave my beard. But it is a little expensive.</li>
    <li> I received this product in time and it is a good product as described. I would recommend others to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The quality is good, and is very light&lt;br /&gt;i like it.The best gift for parents&lt;br /&gt;good good  good good good</li>
    <li> I chose this particular razor because after reading several Consumer Reports reviews that didn&#x27;t seem to indicate any strong price/performance curve with electric razors and I had used a Norelco rotary many years ago. I was happy to discover that the razor is rechargeable and keeps a charge for a very long time. I do have to empty and clean the razor but I can&#x27;t imagine a razor where this would not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been shaving with disposable razors for the last 20 years. I mostly tired of contributing to the landfill. I very rarely cut myself, the shave was smooth with straight-edge razors and it was quick. I was a bit nervous about sacrificing the closeness of my shave and the possibility of razor-burn. However, from the very first shave I have been happy with the closeness and I have not experienced razor-burn.</li>
    <li> Norelco is all over the place with their shavers and prices. Imagine my surprise when, for $50 I could replace my shave heads, or pay $20 (I noticed the price just doubled!! Musta been a pre-Christmas deal) and get a new shaver. Expecting a rough shave, and as one reviewer said, not able to hold a charge, I was surprised in both categories. Good shave and, best of all, fits neatly in my glove compartment AND holds a charge to allow me to shave at the red lights!</li>
    <li> Chose this item because of urgent need and the low price available for it.  I have used Norelco razors since 1952, have seldom ever used another brand. I gave it only a 3-star rateing mainly because I understand it is a cheaper model than the Quantum model I had used for years and is not quite as comfortable as the higher priced unit and I don&#x27;t expect it to last as long. I had used the Quantum for over 15 years. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the Model 6945.</li>
    <li> Great razor! I always have a fear of electric razors, thinking they will cut me up! However I took a chance and got this particular model, and no regrets since. I had it for about two weeks, and use it every other day. (I like the five oclock shadow i get the next day). If i had stick with my disposable turbo 5 shaver, I would of spent about $18 a week, times 52 well over $500 in shaving supplies, compared to this, once a year replacement for the head and your set</li>
    <li> Lower speed fooled me.  Does a good job and the charge does last a long time.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a trimmer, since I had read previous reviews.  Does exactly like I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> A++++++++! Very good to use, making you shaving very smoothly every day &amp; every time  , please enjoy with Your 6954!!!</li>
    <li> This razor is a back-up for my regular razor or for travel.  It does not shave as closely as the more costly razor but it does an acceptable job and should I forget it, it is not something to fret.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this razor he says he hardly gets any razor bumps,easy to clean and charge he has not had any problems with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year and it&#x27;s still treating me fine. I am considering replacing the blades soon. I use this alongside an Andis 08770 trimmer. For the price, its not bad, however, if you&#x27;re in the market to get a good quality shave, I would suggest investing a little more money for something more powerful.</li>
    <li> Great price for a rechargable and good quality shave.  Just be aware there is no sideburn trimmer on this model.  So if you can get by without it great, if not do not buy this model.</li>
    <li> It was significantly weaker than my previous shaver (Panasonic ES4026NC Pro Curve) and required many runs for a  very basic shave.</li>
    <li> I am little disappointed with this unit as I was expecting something up to par with Braun pocket shaver that I have for last 8 years. I always use double edge razors (I have very thick beard) then clean up my face with electric razor. This way, I get very smooth shave and the shave holds up 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purpose, this unit will be probably OK as my Braun is ready for be retired. However, here is what I don&#x27;t like with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Weak motor, I would not use this as sole razor to shave. The motor is weak and you need to make many rotations on the same surface area to clean up properly then your skin will be burnt due to irritation. But again, I have very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;2. Weak springs on the razor head. The more pressure you apply the motor will bog down more. But then the head doesn&#x27;t glide down on your face as more expensive units do.&lt;br /&gt;3. Flimsy plastic body and very light.&lt;br /&gt;4. No side burn razor (although I knew this from the beginning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/23&lt;br /&gt;I lowered my initial three stars to one...I&#x27;ve returned the product to Amazon. This little machine is not capable of giving me a decent shave.It makes a lot of noise, vibrates a lot but no action...Weak motor was the reason I returned this unit.</li>
    <li> Razor works very well.  Holds charge a long time, about a week.  Light weight and provides a good smooth shave.</li>
    <li> nice razor especially to travel with</li>
    <li> still functioning, all is well</li>
    <li> Great razor t a great price. I&#x27;ve had this razor over a year and never had a problem with it. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good for a cheap lil&#x27; thing</li>
    <li> Waste of money, doesn&#x27;t even trim hair properly</li>
    <li> It cut really good and close. No nicks. I did not notice that this model did not come with the mustache trimmer.  But I still like it.</li>
    <li> I just paid 18$ .It&#x27;s really deserve.After I got this, I formed a new habit that I&#x27;d like to clean all my beard before I went out every day.</li>
    <li> Does give a close shave and is very quiet.  The only negative is I which it could be water rinsed like my Remington can be.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. He went B.B. B store first and found this brand&#x27;s price from $70 to over 100, then I&lt;br /&gt;Went  Amazon searching and found this one. He said I used the similar shiver before and it&#x27;s good. And I checked&lt;br /&gt;The price, it&#x27;s a surprise, after discount  it costs only $23(including shipping). My husband like it very much, he&lt;br /&gt;Said it&#x27;s good to use and almost no noise. We are very happy with this purchase, thanks!</li>
    <li> My friend asked me to buy it, and he has not told me anything bad about this stuff. It is Philips, you konw!</li>
    <li> This is not a great product. The blades are not that good. Some times you feel like it is plucking the hair when you shave the lower part of the chin. I dont think the blade is going to last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this while travel only so that I dont have to carry the whole saving set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for daily shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband thought he wanted to try this one. He said no he didn&#x27;t care for it. So he gave it to our son. He liked it.</li>
    <li> Electric Razor,Philips Norelco handy and so far requires little maintenance. Size allow travel without taking up too much room and fits easily in luggage.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and made poor. Battery power was weak. I have to connect it to power to use it.</li>
    <li> i already use it for a couple of time, feeling really good, i like it ,hope it can last long.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value and I would recommond this product. It&#x27;s quiet and keeps it&#x27;s charge for quite a while.</li>
    <li> highly dissapointed with the product. I had to use this for atleast 15-25 minutes daily and, even, after that I had to use razor because the finish was bad.</li>
    <li> It is a very good staff according to its price, I always use philips razor, I think it is a nice brand.</li>
    <li> great product for the cost, holds charge, would recommend it for general use, only downside is it doesn&#x27;t have a pop up trimmer</li>
    <li> ITS A PIECE OF JUNK. STICK TO HAND HELD BLADES INSTEAD OF THIS THING. iF YOU LIKE JAMMING IT INTO YOUR FACE FOR A CLOSE SHAVE BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I read all the negatives about this shaver and comes up with the conclusion that most of those reviewer are not objective&lt;br /&gt;I have used electric shaver for about 50 yrs (yes I am 69).and tried all brand name and all the price range&lt;br /&gt;electric shavers would never ever cut as close as a blade from the 1st pass for obvious reason there is a barrier (screen)  between the blade and your skin(safer) .&lt;br /&gt;As far as the irritation and burning they do occur when you press hard trying to obtain a close shave&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors are not faster than the blade, but for a quick touch up before a meeting or later in the day (dinner or date)&lt;br /&gt;I always use wet shave with any electric razor and you will obtain a smooth and faster shave(and less irritation)&lt;br /&gt;Are you board yet?&lt;br /&gt;NOW this shaver do what it suppose to do for less($) than the price of 2 disposable cartridge blades&lt;br /&gt;Any better shaver out there? yes for 3 to 4 time the price&lt;br /&gt;For $20 or less what do you expect from shaver? it is not going to have all the bell and whistles and motor of a 50 or 80 dollars one?&lt;br /&gt;How about a heavy thick beard.that dull any blade after one shave or less? do not expect any electric razor to do the job except few modesl with strong motor(over $150)&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shaver for almost 2 months before the rating an I am satisfied with it,  I am going to use it as a backup for my more expensive and somewhat better norelco and  Pana(linear)&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations::use wet shave faster and easier on your skin and closer shave&lt;br /&gt;carefully rinse with water do not immerse.. excellent as a back up shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Last I do expect the blades to last 18 month or better(wet shave) and 10-14 month (dry shave)</li>
    <li> A quick and good close shave.  I would recommend this to all my friends who don&#x27;t like shaving.  It is easy now.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and OK but not really a good every day solution. Quiet but does not really give a close shave.</li>
    <li> My boobear loves his new razor and uses it every day! It keeps him smooth and soft and its absolutely wonderful!  He thanks me all the time for not having to use a plain razor and run the risk of nicking his face. This was perfect for my love!</li>
    <li> My husband watched the video &amp; choose the razor because of it.  He feels the video was completely accurate &amp; is very satified.</li>
    <li> It was what I needed and cost was unbeatable...so it was good. - - - - - no more words</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 74, and 50 yrs ago a Norelco product last 25 to 30 years.  I seem to be buying a replacemen about every three yrs these days.  No one&#x27;s fault except that China can&#x27;t even duplacate a clothes-pin from our original, which lasted near a life-time,  for their&#x27;s to last two yrs.  Just the same ole Chinese s***......which is all they are capable of \\&quot;trying\\&quot; to re-produce.</li>
    <li> bought for little money now I know why want stay charged very long sharp blades that&#x27;s good but still very cheap</li>
    <li> Norelco, as with other brands, has models costing over a hundred dollars.  Models like that simply aren&#x27;t necessary.  A good, close shave can be obtained with this model; after all it&#x27;s the three heads doing the job no matter how they&#x27;re surrounded.  This model doesn&#x27;t have the beard/sideburn trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t work that well anyway (I had one on a former Norelco shaver).&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself a cheap little ten or fifteen dollar trimmer; it&#x27;s all you need.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this model terrible razor only get about 2 shaves per charge about ready to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Cuts OK but has no trimmer for longer hair. Feels OK when you hold it in your hand. OK for the price.</li>
    <li> I had always use Remington foil shavers in the past, but when I saw this on sale at Walmart I decided to give it a try. It is amazingly good for the price. It shaves as close as the more expensive foil savers and is much, much quieter. I am completely sold on Norelco products at this point. Although, I think next time I may try 1 of the wet/dry models just for the novelty of using shaving cream with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> The razor works good with electrical power and decent with battery only.  It was less expensive than replacing the heads on an older razor.  Wish the heads were inter changeable, but they aren&#x27;t from model to model.</li>
    <li> I have used the Norelco 6945 for a month. It is very comfortable on my skin and easy to hold at different angles in either hand. The floating three rotor design conforms to facial contours to give a good shave around the chin and mouth area. I use it to shave my head also (the fringe around the sides and back.) That is where the floating rotors really perform well. The large cutter contact area makes quick work of all my shaving needs. For me, a wet shave with blade and lather is best. This Norelco does about 98% as well as a wet shave... that&#x27;s better than any other electric I have used (but those others were many years ago.) I would definitely buy a Norelco product again.</li>
    <li> The shave from this razor is decent but the time on your face to get to decent is 2X of a high end razor.  The charge last a super long time.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because the unit doesn&#x27;t have a sideburn cutter but I can easily forgive it because the price was surely right!  It is Norelco quality!!  I have alternate means to care for the sideburns!</li>
    <li> This is bought to send a friend a gift, like a friend. I like Philips shavers.This model is very affordable</li>
    <li> Excellent price fast shipment good shaver does not irritate skin will give good service holds charge well easy to clean</li>
    <li> I am in love with this razor. It is small and so practical. It gives very good close shave and I can use it on all parts of my face. It is very easy to clean and battery lasts for more 2 weeks. I used to get cuts all the time from normal razors, so this is a boon for me. 2 minutes every morning and I am always clean shaved. My friends can&#x27;t believe I use electric razor for shaving as this one works better for me. It goes without saying that I am saving good money as I don&#x27;t have buy shaving creams/gel and blades.</li>
    <li> everything is good. It worths the price. If it is water-proof, it wil be great. ha ha ha ha ha</li>
    <li> This is an OK shaver but I wish I had gotten one with a trimmer.  Much quieter than other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the lady of the house. She uses it for her arms and legs. I am using an older version of the same model (ten years old). The battery lasts almost all week for her before recharging. I have caught her sneaking in to my bathroom to use the flip up trimmer on my shaver for her nose hairs. Norelco needs to listen to its customers and go back to having a trimmer on the shavers.</li>
    <li> good value.  still using old electric shaver w/trimmer despite dull blades.  light weight good feature for quick shave before heading out into public.</li>
    <li> It takes a considerable amount of time to shave with this product, probably to the point where it&#x27;s better to just use shaving cream and a normal razor.  You need to go over the same patch of hair over and over again before it will cut and finally when it does cut, it leaves your face red and flaky.  I would recommend investing a little more money on a better product.</li>
    <li> This works great but I only wish it had a trimmer blade.  It works very well for regular shaving.</li>
    <li> could have been better but for the price it was a good deal</li>
    <li> I use every day and the battery still lasts for more than 2 weeks without the need for recharging. You can push close to the contour of your face without cutting your skin. This is the best electric razor I ever used.</li>
    <li> Only thing, no trimmer. Still worth the price. What else can I say. We are talking about a razor. Okay</li>
    <li> I was in need of one, and found this on Amazon.  Surprise this razor did a great job.  If you are looking for one, this will be GREAT product for you with lesser price compare with Panasonic or so.</li>
    <li> doesnt cut my beard close at all, would love my money back!!! i really should have returned it right away just terrible!!!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s great: You don&#x27;t even need to look your face in a mirror while shaving, just hold the electric razor and go all over your face. The battery lasts at least 30 minutes of shaving action between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not so great: It lasts 8 hours to fully charge the battery. You must schedule a charging day once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for a price of 17.99... so this review is based on that price and functions.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son for Christmas and he loved it. Had a $10 instant rebate and that made it even better.</li>
    <li> This Norelco is the third or fourth I&#x27;ve had over the years.  At first use, it seemed underpowered and ineffective. As some weeks have gone by I&#x27;ve become accustomed to how best to use it. That is, I suspect, a very individual matter.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for cheek and neck but not for around lips or chin.  It is well worth the small price.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, I got it for very good price and very happy with it. use it for almost 2 months, still not needed to charge the battery.</li>
    <li> It is compact, fits in hand well, and it works, but battery doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as a previous electric shaver I had, and it seems sometimes I have to go over certain spots multiple times to get all of the hair.  I&#x27;ve owned others that I think worked better, but this was very cheap, and it does work, in the end.  I just can&#x27;t highly recommend it, but if you need a cheap, electric shaver that does the job, this works.</li>
    <li> It is a common one except I was surprised to find out it has no trimmer, which I need sometimes.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He always has it handy wherever we go out of town. He says it is easy to use and it cuts close.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor, before of this I shave with a razor and it takes me so much time for me so I decided to switch to an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave irritated my neck and I noticed that the end result was close to the shave with a razor, but it took me less than the half of the time, the new thing with an electric razor is that you need to do proper maintenance by taking away all the cutting heads and clean them using the brush provided to take all the hair inside the top or the razor, is not a big deal, now that I have confidence with the parts, i&#x27;m able to get all parts clean in less than 5 minutes, .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now and as I precaution to have this machine working properly for all the time possible, so I clean it up every second use, my shave is not as good as it was with the razor blade, but I can shave myself often due to the quickness with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid that by choosen the cheapest one of the phillips electric razor I will get a bad product, but I was wrong this machine works great holds the charge very well I use it about 3 times a week and it have a month with me now and the initial charge still holds so this was an unexpected surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor was USD$27.97 by the time I made the purchase and can use a $10.00 cupon so I get this for USD$17.97 that was an steal and this is a really good machine, I don&#x27;t have tons of facial hair, but every two days I look like a drunken man if I don&#x27;t shaved myself, so now I&#x27;m able to shave often and look ok for my daily routine without the waste of water while using the traditional razor blade.</li>
    <li> very good price and quality. easy to use I will recommend this one I buy yhree for gift for my parent in law</li>
    <li> For the price this was an excellent purchase.  I would recommend this product as a first time buy for someone with a budget.</li>
    <li> It looks very good, moreover very cheap. It&#x27;s good gift for my father. Philips is also a good brand. I like it.</li>
    <li> The price was right and served my shaving needs as compared to replacing the saving heads on my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is a good razor for men. But it&#x27;s not compact and would spend a little bit more space for travelling case. It&#x27;s a great deal and I love it.</li>
    <li> The razor is a simple shaver. The cut is close and outstanding. If your looking for a razor to give you a close shave that won&#x27;t tear your face up in the process, then this razor is perfect. I think the Norelco brand has always produced quality products and this razor proves the legacy of quality continues within the company.</li>
    <li> Despite being a simple machine, does its job very well, in my case, if I use the machine very often irritates me enough however for every 2 days.</li>
    <li> this item is a backup because I am hard on razors and I know the brand and swear by it</li>
    <li> There are better ones in the market , go for them since its a long time needing to charge it to use it without electric supply.&lt;br /&gt;But yes it works perfectly well in India on 230 V line</li>
    <li> I love it,it is a perfect product,it is amazing.I will prove it for you guys in the future days .</li>
    <li> I actually returned this item.  Bought it for my husband for Fathers Day and he said it is a piece of garbage.  Should have spent more to get a better one...guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband to replace his worn out one. They are very similar and he like it. disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have the flip up sideburn trimmer on this model.</li>
    <li> Wanted just a simple corded unit (they&#x27;re getting hard to find); didn&#x27;t realize this was a combo.  Perhaps the chargeable mode will be useful.  It is a good basic razor at a low price, works very well, seems to be typical high-quality from Norelco.  However, the plastic blister pack it came in was one of the worst I&#x27;ve seen in years.  It took ten minutes with leather gloves, box cutter and screwdriver to very carefully get the razor out of this dangerous packaging.  Why do manufacturers continue to use these things.  On top of that, the blister pack was in a large sealed box.</li>
    <li> nice razor for the price, well worth it</li>
    <li> I have asked about the problem about the 110-240 v for recharging.  I got the answer in 5 min for solving the problem</li>
    <li> very good travel razor</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I bought it for my 23 year old son who doesn&#x27;t like to shave and always looked scruffy.  It is so easy to shave with and he always looks great.  It makes his face very smooth and now I can see his beautiful face again.  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to use a conventional razor. This really does the trick.</li>
    <li> I brought it back to my dad as a gift. It works internationally.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it so i think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the top-of-the-line but it performs very well so far.  Clean shaves quickly.</li>
    <li> I did not use the razor.  It was for my son who broke his while a residen of a nursing home.</li>
    <li> it looks very pretty, i don&#x27;t know how well it works ,this is a gift for my brother,i think he would like it.</li>
    <li> Some information above is wrong, it contains a NiMH battery, not Li-Ion one.&lt;br /&gt;Even though, it still be a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Using Philips shavers for more than ten years, satisfying</li>
    <li> I very like this razor, shaving it close to the face, feel very comfortable, and the razor with hands won&#x27;t get fingerprint, very good!</li>
    <li> I have used a similar Norelco model that has a sideburn trimmer. Instead of buying new shaver heads I decided to buy this model, without the trimmer. Price after a coupon discount was about 18 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves as well as the model I had. One caution: keep a grip on the head when removing it for cleaning as it is not hinged, i.e. will fall to the floor if you aren&#x27;t careful. Also, read the cleaning instructions. I cleaned my old shaver less often than recommended - probably affecting performance. Has a two year warranty.</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  Works well.  Cheap price</li>
    <li> At $18 I did not expect a top of the line razor.  This razor has only three blades total instead of nine like the more expensive Norelcos.  I use it for travel.  It does its job.  No bells and whistles but I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> Like most of these three circled razors, it pulls on the hairs (leaving many razor bumps), and doesn&#x27;t shave the face evenly.</li>
    <li> Have shaved with the entry level Norelco electric rotatary head shaver since I started shaving 45 years ago and have always been most satisfied. They last for many years each and I never replace just the shaving head blades because it&#x27;s less costly to just buy a whole brand new shaver when they are on sale and retire the old shaver. Unfortunately on this particular model they eliminated the trimming attachment which seems like a crafty way to shift consumers up to a  higher level (ie more expensive) model. They all shave the same.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not shave as close as the Norleco Lift-and-Cut shavers which cost only a little more on sale.  I have both and its easy to tell the difference.  I recommend that you pay a little more but get the Lift-and-Cut shaver which looks a lot like the 6945 but works much better.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old razor.  great close shave.  Got it at a discounted price compared to the ones in the store.</li>
    <li> its hurting my skin.. I didn&#x27;t liked it. looks like inside blades are not aligned well. I was thinking to return but by the time I started using 30 days completed. bad luck..</li>
    <li> Works great and is very quiet. I do miss the battery charge indicator that I had on my last one. But other than that&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good razor. Very quiet and easy to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;My friend really likes this!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to my friend without any hesitation!</li>
    <li> Holds charge for numerous uses. Shaves fairly close and is light and portable. Overall a pretty good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> product is great, but was not able to register product online, (model no. not found);  received no paper form to mail in.</li>
    <li> I like the price compared to other similar products. Does not give a very smooth shave and not easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This model is less expensive but badly made. The body and blades have excessive tolerances, creating vibrations and noise. Everything is plastic and reflect poor engineering. When you shave the blade unit slides creating discomfort and lacks precision.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  No trimmer for mustache or sideburns.  Week motor means it doesn&#x27;t cut for beans.  Going shopping for another one today.</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my son, he used it once and had razor bumbs very quickly. This had not happened before using any other razor. Will not  be using this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I like Philips Norelco and have used them in the past. This is even better than earlier models. Shaves effortlessly.</li>
    <li> Quieter than my last Norelco that lasted over ten years, but shaves a bit better. No trimmer.</li>
    <li> This razor provides an excellent shave at a low price - it is that simple.  For those who need a rotary blade shaver to get the job done this is a great value.  I have been using this Norelco for several months.  It gives a consistent, decent shave which is all that most of us need.  I am shaving at 5 a.m. so worst case run it over your face again before your big night out.  The battery seems to last a full week after being charged. It is well built and fairly easy to clean.  Once every few months you will have to disassemble the head and give it a thorough cleaning with the supplied brush.  What it does not do:  it does not have a trimmer like a lot of other Norelco&#x27;s.  The battery charge light seems to always stay on when plugged in so I am not sure when it has a full charge (I just do overnight).  It is not self cleaning, it cannot be used in the shower.  The cord is a little bulky.  The plastic shave head cover falls off fairly easily.  Bottom line - I am in my 50&#x27;s and have had several much more expensive ($100) electric razors that missed hairs on my neck or irritated my face or broke.</li>
    <li> Only used it once. Did not seem to work well or get a clean shave. Not sure what the problem was.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco 6945XL Electric Razor ...&lt;br /&gt;Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Very good use it every day</li>
    <li> My hubby has a brillo pad 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. It does take a couple of passes to get a clean shave but for the money and my honey it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor hoping to replace an older Panasonic model that I had. While this razor does an excellent job cutting any hairs that I might&#x27;ve missed the day before (which the Panasonic struggles with), it does not cut the hair very close to the face, even after about time to acclimate to the different style. The result was a shave that didn&#x27;t feel smooth and didn&#x27;t last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the battery life on this razor is excellent, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it as a travel razor when I don&#x27;t want to lose my other.</li>
    <li> I bought this when Amazon had a coupon for $10 of, so I paid about $18 for it. I love it, definitely an improvement over my previous electric razor. Gives a decently close shave once you get used to using it, and the battery lasts for freakin ever. I&#x27;ve had it for almost 6 months now and only remember charging it 3 or 4 times. I shave about every 3 days, sometimes longer if I don&#x27;t have time.</li>
