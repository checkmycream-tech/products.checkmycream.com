      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Always pleased with Colgate products.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the bristle design on this.</li>
      <li>someone that leans to the more obsessive side of dental care</li>
      <li>and I have no complaints about this great new toothbrush!</li>
      <li>Indeed, after use, you do notice a very clean mouth.  </li>
      <li>This turned out to be a great size for my 13 yea old son.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  </li>
      <li>This is the most comfortable, easy to use toothbrush ever.</li>
      <li>I find it so difficult to locate compact head toothbrushes, so to find on Amazon at a great price was perfect.  </li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re finished brushing your teeth, use the textured top to clean your gums &amp; tongue.</li>
      <li>If you want a good, quality replaceable toothbrush, this is a decent buy.</li>
      <li>We still prefer using our electric toothbrushes at home, but we took these on vacation with us and they worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Got this free from the dentist.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommended product for its advanced feature set and competitive price.</li>
      <li>The handle fits comfortably in my hand</li>
      <li>It makes for a great clean and it&#x27;s good for all of your mouth, specifically the gums and soft tissue of the cheeks, inner lips, and tongue which are often neglected in toothbrush design.</li>
      <li>It also cleans the insides of my cheeks well, leaving my mouth feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable and gets my teeth clean, and seems like a well made toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>After it arrived I was excited to try it out.  </li>
      <li>All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  </li>
      <li>While this is better for people with a sensitive gag reflex, I like the efficiency of more square &amp;#34;footage&amp;#34; on my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>and I actually find the tongue cleaner more effective than a scraper.  </li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t feel as clean as I like.  </li>
      <li>Yep, this toothbrush also has place on it to clean your tongue and cheek.</li>
      <li>I liked this toothbrush, it had soft bristles and it was comfortable to handle.</li>
      <li>B00ELI7SBG Colgate 360 Compact Head Toothbrush]] are gentle on your gums while special cups hold the toothpaste for better polishing.</li>
      <li>I also have used this brush with the full size head.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for smaller mouths.  </li>
      <li>The compact brush and soft bristles work nicely.</li>
      <li>Although, not my favorite toothbrush line, the compact head version of the 360 toothbrush is fairly decent.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush has a good design, but is NOT soft.</li>
      <li>The compact head is a perfect fit for my small mouth, and it&#x27;s easy to access my back teeth.  </li>
      <li>The tapered bristles are tightly packed &amp; remove more plaque &amp; stains, &amp; the textured top  cleans my cheeks while I brush my teeth!  </li>
      <li>Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
      <li>, I use the bristles to keep that minty fresh.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice soft grip on the back and at the top of the handle where your thumbs</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m not sold on incorporating rubber cups or flaps to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; my teeth, I adore the way the tightly-packed, patterned bristles cleaned between my teeth and brushed my tongue so effectively.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s a soft it feels more like medium to me.  </li>
      <li>This one is particularly nice as it also has a tongue scraper/cheek massager on the opposite side of the bristles.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s an add on item, but a very competitive price and with that price, you feel comfortable replacing the brush regularly.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job getting down in there.</li>
      <li>I use with the COLGATE TOTAL® ADVANCED WHITENING TOOTHPASTE the combination removes surface stains, dual-silica technology helps prevent new stains from forming plus fights germs for 12 hours.</li>
      <li>While the full head was not for me, the compact head brushes are more comfortable for me and and acceptable,I still prefer the narrow head over all.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t expect the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; to remove stains more than a regular brush.....</li>
      <li>This one has the small head, which is best suited for smaller mouths, but I use both kinds interchangeably without issues.</li>
      <li>a found the multi-height bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>It feels more like regular size to me.</li>
      <li>It is a bit big for compact but it was ok for me.</li>
      <li>so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  </li>
      <li>B0070PX7E4 Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]].</li>
      <li>The smaller head allows for the bristles along the perimeter to clean a bit better without the disadvantage of such sparseness as found in the full head version.</li>
      <li>Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved my old one and couldn&#x27;t find a new one in the store I bought my last one.</li>
      <li>The polishing cup holds toothpaste against tooth surfaces to help maximize the paste&#x27;s performance, helping to remove plaque and stains from tooth surfaces, with the Colgate® Sensitive Enamel Protect(tm) to protect tooth enamel from acid attacks or COLGATE TOTAL® CLEAN MINT TOOTHPASTE.</li>
      <li>Nice smaller toothbrush with a soft head.</li>
      <li>I thought this toothbrush was fantastic - the bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t irritate the gums or teeth, but they&#x27;re still capable of deep-cleaning the mouth.  </li>
      <li>I also prefer the medium bristles as the soft feel like it would only be good for people with sensitive mouths.</li>
      <li>The compact head is indeed a bit on the small side and was a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
      <li>I like bringing a new toothbrush for a vacation, and I brought this one on my most recent trip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a very large toothbrush, which is something many people prefer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great tooth brush does the job well</li>
    <li> Love the 360 w compact head</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is really the best one yet.  It&#x27;s smaller but gets in everywhere and does a really fantastic job at cleaning those tight areas.  Even though it&#x27;s a soft it feels more like medium to me.  I really like the fact that it&#x27;s smaller and I don&#x27;t have to jab myself with the larger brushes anymore.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Colgate&#x27;s 360 Compact Head Toothbrush packs in a myriad of features to deliver a brush that will grab your attention.  It has an intricate brush design to sweep away debris from the hardest to reach locations of your teeth.  Indeed, after use, you do notice a very clean mouth.  You get the feeling that the mixture of brush shapes and sizes built into the head truly are getting to the gum line, between tweet, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this 360 product is heavily focused on its textured back of the brush head.  This serves two purposes.  When cleaning the side of your teeth, it moves along your cheek, gently brushing your cheek to remove some additional bacteria.  Furthermore, it can also be used on your tongue for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the compact head to be larger than other compact heads I have used, and the soft brush was still rather stiff, so I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be worried that it is too soft, it&#x27;s far from too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the price that amazon often carries the brush at to be incredibly good too.  Sure, it&#x27;s an add on item, but a very competitive price and with that price, you feel comfortable replacing the brush regularly.  I truly believe that regularly replacing of your toothbrush goes a long way in keeping your teeth cleaner.  I don&#x27;t see any reason to use a brush more than a month at the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended product for its advanced feature set and competitive price.</li>
    <li> The soft bristles are great--they gently clean without irritating my gums. As for the other bells and whistles, the varied bristles help get nooks and crannies on the entire tooth, front and back. The tongue cleaners on these brushes is never that great, since brushing the tongue works so much better, so I just do that. If you prefer the back of the brush ones, though, this has it! This one has the small head, which is best suited for smaller mouths, but I use both kinds interchangeably without issues. Great brush!</li>
    <li> Yep, this toothbrush also has place on it to clean your tongue and cheek. Sounds kind of weird, but it really does work. The compact brush and soft bristles work nicely. Always pleased with Colgate products.</li>
    <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  Perhaps it is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  Tongue cleaning reportedly reduces bad breath and reduces bacteria known to contribute to periodontal problems, tooth decay, gum infection, gum recession, and tooth loss (Wikipedia). I have now added it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the four designs from this line that I tried, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate has made big jump forward in brush design with this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this brush to my daughter to try as she prefers the more compact heads.  She was very pleased with how well it cleaned her teeth and tongue.  She would like to see Colgate come out with a child&#x27;s version of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these 360s will go into everyone’s Christmas stocking this year.th this brush.

    <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like the design of this Colgate 360 Compact Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The compact head is a perfect fit for my small mouth, and it&#x27;s easy to access my back teeth.  I thought the bristles were a little harsh for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush, but they did soften up after a few uses.</li>
    <li> The head of this toothbrush is compact as the name states but  I don&#x27;t like that feature.  I have sensitive teeth and using this brush didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or gums but they don&#x27;t feel as clean as I like.  I have tried a few of their toothbrushes and regularly use colgate toothpaste.  This toothbrush cleans okay but prefer my [[ASIN:B0070PX7E4 Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Medium]].</li>
    <li> I liked this toothbrush, it had soft bristles and it was comfortable to handle. I  alternate between electric and manual toothbrushes (to get a break) and I liked how this one performed. It did a good job of cleaning my teeth and the tongue cleaner is something that should be standard in all toothbrushes. It is a bit big for compact but it was ok for me. No ADA seal.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and struggle to use full size toothbrushes and prefer compact toothbrushes. In the compact ones I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one seemed to be bigger and more like a full size.</li>
    <li> I like the way this toothbrush cups my teeth and seems to get all around them when I brush. It does a good job getting down in there. It&#x27;s not a very large toothbrush, which is something many people prefer. It also cleans the insides of my cheeks well, leaving my mouth feeling very clean and fresh. The soft bristles are not as soft as other brands, but they are not stiff and they don&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
    <li> Although, not my favorite toothbrush line, the compact head version of the 360 toothbrush is fairly decent. The smaller head allows for the bristles along the perimeter to clean a bit better without the disadvantage of such sparseness as found in the full head version. The bulge in the middle of the handle is not something to which I am fond. The tongue and cheek cleaner works nicely.</li>
    <li> I also have used this brush with the full size head.  I like the compact head much better from a size perspective.  Like the full size, though, I think it makes toothpaste foam a bit too much and the tounge cleaner is too aggressive, especially if you&#x27;re not used to it.  My mouth had to &amp;#34;toughen up&amp;#34; and until then it felt really rough.</li>
    <li> This Colgate 360 Compact Head Toothbrush works in a pinch. We still prefer using our electric toothbrushes at home, but we took these on vacation with us and they worked just fine. If you want a good, quality replaceable toothbrush, this is a decent buy.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this Colgate 360 compact head toothbrush are designed in the same style as their 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush, but just have a smaller brush head. There are bristles of varying lengths for reaching inside the crevices of teeth, all the way down to around the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the brush between the bristles there are what Colgate calls polishing cups, which are small rubber pieces meant to help clean plaque away. Everything about this brush is just like the Whole Mouth Clean version, just in a slightly shorter brush head style. This turned out to be a great size for my 13 yea old son. He needs something much larger than a little kids tooth brush. But also very large adult toothbrushes are a little overkill considering his size. This brush works out great for him.</li>
    <li> Perfect for smaller mouths and those who prefer a smaller brush, the tightly packed, soft bristles of the [[ASIN:B00ELI7SBG Colgate 360 Compact Head Toothbrush]] are gentle on your gums while special cups hold the toothpaste for better polishing. A built in tongue cleaner helps power away even more bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection. Germs can hide in those bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums, and as a result I can only use soft or extra soft brushes.  I thought this toothbrush was fantastic - the bristles are soft, so they don&#x27;t irritate the gums or teeth, but they&#x27;re still capable of deep-cleaning the mouth.  Since the head of the toothbrush is relatively small, it can even reach into those hard to reach places behind the molars to get every last bit of food or plaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the soft and extra soft bristles on this style of brush, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference between the two.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the bristle design on this. While I&#x27;m not sold on incorporating rubber cups or flaps to &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; my teeth, I adore the way the tightly-packed, patterned bristles cleaned between my teeth and brushed my tongue so effectively. It felt like flossing was an option rather than a necessity, though I am a flossing fiend so I do floss each brush anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I personally prefer the full head. While this is better for people with a sensitive gag reflex, I like the efficiency of more square &amp;#34;footage&amp;#34; on my toothbrush. I felt like the smaller head made me work harder. I also prefer the medium bristles as the soft feel like it would only be good for people with sensitive mouths.</li>
    <li> My repeated toothbrush purchase may buy again. it doesn&#x27;t wear out that fast.  good colors to view and good grip.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try another toothbrush.  I need one with soft bristles and a company head.  I thought this would work.  After it arrived I was excited to try it out.  I went to brush my teeth with it and I felt like I was using a scouring brush for pans instead!  The bristles were hard compared to GUM toothbrush I bought from Amazon previously.  Going back to use the other toothbrush and saving this one for cleaning!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Colgate toothbrushes over the years.  There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  This 360 Compact Head toothbrush has multi-height bristles and rubber cups/blades to help remove odorous bacteria and plaque.  There is also a useful textured cheek and tongue cleaner on the back of the bristle head.  We tried it (several samples) for a week a found the multi-height bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  Tongue Freshener scraper helps remove smelly plaque and buildup from tongue and cheeks.  We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
    <li> I find it so difficult to locate compact head toothbrushes, so to find on Amazon at a great price was perfect.  Compact brushes help to get to the back of the upper teeth where the space is tight. The bristles are soft but not so soft you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve brushed at all.  This one is particularly nice as it also has a tongue scraper/cheek massager on the opposite side of the bristles.  Handle is very comfortable and it fits in my toothbrush holder.  What more can you say about a toothbrush!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00ELI7SBG Colgate 360 Compact Head Toothbrush, Soft]] removes more bacteria than the average toothbrush. The tapered bristles are tightly packed &amp; remove more plaque &amp; stains, &amp; the textured top  cleans my cheeks while I brush my teeth!  When you&#x27;re finished brushing your teeth, use the textured top to clean your gums &amp; tongue. The whole toothbrush works together to remove over 96% more bacteria than the average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this brush but the bristles are harder than  other soft bristle toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I&#x27;m having a hard time getting used to them, &amp; developed a tiny canker sore on the tip of my tongue...not sure if its from the toothbrush or not.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have a small mouth. In my opinion, this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t have a compact head. It feels more like regular size to me.</li>
    <li> I like bringing a new toothbrush for a vacation, and I brought this one on my most recent trip. Usually, the toothbrush stays in my travel case, waiting for my next trip, but when I got home, and unpacked, I decided to make this travel brush my daily brush. I really liked the bristle softness and the varying bristle heights. My teeth feel clean and the back of the brush has a pad for whole mouth freshness (tongue, roof of mouth, cheeks - it feels great on it all!). The handle fits comfortably in my hand and I have no complaints about this great new toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Every once in a while I take a break from using an electric toothbrush to go manual. I decided to give the Colgate 360 Compact Head a try because my mouth is small but my teeth are big so brushing can be a bit uncomfortable. The compact head is indeed a bit on the small side and was a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the overall layout of the bristles and the tongue cleaner on the back side. It makes for a great clean and it&#x27;s good for all of your mouth, specifically the gums and soft tissue of the cheeks, inner lips, and tongue which are often neglected in toothbrush design. The handle, however, leaves a lot to be desired. It&#x27;s wide and the tapers and then has a rubbery grip further up but I found that tapered section left my grip lacking. I prefer a bit of a club-like handle so I can put some elbow work into my brushing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad brush at all, but I would not buy it again with this handle.</li>
    <li> Got this free from the dentist.  Used it once.  The bristles are SHARP and scratched my lower front gums, which are still swollen and sore the next morning.  The scrubber on the back abraded the inside of my lower lip, which is also still irritated.  Will try this on my bathroom tile grout.</li>
    <li> The compact head toothbrush is perfect for getting around all of my teeth.  I wish I had discovered these earlier.</li>
    <li> If you have a small mouth (like mine) you will appreciate this smaller head toothbrush. The bristles are relatively soft and it works well in my mouth. I&#x27;m not so sure about the way I have to use this one, and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of tongue scrapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars ... Not perfect, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> It is amazing how toothbrushes have evolved.  I love how this head is small and allows me to get to my back teeth with ease (as my hygienist reminds me a easy place to under brush especially since I have what she calls a small mouth.)  The small head also allows me to maneuver around my whole mouth with out having to open so wide as to aggravate my existing jaw pain.</li>
    <li> As I said in another review, no doubt toothbrushes are beginning to advance. From &amp;#34;rubber flanges&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;rubber stars&amp;#34; to bristles facing in every direction. Colgate is making this push. This brush is not in line with that change. Unlike a brush I recently tried that used &amp;#34;rubber flanges&amp;#34;, this brush presents a more traditional design, not foregoing bristles in favor of rubber pieces sold as &amp;#34;polishers.&amp;#34;  The &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; in this case are more bristles shaped differently and tightly packed.  The tongue and cheek cleaner does make a difference and I actually find the tongue cleaner more effective than a scraper.  And, it comes in at an awesome price, and on Amazon, it&#x27;s way lower than in my local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, whether you like this brush or not will be a highly personal choice. However, I found this brush to be the best, even among brushes costing four times as much.</li>
    <li> This one, in my opinion, fits the bill on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic handle, and bristles soft enough to massage gums, firm enough to scrub teeth. I tried the medium bristles, and like the Goldilocks fairy tale, this soft one is juuuuuust right.&lt;br /&gt;As someone that leans to the more obsessive side of dental care, I appreciate the tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> Nice smaller toothbrush with a soft head. I loved my old one and couldn&#x27;t find a new one in the store I bought my last one. I was happy to find this one online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fairly simple toothbrush without a lot of fancy decorations.  It does have a fairly long tongue and cheek cleaner on the back.  The head is not that wide- it&#x27;s good for smaller mouths.  The bristles are variable height, but not extremely so, and it has polishing round &#x27;cups&#x27; with bristles inside.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice soft grip on the back and at the top of the handle where your thumbs go.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are packed tightly and hold up well, even with vigorous brushing.  The head is not as big as some others but to me that helps me concentrate on one area at a time better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable and gets my teeth clean, and seems like a well made toothbrush.  I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> The polishing cup holds toothpaste against tooth surfaces to help maximize the paste&#x27;s performance, helping to remove plaque and stains from tooth surfaces, with the Colgate® Sensitive Enamel Protect(tm) to protect tooth enamel from acid attacks or COLGATE TOTAL® CLEAN MINT TOOTHPASTE. I use the MEDIUM bristle for my initial clean for teeth and gums. It has tapered bristles and a cleaning tip to help remove more plaque and stains. I use with the COLGATE TOTAL® ADVANCED WHITENING TOOTHPASTE the combination removes surface stains, dual-silica technology helps prevent new stains from forming plus fights germs for 12 hours. I use this when I am traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate® 360°® has a unique tongue cleaner located on the back of the brush head that helps remove up to 96% more bad breath bacteria than brushing teeth alone with an ordinary manual toothbrush. I have to admit that I don&#x27;t use the reverse side on my tongue, I use the bristles to keep that minty fresh.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth, so I am always looking for the compact head on toothbrushes.  This one fit perfectly, and made it easy to reach all the places in my mouth that need attention.  The bristles are soft, but still pack a punch.  I had gum grafting last year, so I now make sure to buy soft bristles, so I don&#x27;t brush too hard an cause damage.  This brush fits the needs I have.  It is easy to hold and has a small enough handle to fit into my toothbrush caddy.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> While the full head was not for me, the compact head brushes are more comfortable for me and and acceptable,I still prefer the narrow head over all. The whitening cups are really just a gimmick to me, as they don&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I have no problem keeping the toothpaste on the brush, and find no need for these things. I would rather have more bristles. These tongue scrapers don&#x27;t do anything for me, and I find that they are not effective. I am morecomfortable using the brush bristles. Still, if a narrow brush is too small, and the full heads are too large, this one might be  just right. Just don&#x27;t expect the &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; to remove stains more than a regular brush.....I did not notice any difference, both in appearance and feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. I have a small mouth so I prefer smaller heads on my toothbrushes and I really love the size on this one. I also have sensitive teeth, so soft bristles are a must for me. I like the design of the bristles. They are circular and kind of hug around your teeth for a great clean. I am also a big fan of the tongue and cheek cleaner.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has a good design, but is NOT soft. I shudder to think of what the medium or hard bristles would feel like.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does an adequate job of cleaning my teeth. Personally I prefer a brush with a fuller head but this one packs a lot of bristles into its compact head and does a great job of cleaning my teeth. I really have no complaints about this product. Excellent toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is the most comfortable, easy to use toothbrush ever. Finally someone discoverd how to wrap around teeth with a multi level brush. Thanks, Colgate.</li>
