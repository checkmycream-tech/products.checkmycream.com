      <li>when compared to all others in the list I found this for the minimal price I thought for a try and am very proud</li>
      <li>When I use it as laundry detergent, the clothes come out super clean, and the smell is soooo refreshing!</li>
      <li>Once you use TRUE ORGANIC SOAP BERRIES - you will KNOW the difference!</li>
      <li>but you can easily replace with a sturdier bag.</li>
      <li>It has this sweet smell that I just love.</li>
      <li>Have used it in both top-load washers and HE washers just fine.</li>
      <li>Even at a small package which means more money, they were still the best value I could see listed.</li>
      <li>(everything was perfectly soft, smelled fresh, and was clean!), bathe and wash hair (feels great to get away from chemical soaked hygiene products).</li>
      <li>I have found that adding some essential oil or a bit of orange oil makes the scent more pleasant to deal with</li>
      <li>the chemical laden bath &amp; body works stuff and works even better, leaving my skin soft and fresh and clean!!!</li>
      <li>The clothes come out lightly soapberry scented.</li>
      <li>Cheap way to wash.  </li>
      <li>The berries have a light fruity and nutty</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, shipped on time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that strong clean like the Chemical soap.</li>
      <li>Everytime I wash my hair with soapberries, it comes out clean, shiny, and super smooth, no conditioner needed!</li>
      <li>I plan to buy a large pack and store in my handy dandy  sealable, 5 gallon buckets that are great for long term storage.  </li>
      <li>LOVE that there is no artificial scent, just clean clothes.</li>
      <li>I must say I am pretty satisfied.</li>
      <li>I use the liquid: Firstly, I must say I love the smell of reetha.</li>
      <li>even clean his laundry</li>
      <li>The clothes smell clean, no added fragrances or chemicals, just clean.</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about soapberries, but I never really thought they&#x27;d be able to handle all my laundry needs.</li>
      <li>Laundry came out clean &amp; smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Family of five, including 3 boys and all laundry gets clean.</li>
      <li>But otherwise, on normal loads, I just run it as normal and stuff comes out clean and smelling great.</li>
      <li>I can say for sure that my skin feels more moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>But they don&#x27;t get your clothes dazzlingly clean, by any means.</li>
      <li>They come out and smell clean.  </li>
      <li>and they come out bright and white.</li>
      <li>I have found more uses for this product than I thought I&#x27;d find and the soapnuts suds up very well.</li>
      <li>One pound of soapnuts is great to have because I&#x27;ve been discovering online other ways to use these.</li>
      <li>Love my new washing routine!</li>
      <li>Of course if you buy the bigger packages save even more money, which I&#x27;m sure I will be doing.</li>
      <li>Third, these soap nuts are much more affordable!</li>
      <li>Green will had great prices, super fast service and free shipping.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to a more earth friendly and cost effective alternative to conventional cleaners.</li>
      <li>The first came out smelling like a different kind of clean</li>
      <li>only are these good in a normal washing machine, but I&#x27;ve also used them camping with a bucket and plunger &amp;#34;washing machine.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It is very  helpful to clean my stuff in kitchen or my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loves this product saves on money and on various allergies. Thx</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s some of my problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - They state that they&#x27;re Certified Organic - and they&#x27;re NOT. (That&#x27;s been verified with the USDA National Organic Program.)&lt;br /&gt;2 - Lots of fluff in the description that says little of real substance. (Read carefully. Sounds like another political speech. Just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.)&lt;br /&gt;3 - Awfully expensive for being a cheap import FROM CHINA.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Pretty close in price to well known and respected USA brands that import the berries from INDIA.&lt;br /&gt;5 - I&#x27;m all for minimal packaging, but the prices should reflect it - and they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;6 - The \\&quot;SALE\\&quot; prices here on Amazon, are the same as the \\&quot;REGULAR\\&quot; prices on their website. Who are they trying to kid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but that&#x27;s way too many strikes for me. That&#x27;s TWO \\&quot;strike outs\\&quot; already. I pass.</li>
    <li> good looking product..  shipping was on time.. they work well use them all the time</li>
    <li> Upon receiving the soap nuts and opening the bag I could tell these were higher quality product then ones I have purchased from other companies. First the little bag that comes with is studier material then any I have seen before, I have used it several times and it&#x27;s holding up better then previous ones. Second, the soap nuts themselves are have a much nicer appearance, they are much larger and seem to have more \\&quot;soap\\&quot; in them then ones I have bought before. Third, these soap nuts are much more affordable! I paid almost double the price for a less quality product last time. I have done several loads of laundry, cloth diapers and regular laundry, and they came out smelling clean and fresh. I will definitely be sticking with Greenwill for my soap nut purchases in the future.</li>
    <li> Okay, so this is a review I am writing before I have even ordered the product from Greenwill. I have been wondering about using soap nuts for a while now. I am from India and I remember washing my hair with reetha (soap nuts) when I was younger. I really liked how they worked but it was too much trouble to make the liquid and I started using shampoo instead. Fast forward 20 years later, I am sitting in America and I&#x27;ve begun to try and go as green as possible. Recently a friend posted about some &#x27;no poo&#x27; method that&#x27;s been the rage and I thought to myself, ewww, I can&#x27;t wash my hair without any shampoo. That&#x27;s when I remembered using reetha as a child. So I did some searching online and found this product. A couple days later while talking to an Indian friend of mine I told her I was thinking of buying reetha online but I couldn&#x27;t figure out which seller to buy it from.  She told me she&#x27;s been using Greenwill soap nuts ever since she&#x27;s come to America for laundry and as shampoo. A few days later she gave me a sandwich bag of these soap nuts to try before I order. Hence, the review before ordering. So far, here are my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I made the liquid: I made the liquid using 6-7 soap nuts in 3 cups of water. I soaked them in 2 cups of water for 3-4 hours, simmered them on low heat for 2 hours, added a cup more of water, let the water come to a boil, and then I let them soak for a whole night. The next morning I broke the berries down with my hands, and then strained the liquid out in glass bottles. I squeezed about 2-3 drops of lemon juice in the liquid to stop it from going rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use the liquid: Firstly, I must say I love the smell of reetha. I always have since I was child. It has this sweet smell that I just love. Anyway, since having made this liquid about a week ago I&#x27;ve used it for almost everything. I tend to go overboard when I get excited about things.. So I&#x27;ve used it as a shampoo. The reetha in India used to get all sudsy from what I remember, this liquid does not. BUT, it does the job. It makes my hair all soft and shiny. I have to use a little more than usual and it feels weird since it feels like I am just pouring water over my hair and working it into the hair but the results are good. Apart from that, I use the liquid as a body wash. Again, the same feeling, that of pouring water over my body but I am not joking when I say that it makes my skin soft. I thought I was imagining it at first but after having used it for a week I can say for sure that my skin feels more moisturized and soft. I still have a giant bottle of Ajax sitting in my house which I need to use up so I just poured half reetha and half ajax in my hand soap dispenser and started using it as dish washing liquid. Now my dishes are squeaky clean and my hands are so happy because they aren&#x27;t drying out. Lastly, I poured a little of the liquid along with vinegar and water in a spray bottle and I am using that to clean around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am loving the results. And I have only used 15 berries in the last 2 weeks. I have another 10 sitting around. I am definitely ordering  more soap nuts from Greenwill soon. I am quite excited!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using reetha for a month now. I bought reetha from this seller and they&#x27;re the same as my friend gave me and do a brilliant job. I wash my whites with them as well and they come out bright and white. For my hair, I liked the reetha liquid but I wished for more so I bought Hesh Pharma&#x27;s Shikakai and Amla powder. Now I use a spoonful of each powder, wet the powders down with reetha liquid, and use that to wash my hair with. This mixture works perfectly with my hair type. I will not say that my hair looks amazing, it looks much the same to others but it FEELS amazing to me. I love using soapnuts and I will continue buying them from this seller.</li>
    <li> Grown up in China, I constantly heard about the benefit of using soapberries. This is actually my first time using it. I use it as shampoo, dish detergent, and laundry detergent. It works great! You can find tons of instructions on how to use them on the internet. Everytime I wash my hair with soapberries, it comes out clean, shiny, and super smooth, no conditioner needed! When I use it as laundry detergent, the clothes come out super clean, and the smell is soooo refreshing! Oh, and it gets off the grease easily from the dishes! I can&#x27;t say enought good things about this product. It&#x27;s all natural and it great!!!</li>
    <li> I love soapberries. They are great for anyone who has sensitivities to detergent but my favorite thing about them is that they keep towels and cloth diapers absorbent because they don&#x27;t have all those chemicals that build up and cause them to repel water. Of course, that is if you are not using dryer sheets. Soapberries last a long time, too. I always have some on hand for diapers and just in case we run out of detergent because the teen didn&#x27;t tell anyone she was doing 3 loads of laundry and used it all up. Soapberries are on my list of favorite things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these nuts for washing my clothes since I purchased over a year ago. I found it was easier to take about 10 nuts and simmer them in a pot of water to make a &amp;#34;soap nut concentrate&amp;#34;, then freeze them in ice-cube trays, rather than work with nuts in the drawstring baggie. I use about 2 defrosted cubes per load, along with (1/8c.? I eyeball it) white vinegar. Found the vinegar is a very important element in helping wash with these. I also use a Tbsp. of mixed washing soda/ borax. Have used it in both top-load washers and HE washers just fine.</li>
    <li> Updated from my earlier review below - after I posted a 4 star review seller contacted me and sent two free bags to replace my broken ones...free of charge!  I have now tested the bags 10 runs each, one in my dishwasher and one in my washing machine and both have held up beautifully, so I have upgraded my review to 5 stars.  Excellent customer service and products you can rely on!  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out after reading The Good Life Lab and found them great to replace dishwasher and laundry soap...everything comes out clean and the dishwasher has less build up.  The bag to put them in is not as durable as the title suggests...broke open in the washing machine on the third use (see updated above)....but you can easily replace with a sturdier bag.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with these. I am pretty upset because I was so looking forward to all of the benefits that were promised about soapberries. I was really looking forward to a more earth friendly and cost effective alternative to conventional cleaners. However, I found these soapberries to be absolutely disgusting. The smell was just horrible, downright repulsive. I tried to use them to hand wash some clothes, and my whole bathroom stunk, and the smell wouldn&#x27;t come off my hand even after several hand washings. I then tried to make some of the soap liquid as described in the instructions, hoping I could add fragrance to improve the smell, but I only made it worse. Simmering the berries made my whole house smell awful, and even with essential oils, I wasn&#x27;t able to overpower the bad smell of these. I am worried that they are actually &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; or rotten or something, because I have never heard anyone say that they dislike the smell of soapberries. Most people say they don&#x27;t smell like anything at all. I had to burn candles and incense to try to get rid of the smell that totally permeated my house. Additionally, the packaging for this product is pretty terrible. They arrive in  just a plastic zip lock bag. you would think maybe for a product that is supposed to be all natural the packaging would be a bit more conscious. Over all, I would never purchase these again, and I feel that this experience has turned me off from every wanting to give any other brand of soapberries a try in the future :(</li>
    <li> Soapberries or soap nuts work well for my children with excema.  They dull white clothes, though.  And I use 2 or 3 bags of about 6 nuts in each bag per load, rather than one.</li>
    <li> Did several loads with the soap nuts yesterday. Had to replace the nuts after just two loads, but I had allowed one of the loads to soak for a while before washing, so that may have been why they didn&#x27;t last as long as I had read they would. Laundry came out clean &amp; smelling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have two complaints - the first is that not all of the soap nuts are deseeded as described. With just a quick glance I found at least 3 right at the top of the bag which still had seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second, more minor complaint is about the muslin bag. Once closed, it&#x27;s almost impossible to open when it&#x27;s wet to check/replace the seeds. I would suggest using a hair tie or something similar to close the bag instead of the drawstrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to add: As I told the seller in a comment, I&#x27;d add to my review if I didn&#x27;t find the seeds to continue to be an issue. Since those first 3 seeds, I haven&#x27;t found any more, so I&#x27;m very happy with the product &amp; have upgraded my rating to 5 stars from 4.</li>
    <li> I like it. It is very  helpful to clean my stuff in kitchen or my hair. I used it instead of shampoo.When I washed my hair, I found my hair is more shine than before.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the soap nuts and I must say that I really like using them instead of store bought laundry soap. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I feel very confident using these with all my laundry. I also add vinegar to my wash and use the wool dryer balls in the dryer. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love my soap nuts! If you haven&#x27;t tried soap nuts yet you should! I like the Greenwill soap nuts best. They seem to last longer than other soap nuts. I wash laundry for 5 people with these. The clothes smell clean, no added fragrances or chemicals, just clean. My husband works for a natural gas company and the the soap nuts even clean his laundry well, although you need to pretreat heavy grease stains just like you do with detergent. Several members of our family have sensitive skin and cannot use some types of laundry detergent but have not had any problems with the soap nuts. We have even given several friends and family members samples and they have now switched to using soap nuts.</li>
    <li> My reasons for buying this were first, curiosity, and then that these are not damaging to plants and groundwater, and there&#x27;s less packaging waste. You can put the cardboard box and brown paper bag it came in into your compost. We have a laundry-to-landscape system and I do have some questions as to whether or not these inhibit plant growth. I&#x27;ve read that there&#x27;s something in it that inhibits germination, kind of like hackberry or walnut is said to, but it didn&#x27;t seem to negatively impact our native plants. Clothes washed in soapberries do have a subtle scent that reminds me of creosote after a storm. But they don&#x27;t get your clothes dazzlingly clean, by any means. My husband gets heavily soiled with his work sometimes and these don&#x27;t quite cut it. So if you only experience light soil and don&#x27;t wear white clothing these might work for you.</li>
    <li> Package arrived in 2 days in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve already used some of the soap nuts for my laundry. I&#x27;m going to try them in the dishwasher next.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with these soap nuts.  Cleans the clothes very well and according to the pamphlet that came with them, there are other suggested uses for them, too.  Cant wait to try them out!  All of the product came well protected and packaged, and in a timely manner. Very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this for all my cleaning. Dish washing especially cleans oils off glass no problem! Hair shampoo, laundry, counters and veggie rinse as well. Boil the nuts in water and strain in nut milk bag and store in fridge for a week or freeze in ice cube trays. These soup berries produce a darker and more potent solution than the store brands for sure and the are organic! This is my second order so far and I am pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> These soap berries from Greenwill are the only ones I will use. I have tried some other company&#x27;s berries or soap nuts and they don&#x27;t compare in quality. Greenwill soap berries make so much more soap than any of the others, and they are seedless. Some companies give you a hardened berry with the seed which makes it harder to use and yields less of the good stuff. I love to boil them and put the liquid into a bath &amp; body works foaming soap container. The soap berry solution FOAMS up just like the chemical laden bath &amp; body works stuff and works even better, leaving my skin soft and fresh and clean!!! I also only use the soap berries for my shampoo now, if you haven&#x27;t tried it please do (you will love the results).</li>
    <li> I love it. It smell great and natural! I am using it for bath, hand wash, face, Shampoo. I am still learning how to make it works better. It&#x27;s not that strong clean like the Chemical soap.</li>
    <li> I am sold on these. My husband...not as much, but he doesn&#x27;t do the laundry so whatever. Ha! I use these to wash everything, and I have been using them to wash everything for about 3 months now. They work great. They can even get big bacon grease stains out of a towel (not even kidding). If you need a little extra oomph from them, you can stop the wash cycle when the tub is full of water and soak the clothes for a bit (or use pre-soak if you have a fancy washer). That&#x27;ll do it. But otherwise, on normal loads, I just run it as normal and stuff comes out clean and smelling great. And then I compost the soap nuts when I am done. It&#x27;s just my husband and I, but we do a lot of laundry (not to brag, but...you know), and I&#x27;ve not even used 1/3 of the soap nuts in the 1.5 pound batch yet, in 3 months. Love it!</li>
    <li> One pound of soapnuts is great to have because I&#x27;ve been discovering online other ways to use these. It comes with a little cloth laundry bag too.</li>
    <li> Love my new washing routine! These soap nuts really do a good job!  Prior to this I bought borax and washing soda and added a little of both to my washer before starting a load along with a little shredded soap and a splash of shout stain treater. But now I toss in my little muslin bag with 3-4 nuts in it, and my magnet ball from Norwex, (softens water) and I am done.  Load after load, these two items stay in the washer, I load my clothes and hit start. They come out and smell clean.  I am really impressed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Greenwill on amazon and I received it in a timely manner and it was packaged well. I have found more uses for this product than I thought I&#x27;d find and the soapnuts suds up very well. I will not hesitate to purchase this product from this seller again when needed, the only problem is they last so darn long that it may be quite awhile before I need more. :)&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 13, 2013. I still have most of the bag of soapnuts. They seem to last forever. I have found that adding some essential oil or a bit of orange oil makes the scent more pleasant to deal with, otherwise it is very very bland. They really do not have a soapy smell.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using soap nuts for our household laundry for several months now. Family of five, including 3 boys and all laundry gets clean. So much easier to use than liquid or powder detergent. I have 2 separate bags that each contain 3 soap nuts for more even soap distribution. LOVE that there is no artificial scent, just clean clothes. We often use cold water and have had no issues with clothes not getting clean. So surprised at the efficiency and effectiveness of something that is not widely known about!! I am so glad we gave these little nuts a try. :)</li>
    <li> We received these Soapberries recently and have used them for cleaning dishes (everything came out sparkling and fresh), washing laundry (everything was perfectly soft, smelled fresh, and was clean!), bathe and wash hair (feels great to get away from chemical soaked hygiene products). It has worked in every test we have put it through so far. Even my wife&#x27;s wedding set came out extremely shiny and clean when we soaked it in this liquid. We will definitely be incorporating more natural products into our lives that have been around for thousands of years!</li>
    <li> Great product, don&#x27;t need any additional softener.  The clothes come soft and fluffy.</li>
    <li> We cloth diaper, and we use these for our laundry.  We have been very pleased with the results!  For a more detailed review please see http://www.raisethemnatural.com/2015/05/greenwill-soapberry-review.html</li>
    <li> ...... but we are adding to our laundry and using less soap and the clothes come out just as clean. Funny little things.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about soapberries, but I never really thought they&#x27;d be able to handle all my laundry needs. A dried berry? For washing clothes? It can&#x27;t be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came with a little canvas pouch that you just add a few berries into, tie it up, and toss it in the washer. You can get like 3-5 washes out of them before you need to change the berries out. The clothes come out lightly soapberry scented. The berries have a light fruity and nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are these good in a normal washing machine, but I&#x27;ve also used them camping with a bucket and plunger &amp;#34;washing machine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I love soapberries!  I boil about 15 up to one hour in about 3-4 cups of water, strain, freeze in 2 ice cube trays and use 2-3 for each load of wash.  Smells gone.  Not so good for whites and spots but I use local stain removers or whitener if I need to.  Cheap way to wash.  My daughter adds those fragrance beads, I don&#x27;t.  Husband uses some of the liquid to wash his hair.  I put it in those small spray bottles.  Eliminates itch but only lasts about 1-2 weeks at room temperature, then you need to throw it out so don&#x27;t use much at a time.  Keep liquid in refrigerator if you have extra.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from allergies associated with OTC soaps and cleaning products.  We have been searching for ways to eliminate toxic chemicals in our life, so an adventure to find better products began. The soap berries are easy, chemical, dye, and wasted packaging free.  They work great and have been a big help in ridding our laundry of nasty chemicals. Green will had great prices, super fast service and free shipping. I will definitely use them again!,,</li>
    <li> My son ordered these and gave them to me.  I have been using soap nuts for several years and have tried several “brands”. I usually avoid products from China but my son thought that based on the price, the promise that Chinese berries have a higher soap content and that they were China Certified Organic, I should give them a try. Well, you get what you pay for. I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1. They came in a plastic zip lock bag. There was no package seal of any kind. (note: Greenwill states that berries are packaged at their facility in SC but the address is a residence??)&lt;br /&gt;2. The bag was in bad shape and had a tear at the bottom. I didn’t do this opening the box as the air bags where on the top (kudos for amazon packing).&lt;br /&gt;3. The wash bag is only single stitched which makes me question whether it will last.&lt;br /&gt;4. There was no information sent in that provides verification of Chinese organic certification and there was no information on the company website that did this either.&lt;br /&gt;5. I tested a Greenwill berry against another company’s berry using equal size berries. I used identical jars, each containing 1 cup of water. I let the berries soak for a while then shook the jars equally. The other berry made over twice as much suds. I&#x27;m going to try to submit pictures.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to have my son return these as they are not as described in the listing.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these to bring my Amazon total purchase price up, to qualify for supersaver shipping. I had seen them before and was interested, but had forgotten about them.  Amazon suggests that I add so many more dollars to bring my total dollars spent to qualify,so I search for items within that price range, lo and behold soap nuts in a small package. Perfect, I decide this is a good size and price to try. I have done two loads of colored cold water laundry large capacity. The first came out smelling like a different kind of clean (I mean this in a good way) the next was a comforter that had been in storage and had a funky smell, no more funky smell! I also boiled a handful (as I saw in a helpful YouTube video) and am currently trying the liquid for dishes, and can&#x27;t wait to try for washing my hair. Packaging was a good choice in my opinion, a simple paper bag, taped closed. They were also shipped promptly and arrived in 2-3 days. Even at a small package which means more money, they were still the best value I could see listed. Of course if you buy the bigger packages save even more money, which I&#x27;m sure I will be doing. I plan to buy a large pack and store in my handy dandy  sealable, 5 gallon buckets that are great for long term storage.  Thanks Greenwill and Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with soap nuts and I really want them to work.  I have tried everything but they do not seem to be getting the job done.  Even the load of wash that are not difficult, I have become concerned that I am simply washing them with water.  First of all they did not come with the complimentary cotton wash bag.  I bought some separately.  I have used between three and seven soap nuts with the same results.  Sometimes I suspect they may be working because there is occasionally a sticky residue that requires an additional rinse cycle.  I tried them with a small load of cloth diapers with horrible results.  They did nothing to get rid of the stains or smells.  I tried them with my two year old&#x27;s clothes that had urine on them.  It did not get rid of the smell.  I made the tea by soaking the nuts in hot water before using them with colds.  This is the only load that I cannot officially complain about because the clothes really did not smell that bad to begin with.  Although when I smell my armpits, I start to believe that it also did not work in these situations.  I want to use soap nuts but I do not think this is the company to buy from or the soap nuts to use unless I got a bad batch.  If anyone has suggestions, I will gladly take them.</li>
    <li> Great product for laundry and hair wash!</li>
    <li> I thought I would absolutely love this type of product. I really did. But unfortunately I have to write a negative review. These &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; nuts actually somewhat bleached my clothes. I know that sounds crazy but it really has! I have had to toss out several articles of clothing because of the white-ish spots I got after washing them with soap nuts. I don&#x27;t know if this is a case of bad nuts or a known thing but I am not going to continue using anything, even if it&#x27;s natural, if I run the risk of the product ruining my clothing. Back to regular laundry detergent for the mean time.</li>
    <li> I have used soap berries for 8 years (EVERYTHING I USE IN MY HOME AND BEAUTY IS 100% NATURAL) PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE - DO YOUR RESEARCH on this company and the soap berries they offer!  The company is outright telling lies in their description and they are selling soap nuts/berries that are EXTREMELY INFERIOR to other REPUTABLE brands that are CERTIFIED ORGANIC!!!!!!!!  This company keeps popping up with different names and different descriptions.  The USDA case against them wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;CLOSED&amp;#34; - the company was ordered to cease the fraudulent abuse of USDA Organic Certification compliance. and their website was terminated.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!  Darker soap berries/nuts ARE NOT A GOOD THING - they have too much moisture and will ROT!!!!!!  The DARKER the berry, the OLDER the berry - and soap berries are one product you DO NOT WANT OLD!  The picture being used in this listing is comparing their soap nuts/berries to USED berries and has been used MULTIPLE TIMES by this company in other &amp;#34;incarnations&amp;#34;. Ask the company if their packing and handling facilities in the US are USDA certified to do so.  If you are going to go GREEN with your life, please do so responsibly and make sure you are dealing with a REPUTABLE COMPANY!.  Once you use TRUE ORGANIC SOAP BERRIES - you will KNOW the difference!</li>
    <li> We in India use these soap berries as shampoo for hair. when I looked at amazon for these I found that these are used as detergent. Today I used it for both. I washed my hair and my clothes too.I must say I am pretty satisfied. The later is quite wonderful. I boiled just about 10 berries and used as shampoo for entire family of four and laundry. Thank you for the price I bought it.  when compared to all others in the list I found this for the minimal price I thought for a try and am very proud I made that decision.</li>
