      <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to be the original revita shampoo i used before!</li>
      <li>This is a great product one of the key components to fighting hairloss.</li>
      <li>Great for thinning hair, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had hair this healthy since high school!!  </li>
      <li>She had bald spots and super fine hair...</li>
      <li>; I had to call and ask when it would be delivered,  Original estimated delivery date was January 24-29</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner so much!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cool feel on the scalp.</li>
      <li>bottle is better than the other kind that leaked</li>

      <li>You are supposed to leave the shampoo on your hair for about 3-5 minutes unlike other shampoos that you should rinse out right away.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still in trial stage.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be the original revita shampoo i used before! The color and texture is totally different than the last one. last one i bought from GNC.</li>
    <li> Not seeing any results just yet.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re hair is thinning, it just MAY be the thing.  It takes some time, but so far I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have all my patients that experience hair loss to use this amazing shampoo.  Sometimes during the year I tend to shed hair and clog the shower.  NO one hair is loss whenever I use this shampoo.  I think is an amazing product to help keep your hair healthy and on your scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner so much!  Been using it now for about 7-8 months and my hair is much thicker, stronger, and grows fast.  My friends always ask me how is it looking so great?!  It is Revita!  My best friend&#x27;s hair is amazing too!  She had bald spots and super fine hair... now after a year of using it, it is thick, long and full like it was in high school!  I swear by it!</li>
    <li> Bought shampoo and conditioner combo pack works ok. I do think it&#x27;s a little different from the small bottles I bought , but I think it is still pretty good , and I am very satisfied with Amazon came very quickly and packaged very well. I will be using Amazon in the future.... Thank you....</li>
    <li> Use these products with the DNC topical hair loss treatment and the results are really wonderful.  However, these products used by themselves will make the hair fuller and healthier.</li>
    <li> I was loosing hair by the handfulls due to female hormone changes and this shampoo and conditioner made a world of difference.  Not only did my hair start growing back but all of my hair felt thicker!</li>
    <li> To be fair I just started using the shampoo and conditioner so I can&#x27;t give a fair assessment yet. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well.  I don&#x27;t use it every day and I only apply it once rather than twice as directed, but it causes noticeably fewer hairs to fall out when I comb out the tangles. This provider was very late delivering it and did not notify me that it was back ordered; I had to call and ask when it would be delivered,  Original estimated delivery date was January 24-29 but it did not come until two or three weeks later..</li>
    <li> This is a great product one of the key components to fighting hairloss. Match this up with fin and Lenox.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product now for about 3 months.  We&#x27;re amazed!  Since my hair has started to gradually thin, I just ordered some for me too!  Love this product but it&#x27;s habit forming.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;Just need a small quantity of the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Pump bottle is better than the other kind that leaked</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son and he is really happy with the product!</li>
    <li> @nd batch of this stuff, once again, not a high lathering product but a definite improvement of holding on to what you got. Slightly hard to rinse out, leaves hair manageable with a noticeable sheen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working but, being patient.  It&#x27;s going slow.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any watering down as was reported in some reviews, but that&#x27;s just me. I used the shampoo before, but this is the first time I tried the conditioner and I like it&#x27;s cool feel on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing for hair growth.  My stylist sold me some from her salon because I had a lot of hair breakage due to over processing and stress.  I bought this through Amazon at a much cheaper price than my salon!  I bought the larger size and now a few months later I have new hair growth and it&#x27;s coming back in even healthier and thicker than my baby fine hair had before.  I haven&#x27;t had hair this healthy since high school!!  You are supposed to leave the shampoo on your hair for about 3-5 minutes unlike other shampoos that you should rinse out right away.  This product&#x27;s nutrients absorb into the hair shaft while you shower.  If you are losing your hair I would highly recommend this!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
