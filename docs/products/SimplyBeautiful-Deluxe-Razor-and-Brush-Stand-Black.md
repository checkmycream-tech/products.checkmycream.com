<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Broke my first razor when it fell out of the medicine cabinet. This stand has been great.</li>
    <li> I use this stand to hold two black handled razors I own.  Looks wonderful.  I have a chrome stand like it for my brush and silver handle razor.</li>
    <li> Perfect holder for my razor and brush. Heavy enough that it cannot be easily tipped over.</li>
    <li> Stand fits nicely into cabient and out of the way. Holds razor and brush fine.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stand is a classier alternative to the cheap plastic stand that came with my shaving brush. It is stable and stout. The finish seems consistent and fairly durable. It fits my brush and razor perfectly. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> My brush is constantly falling. It is ok, depends on your brush maybe.</li>
    <li> Very Clean.  Love the black stand with my Parker 96R Handle.</li>
    <li> Had to bend the brush holder because it was too small.&lt;br /&gt;Works OK now.</li>
    <li> Excatly how described, happy I purchased this stand.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking and sturdy, the only reason I give it four stars is my brush does not fit at the handle. I have to put the brush in at the base of the bristles so it sits high. The handle isn&#x27;t particularly large so I think the mouth of the holder could be slightly bigger. I would still buy again as it looks great and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> heavier and stronger then I thought it would be, its good built solid .... fit my &amp;#34;long handled &amp;#34;merkur safety razor&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger &amp;#34;Shaving...</li>
    <li> This is the perfect stand for my husbands merker safety razor and badger brush.</li>
    <li> also bought this for my son for Christmas. It was exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Does the job and does it well. Looks decent by my sink, coupled with my gold-plated Merkur and my badger brush.</li>
    <li> very well made, not a cheap plastic feel.</li>
    <li> Arrived far ahead of schedule and was fully assembled. Absolutely met all standards and looks great with my razor and brush.</li>
    <li> Had this for about 6 months now. Heavy base, and it fits all my razors and brushes. If you have brushes over about 24mm, this is probably not for you, as my largest is a tight fit. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great place to hang your &amp;#34;in-use&amp;#34; razor and brush. It hasn&#x27;t showed any signs of rust and the finish hasn&#x27;t worn at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor/brush stand. I especially like the weight of the product. It feels as though it will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I love this elegant but heavy stand.</li>
    <li> Quality is my thing. This is quality. It has some heft to it and feels very sturdy with both brush and razor on it. I don&#x27;t feel i will knock this over when I am rummaging around the bathroom before I have my coffee in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a DE safety razor as a gift this Christmas with a black handle. I purchased this stand and a black handled brush to go with it and I am very pleased with how it looks sitting on my bathroom counter. Seems classier than all chrome to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for the brush I bought to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B1TKY8C SimplyBeautiful Basic Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
    <li> Nice heavy base, never tips over.</li>
    <li> the only thing to consider i think would be the brush size. it is a bit small, so it ended up fitting where the bristles meet the handle on mine instead of on the handle itself.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Christmas.  It fit his new brush and razor perfectly.  We love the finish of it. It has held up well for the 2.5 months he&#x27;s used it.  I&#x27;m interested to see how it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> The stand has some weight to it, and has a rubber/foam bottom so it won&#x27;t slide around the counter unless you want it to. The razor opening is perfect for my 40 year old double edge.  The brush holder will fit my very large brush (old original pure badger) where the bristle meets the handle.  Very clean lines..</li>
    <li> Solid metal with matte-black finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably heavy base makes this stand more than adequately stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush holder may not accommodate larger brush handles.</li>
    <li> A very nice looking stand in black</li>
    <li> Love this thing has style and durability would recommend to others</li>
    <li> Grade a stand. Great construction and material.</li>
    <li> Not all razors can hang from it.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for the boyfriend. He really likes it. It was the coolest looking one I could find that wouldn&#x27;t look bad in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> At least nothing I can see so far. simple and sturdy. i don&#x27;t see a part where it can rust vs. the others. it fits my merkur 34c easily and my badger shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Amazon really seems to push the chrome versions of this type of stand, from my browsing around, but I typed in &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; specifically on a hunch and was rewarded with this little number. I really like this thing! I wouldn&#x27;t have minded if it was a tiny bit shorter, as I&#x27;ve got the shorter-handled Merkur 34C (which you should all use, period). It&#x27;s not too big a deal, though, as it is still rock solid at the base and it would probably be silly for them to make two models for this type of thing. If you&#x27;re worried about the stand, it&#x27;s awesome; if you&#x27;re worried about the color, stop worrying and get it!</li>
    <li> Nice, solid and heavy. It holds a brush and a razor together or separately without tipping over. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great looking and helpful to dry out and keep shaving stuff out of harm&#x27;s way!</li>
    <li> This stand is great, it is very heavyweight and holds both the razor and brush as discribed.  Finish does not show water spots.</li>
    <li> I bought a Chrome Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and it fits good in this stand and also a shaving brush which fits well on the other side. The quality is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husbands shaving brush.  After a lot of research I decided to go with this particular stand. A lot of reviews for the chrome style stands people stated that they would show signs of rust over time. I figured since this is a darker color it wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable. So far its held up perfectly!</li>
    <li> Nice heavy stand. Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to hold my Merkur 20C double edge safety razor and shaving brush. Does the job well. I didn&#x27;t want anything chrome as keeping chrome spotless around water can be high maintenance. This stand is very slightly glossy, almost matte, black, and looks great. The stand is substantial, has more weight than you would expect, has a sturdy rubber base to prevent slipping, easy to clean... can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> For those looking at this thinking it looks fragile, cheap or plasticy, so did I. Very much so impressed with this product. It&#x27;s a sturdy, heavy metal stand that looks awesome. Something different from all of the other steel looking stands, you won&#x27;t be disappointing.</li>
    <li> The base is nice and heavy and its beautiful and of high quality.  The mat black finish looks great.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The picture of this razor and brush holder makes it look fragile and tippy.  The real item, however, is rock solid.  It&#x27;s weighty enough that no matter how heavy the brush and razor are, it won&#x27;t tip over.  In addition, it&#x27;s very attractive.  A great item at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Great stand! Looks great in the bathroom. Wife is happy that all my stuff is neat. I have a Parker 99 and a simply beautiful badger brush that I use the stand with and i honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A solid shaving brush and razor holder.  It will not hold a Gillette Fusion Power, but it will hold the new Schick Hydro, which is what I&#x27;m using now.  A little taller than is needed, but I guess if your brush is longer, or your handle on your razor, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> My wife surprised me with this just for a &amp;#34;Tuesday present&amp;#34; as she refers to it. A present that is not for a special occasion just because she is one of the awesome women, I am lucky enough to have. I hang my Parker brush in it along with my cheap Harry&#x27;s razor. Nice and heavy to keep from tipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for my Merkur Long handle saftey razor (http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Long-Handled-Safety-Razor/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1392954261&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;merkur+safety+razor) and a Art of Shaving Badger brush. It works great, looks great. Allows the brush to hang low enough and far enough away from the upright as not to affect the bloom. Plus, I just really prefer the all black look, looks great in contrast to the bright chrome of the razor</li>
    <li> I found that the typical razor does not sit well in the holder so I wrapped the razor head with a matching cloth covered elastic.  That keeps it in its place.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up this razor stand.  first, I expected that I would have put it together.  Instead, it arrived fully assembled.  It is a bit heavier and sturdier than I expected.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> ENJOYING THE NEW STAND - MAKES U FEEL GROWN UP! LOL  AND THE STAND ACTUALLY FITS THE SHAVING BRUSH WHERE IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO.  DOWN ON THE HANDLE AND NOT CRAMPING THE BRISTLES LIKE IN ONE OF THE PHOTOS ALTHOUGH U COULD HANG YOURS LIKE THAT.  PURCHASED MY SHAVING KIT (BRUSH INCLUDED) FROM &amp;#34;The  ART of SHAVING&amp;#34; - FOUND IN MOST MALLS OR ON LINE.  BRUSH FITS LIKE THEY WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER...  AND THE RAZOR STANDS UP QUITE NICELY AS WELL!  NOTHING LIKE AN EYE&#x27;S FULL OF OF SHAVING CREAMS AFTER SHAVING YOUR HEAD AND HANGING UP YOUR RAZOR NEXT TO THE BRUSH WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED ON THE FIRST TRY.  AND IT&#x27;S SAID THAT IF YOU WANT TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF SOME VERY EXPENSIVE SHAVING BRUSHES, THEN YOU NEED TO HANG YOURS (HAND MADE OR NOT!)...  I LIKE IT BETTER THAN CHROME.  MATTE BLACK LOOKS STEALTHY AND IS STURDY ON THE COUNTER IN THE BATHROOM.  LOOKS A LITTLE MORE SHINY IN PERSON THAN DULL ON THIS PIC.  A GREAT BUY AND WAAAAAAAAAY CHEAPER THAN THE $50 - $150 STANDS &amp;#34;The ART of SHAVING&amp;#34; WAS SELLING.</li>
    <li> Very modern looking &amp; won&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;rusted look&amp;#34; like the chrome ones do. Have been using it everyday &amp; works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a elegant stand, i have a Parker badger brush that is black with a chrome butt and wanted something to accent the brush.  This stand does the trick! Not only does it compliment the brush, the stand is made well and of sturdy material. Base is thick and balanced and looks great on the sink.  My razor is anodized black as well and all together it looks quite nice.  Would recommend this to anyone putting together their own shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I have to rave about was the shipping, got here fast and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied met expectations glad to have space for both razor and brush. Had searched for a long time for this item</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a surprise. It is weighted nicely and the finish is so pretty. Our bathroom is cream and white, his shave brush is ivory and his mug is a light maple. He has a two tone Murker razor. It&#x27;s really pretty with the dark post. Very nice quality. Feel confident in your purchase of this product. My husband is very proud of it.</li>
    <li> The chrome one I bought, broke in two within a month of use.  This one looks like it&#x27;ll hold up.  Gave it 4 stars, because I think it is too expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed the stand to hold and display my badger brush and razor. It works great and arrived exactly as described. It is very solid and sturdy.</li>
    <li> The stand hold my safety razor nicely, but doesn&#x27;t hold my Art of Shaving brush properly. Have to mount the brush between the base and the bristles, not on the ring at the bottom where it should mount.</li>
    <li> Just like a lot of the other reviews say, too small at the top to fit the handle of the brush at the base.</li>
    <li> Good stand, though I wish the razor holder had a little longer fork.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Harry&#x27;s Truman razor and the Escali shaving brush.  It keeps them handy and allows them to air-dry rapidly.</li>
    <li> Chrome shaving stands are very common and show water marks easily. This black stand is matte and not shiny and sometimes I&#x27;m in the mood for something different. I have a chrome stand that I use with chrome finish razors and I use this one for matte finish/black handle razors.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this stand. It is very stable and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Nice weight, functional and looks great! Must have for the wet-shaving enthusiast.</li>
    <li> I purchased this stand to use with the Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.  I was initially concerned that the black stand would look odd against the natural wood colored shaving brush handle.  However, after getting it setup, I am quite pleased with the contrast.  The stand is sturdy and appears well made.  I am confident I will get many years of satisfied use from this stand.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, stylish, and hasn&#x27;t rusted at all in the 6 months I&#x27;ve had it, all for a low price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I went through so many listings for stands until I finally found this one.  I wanted a nice matte black because the silver toned metallic stands always show water spots and often rust.  This stand is not completely flat matte finish, but it is not a glossy enamel, either.  It is just right between those two extremes.  It wipes clean easily, and holds my Parker handle fine, though I have to rest it at the screw under the blade holder assembly.  It sits perfectly, though.  No wobbling.  The brush fits in its spot without any rocking and the set looks nice sitting on the counter between shaves.  I am quite pleased with this piece.  It has a good weight to it, so there is little risk of knocking it over when picking up your brush or razor.  I would recommend this stand to anyone who is using a double edge razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I just tried my stand with the Weishi gunmetal color razor handle.  It is a perfect fit, and rests the way you would expect it to rest, with the blade holder section of the handle sitting right on the arms of the stand.  Either handle looks great on this stand, just note that some might find it awkward with the Parker sitting on the handle screw.  This doesn&#x27;t bother me, since it sits steady in its place.  If anything, it might be beneficial, since it allows air to get completely under the butterfly assembly, lessening the chance of having either the handle or the stand rust over time.</li>
    <li> I viewed a lot of stands, chose this one because it was not cheap-shiny.  Hold my brush and razor perfectly, is sturdily constructed, and I like the utilitarian look/design of it.  The  base is well weighted...unusually, it shows no &amp;#34;made in&amp;#34; ... it may have come from Mars but it appears to be of very good quality.</li>
    <li> Finally my husband has somewhere to put his brush and razor.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I had to adjust the tines on both sides upward bit to keep my razor and badger-hair brush from falling off of it at the slightest nudge, but has worked really well since then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted countless hours looking for a shave stand.  There are dozens of these for sale from different manufacturers, but they are all of the shiny, stainless steel variety.  The problem with those is that they can look cheap, depending on the finish (&amp;#34;cheap-shiny&amp;#34; as another reviewer put it), and they also don&#x27;t look very appealing unless they&#x27;re very clean.  I took a gamble and it paid off.  This one feels substantial and solid, the finish is nice, and it has the look I was hoping for.  My brush (24mm - whipped dog) is too big to fit the way I had hoped, from the grip, so I hang it where the bristles meet the grip.  Great product, I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I like the stand, but the brush doesn&#x27;t fit well.  it doesn&#x27;t sit straight up in the space and tilts to one side.  the stand that came with the brush fits better, but doesn&#x27;t have a place for the razor....what to do?</li>
    <li> Received this as a Christmas present, along with razor and brush. This is heavy at 8.2oz or 232 grams and very stable. It holds my Edwin Jagger DE89 Safety Razor and my Finest Badger Chrome Shaving Brush perfectly. The bright chrome of the razor and brush looks outstanding against the smooth flat back stand. There are many to choose from, some cheaper some more expensive, for the money this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> If you have the battery operated razors it won&#x27;t fit in the groove. I have Shick Hydro and it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> This is a very attractive stand.  Holds both brush and razor. Matches my bathroom decoy to a tee. Hopefully will hold up to the test of time.</li>
    <li> This works great for my husband!</li>
    <li> Stand does exactly what I bought it for. Holds my razor and brush off the counter and let&#x27;s them dry appropriately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now, and I&#x27;m really happy with it.  Fits my Merkur razor and Semogue brush just fine, although the razor sits at a little bit of an angle due to the length of the razor-holder arms.  It still looks great and seems solidly built with none of the upkeep of chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 7/21/14: I&#x27;m editing this review to reflect that I just got a new brush (an HIS synthetic), and the stand won&#x27;t hold the brush in the middle of the handle - I have to wedge it in by the knot, which I&#x27;m afraid could damage the fibers.  So, if the stand fits your brush, it&#x27;s awesome, but you may have to return it if not.</li>
    <li> A great value. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> Perfect accessory for my Merkur razor and for allowing the shaving brush to dry after use.</li>
    <li> This has a much more premium feel than I was expecting.  Like the extra weight and build quality.</li>
    <li> Thie is a beautiful and very productive item.  Allows a convenient locale to rest your razor and your shaving brush.  I wouls recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I chose this razor and brush stand because I wanted something different than just the standard chrome or silver finish. This standard vertical style is very classy looking and made well. The base is weighted for stability and construction is tight. The finish is smooth and easy to keep clean (just wipe off water spots with a towel). It is a perfect fit with the other items used in my shaving ensemble. Price is reasonable, especially since there are not a lot of black finish items on the market. My brush fits the holder at the point between the hair bristles and handle. I use a Fusion razor on a black &amp; chrome handle. This stand balances the razor perfectly at the indention of the black handle below the razor. The final look is stylish and classy&lt;br /&gt;Anyone would be happy with this stand.</li>
    <li> This stand besides having an overall good look is the perfect accessory for your shaving gear. It&#x27;s minimal design lets your razor and brush dry quickly.</li>
    <li> The only problem is the stand doesn&#x27;t fit a narrow razor</li>
    <li> I bought this as a beginner tool to hold my Escali Badger Brush and a Parker 22R razor. They both fit perfectly in it without having to make any adjustments/modifications. The stand is very light and sturdy. I&#x27;ve seen reviews about the chrome ones rusting, so I took a chance on the black one, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the finish on this one.</li>
    <li> Does not fit my husband&#x27;s razor, the brush fits though. Just make sure to measure before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful piece that is well balanced and weighted to withstand tipping over.  Holds straight razor and brush adequately for drying and use.  Good buy and ...Simply Beautiful!</li>
    <li> Nice and sturdy, heavier than you expect. Holds my brush and DE shaver nicely.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, and elegantly accommodates my heavy, long handled Parker razor. With ease.</li>
    <li> The brush side is too narrow.  I have to hang my brush where the bristles meet the handle.  This makes the brush protrude quite a bit over the top.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor stand for the bathroom in our beach condo.  I like the black color and sturdy design - it hold my razor and brush for my beachside digs!</li>
    <li> great finish, sturdy, and will not tip OVER. SITS WITH MY SHAVING MUG AND THE TWO OF THEM LOOK GREAT. WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> The stand does the trick, and it does it in style. Prior to purchase, I was concerned with buying a black plastic-y looking stand but those concerns were quelled once I saw it in person for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Completes the shaving kit and my fussy wife will actually allow it on the countertop!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Great looking brush and razor stand and I like the black color. Weighted well as it sits inside my scuttle when not in use.</li>
    <li> The stand is a great alternative to the glut of chrome stands on the market.  It fits the [[ASIN:B001XURHAC Evernice Progress Model 247 Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Chrome Handle]] and the [[ASIN:B0067PSOO6 Parker 92R Ultra Heavyweight Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor &amp; 5 Shark Super Chrome Blades]] perfectly and provides a nice contrast to the chrome accents in the razor and the brush.  It is sturdy and won&#x27;t topple over. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Fits my Art of Shaving products perfectly</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was hoping for! It has a good weight to it to keep it stable. It&#x27;s not too big. It also feels like it&#x27;s made very well. Overall a great addition to my bathroom.</li>
    <li> nice simple stand fits my fusion handle and art of shaving brush perfectly</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Great transaction!</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to. Love it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful way to display your favorite razor &amp; brush. Fork for the brush is tight enough that you will have to hang most bushes at the knot so if your handle is very large, it may become top heavy. nice padded base.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as part of a new shaving experience Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice to have  everything all together and easily accessible. It doesn&#x27;t hold the razor he has now but it&#x27;s easy enough to buy a differently angled razor.</li>
    <li> Great stand. Great quality. My husband loved his Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> Just a wonderful stand.  Great quality and craftsmanship. I love it.</li>
    <li> This black chrome stand is the perfect accessory to hold your safety razor blade. It&#x27;s elegant, modern, and provides the necessary functionality to air dry your razor. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I wanted a decent razor and brush stand in order to reduce clutter in my bathroom.  Thankfully, Amazon has a large selection with extensive reviews. I chose this one because reviewers had mentioned it was a very high quality stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree.  Fit and finish are excellent.  The stand holds my Merkur razor and Art of Shaving Badger brush, perfectly.  I like it very much, and the price was a bargain compared to some of the other stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took the stand out of it&#x27;s shipping box I noticed that it appeared loose and wobbly.  I discovered that the parts thread together and a simple twist tightened everything up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaving brush and safety razor stand because another reviewer mentioned it fit the Art of Shaving brand of brushes. I have the Pure shaving brush that I purchased from AOS when I worked there, stupidly without the stand, and it does not fit. It will fit if you place the brush in the stand face down where the bristles meet the handle, but it will not fit at the base of the brush without some stretching of the stand or some force to get it in there. My brush was already cracked around the base from dropping it, so I took a file to the edges and wore them down a little to better fit the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the R89 Grande Safety Razor by M&amp;uuml;hle which is a taller safety razor and it fits perfectly. I was worried it may be too tall for this stand, but the stand is actually pretty tall itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is great quality for the price. As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s heavy duty, very stable, and the paint looks nice.</li>
    <li> It holds stuff and is sturdy</li>
    <li> My husband recently started shaving using a brush and old fashioned razor.  It is laying on his sink, which drives me nuts.  I asked him about a stand, and he said it was too expensive.  I went to look at how expensive (he was buying his items from an online shaving place) and the stand for his brush was around $80 or more dollars.  That is too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for other stands and found this one.  We have chrome fixtures, but bronze hardware on the cabinets, and a caramel and creme colored granite.  This is black, but looks similar to our antique bronze colored finishes.  It looks at home on his bathroom counter.  I read that some brands rust, and some colors flake, and some spot...this one had good reviews so I took a chance.  It is heavy, and his brush fits nicely.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Husband saw it and smiled.  Especially when I told him the price.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the stainless steal being spotless. I decided to get it in black just in case it gets any rust. But I haven&#x27;t seen anything yet. I make sure it is dry after I shave.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work with the Wet Shaving Product badger brush. Mach razor also kept falling off the holder.  Returned item.</li>
    <li> Good, brush holder portion could be less wide.  I have three different brushes that ALMOST fit.  I added rubber bands to the brush so that it doesn&#x27;t fall through.</li>
    <li> Looks great in my bathroom and provides me with easy access to my razor and brush. Has some weight to it. Feels like a quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very nice finish and sturdy design a little pricey though but nice and my shaveology razor fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> The stand looks exactly like the picture.  It&#x27;s padded on the bottom and weighted so it feels substantial and easily holds both my razor and brush.  If you&#x27;re curious, it&#x27;ll also hold just the razor or the brush without tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s be clear here, if you like the way it looks on your screen, you&#x27;ll be happy with how it looks when you open the box.</li>
    <li> sturdy, sleek and looks really good, what more can I ask for, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I am satisfied,burly construction.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this, fits the art of shaving brushes great!</li>
    <li> Great looking matte black stand! Also constructed very well. Unfortunately didn&#x27;t fit my parker brush the way I expected. Very sturdy, good looking stand.</li>
    <li> This accessory goes beautifully with my black &amp; white striped Frank Shaving badger brush. It is well balanced and sturdy enough for both brush and razor. It rarely needs cleaning, but when it does, I just rinse it off with water and dry it with a towel. It provides just the right touch of understated elegance in the bathroom and both safety razor and brush handle  fit without problems. I definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best inventions ever.  keeps razor and brush out of the way and dry I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Nice stand and looks good on sink counter!!!</li>
    <li> Looks great and does exactly what I bought it for. It holds my brush and safety razor without any issues.</li>
    <li> Nice Stand. Good weighting in base. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> five stars... it does exactly that it looks like it does and it does it well.</li>
    <li> great and stylish holder for my Edwinn Jagger DE89LBL razor and Badger hair shaving brush.</li>
    <li> Very stable, looks great, but holds brushes from the bottom not from the neck so cannot use my new brush that has a bigger handle on it. Great value if your brush is standard size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these stands that wasn&#x27;t a cheesy chrome or pewter or oak forever. Fits my double-edge safety razor and lather brush (is that what they&#x27;re called? Lather-er? Shaving soap whisk? I don&#x27;t know.) just fine. And it&#x27;s not cheesy chrome or something. Well made and handsome, kinda like me.</li>
    <li> The stand is beautiful...I had been keeping my razor and brush in the cabinet.  When my wife saw my brush and parker razor in the stand she moved it to the sink.  She said &amp;#34;It looks to good to hide&amp;#34;.  I love the fact that the water can drain out of my brush, it was always damp and misshapen when I kept it in a bowl.</li>
    <li> Have had this for at least 6 months or so and it still looks brand new...I love the flat black color and the base has good weight to it....does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Fits all my brushes perfectly. Looks sleek. Holds my Jagger DE razor like I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Heavy and heavy duty so it won&#x27;t tip easily.  Holds my razor and brush pretty easily.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice weighted base, does the job well.</li>
    <li> Like the previous reviewer mentioned, you might have to get a little creative with how you actually hang your razor and brush. That said, this stand holds my [[ASIN:B008WG9IP2 \\&quot;Prince\\&quot; High Density Premium Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B0067PSOO6 Parker 92R Ultra Heavyweight Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor]] very securely, and kind of presents them while they dry after a shave. The stand itself is very solid, and I&#x27;m a big fan of the flat black. So far, the stand hasn&#x27;t really accumulated water spots, and has been easy enough to clean. It&#x27;s a great way to store your razor and brush while simultaneously classing up the look of your bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made and what you expect. Nice weight so won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
    <li> Not only did it fit my Harry&#x27;s Truman razor perfectly - it also hung my brush by the handle instead of where the bristles meet the handle.  It looks so great - that I now display on our soapstone top vanity - and it looks great. Could not be happier!!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints at all! Holds my Semogue boar brush and Gillette Tech nicely. Looks great, and has held up well.</li>
    <li> A nice solidly weighted stand for brush and razor. Doesn&#x27;t take up a bunch of space.</li>
    <li> Nice stand,built well and looks great.</li>
    <li> Fits my Edwin Jagger 81SB586 brush and Edwin Jagger DE89L razor.  Looks great. Good heavy weight so no tipping. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The stand Looks great and simply works. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Plus I received it pretty quick too.</li>
    <li> I like this stand. It has some weight to it, which I like. I also think the black looks very nice. It can hold my brush and razor, so it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what it is. Well balanced and still looks great after 1 yr.</li>
    <li> Works great, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and looks good doing so. Holds my Edwin Jagger brush and razor without issue. Stand is large enough to hold long-handled razors as well. It is very sturdy, has a high-quality weight to it and the bottom has a nice, thick pad to keep it from sliding around and/or scratching the counter.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. It&#x27;s a great stand, good and sturdy and it matched his shaving set perfectly. We&#x27;re both happy, so 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, hood construction, good material. Fits my Perfect badger hair brush. While I&#x27;m waiting to receive my new safety razor I put an emergency Gillette fusion razor on it &amp; it fits perfectly. Great for the price &amp; helps keep your shaving tools organized. Now the bathroom sink is not an eye sore.</li>
    <li> Great item good weight to base means razor &amp; brush won&#x27;t tip over. Razor and brush fit well. Great matte finish not tooo fancy very simplistic. Great gift for any Olde time shavers. ^_^</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My husbands other shaving stand broke, and we were looking for a stand that wasn&#x27;t cheap looking like chrome. This stand has held up great, and looks very sophisticated.</li>
    <li> My razor handle needs to be pressed in because it&#x27;s too small but i bought their brush and that just slides in, other then that great product.</li>
    <li> It was a gift so I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> Looks great, works great, awesome stand!</li>
    <li> This attractive and elegant stand is very functional.&lt;br /&gt;There is no assembly, you take it out of the box and use it.&lt;br /&gt;The stand has enough weight to hold heavier razors without problems.&lt;br /&gt;My WSP Monarch brush hangs from the base ring not from the knot, an important point.&lt;br /&gt;One problem, my Boss Mach 3 razor will not hang properly, the razor holder is for a standard safety razor not the newer cartage type razors.&lt;br /&gt;I can get the razor to balance but it is an effort, using the stand and the wall the razor balances in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Simply Beautiful would have to redesign the razor holder side to accommodate cartage handles to fix this problem.</li>
    <li> The stand does what I bought it for.  It fits my rather large brush without any issue, comfortably holds a safety razor, and proved to be of surprisingly good weight and construction.</li>
    <li> Just came in 2 days ago, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it will hold up. But it looks and feels wonderful—has a great weight to it, particularly in the base. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It looks great and does the job. It was a nice gift for my husband. He likes it and is happy to have a place for his razor and brush to sit.</li>
    <li> Rock solid.  Doesn&#x27;t become unbalanced or tipsy if you take one item off.  Not sure it qualifies as &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m going to buy another for our other house.</li>
    <li> Got this stand to match my oil-rubbed bronze bath fixtures. Even nicer than expected! If your bronze finish is dark enough it will blend right in. Has a good rubber base that won&#x27;t scratch my sink. Fits the brush and razor well. Just right.</li>
    <li> Does not hold larger brush handles.</li>
    <li> Looks great and doesn&#x27;t rust like the chrome holder I had.</li>
    <li> Good quality, sturdy, attractive.</li>
    <li> This product is sturdy and looks and works great</li>
    <li> My brush was loosing more bristles than I could tolerate. I bought a new one and the handle was a little too big for forks with the large opening side of this stand, witch has pretty much standard size holder openings. I was not willing to hang my brush by the knot. And so what I did is I took some socks from my tool box, found one that was just a little too big for the opening for the brush forks, and GENTLY forced it in but not all the way. After tweaking the tongs up down to be even again,the new brush handle fit. This solved the problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am an old aircraft mechanic, and I understand what stress can do on some mettles. Tweak at your own risk. My procedure worked for me. If you try this adjustment, you do it at your own risk.</li>
    <li> great product.  As others said - it actually ends up being a very nice contrast for your equipment.  however it&#x27;s smaller than you think and while this seems logical and correct.. you end up easily moving it around on your counter than youd&#x27; like and thus things tipping over.  Yes the base is heavy.. but far too easy to bump the holder to tip it enough to drop things or move the stand.  I woudl recommend finding a bigger and heavier one.</li>
    <li> This is a great stand and even got my wifes approval to leave it on the counter top because it lots great.</li>
    <li> This particular brush and razor stand is both useful and sturdy. I find it to be a welcome addition to my shave area. I personally prefer the black finish, and that it not only looks sturdy, but also feels like a quality, well designed product. I would recommend it, and believe it comes at a good price.</li>
    <li> Solid&lt;br /&gt;mine came bent in the mail though... I easily bent it back into place though</li>
    <li> I have 3 stands and this is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Extra bonus! - If you have a Ikon Bulldog handle it can hang upside down by the smooth slot in the handle - Perfect fit!</li>
    <li> I got this to complement the black Merkur razor and black brush I bought.  Great looking and rather heavy, the finish is a nice matte and everything is joined and machined precisely.  It&#x27;s a great price for a slick modern look.</li>
    <li> My fiance was so happy with the stand for the first few months that he had it, but the other day the holder for the brush broke. It&#x27;s past the date for exchanging, and I don&#x27;t know if we got a defective one, but we are bummed.....</li>
    <li> smaller than expected but not at all a bad thing as ive just moved my new bathroom is cramped it fits my razor and brush my razor is a parker 96 and my brush was a synthetic one from the body shop its sturdy and i like that it matches my razor</li>
    <li> Looks sharp. Holds my razor well. The brush holder is not big enough for my brush, so that kind of defeats the whole purpose of purchasing a dual stand.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly with razor &amp; brush</li>
    <li> Great stand for the Art of Shaving products! Holds my badger brush and razor with ease. Overall great product with a sleek design and highly functional which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> All in all, I do like this stand.  Both my brush and the Futur fit a little wonky in it, but they do fit and it does hold them.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t look half bad.  My brush is a bit on the larger side, and it holds it between where the bristles meet the handle.  I was hoping for the top of the handle where there&#x27;s a metal butt.  Regardless, it&#x27;s still not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve seen a Futur, there is an indention in the handle that&#x27;s probably an inch or less in length.  That&#x27;s where this stand fits on the Futur.  The top of the Futur is too thick to hang by the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still recommend this product by all means, it just fit my supplies a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;Way better than sitting on the counter top though  :)</li>
    <li> Fits the bill, heavy and classic look. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Well built. Sturdy. Looks great with razor and a brush.</li>
    <li> Nice complement to my shaving items.</li>
    <li> A nice and inexpensive stand. It arrived quickly and I am happy.</li>
    <li> Holds my Merkur safety razor and badger hair shaving brush perfectly!</li>
    <li> Item is as described.  It&#x27;s got the weight to stand on it&#x27;s own no matter what razor or brush you have on it.  Holds everything very nice and keeps it off the counter.  Excellent place to let your brush and razor dry after a shave.</li>
    <li> Good stand, arrived quickly, looks nice, and build quality feels good. I have a Merkur razor and an Escali brush, holds both just fine. I should say, if your razor has a VERY fat handle, it may not hold it, but mine does have a fat handle, but with a slightly smaller indent at one spot, fits just fine in that area. Brush fits quite well.</li>
    <li> Great quality..did not fit all of my brushes...odd sized brackets.</li>
    <li> Solid stand.  Does exactly what you want it to do and looks very nice/not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, item as described.</li>
    <li> Simple, basic, has yet to rust several months later. This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Does a great job holds my razor and brush.has nice weight to it color look great</li>
    <li> Quality is higher than I expected, and I think it will last a long gone time. Would buy again. Also holds brush and razor good and high</li>
</ol>
