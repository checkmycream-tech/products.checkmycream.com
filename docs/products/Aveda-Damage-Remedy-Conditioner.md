      <li>This and Kerastase Masquintense are the top two conditioning treatments for damaged hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but still I thought it would be better.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I have always been pleased with Aveda products and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  </li>
      <li>I love about this conditioner</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much!</li>
      <li>Defiinitely will purchase again, good price , fast de;over</li>
      <li>I have fine colored hair and have tried just about every product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Fine, you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>I have fine, but curly hair and</li>
      <li>I love it at the first wash!</li>
      <li>Huge difference from the lower priced conditioners.</li>
      <li>This quiets the hair, makes it smooth and shiny and light.</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>My hair feels silky, smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product and bonus</li>
      <li>Glamazons, unless you&#x27;re just wanting a conditioner for hair that is already pretty healthy, don&#x27;t even think about buying this one.</li>
      <li>never feels built up, always feels clean.</li>
      <li>I also think its worth the price, but my normal conditioner (aveda shampure) is much cheaper and works great.</li>
      <li>I love this product as I have very frizzy, flyaway hair.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product.</li>
      <li>Great product - does not weigh down your hair.</li>
      <li>All Aveda products are worth the money.</li>
      <li>Most of the Aveda salons are only in it for the money.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is one of a few good ways to do it.  </li>
      <li>it was a nice product as prescribed would recommend it if you have hair problems of any other complications with hair</li>
      <li>I am an avid swimmer and chlorine pretty much destroys my hair.</li>
      <li>less is more!</li>
      <li>After so long I came across again AVEDA and give it one more try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an Aveda product, it doesn&#x27;t smell fruity and sweet because they use all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>You can use a small amount and get good results.</li>
      <li>Aveda was all the rage when it first burst onto the scene, but, since then so many other companies have hit it out of the ball park.</li>
      <li>- it just makes it so much nicer.  </li>
      <li>but Aveda Damage Remedy really helps.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the damage intense treatment</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t buy into the whole cult like mentality.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get quite as much moisture as I hoped.</li>
      <li>I really like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very allergic to almost all the hair care products out there,</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>but when I do it makes such a huge difference on the texture of my hair, very soft</li>
      <li>Soft, pretty...</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend for those who color treat their hair.</li>
      <li>, my hair&#x27;s never been so silky soft, but this product achieves it without making it greasy as many other moisturising conditioners do.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is not a thick cream but a lotion.</li>
      <li>I live in Phoenix</li>
      <li>Save your money and buy this from an AVEDA store for a new bottle ($28)</li>
      <li>After just a few uses - shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner - my hair was so noticeably healthy and soft again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the higher end leave in conditioners, deep conditioners, damage repair conditioners and NOTHING</li>
      <li>This is my second bottle of this product and it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t done exactly what I thought it would to my damaged hair</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, tending to get frizzy in humidity, and this Damage Remedy conditioner helps conrtrol &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I got three uses out of the tiny tube (I was conservative in how much I used)</li>
      <li>In fact all of the aveda products so far have done what they say.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair manageable and soft and reduced shedding.  </li>
      <li>Been using Aveda for nearly 20 years-</li>
      <li>Has an earthy smell but then again it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
      <li>This is keeping my hair soft and manageable along with the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>So if you go a few days in between washes, there&#x27;s no reason a liter wouldn&#x27;t last you a year or more.</li>
      <li>I originally bought the 1 liter bottle of both which lasted over a year for me and a small bottle of leave-in which lasted a month or so.</li>
      <li>Coupled with Damage Remedy Shampoo and Daily Treatment, my hair is as soft and shiny as it was before I began coloring it.</li>
      <li>It brings my hair back to its natural state.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m learning the hard way that even with only washing my hair once or twice a week - it needs TLC, and this is the only product that works to actually repair my hair and not just leave a soft residue; so I will definitely be getting some more.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine who was an Aveda stylist recommended this product for me after my hair had become extremely brittle and damaged from an intense day of bleaching that my hair never recovered from.</li>
      <li>It did leave my hair feeling somewhat more moisturized after a use, but using it everyday made my hair heavy, oily, and I could feel the buildup.</li>
      <li>I noticed not a huge difference but enough to make it worth buying.</li>
      <li>The results are very anti climatic and not worth the price tag.</li>

    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Smells awful. Not normal for aveda products.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who was an Aveda stylist recommended this product for me after my hair had become extremely brittle and damaged from an intense day of bleaching that my hair never recovered from. (bleaching was not done at an Aveda salon.) After just a few uses - shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner - my hair was so noticeably healthy and soft again. I originally bought the 1 liter bottle of both which lasted over a year for me and a small bottle of leave-in which lasted a month or so. And that was before I even knew I didn&#x27;t need to wash and condition every day. So if you go a few days in between washes, there&#x27;s no reason a liter wouldn&#x27;t last you a year or more. I haven&#x27;t used this for over 3 years now because of how expensive it is - but I&#x27;m learning the hard way that even with only washing my hair once or twice a week - it needs TLC, and this is the only product that works to actually repair my hair and not just leave a soft residue; so I will definitely be getting some more. I get my hair colored about once a month and style it with a diffuser almost daily. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the higher end leave in conditioners, deep conditioners, damage repair conditioners and NOTHING works like this does. It&#x27;s an Aveda product, it doesn&#x27;t smell fruity and sweet because they use all natural ingredients. I don&#x27;t think the smell is bad at all, it&#x27;s refreshing and natural. It&#x27;s expensive because it works. Please, I beg of you to at least try the conditioner and you will absolutely not regret it.</li>
    <li> This is like a miracle: your hair becomes silky. Although it is expensive, it is worthy it. I loved it so much!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!! But this particular one is the old formula, making it at least 2 years old... Save your money and buy this from an AVEDA store for a new bottle ($28)</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this product and it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t done exactly what I thought it would to my damaged hair but it has improved a little.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Has an earthy smell but then again it&#x27;s all natural. Would highly recommend for those who color treat their hair. Gives an incredible shine.</li>
    <li> This is a go to product for summer damaged hair.  It works!  You can use a small amount and get good results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time but when I do it makes such a huge difference on the texture of my hair, very soft</li>
    <li> I have fine colored hair and have tried just about every product on the market.  I have found this product to &amp;#34;tame the tiger&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I usually use half a tablespoon in my hair and let it sit for 5-7 minutes while I was the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this conditioner is that my hair feels so great afterwards. My hair feels silky, smooth and shiny. The smell is also fairly subtle and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure you wash all of it out!! or else its a little gross.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that its a pretty heavy conditioner so I don&#x27;t feel like I can use it every day. I also think its worth the price, but my normal conditioner (aveda shampure) is much cheaper and works great. I would only use this product once a week, whereas I use the shampure conditioner every day.</li>
    <li> I am an avid swimmer and chlorine pretty much destroys my hair. this has been a great remedy. I have tried &amp;#34;swim shampoos&amp;#34; but none work as well as this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now.  I use this product when my hair becomes dry and brittle.  It brings my hair back to its natural state.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I began coloring my gray hair about a year ago with semi-permanent products. The inevitable strawy feeling was growing worse with each color treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very allergic to almost all the hair care products out there, but Aveda is an exception. So I looked into what Aveda has to offer for damaged hair and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. Coupled with Damage Remedy Shampoo and Daily Treatment, my hair is as soft and shiny as it was before I began coloring it. I&#x27;m very pleased with its effectiveness and would recommend it to anyone whose hair has chemical or heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is keeping my hair soft and manageable along with the shampoo.  Definitely good stuff, quite good, but still I thought it would be better. kind of takes out my curl and flattens me, but still great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I live in Phoenix the dry air is so damaging but Aveda Damage Remedy really helps.</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this range at my salon and it&#x27;s the best, my hair&#x27;s never been so silky soft, but this product achieves it without making it greasy as many other moisturising conditioners do.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair - nothing &amp;#34;repairs&amp;#34; hair - it just makes it so much nicer.  Soft, pretty... I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> it was a nice product as prescribed would recommend it if you have hair problems of any other complications with hair</li>
    <li> Daughter in law recommended and now. So do I</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. It did leave my hair feeling somewhat more moisturized after a use, but using it everyday made my hair heavy, oily, and I could feel the buildup. The price is what makes me not want to recommend it, but for those who are use to Aveda prices might want to give it a try or see if you can get a sample from a salon before buying.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair noticeably healthier.  Huge difference from the lower priced conditioners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, better than what I was using but I think it was a little over priced for the result. I didn&#x27;t get quite as much moisture as I hoped.</li>
    <li> This and Kerastase Masquintense are the top two conditioning treatments for damaged hair. This quiets the hair, makes it smooth and shiny and light. Fantastic product and bonus: Aveda smell.</li>
    <li> I have always been pleased with Aveda products and this one is no exception.  It&#x27;s great and my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I have fine, but curly hair and this works the best for the money. never feels built up, always feels clean.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Been using Aveda for nearly 20 years- it always works for my hair.  I put this in and pull my hair into a bun every day for work.  It conditions as it helps hold my bun in place.</li>
    <li> I received a small tube of Aveda Damage Remedy as a sample. My hair is not damaged and I do use a good conditioner after I shampoo. But I have stayed away from leave in conditioners out of fear they&#x27;d be greasy.  Well what do you have to lose with a sample?&lt;br /&gt; I got three uses out of the tiny tube (I was conservative in how much I used) This conditioner is not a thick cream but a lotion. I used a dollop and put it on my ends. I also did use my styling mousse and serum protectant also. Overall I think this product made my hair smoother. I noticed not a huge difference but enough to make it worth buying. I think for anyone who does a lot of drying, coloring, ironing, it&#x27;s a good idea to keep your hair protected. This conditioner is one of a few good ways to do it.  Remember: less is more!</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for a number of years.  It is good by itself but sometimes I also mix it with other conditioners.  Makes my hair manageable and soft and reduced shedding.  I sometimes try other products but I keep this as a good ole stand by as it is tried and true and I know how my hair will respond..</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good product at good price</li>
    <li> Glamazons, unless you&#x27;re just wanting a conditioner for hair that is already pretty healthy, don&#x27;t even think about buying this one. The results are very anti climatic and not worth the price tag. Aveda was all the rage when it first burst onto the scene, but, since then so many other companies have hit it out of the ball park. Ex: the new Color Proof line is 100% Vegan and is less expensive. If you are an Aveda Junkie, do your thing, but know this.....Don&#x27;t believe everything you hear. Salon&#x27;s that use Aveda get great advertisement and referals from Aveda the company. Most of the Aveda salons are only in it for the money. Don&#x27;t believe me? Fine, you don&#x27;t have to. I don&#x27;t get paid by companies for my reviews. My clients follow my blogs because of my brutal honesty. I know my industry inside and out. From product ingredients to salon design. I do not hate Aveda, so don&#x27;t get it twisted, there are things from Aveda I really like. I just don&#x27;t buy into the whole cult like mentality. BOOM!&lt;br /&gt;xoxo&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
    <li> Great product - does not weigh down your hair. Non-greasy, provides hair repair.  Defiinitely will purchase again, good price , fast de;over</li>
    <li> I love this product as I have very frizzy, flyaway hair.  It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought my first AVEDA hair products few years ago. I love it at the first wash! When I finished it I kept buying other brands just for the sake of changing. After so long I came across again AVEDA and give it one more try. I was thinking let me see if I feel inlove with it again. The magic WORKED! This time I think I will stick with this product over and over again. Great product!</li>
    <li> Terrific conditioner.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the damage intense treatment but I am happy I got this! It is a fantastic product. My hair is in the best condition ever. All Aveda products are worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. In fact all of the aveda products so far have done what they say. And smell good too</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it is the best conditioner that I have ever tried and I have tried many!</li>
    <li> For $30-some, I expected something. My hair feels just as dry as when I use Dove conditioner. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, tending to get frizzy in humidity, and this Damage Remedy conditioner helps conrtrol &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;. Leaves my hair softer w/more body.</li>
