      <li>We use this same product at the hospital that I work at, and I wanted to try it at home, but the product that I received from Amazon has no odor to it, as if the bottle was filled with water.</li>

<li> I thought it was a bit expensive when I ordered it at first...</li>
<li> The Hollister m9 Odor Eliminator Spray was first introduced to me at my local hospital when I was sick.  </li>
<li> Am I the only one that was confused by this?</li>
<li> ; odor left behind.  </li>
<li> You spray it in the air and bad smell disappears instantly, you spray it in a smelly trash bin and the bad smell is 95% killed and the effect last a few days!</li>
<li> disappointing to say the least.</li>

    <li> UNSCENTED!!!  love it!  Works great with no &amp;#34;someone pooped in the Christmas tree&amp;#34; odor left behind.  I have already ordered more.  Took one to my mother in the nursing home...her roommate has a bowel problem but is now no longer embarrassed to use the bedside commode.&lt;br /&gt;They ship very fast and very well packed.  I thought it was a bit expensive when I ordered it at first...but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> very good for clearing the air</li>
    <li> This stuff work&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> veery helpful  great size for travel.</li>
    <li> This works well.  I work in a medical facility and this works there even with the strong, difficult odors we have.</li>
    <li> This spray has no odor.  We use this same product at the hospital that I work at, and I wanted to try it at home, but the product that I received from Amazon has no odor to it, as if the bottle was filled with water.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it and thought great no SMELL!  Fantastic....BUT when there was an odor and I sprayed it...ungodly smell.  Must be when it is trying to neutralize the smell that it gives a horrid smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing to say the least.</li>
    <li> Amazing and great for someone with IBD or IBS - no worries when using a bathroom away from home - small bottle easily fits in pocket book</li>
    <li> I use it for general household smells and it is magical! You spray it in the air and bad smell disappears instantly, you spray it in a smelly trash bin and the bad smell is 95% killed and the effect last a few days! If you open the bottle, you can tell that it has a discrete and agreable soapy smell, but you can´t notice it after you sprayed it.</li>
    <li> This odor eliminator is great!  I was first introduced to m9 when working in the hospital, and was so happy they had it on Amazon.  Febreeze can&#x27;t touch this stuff!  It is perfume-free, so it won&#x27;t aggravate allergies or asthma.  The odor is pretty neutral, just a touch of chemicals, but it somehow cuts bad smells easily.  I love this stuff and highly recommend it for the bathroom or litterbox.</li>
    <li> Ii don&#x27;t think it takes the odor out of the air.</li>
    <li> The M9 works immediately and well.  I wish the spray function weren&#x27;t so noisy.  The Febreeze brand has a spray piece that is quieter.  I would like the makers of M9 to offer an alternative sprayer that does not announce the sound when I am spraying.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really absorbs and neutralizes odor (instead of masking it). I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is best stuff for eliminating odor.  Febreeze just covers it up, this actually eliminates the odor.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the effect of this product. I discovered it during a hospital stay and it great for home use.</li>
    <li> The Hollister m9 Odor Eliminator Spray was first introduced to me at my local hospital when I was sick.  I have continued to use it for its effectiveness against any odor in my room.  Both the scented and unscented does the job as described and personally, I give this product a high mark.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The smell is kind of &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;.  Actually it&#x27;s really supposed to be unscented...so I guess that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job at eliminating odors. It seems best effective when you spray upon the first sign of odor before the odor gets a chance to spread too much. Product delivered exactly as described and quick shipping. I recommend this product and seller. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I work in a hospital and this is the freshner they use.  If it works in a hospital, it will work for you!  I use the unscented as a bathroom freshner as my husband dislikes the popular scented/fragrant sprays on the market.</li>
    <li> As an ET nurse I would recommend this to all my patients.  Also the liquid odor eliminator is very good.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this before and love it.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Picture shows three bottles- why? yes they show quantity of 1. One what? kit or just one of the three bottles listed? Am I the only one that was confused by this? Will use product and write a user review</li>
