    <li> It stayed warm then got cool and hard after about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> Re-usable, which is good. Stays hot for a while, which is good, but it didn&#x27;t stay soft as long as I would have hoped. It started to solidify after about 20 minutes and it got harder to use, but up till that point, I would have said I loved it :)</li>
    <li> I love the product! It works great when the disc is flexed, and boils back to liquid just fine. My only issue with it was that the disc was REALLY hard to flex the first time. It has been easier ever since that first go round though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a good rating because, as a Pure Romance consultant myself, I can tell you this product is AMAZING... However these were never intended to be sold on Amazon, or any other site for that matter! If you&#x27;re not getting this from the Pure Romance website or from an actual consultant, there is no telling what you&#x27;re getting. I see some reviews on here saying the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; were coming out... The PURE ROMANCE heart massager does not have beads! I don&#x27;t know how many customers on here actually received a Pure Romance product and how many didn&#x27;t... But I wouldn&#x27;t take the gamble if I were you. Go to the Pure Romance website or find a consultant in your area. If ANYTHING is wrong with your item when you receive it, they will replace it for you!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;Hannah Cook</li>
    <li> Worked great when I first bought it but now it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;un-harden&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This did exactly what it said it would do. Ordered more for gifts</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. IT IS A KNOCK OFF BRAND. THIS IS NOT PURE ROMANCE, IT IS A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE THAT IS EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! Paid 11 for a knock off brand, the heart that was sent to me was not the same on the picture. Opened it up followed the directions and it didn&#x27;t work!! I heated it up on the stove with a rag in the pot, it worked for 20 minutes and hardened up, put it back in and doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> used once wasn&#x27;t pure romance was a knock off tried 3 times to boil it back to reuse and it never worked total disapointment!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, but the product was not as described.  Product is advertised as being a \\&quot;Pure Romance Heart Massager\\&quot;.  The product was very similar, but not a Pure Romance Product.  I have yet to try the product myself, but it does seem like a quality massager.  Just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I use this to stop my muscle spasms so I am able to leave the house.  This heart last a long time.  I have even ordered a couple more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the reviews.  It came solid.  I followed the instructions.  Boiled it but now it has cyrstalized again and I massaged the crap out of it and it NEVER gets hot!  I pressed the metal thing several times.  What am I doing wrong?  HELp...I really wanted this to work.</li>
    <li> It works perfect when you use it for the first time. But the second time the cristals don&#x27;t disappear and the only way it works again is by boling the heart again.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i used one of my friends and i love it. i personally use it to combat mother nature once month an it is great.it instantly gets hot and stays hot for at least 30 minute. the disks are hard to pop at first but over time become easier.. i love this and recommend this to anyone. if you plan on using it as a massager note to get massage oil because it doesn&#x27;t easily slide over skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was as described a Pure Romance heart massager. When I received the item it was not a Pure Romance heart massager. Instead it was a brand called Domestic Divas. The heart still works as it is supposed to but either way it&#x27;s not what is pictured. BEWARE you might not get the Pure Romance brand. Will update this after seller contacts me back.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend actually bought one for us at her house and I liked it so much that I had to buy one for my house too. Simple to use and keeps the heat for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> Total garbage. Seams came split. Do not buy this get one of the rice bag products. Works better and come in cute animal shapes.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Fits on your abdomen in your higher low rise jeans. I would love to get this in bulk for all my female family members for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. I went to the zoo one day and it was rather cold out I put this in the back of my pants and I stayed nice and warm the whole time while I was at the zoo. It is great for lots of different things but I mostly got mine to use during the winter. My boyfriend thought it was silly to buy it until he was cold and I let him use it to warm his hands and now he is in love with it too haha!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife as she had stated she wanted 2 of them for Christmas.  They arrived earlier this week and I went ahead and let her open them last night.  She immediately used them and I was surprised at how warm these actually get!  After about an hour and half of warmth, we boiled them and now they are ready for reuse!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This item has so many uses! It is easy to use. Gave some romantic massages, used it as a heating pad and a hand warmer so far. haha. Wish i had 10 more!</li>
    <li> I had this product for four days, used it approximately four times and now it&#x27;s broken. I have re-boiled it and it turned to gel, but after it cools to room temperature it gets hard and is unusable. This product is a great idea but the quality of the product is very lacking. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing invention in the entire world. I absolutely love it, and would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
