      <li>This is my favorite foundation, it is a shame</li>
      <li>I love this foundation on #s 20 &amp; 50</li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years, and I hope they never discontinue it.  </li>
      <li>also love the fact this foundation has sunscreen in it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear liquid foundation because all it does it crust up, then I have to put lotion on top.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>This foundation provides superior coverage that lasts a full work day, and it is so easy to put on and use.  </li>
      <li>It comes with its own sponge to put it on, so your fingers stay clean.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking everywhere for this makeup since the stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore and was so excited!  </li>
      <li>Love the smooth creamy powder and foundation all in one.  </li>
      <li>This powder foundation is so easy to apply, and it makes my complexion look smooth and even.</li>
      <li>Although this powder feels like the same store bought powder that I have loved for so many years, the color seems lighter than it should be.</li>
      <li>and if you have a bit larger like pores it does a good job minimizing them.  </li>
      <li>I began using just when I traveled, but it quickly replaced my liquid foundation when not traveling.</li>
      <li>but hey this foundation is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
      <li>I like it very much, please do not discontinue, I will recommend to anybody.also to my family.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>Discontinued, hard to find but great stuff.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The only problem is I think that Maybelline has discontinued it-luckily I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant to order this though because you never know what you will get but it was exactly like the one in the store that I would have bought.  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup-</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in any stores near me any more and it&#x27;s the only type of powder foundation that I like!</li>
      <li>I would highly suggest this to anyone who has flaws, marks, or acne scars to cover, because it works so well yet looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Totally bummed that it is no longer available at stores, and is double the price on amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced, especially when they run buy one get one 50% off specials.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural</li>
      <li>sucks I used to be able to pick this up for 6.97 and</li>
      <li>this is the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t break me out and keeps me looking natural and hides my imperfections.</li>
      <li>My skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>

    <li> I love the product, but it came crumbled inside of the wrapping that it was shipped in.  :(</li>
    <li> Bought elsewhere for a lot less.  I was going to buy it here but waited 24 hours and when I went back to purchased  It went up $5.00.  So purchased on another web site.</li>
    <li> Love this foundation, can&#x27;t imagine why Mabelline discontinued it, it works great.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast and I received exactly what I ordered. Unfortunately, Maybelline has discontinued this makeup and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when I run out. I having been using it for years. Anyway, I was very pleased with the seller.</li>
    <li> Maybelline needs to put this back in stores. I love this product and I was super happy that I was able to find it.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, please do not discontinue, I will recommend to anybody.also to my family.&lt;br /&gt;in the market is very difficult to get it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation, it is a shame I don&#x27;t find it at any store anymore! I love this foundation on #s 20 &amp; 50</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand and color of powder foundation for over 10 years! Totally bummed that it is no longer available at stores, and is double the price on amazon. Although this powder feels like the same store bought powder that I have loved for so many years, the color seems lighter than it should be. Also, I ordered 2 of this product, and only received one. I will be shopping around for a different brand of powder foundation, and will not be reordering this product.</li>
    <li> Great price and perfect match.</li>
    <li> I love this powder foundation!  I am so sad that they discontinued it.  It has been the best foundation I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Came broken. Very bad condition.  I can&#x27;t use it. Hope for a replacement soon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and absolutely love it. Excellent price and service from the seller.</li>
    <li> Best Foundation out there. Very sad it has been discontinued. Searched all the drugstores for something that was even similar and could replace it and nothing. this is the only foundation that doesn&#x27;t break me out and keeps me looking natural and hides my imperfections. thank god they are still selling this online because I don&#x27;t know if I can go thru losing this product all over again. sucks I used to be able to pick this up for 6.97 and now im paying 9 something plus shipping but hey this foundation is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for 11+ years and not one negative thing to say.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. Order was processed promptly and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> My favorite and stores are discontinuing it.  Love the smooth creamy powder and foundation all in one.  I&lt;br /&gt;bought several to put away for future use.</li>
    <li> it says pack of 2, but I got one</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive. I can&#x27;t wear liquid foundation because all it does it crust up, then I have to put lotion on top. This creates a heavy look which is not desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mabelline&#x27;s PureSTAY Powder Foundation is perfect for my skin. It takes 1 minute to apply in the morning and covers under-eye circles, red patches, and minor blemishes. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup- just this foundation and mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact this foundation has sunscreen in it. I never have to put sunscreen on my face when using this foundation- it provides ample coverage from the sun&#x27;s harsh rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and very sad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores. Amazon is the only place I can find this foundation.</li>
    <li> This powder foundation is so easy to apply, and it makes my complexion look smooth and even. I began using just when I traveled, but it quickly replaced my liquid foundation when not traveling. The only problem is I think that Maybelline has discontinued it-luckily I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, smooth application</li>
    <li> I love this makeup. I&#x27;ve always used this and was sad when they stopped making it however when I got it, it was all busted. Couldn&#x27;t use it at all. :( Amazon refunded my money but still. Wouldn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this.  I checked all the stores but couldn&#x27;t find it.  This is my favorite foundation. I can&#x27;t understand why they have to discontinue.</li>
    <li> Discontinued, hard to find but great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product sadly it&#x27;s been discontinued by Maybelline but grateful Amazon still has it.</li>
    <li> This foundation provides superior coverage that lasts a full work day, and it is so easy to put on and use.  It comes with its own sponge to put it on, so your fingers stay clean.  I have been using it for many years, and I hope they never discontinue it.  I would highly suggest this to anyone who has flaws, marks, or acne scars to cover, because it works so well yet looks very natural.  It&#x27;s almost like a powder and foundation in one and keeps my skin from looking oily.  Also it provides excellent SPF 15 sunscreen protection, so my face never gets burned.  I love this foundation!  It&#x27;s also very reasonably priced, especially when they run buy one get one 50% off specials.</li>
