      <li>Good lightweight, great for the summer months, it just sinks right in!  </li>
      <li>This is a decent product that I use under my makeup for an interview or any day that I want to look good.</li>

      <li>Has done nothing for my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I love new things, I like this kind of product, I will buy it again</li>
      <li>hope it will continue to be available.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what I will do when this is no longer available.</li>
      <li>No where near as good.</li>
      <li>so the ultra mild scent is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>The pores on my nose - where they are most noticeably large - have even appeared to minimize.</li>
      <li>This product did not give ANY  noticible GOOD results when used for several months...</li>
      <li>It is also 1.7 OZ--a lot more than most of serum, which is only 1 OZ.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m lucky that Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>I use it after a grapefruit acne scrub and it seems to balance out the necessary necessary oils in my skin perfectly....</li>
      <li>By ordering several to add to my own inventory, I can now relax and enjoy the amazing lift and life it gives to my facial skin.</li>
      <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use and daily application show amazing results with firmer youthful looking</li>
      <li>I wish this was still available to purchase in stores, last time I found it was in Las Vegas via Amazon and ordered like 10 bottles. :)</li>
      <li>It is a clear, refreshing gel that absorbs into your skin.</li>
      <li>Love what this product does for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>i love this serum..makes my skin young looking and feel fresh</li>
      <li>In fact, my serum also had the expired coupon dated 2009 and so far, I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>She was right.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these products and I got them right away.  </li>
      <li>i have extra sensitive skin and this product really works great-</li>
      <li>Then I found it again on Amazon where I got it for a reasonable price and quick shipping.  </li>
      <li>-i also use on my hair to fluff it up-it works better than those root-lift products-who knew!</li>
      <li>If using foundation, it&#x27;s worth investing in a better brand like Christian Dior, because it&#x27;s the first thing that comes into your skin.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have discovered it sooner as it seems many are buying up all the extra they can find!</li>
      <li>I have been using this for more than 3 years and it really help my skin looks fresh and younger.</li>
      <li>enough to keep my skin healthy and hydrated without looking like I took a dip in the Canola oil.</li>
      <li>So while purchasing a cosmetic which appears to have been manufactured several years ago, I think the fact that the product is meant for the for the skin (as opposed to the eyes) is OK...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe and soft for even my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Look forward to getting more results, as I have only used this product for a week!&lt;br /&gt;One thing negative to say, The product took longer than expected to arrive, and I was in need of a Face serum, but Very happy after using this treatment serum.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s always very critical of everything about me, so this was a huge surprise.</li>
      <li>Fast Service.  </li>
      <li>It does have a gentle tightening effect and improves skin texture for the time that you use it.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have spent that much more money for one.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
      <li>and it is gentle on the eyes.</li>
      <li>and you are ready to put your foundation on.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost forty and have a two year old; so I rarely get 5 hours of sleep a night.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it every day, the serum has really made my skin so much softer and smoother, I only wish they still made it.</li>
    <li> I looked at the reviews of this product before purchasing on Sunday, March 26, 2012.  I saw a few reviews that said they got expired products.  I purchased anyway.  Mistake.  I received my package this morning.  The L&#x27;Oreal box looks battered and worn.  It also has a label that said the product was intended for sale at CVS.  I gently opened the box and found that \\&quot;expires in 12/2009\\&quot; manufacturer&#x27;s coupon inside.  Ridiculous.  Don&#x27;t a sell an expired product without disclosing that it&#x27;s expired and letting the consumer decide whether they want to put that crap on their face.  This is already back in the box to be returned.</li>
    <li> It does what it says...I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day.  AM under make up and PM after washing.  Keeps the dryness away.  The quality of the product met my expectations.  I use a lot of L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> First of all, for those rating the product one stars based on an \\&quot;expiration date,\\&quot; there are no regulations or requirements under current United States law that require cosmetic manufacturers to print expiration dates on the labels of cosmetic products. Even Europe only requires expiration dating only for products whose minimum durability is less than 30 months. So while purchasing a cosmetic which appears to have been manufactured several years ago, I think the fact that the product is meant for the for the skin (as opposed to the eyes) is OK... a the t least in my book. In fact, my serum also had the expired coupon dated 2009 and so far, I LOVE this product. I wish I would have discovered it sooner as it seems many are buying up all the extra they can find! I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but from the first use I noticed a marked difference. I have oily skin, but it&#x27;s also sensitive, so I end up drying out and getting red from many of the past products I have tried. Skin Genesis has had no adverse impact on my skin in any way thus far. I use it after a grapefruit acne scrub and it seems to balance out the necessary necessary oils in my skin perfectly.... enough to keep my skin healthy and hydrated without looking like I took a dip in the Canola oil. The pores on my nose - where they are most noticeably large - have even appeared to minimize. I&#x27;m looking forward to how I look in a couple more weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It seems to work from the minute I put it on.  The only problem is that it is being discontinued!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to work on the deminishment of my pores, it definitely made a difference, have been using it for several month now.But you will pay twice as much for it at any store, so ordering it on Amazon is definitely the way to go.   Added benefit of the product I used it as PRIMER,it works awesome. Give it a try!   I wash my face, put it on, brush my teeth and you are ready to put your foundation on.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost forty and have a two year old; so I rarely get 5 hours of sleep a night. Inspite of this, I have great skin thanks to loreal skin genesis. I use it every night and my skin is so firm and smooth. I get compliments from 20 year olds. My sister was here for Thanksgiving and she asked me to write down my skin care regime, since she was so impressed with the way my skin looked. She&#x27;s always very critical of everything about me, so this was a huge surprise. My brother also said my skin looks like baby skin. The last two years have been a nightmare with the birth of a baby, the death of my mom and brother and lots of wine to help cope. Without good skincare my skin would be a wreck!!!!!I also use a cheap skin scrub three to four times a week. This product is not available in stores anymore and I thank God that amazon still carries it for such a reasonable price. You&#x27;ll not be disappointed......</li>
    <li> Since Loreal has discontinued the line of Skin Genesis, the products are hard to find. I am stocking up before they are completely unavailable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened with this product, but it is very different from the formula I&#x27;ve used for over a year. This serum has left my face and neck with an itchy, blotchy rash. I believe this product was packaged for the Canadian market, evidenced by the English description, along with a French description. I can&#x27;t say if L&#x27;Oreal has 2 different formulas, or if the original is different; all I know is that this product is not the same and, for me, it is unusable.    7/16/2011 After my skin cleared, I re-tried a small amount on my face, avoiding my eyelids and neck. It seems to be fine as long as I avoid the more vulnerable skin. The reason I tried this product again is because it feels and smells the same as the serum I was using before. It simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to have such a bad reaction from something that has worked well before.     This formula works very well on my forehead and sides of my face, but I won&#x27;t try it on my eyelids again and my neck still hasn&#x27;t recovered completely.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! Every moisturizer I have ever used makes me break out, but this completely non-oily, non-greasy gel provides just enough moisture to keep my skin from drying out, and does not make me shiny at all.  LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these products and I got them right away.  Fast Service.  Will order from this vendor again.!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but the L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Daily Treatment Serum  was NOT as expected.  I had been using the store-bought serum  for about a year, with great results.  Even though the package  looked legitimate, I&#x27;m skeptical that the contents were not  fresh, possibly OUT-DATED. This product did not give ANY  noticible GOOD results when used for several months...</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that I am very happy to see this product here. When loreal started the youth code line I bought the same looking bottle thinking it was this serum. I was wrong. It looks similar but it is definatly not. I used the entire bottle of the youth code hoping I would see improvement over time like with the skin genesis strenghtening serum but I never did. I was begining to think the serum was discontinued. I have also tired the clinque \\&quot;even better\\&quot; line and did not see results that nearly compared to this. I used Skin Genesis every day along with an AVON daily moisturizer and I can honestly say that my skin looked great. No blochiness, no bumps, no pimples, etc. I even was complimented on how great my skin looked. When I say this product made my skin glow, it was noticible and I have yet to find something else that compared. It does feel weird when first applying.. like I am putting a gel on my face, but two pumps...rubbed all over my face and let it dry before applying moisturizer (usually one or two mins) and I am good to go. Thank you amazon for keeping this product in stock!</li>
    <li> This is a product that actually delivers what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will continue to be available.  It really works and shows results within a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;Continued use and daily application show amazing results with firmer youthful looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am 66 years old and have been using this for about a year.  My skin is so much firmer with&lt;br /&gt;more elasticity.</li>
    <li> I have used several different types of facial serums and prefer this one to all others. Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, no stinging or burning. Definitely can see the difference in your skin in about a week..much brighter and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I use quite a few L oreal products and this is a definitely a winner.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product sold by CLEAR SKIN SOURCE on Octorber 2011 since I read other review and want to try if it can help for my skin. However, when I opened the container, there was a coupon inside and it expired 12/31/2009. It means that this product was manufactured on 2008. I tried to find the expired day on the box, but it is not printed on the box. If they didn&#x27;t forget about the coupon inside, I have never known about this. NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
    <li> L oreals skin genesis daily treatment serum is exactly that! You will use it daily a.m and p.m. and notice the deweyness you skin maintains. You definitely notice if you miss using it,and will rush to apply to keep the wonderful feeling it gives your skin</li>
    <li> I am an over fifty year old woman and this is the one product that I use faithfully.  After a few days without use I can see the fine lines come back.  Love what this product does for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;v been using it for over 10 years now. I&#x27;m 45 but look 38, not bragging, that&#x27;s just what people say. I have severe allergies so the ultra mild scent is a huge plus. It&#x27;s NOT greasy. NOT sticky. Just perfect!!! I apply it thinly to face, neck, chest and shoulders wait a couple minutes then apply moisturizer. I wish this was still available to purchase in stores, last time I found it was in Las Vegas via Amazon and ordered like 10 bottles. :)</li>
    <li> prodct was as listed. as expected. nice to be able to purchase discontinued items. review reviewed re view rev iews</li>
    <li> this L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Daily Treatment Serum Concentrate has an unpleasant odor; so,unfortunately, even if it works I won&#x27;t want to wear it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for combo skin. I got amazing results using this. And incredible price for this. Way better than most products out there costing much more. Save your money and get some cute shoes.</li>
    <li> Very good for the skin. Helps with face an neck problem called wrinkles. So if one needs help with wrinkles this may help.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for years and then the company stopped producing it.  There was nothing else like it on the market.  A non-greasy moisturizer!  Then I found it again on Amazon where I got it for a reasonable price and quick shipping.  Thank you for making me happy again!</li>
    <li> This Serum makes the pores on my skin smaller and brighter and nurtured. I love it and will buy again soon!</li>
    <li> Been using this forever it&#x27;s the best for my skin  I use I tuner my makeup then use a moisturizer on yop</li>
    <li> I love this product and can no longer find it in stores, so Amazon had it and I ordered a bunch. I was delighted to find that the item sent to me came with a small travel size of the same product AND a sample of the corresponding moisturizer. Purchased 7 of these so it was a great deal!! Delivery time was FASTFASTFAST. Awesome experience all the way around.</li>
    <li> Works as stated. Great Seller !!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it cuz I didn&#x27;t notice any difference on my skin. pretty rpicy for the little bit that is in the bottle. will try something different</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal, therefore finding it is difficult.  Love this product wish it was still available.</li>
    <li> i love this serum..makes my skin young looking and feel fresh</li>
    <li> It great for oily skin.  First I used L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis Daily Treatment Serum before any face moisture on it.  I could see my skin is flawless, clean, pore tighten and smooth.  It take time to get with this product before you will notice it.  I&#x27;ve been used for 2 years.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s why I buy it. It works to make my pores smaller and skin healthier all around. It doesn&#x27;t do much for dark spots so don&#x27;t buy this thinking it will help with that. It&#x27;s safe and soft for even my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, hyaluronic acid is an ingredient you want to look for in skincare products.  I read about this in Real Simple magazine and decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did.  This is a serum, so it is meant to be used under your regular moisturizer, but it does bump up the hydration by a big notch.  I&#x27;ve had the bottle for several months so a little goes a long way and the price is very affordable for the quality of skincare it provides.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  The product has made my skin so soft, I am yet to be unhappy. Look forward to getting more results, as I have only used this product for a week!&lt;br /&gt;One thing negative to say, The product took longer than expected to arrive, and I was in need of a Face serum, but Very happy after using this treatment serum. Will buy more as I need it!</li>
    <li> Since L&#x27;Oreal stopped producing and marketing the Skin Genesis product, I have searched everywhere for it. Thankfully, Amazon.com included a seller of this wonderful skin beauty aid in their list of sellers. By ordering several to add to my own inventory, I can now relax and enjoy the amazing lift and life it gives to my facial skin.</li>
    <li> best product i ever tried-and i tried a lot-i have extra sensitive skin and this product really works great-i get a lot of compliments and i&#x27;m over 50 so that makes me happy-i also use on my hair to fluff it up-it works better than those root-lift products-who knew!</li>
    <li> I hunted all over for this!  It works really great, but I can no longer find it in stores.  So I bought three to last me a while.</li>
    <li> I never review products but felt compelled to review this because it has been one of the few products that made a real difference in my skin. I have oily/acne prone skin that somehow is dry and flaky in spots at the same time. This product has totally calmed and evened my skin tone. Like anything, it&#x27;s not a miracle product but I think it has my skin looking like the best version of itself.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the skin and does make you look younger. Great price. Will buy again. I have been using this product for a couple of years and am ver satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. I&#x27;ve been using for over 4 weeks and nothing. My skin is the same. Has done nothing for my fine lines.</li>
    <li> Wonderful need more if we get hand bag taken care of</li>
    <li> This product feels very light on your skin. I have used it for many years under other moisturizers. Very refreshing after morning shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it works because I put different things on the face. However it makes my skin feel good and it is gentle on the eyes. It is also 1.7 OZ--a lot more than most of serum, which is only 1 OZ. I got the 2nd bottle and will continue using it. For less than $10, I really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> This is very good product, and it&#x27;s new, I love new things, I like this kind of product, I will buy it again</li>
    <li> This might work for others, but not for me.  Made me break out pretty badly.  I tried it instead of the Youth Code one due to the price and it was a mistake, shouldn&#x27;t have switched.  No where near as good.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty product monster and could not leave  the cosmetic department without spending a fortune, therefore I avoid places like Sephora, Marrionaud (in Paris) or simply Bloomingdales and other department stores.  Since I was in my pre-teens, I buy products as expensive as I could afford to take care of my skin, to avoid getting pimples.  I&#x27;ve always set a high standard in hygiene and prevention for kids of my age. I learned a lesson from my aunt, that once those pimple scars are there, they never disappear. She was right.  Also she told us that moisturizing your skin properly is the key to prevent wrinkles and always wear a sunblock when one is exposed to UV rays.  This product amazingly goes well underneath your foundation.  I don&#x27;t suggest using another moisturizer if you put on foundation.  It makes a good base and primer.  It depends on your skin type. I have used really high end French and Swiss skin care brands when I was younger.  I realized that expensive does not necessarily mean it&#x27;s more effective.  I am more into skincare than makeups.  Makeup actually ruins your skin, so don&#x27;t use them unless you really have to.  If using foundation, it&#x27;s worth investing in a better brand like Christian Dior, because it&#x27;s the first thing that comes into your skin.  I don&#x27;t use Dior, Lancome, Channel or La Prairie skin care anymore since I have other priorities now.  My skin has never looked this good.  What I like most is that it does not feel greasy on my skin.  I know that because of the price, it&#x27;s likely this product must be a little old. However cosmetics, as long as they were  not open could last four years from my experience.  This comes in a pump bottle so it&#x27;s ok. I have very sensitive skin infact, but this product does not give me acne or pimples.  I used to spend a fortune on skin care, nearly 500 dollars a month and that was way back then. Now, I spend less than 50 dollars per month and they work for me the same.  I use this in the evening before L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s revitalift night complete.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but mom said it&#x27;s never too early to star.  It pays off.  I&#x27;m now a mom of two and my daughter is now in Junior high, yet people often mistake me as an older sibbling whenever I come to fetch them.  :)  I like this product and I recently placed an order for four bottles.l&#x27;s revitalift night complete.

    <li> After using the product for about a month, I did not see any changes to my skin.  I see why it&#x27;s being discontinued</li>
    <li> I massage it to my face every night before going to sleep. I have been using this for more than 3 years and it really help my skin looks fresh and younger. I do not know why it was taken off the market. i&#x27;m lucky that Amazon carries it. Can you inquire from L&#x27;Oreal why it was discontinued?</li>
    <li> This is my favorite serum!  I use it after my regular moisturizer in areas that are especially dry.  I have been unable to find it locally so I was very happy to find it on Amazon.  It is superior to several other serums I have tried.  Also, I have had a hard time finding any brand of serum recently.  Was this a fad and they&#x27;re now being discontinued?</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting more than one. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent that much more money for one.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was great though</li>
    <li> Good lightweight, great for the summer months, it just sinks right in!  I out it on before moisturizer and sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This is a decent product that I use under my makeup for an interview or any day that I want to look good. It does not have retinol ingredients or seem to produce long term results.  It does have a gentle tightening effect and improves skin texture for the time that you use it.  It is a clear, refreshing gel that absorbs into your skin.</li>
    <li> i found a coupon in it, which wrote expired before 12/31/2009. when does this product expired?? it was produced more than 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference on my skin, but maybe it will work for someone else. It&#x27;s a serum so if you have to be midful to rub it in very well if not it dries and leaves white stuff on your face.</li>
    <li> It is just oaky, not sure if it does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> very please with result. I recommend this product.  where can I reorder it again.</li>
    <li> I have been getting this serum for the face for awhile now.  I use it daily and feel it is beneficial to the skin.  It also lasts a long time as a couple of squirts is enough for each daily application.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do when this is no longer available.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful because it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy. People compliment my complexion and say my skin glows.</li>
    <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
    <li> Had a problem after moving to a new office that was really dry. Tried a bunch of alternatives and this is hands down the best solution for people with dry facial skin. Everyone noticed a difference in my face within a week.</li>
