      <li>My favorite thing for keeping my skin moist, especially in the winter</li>
      <li>Thanks smellgood and Amazon!</li>
      <li>love everything about African Shea butter</li>
      <li>It has a light natural fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Shea Butter must be placed in palm and worked until soft and creamy, then and rub on from head to toe,  it absorbs quickly into skin leaving your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>From my research thus far, I gathered that African butter is just as effective as shea.</li>
      <li>Price just right, new product.</li>
      <li>very high quality shea butter</li>
      <li>I found this product to be very helpful for both issues.</li>
      <li>My whole family loves this product.</li>
      <li>The shipment was fast.</li>
      <li>Just like it was described thanks again.</li>
      <li>Very please will purchase again.</li>
      <li>However this shea butter moisturizes my skin and hair very well.</li>
      <li>It really surpassed my expectations.</li>

      <li>Very unprofessional.</li>
      <li>This makes my skin very oily</li>
      <li>My whole family has skin issues.</li>
      <li>You so much .</li>
      <li>I have purchased unrefined shea butter in the past many times and it is always an ivory color with a mild nutty scent.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love the Shea butter for how it keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
      <li>I bought the same butter from a different seller and it was much better than this one.</li>
      <li>The Shea Butter is grainy, however, microwave it for a few seconds, use some of your favorite oils, mix and your hair and skin are ready to go.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s scary ordering things online before seeing and touching them first, but I was very pleased by the quality and careful packaging of the product.</li>
      <li>The packaging was not as expected, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>so it will last for a very long time :)</li>
      <li>It stays moisturized throughout the next day too since I put it on right before I go to bed.</li>
      <li>I live in Miami FL.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll find a new source .&lt;br</li>

      <li>I however discovered that I bought African butter rather than the real shea butter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price, 3 tubs last my family about 4months</li>
    <li> Did not like the color, had little black particles and fibers in it. Not good for use in body care products, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time! It works great it is surely 100% Shea butter</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting tubs but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s good shea butter. My whole family has skin issues.</li>
    <li> Very please will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Woooow I&#x27;m so happy&lt;br /&gt;Thank You so much . It&#x27;s really amazing 👌😍 I&#x27;ll buy it again soon for sure</li>
    <li> After doing more research on African Shea Butter I found out it is just coming from a different tree than the Raw Shea Butter, I remember using this kind years ago and my skin was so smooth. Also at this price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong at all. I just did a mix with my oils and I am using it all over!!!</li>
    <li> My natural hairdresser recommended this product to me.  This company had the best value.  The Shea Butter is grainy, however, microwave it for a few seconds, use some of your favorite oils, mix and your hair and skin are ready to go.</li>
    <li> These are so costly when I buy them from the local beauty supply store, especially for the size I get. This is a great deal, and a great quality of Shea butter. Goes on smoothly and melts in your hands as you rub. I&#x27;ve found some to be too hard with shell like pieces in it....not this one. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying the African Shea Butter. I was pleased to purchase it at very reasonable price. It really surpassed my expectations. It has a light natural fragrance.  I use it on my hair for moisture.  I am very happy that I purchased it.  Thanks smellgood and Amazon!</li>
    <li> The package arrived promptly and is of great quality.  This was a better price than previous purchases that I have made from different sellers.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin very oily but once it sinks in, it is very soft! It stays moisturized throughout the next day too since I put it on right before I go to bed. Fantastic stuff, I highly recommend it! This is African butter though, not shea butter. Two different things.</li>
    <li> The product itself is very good.  I put some in a small glass container and heat it on a candle warmer.  The resulting softened butter is Great.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was more than sufficient.  The shipment was fast.</li>
    <li> I love it sooooo mutch thank u i will buy it again soon its frish and i like it i like it i like it</li>
    <li> the product is a bit hard to apply, but meets expectations. It is an excellent moisturizer and helps with cracked skin</li>
    <li> I love the deal of the 3 pack. Will last a long time:-)&lt;br /&gt;Have told friends about my deal I ordered.</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT &amp; THE SERVICE I GOT 3 JARS JUST AS PICTURE... THE PRICE WAS PEICE THAT IS TOR SURE I WILL ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN</li>
    <li> This is good quality Shea butter that is smoother than some others I&#x27;ve bought in open air markets and the price for three lbs was crazy low. I am ordering more for family members soon</li>
    <li> Very nice.... good stuff....I like Shea butter and this is what I bought before... I like this African Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter exceeded my expectations. Sometimes it&#x27;s scary ordering things online before seeing and touching them first, but I was very pleased by the quality and careful packaging of the product. I would order from them again!</li>
    <li> very high quality shea butter the best even.even though its not raw shea butter it is still goodi&lt;br /&gt;that the best moisturizer you can use</li>
    <li> Very creamy goes on smooth soaks in fast good grade of African butter!! 3 plastic containers as described but pls be aware Shea butter is ivory African butter is yellow two different things just advertised the same took 10days to deliver to Cali I am enjoying the product but I prefer Shea over African however they are both great!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for moisturizing your skin,  I had pick some up last year while in New Orleans and knew I had better get more. I did a search on Amazon and surprise Great  Price for 3 pack.  I kept one and gave 2 away as gift.  Shea Butter must be placed in palm and worked until soft and creamy, then and rub on from head to toe,  it absorbs quickly into skin leaving your skin soft and smooth.  Its totally natural and I truly swear by it, purchase and delivery quick and cost effective.  Enjoy soft smooth skin</li>
    <li> I bought the same butter from a different seller and it was much better than this one. This one came in bags, not in boxes which made it difficult to storage it.</li>
    <li> The box not completely full and it&#x27;s to dray and have dark color .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why like this :(</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t tell anyone but this is 50% of the reason African Americans age so well. shhhhhhh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ervin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!&lt;br /&gt;So the first time I purchased, it was great,  came in nice tubs in a very nice packaging the second time it showed up in these silver non labeled pouches and plastic bags. Looks home made, which is not what the description said when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just these bags of yellow clay looking matter. I&#x27;m not happy at all this time. I still love shea butter, but the seller&#x27;s execution is terrible. I&#x27;ll find a new source .</li>
    <li> No where in the listing does this item state it is bright as mustard yellow shea butter. Its aweful to use in soap making since the yellow requires a lot more titanium dioxide to remove this weird artificial coloring. I have purchased unrefined shea butter in the past many times and it is always an ivory color with a mild nutty scent. This stuff looks like toxic waste in a tuppaware jar. I am too scared to apply this to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit. Found out later that yellow shea butter is not shea butter but from another plant altogether. Totally false advertising  since what I purchased was suppose to be shea butter. Like I said in my review, I am using it for cp soap making and the yellow makes this item completely useless unless you are making a yellow toned soap. Also, can&#x27;t list shea butter as an ingredient since apparently it&#x27;s not shea butter. I lowered the rating due to the fact that this item is not even shea butter.</li>
    <li> Was wonderful and good and service are also excellent and fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shea butter for so many years. The price was right and the 3 pack will last me a very long time. I use it all year round.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars if they advertised this product as it truly is. The shea butter came in a plastic bag which was then placed in some type of foil paper zip lock bag.  I suggest the seller shows prospective customers what they actually get. However this shea butter moisturizes my skin and hair very well. If you have dry skin this will dedinitely fix that . My skin is softer and i have received a lot of compliments and I have only been using this product for 3 weeks. A little goes a long way with this so it will last for a very long time :) will purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Original product. Recommemded.</li>
    <li> I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought this for my mother and her friend and is happy with this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s natural, unbleached, smells lovely and is great value. I have a lot of allergies and very dry skin so it&#x27;s perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Since I found out about raw shea butter I can not go back from putting other stuff on my face, hair and  body. I totally recommend this to anybody. The only thing it is not the fastest thing to put on  but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Did.not.come as advertised</li>
    <li> It showed up in these silver non labeled pouches and plastic bags. Looks home made, which is not what the description said when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just these bags of yellow clay looking matter. I&#x27;m not happy at all this time. I still love shea butter, but the seller&#x27;s execution is terrible. I&#x27;ll find a new source .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is copy of somebody comment, I copied because i had the same problem)</li>
    <li> The picture shows 3 containers..instead I recieved 3 bags.  The seller should specify this in the description.  Its messy to work with when making products.</li>
    <li> I live in Miami FL. Hot, hot, heat! Shea butter is what I slather on all over, every day after shower.&lt;br /&gt;My skin just drinks it up.</li>
    <li> Thought these were gonna come in plastic bowls byt they didn&#x27;t.  Overall I am very pleased with this product. Arrived quick also.</li>
    <li> love everything about African Shea butter</li>
    <li> Although I am happy with the product, it was not packaged as shown. The product was in three bags not in containers as shown in the picture. Please try to show actual picture representation of the product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, I was very surprised to have large chunks arrive in plastic baggies.  I was expecting label containers as pictured online.  Nothing is labeled, very disturbing, not comfortable even using this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.  And the plastic bags cannot be resealed.  Very unprofessional.</li>
    <li> I do some weightlifting and therefore got stretch marks on my shoulders as a result of the growth.  I also have a few scars from my knee surgery and years of sports. I found this product to be very helpful for both issues. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> wonderful......goodbye lotion</li>
    <li> bad seller ,,product was rotten and didn t come in plastic boxes like on the picture but in cheap plastic bags !!! not good</li>
    <li> Great product came on time. Just like it was described thanks again. Price just right, new product. In the future will buy again.</li>
    <li> My wife bought these and I guess they are ok. Probably some scam like do terra oils. Time will tell</li>
    <li> I received this stuff in foil packs rather than plastic tubs.  I do not like the fool packs.  I much prefer the plastic tubs.</li>
    <li> Xlnt.  Exactly what we wanted.  Delivered whend promised</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a very good deal, I bought 3 packs for $15.99. I think this will last for many many months!! It&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  It is very easy to mix with oils (using it for my hair).  The texture is good and their is no smell that I can detect.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is beige in colour, this product is a bright yellow. This product is actually from the Kpangnan African Butter tree which is different from the shea. The sellers need to clarify this!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value for the money. I use it daily after showering. It keeps my skin moisterized. I&#x27;m going to order some more and send to my sister in Florida.</li>
    <li> My whole family loves this product. It conditions the skin much better than lotion and lasts until you wash it off...and even then your skin still retain benefits of the product.  Over time, your skin will become smoother and softer. So, it is  great for dry skin. I will definitely be re-ordering this.</li>
    <li> My favorite thing for keeping my skin moist, especially in the winter</li>
    <li> it was in bag instead of box!!</li>
    <li> The packaging was not as expected, but that&#x27;s fine. I however discovered that I bought African butter rather than the real shea butter. From my research thus far, I gathered that African butter is just as effective as shea. I will wait and see. So far, it feels excellent on the skin and works well in my hair. I like the way my skin feels after application. I shared my pouches with family members. Hopefully, we will all like it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. However it came in resealable bags and not the tub containers pictured, which is what I usually receive. Other than that, I love the Shea butter for how it keeps my skin from drying out. Also, I use it on minor cuts and irritations and it does promote quicker healing.</li>
    <li> You are the best always</li>
