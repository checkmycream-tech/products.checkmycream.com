      <li>so it looks nice, feels good and stays in place.  </li>
      <li>It sure helps between haircuts!</li>
      <li>I bought it to trim my own hair.</li>
      <li>I use it for my own punk hair styles.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all plastic, but it&#x27;s nice, sturdy plastic.</li>
      <li>Then trying to re-close it without throwing off the blade alignment is kind of tricky.</li>

      <li>Love it, love it love it!!</li>
      <li>Wish there was a mode for close shave for the neck area, but otherwise great trimmer!oSo easy to change closeness of the blade, so easy to change the blades too!</li>
      <li>Which is a bummer because it gives a great quick trim.</li>
      <li>Honestly, the Seki is better than the Philips - and for a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with it - - SUPER HAPPY, actually.  </li>
      <li>When I first used it, it seemed to work great</li>
      <li>This one did not hurt at all and was very precise.  </li>
      <li>This item was made very cheaply and did not work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an easy way to cut your own hair (and save on visits to the beauty salon).</li>
      <li>It works as easily as combing your hair and provides a nice razor cut.</li>
      <li>Frankly I get a better hair cut than my wife gave me all those years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Instead, the front of the trimmer (the side with the dial) should be pressed away from the handle, after gripping the handle and placing one&#x27;s thumb in the thumbwell.</li>
      <li>Is there anyone who could lead me to being able to get these directions (picture preferred)</li>
      <li>This is perfect for just trimming up the back of my head and thinning out the top.  </li>
      <li>I had been able to get them but the company went out of business</li>
      <li>but after some experimenting, I was able to figure it out.</li>
      <li>and I assume I will use it for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>Had something like this many years ago.  </li>
      <li>Then using the styling side refines the cut to make it look more textured and</li>
      <li>but once you&#x27;ve cut off more than you meant, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use the Robocutter as often because I am able to just whip out the Seki and trim away.</li>
      <li>It has turned out better than I thought.  </li>
      <li>With this, I can shape my hair and it looks 10 times better.</li>
      <li>I would like it even more if it had a case to protect the blades from dust and moisture in the air.</li>
      <li>I really love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Okay product</li>
      <li>I found a bit of difficulty in the beginning adjusting its handle and taking out the cover to replace the blades, but for the most part it did what it was intended to which I commend it for.</li>
      <li>I have seen and used better razors</li>
      <li>I wish there were more instructions with it.  </li>
      <li>Does an excellent job but could come with a better set of instructions both for blade change and actual use of product.</li>
      <li>Some skill is needed to get the most of it.</li>
      <li>and I had to use something else that was OK</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Very unique design.</li>
      <li>This product is great for beard and sideburn trimming and thinning, which is my main requirement.</li>
      <li>I really loved this razor comb as it does exactly what it is intended to do; cut your hair.</li>
      <li>You can easily cut more hair than you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If kept nice and clean and handled with care, it should function smoothly for quite a while.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a lot more precise.</li>
      <li>Really cuts good.  </li>
      <li>Blade seems easy to be replaced.</li>
      <li>Easy assemble/ easy disassemble, and easy blade</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this to use for my kids haircutting instead of the electric clippers. It took off a little more hair than I was expecting but I had never used this type of razor before. It worked exceptionally well when their hair was wet. It did pull a little while their hair was dry. The handle was short than I would like but maybe they are all designed this way?</li>
    <li> Was looking for a inexpensive way to trim my hair in between haircuts and this little device fit the bill perfectly.  Would of given it five stars but it does not come with any directions / instructions but after some experimenting, I was able to figure it out.</li>
    <li> This little thing feels like a high quality product. It&#x27;s all plastic, but it&#x27;s nice, sturdy plastic. It comes loaded with two Feather Hi-Stainless blades - some of the most expensive DE blades available, which is a nice touch. Since it takes standard DE blades, which I already use for shaving, the convenience factor is great. Now, I didn&#x27;t get this for styling my hair - I am more than happy to trust my stylist with that. But, as a rather femmy male, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good solution to thinning out my arm and chest hair. This works perfectly, I could not be more pleased with the results. I&#x27;m only using one of the combs, which means I robbed the other side of its Feather blade for my face &amp; legs - don&#x27;t usually treat myself to those fancy blades! Anyway, the product feels solid, uses standard blades, and does what I need it to (even if that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for). Five stars it is.</li>
    <li> Works as described. No issues encountered so far (1 month). Perfect price. clean cuts are A+ No complaints what so ever.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair on the sides; it wants to stick out instead of laying down.  With this styler I can thin and shape my hair so it looks nice, feels good and stays in place.  The product is well designed and sturdily made.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any broken strands. But I have to agree with the other reviewer, be very careful when you start cutting at first, the blades are really sharp, so you might accidentally cut too much off. But I&#x27;m so happy I found this product, I love it!</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever used of its kind</li>
    <li> The product is all that I expected from reading the description.  I would recommend it.  For me, it satisfies my need to trim my hair and I can avoid professionals, good as they may be, who do not satisfy me.</li>
    <li> Received item as advertized. Exceeded my expectation!</li>
    <li> I do like this product. It works as easily as combing your hair and provides a nice razor cut. Very inexpensive item. Pays for itself in one use. Easy to take while traveling also. If you are a first time user, cut slowly, use a scissors or an electric shaver with a trimmer to cut the back and by ears. The fact that you can easily replace dull blades with your own double edge blades makes it a clear winner.</li>
    <li> waste of ten bucks.bought it to trim hair on my little dog terrier mix. clogs. useless for me anyway. like pulling a brush thought knots.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job but could come with a better set of instructions both for blade change and actual use of product. My advice is to start with the longest setting and then gradually move to a shorter setting. The shortest setting will almost shave you.</li>
    <li> Great for between haircuts and trims.  Just remember to go slow and keep the setting small until you know it is cutting what is desired.</li>
    <li> The [ASIN:B000SSDTTI Seki Edge Styling Razor Haircutter] Seki Edge Haircutter is easy for my husbnd to use, it is safe and is very low cost.  An excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product works better than I thought it would!!  Simple to use and does everything I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Well, I read reviews regarding this product and purchased it with those in mind. I must say, I am very disappointed in the product. When I first used it, it seemed to work great but then the next few times I had used it, it seemed as though it had a dull blade. Would never buy another one.</li>
    <li> I hate getting my hair cut professionally, because they never do what I ask. With this, I can shape my hair and it looks 10 times better. I have used it about 5 times, and it is still pretty sharp.</li>
    <li> I have used other like products for years to trim my hair, but this product is far superior to any other product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is finely made, but I bought it to use on my cat and it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It just doesn&#x27;t cut the hair and what few strands it does cut get tangled in the comb.</li>
    <li> I have just received the razor. It came with hair on it. Ughhh... Gross. Obviously, it was used before me. How unprofessional this is!!!</li>
    <li> It makes a mess of my victims, it&#x27;s easily to learn. You simply need a victim to try it on before you can realize the potential of what this can do.  Then you can&#x27;t stop and end up slaughtering everyone around you. The power that you will be welding once you grab hold of the handle is second to none.  The gods roar in anguish because of their powerlessness to your new found strength. This is something you cannot pass up, since I have obtained mine I have yet to pay visit to the witches who trick me into their caves and showed me scriptures of powerful beings and asked me if that&#x27;s what I desire.  Just to leave their wretched cave knowing you have not obtained any power at all, curse you witches!</li>
    <li> This cutter is real sharp but easy enough to control. Set it at longest then works it way to shorter length. Used it twice and save over $30 from salon haircut. Blade seems easy to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, and I&#x27;m new to this type of cutting tool. So far I&#x27;ve experimented with it on my son&#x27;s hair, and it cuts well. (Based on the information provided, the blades are replaceable too.) If you&#x27;re new to it also, my suggestion is to proceed conservatively until you&#x27;re comfortable using it. You can easily cut more hair than you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging didn&#x27;t provide a lot of instruction, except to indicate that one edge texturizes and the other cuts. The dial makes the blade on one edge protract and retract. Aside from trial and error, there&#x27;s no information on how and where you should place this when cutting or texturizing. Since the packaging has bilingual information, a diagram would probably be useful. In the meantime, I will look on YouTube to see if I can find any helpful videos.</li>
    <li> It has turned out better than I thought.  It does everything it was advertised to do.  However, detailed instructions on how to use it would have been rather helpful. It lacked illustrations on thinning and taper use.  Other than that, it does a good job after some practice.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and  the blades are nice and sharp. No directions, but simple to figure out. I boughtit to trim my wigs, have not used on my regular hair.</li>
    <li> One of the rare times a product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I had been using a product for the past 45 years but it required a special blade and up to 5 years ago I had been able to get them but the company went out of business and I had to use something else that was OK but didn&#x27;t do the job as well.  Despair set in until I ordered the Seki Haircutter which uses ordinary double edge blades.  It works and it looks like it will last a long time, probably longer than me.</li>
    <li> Good product nice design, takes a little time to figure out how to use it. I do like the feather razor blades for this unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I can&#x27;t get this to cut hair.  It combs through and then nothing.  It might be me.  It seems like it should work and is a step up from the cheap razor hair cutters.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It sure helps between haircuts!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair, and my kids&#x27; hair, for many years now. This razor comb is perfect for creating layers in our thick, straight Asian hair. I especially love that it uses regular butterfly razors, which I can buy cheaply at the local drugstore. I have a layered pageboy, and people can&#x27;t tell that I don&#x27;t visit a hairstylist. If you have confidence in trimming your own hair, this tool is easy to use, maintain, and just plain works.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a tool of this nature for year to keep my bweard in trim - couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.  He had requested this for Christmas? ! I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints (or praises for that matter).</li>
    <li> Not as nice as what I once had, but work.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! If you wear short hair, this will keep you trimmed very well. It&#x27;s a little scary at first - worrying about a false move - but hey, your hair is short anyway. Very good design and manufacture. I get many complements that my haircut is one of the best I&#x27;ve had. I do occasionally need someone to check the trim in the back or a little help with a tweak trim around the ears, but that&#x27;s it. A buncha&#x27; thumbs up. Made in Japan, not China.</li>
    <li> This is not an easy device to control cutting, and it does not cut below the surface because of it&#x27;s shallow cutting setting.  Therefore you end up cutting only the outside.  Good for a short time trim but don&#x27;t expect dumping your barber for this.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. You have to be careful that you are on the right setting but it works great.</li>
    <li> This razor comb is much better than the average razor comb, but it COULD be so much better. I&#x27;m not sure if the dial to adjust the razor makes a significant difference. I am not a professional stylist so I wouldn&#x27;t know. But maybe a seasoned stylist would find that feature useful. All I know is that when my hair stylist uses her razor comb it&#x27;s a lot more precise. For $12 I expected more out of this.</li>
    <li> Used this for longest time until I needed new razor and now I dont know where I put it. OMG.</li>
    <li> Very unique design. There were no printed instructions for it. That is noting that tells how to use it to cut hair or which side is for styling or for cutting. I am not a barber or hair stylist, so some form of general instructions would certainly help.</li>
    <li> Bought a lot of hair trimmers over the years and this one is absolutely wonderful!  Gives you that expensive razor cut look.</li>
    <li> Had something like this many years ago.  i like this because I do my husband&#x27;s hair (which is thick &amp; wavy) and it really cleans it up nicely, between $$$ haircuts.</li>
    <li> This product is well built and performs as stated.  It is particularly useful because it uses standard razor blades rather than the special blades required by the Hair Wiz I had used for many years.  Unfortunately, with blades no longer available my Hair Wiz became useless.  This product is great for beard and sideburn trimming and thinning, which is my main requirement.</li>
    <li> The blade in the device is very dull. When I get a replacement blade I&#x27;m hopeful this is all I will need for occasional trims.</li>
    <li> I received my razor promptly after ordering and tried it right away. It is extremely sharp and easy to use. I got several compliments on my new haircut. I highly recommecnd it.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than the old razor combs. It is sharp and quickly removes that extra hair that gets in your way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for keeping my hair in check - I&#x27;ve been grooming my own hair since 2003, when I became tired of stylists / barbers who simply did not do good work.  Originally, I found an old version of a double-blade trimmer we used as kids.  This Seki Edge trimmer is a slight upgrade from the one I used then (the old one is worn out a bit, so the Seki product works better).  The Seki product is for left or right handed use - no need to keep switching the handle, as long as you are adept with either the right or left hand.  If you have not used one of these before, take it easy at first and get used to it.  Seki is great product, has two double edge blades for trimming and thinning one&#x27;s hair.  I use it every fortnight or two weeks, because that way it becomes easier to keep that &amp;#34;trimmed look.&amp;#34;  Also, you may want to invest in an adjustable battery-operated hair trimmer (Remington, Norelco, Braun, whatever) - to finish up any &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; on the sides and back - must have saved a bundle over the years, too.</li>
    <li> Perfect for self hair trimming. Now I look the way I want, not my hairdresser´s. Some skill is needed to get the most of it.</li>
    <li> The shape of this Razor Comb is different than I expected.  I expected a Comb.  The angled handle makes it easier to work with.  Does a foolproof job of trimming your hair.</li>
    <li> Well, I actually purchaed this to keep my Dogs hair trimmed between groomings. It wasn&#x27;t great for that purpose, as their hair is just too thick for it to really make a difference. I do like the product and used it to trim my own hair !  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and replacement blades are standard double edge razors. I do wish they would post a video of someone actually using it on their hair. That would have been helpful.</li>
    <li> It did not fill my need , the product is very well made, I had very limited use for it</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very good cutting tool. I will defintely recommend it to friends.  Will buy another one later next time</li>
    <li> This has saved me a fortune in beauty shop visits! love it, it trims my hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> We bought this to help thin out our cat&#x27;s coat. He sheds, A LOT. He has a thick short-hair coat and this did not stand up to his fur.</li>
    <li> I really like this product- I have very short hair, and at about the 4th or 5th week after a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; haircut at the beauty salon, I use this product to stretch out the haircut. My hair seems to bump up at the back when it grows out, so I use this to extend the life of my haircut by another two or three weeks.  It saves me money and time!  I own several different styles of these haircutting/razor combo combs, and I use them all.  I like this one a lot and would buy again- highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This thing cuts fast, plan your moves slowly, or you might create the next fad in hairstyles. A bit overpriced....</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t so much a criticism of this product as it us of the whole concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine giving myself a full haircut with this....  I felt like a bit of a fool after buying it... maybe a professional barber can do something or other with it, but its not for giving yourself a haircut with unless you cut your hair very short...  too bad.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I had a little device called a hair wiz. It wasn&#x27;t as fancy as the Seki edge but I loved it! It&#x27;s an easy way to cut your own hair (and save on visits to the beauty salon). Just be careful you don&#x27;t get get carried away! I cut my hair so short one time (just combing thru it and wasn&#x27;t paying attention) that my mom made me buy a wig before she would go out with me! :)It&#x27;s a good price and was shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I have used this now for several months. I bought it to trim my beard when traveling (small, lightweight, easy to pack, etc.). I also have a Philips electric hair/beard trimmer that I use at home. Honestly, the Seki is better than the Philips - and for a fraction of the cost. Granted, the razor blades do dull and must be replaced regularly, and the instructions regarding replacement are not very clear; but once I figured it out, it was easy.</li>
    <li> Great product for cutting my hair. Won&#x27;t need the salons anymore, thank god.</li>
    <li> use it and it does the trick</li>
    <li> This hair cutter is easy to take apart to change the two conventional double edge razor blades that do the work.  The &amp;#34;click stop&amp;#34; settings of the blade depth adjustment and the two choices of cutting patterns are of excellent design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a vacuum cleaner suction aided hair cutter - &amp;#34;RoboCut&amp;#34; - to cut most of the hair and then use this tool to finish cutting the hair along the edges.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old razor cutting comb I have had for years, but can no longer buy the odd size razor blades to fit it.  I like this one very much.  It is easy to use, and does the job well........and uses ordinary blades too.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it love it!! What a money saver for my family. I&#x27;ve been cutting my and my husband&#x27;s hair using a Robocutter for years, but this does a much better job on the neckline and behind the ears (which is hard to reach). I don&#x27;t have to use the Robocutter as often because I am able to just whip out the Seki and trim away. Great product, easy to control the depth of cut and the duel selections are a wonderful bonus! I&#x27;m also very happy that we decided to go with a better product. I think it really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This works great and I assume I will use it for many years to come.  Very sharp and gives good results.  I use it for my own punk hair styles.  I recommend it to anyone who wants wispy layers.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work, i threw it away</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I expecteded, when you comb thru it hardly cuts at all. I tried several ways but I just didn&#x27;t care you the way it wasn&#x27;t cuting.</li>
    <li> for guys with super short hair this is a no fuss trim but does take some practice for longer hair use and its very easy to cut too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this is great for trimming all body hair..... very quick and easy!!!</li>
    <li> nice little tool....be careful though, it&#x27;s super sharp...luv the blade adjustment feature and handle angle</li>
    <li> It does cut well, and filled my need....was still using an old  Hair Wiz ; but couldn&#x27;t get blades for it.  so was using regular double sided blades.  This didn&#x27;t work as well as real blades. The Seki Edge haircutter requires  double sided blades&lt;br /&gt;and  the handle makes it  easier to use.  The adjustable comb and blades provide a good choice in cutting lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Am really satisfied with it&#x27;s performance and very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim and taper my wigs. It could be there&#x27;s a learning curve but I&#x27;ve made three serious attempts to use it and it hasn&#x27;t gotten any easier. It pulls and snags the hair and it&#x27;s money and hope that I&#x27;ve thrown away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about 2 months ago and have used it several times now.  This is the best that I have found.  I especially like the fact that it&#x27;s designed to accommodate the standard double edge razors which can be purchased locally, thereby keeping hair-cutting expenses to a minimum.  I suggest that you be very, very careful when first starting with this razor because you can cut off a HUGE amount of hair without realizing it due to the fact that the razors are very sharp.  Therefore, dial the razor exposure DOWN to the LOWEST setting.  You can always go back and cut off more hair but once you&#x27;ve cut off more than you meant, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the design, it&#x27;s easy to use and cleans up very easily for the next hair cut.  I would definitely recommend the Seki Edge Styling Razor. It will  pay for itself with the first haircut.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to fix a hair cut that I got at a local salon.  The stylist left my hair too bulky and without layers.  I decided to buy the [[ASIN:B000SSDTTI Seki Edge Styling Razor Haircutter]] and have my sister do it for me instead.  It is very sharp out of the box.  I had bought a styling razor from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply before and it was very dull and painful to use.  This one did not hurt at all and was very precise.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried it on my long hair and my husband&#x27;s short hair. Both work well. So from now we can save money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money on professional haircuts which didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I do my own quite often and have recommended the Seki to friends including a long haul trucker friend.</li>
    <li> Okay product but didn&#x27;t help trimming my pet&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Not as useful as I anticipated.</li>
    <li> Great hairstyling tool</li>
    <li> much smaller than expected,,,,, flimsy construction,,,,the locking mech. does&#x27;nt lock,,,not recomended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use - just &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; it through your hair.  I use it between barbershop visits to even out the areas that seem to grow faster than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see over-doing with this, so trim &amp;#34;less than I think I need&amp;#34; then take another look the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good :-)</li>
    <li> Want to save money on haircuts? This is the tool for you. I&#x27;m a guy with relatively short hair just over my ears. I got tired of paying $25 for a styled cut at the salon that went haywire within a week. So I bought the Seki Edge and I haven&#x27;t looked back. Very easy to use after some initial clumsiness on my part. The straight edge side shears off hair evenly as you simply \\&quot;comb\\&quot; your hair the way you normally would. Then using the styling side refines the cut to make it look more textured and layered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is hard to figure out how to open the thing to change razor blades. I thought I would break it, but it somehow popped open. Then trying to re-close it without throwing off the blade alignment is kind of tricky. I wish the dial mechanism had click locks, but it works well enough for me. Otherwise, it is very well-made and durable. Despite the petty annoyances, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This did not work for grooming my Bichon Frise.  Tried it on myself and the result is a hack job.  I am unhappy that I cannot return this product.  Do not attempt to use this on curly or long hair.</li>
    <li> I have looked for this for a long time as I had one similer 25 years ago and it broke now I can cut hair like I did before  and turns out perfect every time!</li>
    <li> It pulls the hair and my kids hate having it done.  Which is a bummer because it gives a great quick trim.</li>
    <li> Really cuts good.  Love that tilts for left or right hand.</li>
    <li> I really loved this razor comb as it does exactly what it is intended to do; cut your hair. I found a bit of difficulty in the beginning adjusting its handle and taking out the cover to replace the blades, but for the most part it did what it was intended to which I commend it for.</li>
    <li> My wife cut my hair for 35 years and then said &amp;#34;no more!&amp;#34;  So I purchased this haircutter so I could do it myself.  At first I was afraid and not sure where to start.  I wish there were more instructions with it.  Anyway I finally took the plunge and started with a motion like combing my hair and little by little got the hang of it.  It shapes and thins as it reduced the volume of hair.  Frankly I get a better hair cut than my wife gave me all those years.  The hardest part is getting the hair off of my clothes!  I recommend doing it nude in the shower, without water.  I have not dared to do it wet or with the water running so it that works, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, you cannot make a mistake while using this device so don&#x27;t be afraid to just take the plunge and style your own hair.</li>
    <li> I believe this tool can do the job as 20 years ago I used anothers tool for a couple of self short women&#x27;s cut but it did have instructions....this one did not.  It only mentions what it can do.  Is there anyone who could lead me to being able to get these directions (picture preferred)</li>
    <li> Works just as specified. Being able to replace the standard blades periodically will save lots of money over the long haul.</li>
    <li> The comb worked well until the razor grew dull. But try taking it apart to change blades! Despite the instruction on the tool, \\&quot;slide open to change blade,\\&quot; nothing--hammer, pliers, or screwdriver--could get it open.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a mode for close shave for the neck area, but otherwise great trimmer!oSo easy to change closeness of the blade, so easy to change the blades too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but be careful when you begin trimming you hair.  Start with the lowest setting.  Being able to replace the blades with standard double edge razor blades is a plus too.</li>
    <li> rips if cutting at all. Does not cut. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> Wife bought it to trim hair on our dog, too much hair on dog. &#x27;Nuf said</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  I especially like the side that keeps some hair off the blade so that it &amp;#34;texturizes&amp;#34;.  I would like it even more if it had a case to protect the blades from dust and moisture in the air.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Did not cut much hair and is flimsy.</li>
    <li> I bought it to trim my own hair. It does a good job. Why do they make you enter more words when a few will do?</li>
    <li> I have been using a cheap 3-blade triangular plastic trimmer for ages, saving oodles of money on haircuts in barbershops. Time came to replace it and this little gadget did it splendidly. The adjustable blades help a whole lot, especially when you&#x27;re getting started on the gadget; as others have noted, you can play it safe by using a low setting first and then go to higher ones as needed and as you familiarize with it. Does a good job on sideburns and around the ears. Another plus is that you can easily shift the handle&#x27;s direction (right or left.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not having difficulty unlocking it to remove blades for cleaning, turning over or changing. Everything clicks right in place and since I don&#x27;t have big hands the task is easy. If kept nice and clean and handled with care, it should function smoothly for quite a while.</li>
    <li> good product, confusing at first, no great instrutions, i had to play with it for a while then got the hang of it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wigs and i have to say that i works pretty well after a little practice. it&#x27;s made of sturdy plastic that is quite difficult to bend much less break. The only issue with this is that if you use too much force, the dial that manages the blades will move. it looks like it will last a long time so i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> No. This is a weird product.&lt;br /&gt;Choppy-but not in a cool way.</li>
    <li> If you are one that your sides grows faster than your top , get this it is awesome. Start at shortest range. Razor is sharp but protected, just comb your with it...</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Do not buy. It doesn&#x27;t cut very well. I ended up just throwing mine away.</li>
    <li> i luv this product! swivels and has 2 different types of trimming/styling settings! u really should get one! tis so simple and easy to use!</li>
    <li> it is a good product i don&#x27;t often use it, but it is somehow a great design and good quality</li>
    <li> Cuts well as expected from Seki (very famous for knives in Japan).&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, the cover comes off quite easily and I lost one of the blades while I was trimming my dog on the deck.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it so much for myself&lt;br /&gt;But I gave my father a great haircut&lt;br /&gt;Looks better than the ridiculous $60 haircuts he was getting before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use smallest setting first then work your way up&lt;br /&gt;Better to cut less off and need to cut more than cut too much off right away!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty decent razor. I have found that it works better on wet hair, because if your hair is dry it really tugs at the root--and can be painful. I have seen and used better razors but I do find this Seki Razor to function as advertised. It is a decent quality razor, I would recommend it to others. But if you&#x27;re really looking for something top of the line in quality--this is not the razor for you.</li>
    <li> easy to use, sharp razor cuts well and dial offers great flexibility.  others that I&#x27;ve tried snag and pull hair; this one is smooth and easy on scalp.</li>
    <li> I just received mine. I had difficulty opening it because I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s direction-illustration on the cardboard insert, reinforced by the embossing on the back of the device, advising users to press the back of the trimmer toward the handle. This is difficult to do without first flexing the gadget upwards in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the front of the trimmer (the side with the dial) should be pressed away from the handle, after gripping the handle and placing one&#x27;s thumb in the thumbwell. It slides up easily 3/8 of an inch, after which it can be lifted up to reveal the razors in their blue \\&quot;carrier,\\&quot; ready for inspection and disassembly. This is preferable to opening the trimmer on the back, which allows the contents to fall out in a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer should revise its instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I made a second pass through my hair and found that the hair doesn&#x27;t fall off the trimmer, the way it did with the (non-replaceable-bladed) Conair Trimmers I formerly used. I can grab it from the trimmer and toss it in a wastebasket. This means that a hair umbrella [[ASIN:B003ED85MK Haircut Umbrella]] might not be needed to catch the hair. Are other users noticing this benefit? It would be a significant selling point, if it&#x27;s true for most types of hair.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to keep my cat lion cut but he wasn&#x27;t having anything to do with it. I&#x27;ll try again when is for is longer</li>
    <li> Good product; works well. As several reviews have pointed out, do a little at a time till you get familiar with how it cuts. Clean hair from razor often for consistent cutting.</li>
    <li> Great tool .....&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair cutting on my own very easy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a professional... I would recommend this product highly!!</li>
    <li> Got it because my poor dog is terrified of the electric clippers. Wanted to cut out some of those mats behind his ears. This doesn&#x27;t cut through the hair. Not the dog&#x27;s hair, not my hair, not anything. A good idea that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> So, so useful.  I have very short hair and often go months between seeing the hairdresser.  This is perfect for just trimming up the back of my head and thinning out the top.  I really love it.  Did not come with extra blades, but it appears they will be easy to find. I had a a very cheap stainless steel fold-up razor cutter before this and it pales in comparison--it used to pull on my hair.  This Seki doesn&#x27;t pull or tug on my hair at all.  I use it just like a comb, it takes out thickness and doesn&#x27;t really distort the overall style that my hairdresser originally cut.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use , great for making that hair cut last longer . A great product at a low cost . Remember to start off with the least cutting depth till you discover how it works . You can cut off not cut on .</li>
    <li> very nice trimmer. will use it to trim my husbands hair. Maybe mine too. Cound&#x27;t find any  in any of our stores</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a haircut in weeks because I can cut my bangs, sides of my hair, and neckline with this product.  I have short hair and this product cuts pixie-style, and not straight edges.  This product is going to save me a lot of money in haircuts.  I will probably only have to get only a few haircuts a year.</li>
    <li> 1. Seller: prompt response for filling order&lt;br /&gt;2. Product is above average, and well constructed.  The blades, in each side, do different tasks, and the central round disc allows depth of cutting.  Handles well designed, and head is easy to handle.  Great price for quality.&lt;br /&gt;3. The replacement blades are double-edged, razor blades that can be purchased in all standard stores, and does not need specialty expensive  blades.&lt;br /&gt;4. Easy assemble/ easy disassemble, and easy blade change.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product to everyone.  Does not need prior hair-cutting ability.  Results will please all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has cut his own hair for the last 50 years. His tool for cuuting his hair failed and he has been looking. The Seki Edge Razor works flawlessly. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I ue his regularly on my husband&#x27;s hair and since doing so he hasn&#x27;t had to go to the barber.  Great money saver!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product(s) to prevent my going to the hairdresser so often.  I have very thick, coarse hair that grows like crazy.  Well, I ordered this product along with a couple others and used it for the first time last night.  I am very happy with it - - SUPER HAPPY, actually.  It was easy to use and my hair is neatly in place this morning and it DOESN&#x27;T look like I did it.  I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Bad thing is no real instrucions for removing and replacing the double edge blade. Sure hate to tear up this product trying to get the blades changed.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, it works well and the price was fair. I can trim my hair weekly now.</li>
    <li> Did&#x27;nt care too much for this one, uncomfortable in my hand</li>
    <li> Easy to use and cheap, saves me money and time to go to barbers.&lt;br /&gt;I would by it again and refer it to other users.</li>
    <li> Hard to figure out to not cut off too much.</li>
    <li> This item was made very cheaply and did not work. It did not cut hair, only pulled a bit out.</li>
    <li> did not use this product because margaret passed away in Feb  and did not get a chance to use it</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product - I am not a professional hair stylist, however, I style for my immediate family.  This tool gives me an &amp;#34;Edge&amp;#34; and my work is more professional looking. I highly recommend this product to professionals and home stylist.</li>
