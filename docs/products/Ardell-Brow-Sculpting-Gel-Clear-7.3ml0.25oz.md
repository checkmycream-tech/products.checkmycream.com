      <li>I have been using this product for years, it is by the far the best priced brow gel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use it on my very light eyebrows before</li>
      <li>But if u like a very light amount of gel it ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This seems to work ok.</li>
      <li>I love this sculpting gel for my brow.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
      <li>sometimes I apply it more than once a day.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Super nice .Didnt come in the box though but still was sealed</li>
      <li>My brows look great and natural.  </li>
      <li>Something handy to have and useful.</li>
      <li>My eyebrows were very defined which I loved</li>
      <li>It has a strong scent.</li>
      <li>First one I own</li>
      <li>It works well and got here very fast!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fast and nice to use.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cheap though</li>
      <li>It may be a good price, but you can definitely find a better product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Product is not a heavy gel, and I do like the fact that the spoolie is perfect for sculpting eyebrows and setting the hairs at the same time.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the results at first although they do not last.  </li>
      <li>Good looking product but no proper instructions on how to use it with what.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>reasonably priced...need to remember to buy more of this stuff.</li>
      <li>Another item which was highly recommended by a YouTuber, and I&#x27;m glad I took a try.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t sculpt your eyebrows as good as other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t send it for ages, had to email them first</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it was supposed to do for your brows.</li>
      <li>This was my first brow gel</li>
      <li>I actually really liked the product itself, but when it showed up from amazon it was almost empty!</li>
      <li>This is like hair spray for your you brows, hold them in placed all day long, I usually put to coats, and it work perfect.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s pretty much just to brush your eyebrows.</li>
      <li>and after I apply my eyebrow shadow, keeps it in place and hold for the whole day.</li>
      <li>(I feel like too much gel gets on the brush, which gets on my brows).</li>
      <li>So I guess it is not sticking as much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product-and I was able to order 2 at the same time with hardly any additional cost-it is a product that is hard to find in the drug stores so this was great!</li>
      <li>The Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel is too watery and makes my eyebrows have more of their natural curl than slicking them down.</li>
      <li>For the price, this stuff is great, but I would prefer the wand to be a little softer and the bristles a little closer together</li>
      <li>BUT those brands all contain parabens,and many many crazy chemicals</li>
      <li>It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t look goopy or wet, and keeps your brows right where they belong!</li>
      <li>I will next time try the Measureable Difference; it is a little more but claims to really set the brow.</li>
      <li>this stuff actually works really well!</li>
      <li>The gel is not very thick like others</li>
      <li>My eyebrows are naturally arched</li>
      <li>and this helps keep them wild but still tamed in a brow like form.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant but a little body spray/perfumy.</li>
      <li>It arrived much sooner than expected</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s got a very soft grip which means that your brows won&#x27;t necessarily stay put all day, re-application MAY be necessary.</li>
      <li>Thought it would be a little thicker and push the hairs a little bit more but it does keep the hairs in place.</li>
      <li>Finally something will, clear mascara will so the same thing I just couldn&#x27;t find any</li>

<li> I know a lot of people use clear mascara to tame wild brows</li>
<li> While the product smells nice, I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has failed to keep my brows in place throughout the day.</li>
<li> Not expensive bit does the same an expensive brow gel does.</li>
<li> my eyebrows can get pretty weird sometimes and this stuff helps keep them in line.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;ve tried endless brands of brow gel ever since I was a teenager, and now I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.  </li>
<li> , this doesn&#x27;t as a matter of fact it has a little castor oil in it which helps brows grow and only has a few ingrediants.</li>
<li> last all day it gets hard after drying...will order again..</li>
<li> This works, just put on and hold down for a minute or so to set.</li>
<li> You have to put it on rather heavily for it to hold.  </li>
<li> I use this everyday when I do my eyebrows</li>
<li> However, this product did not smear the makeup I wear on my eyebrows and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
<li> but it was a waste of money</li>
<li> waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive postage.</li>
<li> Doesnt comeout to clumpy or messy.  </li>
<li> This brow gel holds my eyebrow shape all day without being too stiff or gummy.</li>
<li> Unfortunately not many stores carry brow gel anymore.  </li>
<li> When i got it it was frozen and the bottom had a small hole.</li>
<li> I usually buy Anastasia eyebrow gel</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it worked well.</li>
<li> this brow gel sucks and</li>
<li> it doesnt keep my eyebrows in place it doesnt harden like others ive tired.</li>
<li> but it is just so dang expensive.</li>
<li> After a horrible waxing experince at a salon, I&#x27;m growing my brows out all crazy, long and bushy</li>
<li> I like it and will use in on my bad boys for ever.</li>
<li> watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product was bad (rockGlam or something?).</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s my eyebrows, doubtful though.</li>

    <li> It is suppose to shape your eyebrows. I will never purchase this again</li>
    <li> It works well and got here very fast!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product-and I was able to order 2 at the same time with hardly any additional cost-it is a product that is hard to find in the drug stores so this was great!</li>
    <li> I usually buy Anastasia eyebrow gel but it is just so dang expensive. So I was looking for a cheaper version. This seems to work ok. I have noticed sometimes I apply it more than once a day. So I guess it is not sticking as much.</li>
    <li> The gel is not very thick like others so it doesn&#x27;t sculpt your eyebrows as good as other ones I&#x27;ve tried. But if u like a very light amount of gel it ok. So it&#x27;s pretty much just to brush your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Keeps my eyebrows in line all day! Finally something will, clear mascara will so the same thing I just couldn&#x27;t find any</li>
    <li> I gave this brow gel 4 stars.  You have to put it on rather heavily for it to hold.  It does not cake and holds fairly well. I recommend this gel if you are looking for medium holding power.</li>
    <li> If you have hairs that have a mind of its own.  This works, just put on and hold down for a minute or so to set.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to but doesn&#x27;t really last all day for me</li>
    <li> This is like hair spray for your you brows, hold them in placed all day long, I usually put to coats, and it work perfect.</li>
    <li> This brow gel holds my eyebrow shape all day without being too stiff or gummy. The best brow gel I&#x27;ve found at a great price.</li>

I like it and will use in on my bad boys for ever.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried endless brands of brow gel ever since I was a teenager, and now I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.  This is my favorite so far.  It creates enough \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot; to keep the shape of your brow, while not causing any brow dandruff looking flakes.  It does have a fruity smell that reminds me of those Bonne Bell lip glosses back in the 80s/90s.</li>
    <li> When i got it it was frozen and the bottom had a small hole. when it thawed and I could use it, it worked okay but it was not &#x27;gel&#x27; like it says it is.</li>
    <li> While the product smells nice, I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has failed to keep my brows in place throughout the day. It may be a good price, but you can definitely find a better product.</li>

    <li> The Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel is too watery and makes my eyebrows have more of their natural curl than slicking them down.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were very defined which I loved and it kept my brow in place all day this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, it is by the far the best priced brow gel!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product 100%!</li>
    <li> this brow gel sucks and im not one to complain but it was a waste of money it doesnt keep my eyebrows in place it doesnt harden like others ive tired. it is kinda like water did nothing for me. And i will just repurchase a 2$ brow gel from elf.</li>
    <li> This brow sculpting gel does the job. No flakes. Goes on smoothly. Holds hairs in place. This price is also Good.</li>
    <li> This brow gel hold my brows in place and smells great! I think that every girl needs this in her make up bag.</li>
    <li> this stuff actually works really well! my eyebrows can get pretty weird sometimes and this stuff helps keep them in line. i would reccomend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be a little thicker and push the hairs a little bit more but it does keep the hairs in place. I give this produck a thumbs up. Just use the brush to spread the gel to straghten the hairs and leave them in place.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so fast and nice to use. It works very well and keeps my brows looking awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday when I do my eyebrows and I&#x27;ve had zero complaints. My eyebrows stay in place all day with no smudging.</li>
    <li> perfect! make the brows nice looking....</li>
    <li> Keeps my eyebrows in place all day.I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this sculpting gel for my brow.  It does not leave my brows flakey.  My brows look great and natural.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just use it.  Dont play with it and scab yourself like I did.  Great quality though.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked the product itself, but when it showed up from amazon it was almost empty!</li>
    <li> Good looking product but no proper instructions on how to use it with what.&lt;br /&gt;A waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive postage.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyebrow shaping. I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesnt comeout to clumpy or messy.  I use it on my very light eyebrows before and after I apply my eyebrow shadow, keeps it in place and hold for the whole day.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite eyebrow gel products!  It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t look goopy or wet, and keeps your brows right where they belong!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped for. Maybe it&#x27;s my eyebrows, doubtful though.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately not many stores carry brow gel anymore.  For the price, this stuff is great, but I would prefer the wand to be a little softer and the bristles a little closer together (I feel like too much gel gets on the brush, which gets on my brows).</li>
    <li> First one I own so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s THAT GOOD. Aligns your eyebrows nicely. Something handy to have and useful. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Another item which was highly recommended by a YouTuber, and I&#x27;m glad I took a try.&lt;br /&gt;Product is not a heavy gel, and I do like the fact that the spoolie is perfect for sculpting eyebrows and setting the hairs at the same time.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are naturally arched but I need something to hold it in place, so I hope this works.</li>
    <li> After using this products a few times I noticed that it does not set the brows as much as it claims.  It actually appears to make the pencil on the brow disipate.  I will next time try the Measureable Difference; it is a little more but claims to really set the brow.</li>
    <li> Not expensive bit does the same an expensive brow gel does.</li>
    <li> good product does what it says it is supposed to do. reasonably priced...need to remember to buy more of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok. It has a strong scent. Not unpleasant but a little body spray/perfumy. It also doesn&#x27;t hold things in place all that well, it&#x27;s got a very soft grip which means that your brows won&#x27;t necessarily stay put all day, re-application MAY be necessary. The gel is quite watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product was bad (rockGlam or something?). They didn&#x27;t send it for ages, had to email them first and they they ended up sending me TWO both of which they charged me for. They&#x27;re cheap though so I wasn&#x27;t too upset, but crappy customer service.</li>
    <li> Affordable and works as described.</li>
    <li> This is very good for keeping the brows in line...last all day it gets hard after drying...will order again..great shipping...</li>
    <li> Super nice .Didnt come in the box though but still was sealed</li>
    <li> This was my first brow gel so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it worked well. I am happy with the results at first although they do not last.  However, this product did not smear the makeup I wear on my eyebrows and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy. I would recommend it with the warning that you&#x27;ll probably need to re-apply it during the day, depending on your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
