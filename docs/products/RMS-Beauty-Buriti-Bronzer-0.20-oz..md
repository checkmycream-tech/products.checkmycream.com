      <li>The color provides a beautiful bronzing effect.</li>

      <li>Great for medium skintones</li>
      <li>I am so happy with the color and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Perfect color, perfect ingredients, gives you that natural summer glow.</li>
      <li>For the record, I have fair, freckled skin that never looks good with orangey or brown bronzer.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone with fair to olive skin.</li>
      <li>SO SO SO GOOD.  </li>
      <li>and it is too awesome to be true.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s healthy, and the color is great .</li>

      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this bronzer!</li>
      <li>Also great for some light contouring.</li>
      <li>I have lighter skin and it blends nicely.</li>
      <li>If you wear a  rose peachy  </li>
      <li>I also love that it is not shimmery like most bronzers!</li>
      <li>It smells nice and goes on very smoothly but is not greasy.  </li>
      <li>am thoroughly satisfied with the Buriti Bronzer.</li>
      <li>More for contouring than all over bronzing..</li>
      <li>It is more of a taupey bronze color</li>
      <li>this is my favorite product and my Holy Grail bronzer.</li>
      <li>I like what this company stands for and will buy more of their products.</li>
      <li>Creamy and light!</li>
      <li>glides on beautifully, stays put, and looks natural.</li>
      <li>but I would rather spend more and be able to use and enjoy the product.  </li>
      <li>great product if you&#x27;re into natural pigments.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth &amp; creamy.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
      <li>So happy with the entire line, but</li>
      <li>(you have to dot in on lightly).</li>
      <li>This bronzer if excellent - it is the first one that I can actually wear and looks natural (and I have tried many over the years).  </li>
      <li>The first time I applied it I took a good amount and drew a line where my contour would normally go, then I blended it up.  </li>
      <li>This bronzer is perfect for a fair to medium skin tone with a few birthdays or a few too many.</li>
      <li>In fact, thanks for reminding me about this Amazon because I&#x27;m coming back for more!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a silver dollar, the pot is cheap and the lid is kind of loose.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind it is a more natural organic product</li>
      <li>It looks completely natural and I do love it so much!  </li>
      <li>Very natural and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It comes out a really pretty, almost honey bronze color.  </li>
      <li>I give the RMS Buriti Bronzer five stars because it does exactly what I thought it would based on reading the RMS website&#x27;s information and the reviews here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Which is exactly what I wanted it to do!&lt;br</li>
      <li>just buy a NARS multiple, you get 10x the product in much better packaging.</li>
      <li>i actually love this stuff..very sheer, very natural and just really pretty.  </li>
      <li>Very convenient product to carry in your pocket to use after the gym.  </li>
      <li>I was worried that it would not have much color.</li>
      <li>it seems reasonably price for the quality of product.</li>
      <li>The color can be manipulated based on how much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>I can see it being good for subtle contouring</li>
      <li>The color is so warm and natural that I think I can use it year round in place of blush</li>
      <li>Highly recommend any RMS Beauty product.</li>
      <li>, I want to find other uses for their high cost, very nice natural lip color but a bit dry ... not coming back to repeat with.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s about it, no neck or chest usage unless you want to buy a new one every week.</li>
      <li>Fortunately a little dab goes a long way and it adds a nice dewy glow to a tan.</li>
      <li>The formula is fantastic but the pot is TINY, like a lip balm minus the depth or an eyeshadow pot.</li>
      <li>It looks completely natural.</li>
      <li>It looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>But this is so much prettier than any other bronzer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It is light and subtle.  </li>

    <li> This bronzer if excellent - it is the first one that I can actually wear and looks natural (and I have tried many over the years).  It is pricey but I would rather spend more and be able to use and enjoy the product.  Would like to try other makeup from the RMS Beauty line.</li>
    <li> This is a great multi-use product.  You can use it on your eyes, lips, cheeks and overall face for contouring.  It smells nice and goes on very smoothly but is not greasy.  Very convenient product to carry in your pocket to use after the gym.  And as with all RMS products, the packaging is minimal and the glass container is reusable.</li>
    <li> It is more of a taupey bronze color so it works great for contouring while adding some warmth to your face. Keep in mind it is a more natural organic product so you get a small amount for the prize but you only need a little anyway to use so it seems reasonably price for the quality of product.</li>
    <li> SO SO SO GOOD.  I am so happy with the color and look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium/olive-ish skin tone.  The first time I applied it I took a good amount and drew a line where my contour would normally go, then I blended it up.  I dotted it into my temples and drew another line under my chin.  OBSESSED.  So happy with the entire line, but this is my favorite product and my Holy Grail bronzer.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other bronzer. Perfect color, perfect ingredients, gives you that natural summer glow. Also great for some light contouring.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer! Beautiful in color, natural, and makes my skin glow and feel beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Highly recommend any RMS Beauty product.</li>
    <li> This is BEYOND AWESOME!  It looks so natural.  I am very fair skinned and it is too awesome to be true.  It looks completely natural and I do love it so much!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  My sister had buriti bronzer and I tried it and loved it!  It is light and subtle.  It leaves the look of &#x27;a hint of sun&#x27;.  Very natural and easy to apply.  Creamy and light!</li>
    <li> I bought this after I found the product on Instagram. I was worried that it would not have much color. It does and it applies evenly. I have lighter skin and it blends nicely. I like what this company stands for and will buy more of their products. I would recommend this to anyone with fair to olive skin. I also love that it is not shimmery like most bronzers!</li>
    <li> This bronzer is perfect for a fair to medium skin tone with a few birthdays or a few too many. It&#x27;s moist but not oily, it&#x27;s healthy, and the color is great . If you wear a  rose peachy  blush, this has an added subtle golden color to it. It looks completely natural. Love it! Try it!</li>
    <li> I use this product sparingly. More for contouring than all over bronzing..glides on beautifully, stays put, and looks natural. Would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> I give the RMS Buriti Bronzer five stars because it does exactly what I thought it would based on reading the RMS website&#x27;s information and the reviews here at Amazon. Which is exactly what I wanted it to do!&lt;br /&gt;+ It goes on smooth &amp; creamy.&lt;br /&gt;+ The color provides a beautiful bronzing effect. It is not orange! Yay! I use it for contouring cheeks, eye lids, forehead &amp; the neck.&lt;br /&gt;+ The color can be manipulated based on how much is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;- It is a cream, so setting it with a powder is recommended.&lt;br /&gt;(I have combination skin; dry T-zone &amp; oily cheeks. Breaking out has not been a problem)&lt;br /&gt;- It is on the pricy side of the spectrum &amp; comes in a small amount. However, a little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly satisfied with the Buriti Bronzer. It is now a staple in my cosmetic arsenal.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, wonderful glowing color. A little tough to apply as it doesn&#x27;t blend easily (you have to dot in on lightly).

    <li> not nice to me this color in my cheeks, I want to find other uses for their high cost, very nice natural lip color but a bit dry ... not coming back to repeat with. I think it could serve to dry skin .... &#x3D; (</li>
    <li> too concentrated for me</li>
    <li> The formula is fantastic but the pot is TINY, like a lip balm minus the depth or an eyeshadow pot. I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t accidentally receive the wrong thing. It&#x27;s about the size of a silver dollar, the pot is cheap and the lid is kind of loose. Fortunately a little dab goes a long way and it adds a nice dewy glow to a tan. I can see it being good for subtle contouring but that&#x27;s about it, no neck or chest usage unless you want to buy a new one every week. It&#x27;s not worth the $30 for .20 oz of organic coconut oil with some pigments. just buy a NARS multiple, you get 10x the product in much better packaging.</li>

    <li> great product if you&#x27;re into natural pigments. It comes out a really pretty, almost honey bronze color.  It&#x27;s actually a bit hard to describe because it&#x27;s not a typical orange-y bronze.  Great for medium skintones</li>
