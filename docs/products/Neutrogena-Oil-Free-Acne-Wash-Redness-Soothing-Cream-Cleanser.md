      <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and feels wonderful when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Just feels too strong for every day use for someone at my age and my kind of skin.</li>
      <li>The best part is any acne related redness gets soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love this face wash</li>
      <li>I liked the smell, the tingling and how smooth my face felt.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but you get better with it</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective solution to redness and light acne.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know of anything that works better that won&#x27;t cost me $20</li>
      <li>im always gonna love this even if it stopped working.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent 5 years of my life trying to figure out what product is best for my skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and really cleans the pores good.</li>
      <li>I would say it is probably best suited to young adults with very acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend it for people with acne that causes redness and inflammation.</li>
      <li>But I love the oil-free cream cleanser classic, this one just smells better :)</li>
      <li>That was mostly vitamins, dietary changes, and even a mild at home chemical peel regime.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy overall with this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan on the creme texture (I like something to scrub with), but overall I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
      <li>but this one is my favorite because it leaves no trace of having just scrubbed your face; on the contrary, it leaves your face looking refreshed and without inflammation or redness right out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, makes it feel very clean, and smells good.</li>
      <li>As for redness reducing, it&#x27;s completely true.</li>
      <li>Smells great, feels fresh, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>and now only 2 weeks later my skin looks great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helping with my acne, but not as quickly as I would like.</li>
      <li>It was delivered very fast too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Acne-Free, Clean &amp; Clear, and MORE.</li>
      <li>My friend loved every single one of them, including this Neutrogena product.</li>
      <li>It helped calm the redness of my skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have always been able to trust Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>However, the results are worth it, as any redness virtually disappears after use.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>First, the company that sent the product was expedient with delivery</li>
      <li>It will burn at first</li>
      <li>it leaves ur skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>The acid allows skin cells to shed more easily, penetrates pores to destroy bacteria, and helps ease redness.  </li>
      <li>it was dried out and i broke out everywhere.so far the best i have used is the simple brand.</li>
      <li>What I will say is that the flaky dryness of my skin is pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s acne fighting so far, but when you put it on and then wash it off, your face gets a cool, tingly, minty feeling.</li>
      <li>My nose and sometimes my cheeks are always red, especially as the weather gets colder, and from the first time I used it, not only was my face soothed and mostly redness free, but I think it is still redness free by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>works better than lotion did there, however does sort of dry your face out a bit.</li>
      <li>When I switched to this for in the morning and an exfoliating scrub at night, things really looked up for me.  </li>
      <li>I just took about a week to see any real results.  </li>
      <li>Give it a week or two before deciding its real fate.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say much about</li>
      <li>product claims to calm redness on your face and work with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin combo of mostly oily in t-zone but dry around cheeks and chin.  </li>
      <li>I dont have full fledged acne, but I do have some stubborn blackheads and occasional pimples or redness.  </li>
      <li>I have not had a new pimple on my face in days and the ones that I did have are disappearing fast.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s more oily and less acne.</li>
      <li>Use this product everyday for more than 2 years, it is gentle yet helps me not to have outbreaks almost ever.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have a little rosacea, and within a week it was so much better.</li>
      <li>I do use some other products along with this to keep my skin clear and healthy but this was the much needed last piece to the puzzle.</li>
      <li>This product helped the redness go away while other products just made my skin more red.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is Salicylic Acid, a common ingredient in many skin care products.  </li>
      <li>It burned/tingled a little, but was not unbearable and my skin felt so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this product in an attempt to try and clear up my skin.  </li>
      <li>It also helps clear away my acne.</li>
      <li>This product really does reduce redness and helps exfoliate at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I like that it has aloe in it, which is a proven natural skin healing agent.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>NOTHING worked anywhere NEAR how this product has worked.</li>
      <li>For anyone with sensitive skin this is a must have for the price .  </li>
      <li>It does have a soothing and soft effect, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>No breakouts, no drying of skin, no real negative experience at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a consistent issue with acne, only the occasional breakout on my chin and along my jaw.</li>
      <li>It works, but maybe a little better for someone with dry skin.</li>
      <li>I had a different, but very similar, Neutrogena product that had beads in it that cleansed the skin a little better, but this cleanser works well too.</li>
      <li>I have been using [[ASIN:B002Z72REI Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit, Super Size, 6.7 Ounce]] but wanted a second wash to use in the morning</li>
      <li>Not only was new acne coming up, the stuff that was already there was not healing up at all and getting reinfected again and again and again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have acne and sensitive or red skin you may want to try this product.</li>
      <li>This wash has a higher percentage of acid compared to other comparable washes,  so you definitely get your moneys worth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I would recommend giving this cleanser a try, especially if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrant products!</li>
      <li>But if you are, like me, 30 years old with combination skin, or older, and just have a few small breakouts once a month or so, then you might be better off using a gentler cleanser that does not burn every single time you wash your face.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my skin though.</li>
      <li>The size is average, kind of small, but I don&#x27;t have to use it every single day either, so I can make a tube/bottle/</li>
      <li>This cream cleanser is very thick and actually takes a bit of time to wash off as compared to other cleansers but leaves your skin feeling very smooth afterwards.  </li>

<li> If your skin is particularly dry or inflamed, it stings for about 30 seconds, but not enough that you&#x27;ll want to wash it off.  </li>
<li> For those of you with particularly sensitive skin or a dislike of products that cause a little bit of stinging, this may not be for you.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m dry, combination, and cystic acne ridden.</li>
<li> The first couple days it made my skin worse</li>
<li> I bought this because I realized half of the issue with my complexion was that it was red from irritation, not acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> im always gonna love this even if it stopped working.</li>
    <li> Had acne 3 years ago. HAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THanks to this no more. It will burn at first but you get better with it</li>
    <li> I bought this because I realized half of the issue with my complexion was that it was red from irritation, not acne.  When I switched to this for in the morning and an exfoliating scrub at night, things really looked up for me.  For anyone with sensitive skin this is a must have for the price .  I don&#x27;t know of anything that works better that won&#x27;t cost me $20+.  I just took about a week to see any real results.  In fact, I broke out a bit when I switched to it just because that&#x27;s what happens sometimes when you swap cleansers.  Give it a week or two before deciding its real fate.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels fresh, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Not really noticing any redness relief though... But I love the oil-free cream cleanser classic, this one just smells better :)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have always been able to trust Neutrogena products. However, this one was a disappointment. I don&#x27;t feel like it helped with redness at all and I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned my face whatsoever.  It felt like there was a weird soap film/ residue left on my skin. Threw it away</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this product. Our skins are like night and day. He&#x27;s more oily and less acne. I&#x27;m dry, combination, and cystic acne ridden. My break outs are painful and horrible looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t credit this face wash with clearing my skin. That was mostly vitamins, dietary changes, and even a mild at home chemical peel regime. What I will say is that the flaky dryness of my skin is pretty much gone. My skin feels smoother and my pores are smaller. The best part is any acne related redness gets soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like face washes that lather, this one won&#x27;t so take notice. It&#x27;s like a soothing tingly lotion you wash off. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> i love this cream cleanser it feels great on my skin and it really works! The first couple days it made my skin worse but I kept using it and now only 2 weeks later my skin looks great! I have not had a new pimple on my face in days and the ones that I did have are disappearing fast.  I do use some other products along with this to keep my skin clear and healthy but this was the much needed last piece to the puzzle.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has salicylic acid plus chamomile and aloe.  Now, if you&#x27;ve ever put aloe on a burn or cut, you know it stings.  That&#x27;s just part of it, but it does help soothe and heal afterwards.  This product works the same way.  If your skin is particularly dry or inflamed, it stings for about 30 seconds, but not enough that you&#x27;ll want to wash it off.  I like it when products sting because I know that they&#x27;re working.  For those of you with particularly sensitive skin or a dislike of products that cause a little bit of stinging, this may not be for you.  However, the results are worth it, as any redness virtually disappears after use.  I strongly recommend it for people with acne that causes redness and inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily, and acne prone skin. I tried this product and it helped sooth my skin. It helped calm the redness of my skin. This product helped the redness go away while other products just made my skin more red. It also helps clear away my acne. I like that it has aloe in it, which is a proven natural skin healing agent. It is a great value at just $8.00. If you have acne and sensitive or red skin you may want to try this product.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is one of the only brands I can use on my face without horribly breaking out. I have been using [[ASIN:B002Z72REI Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Scrub, Pink Grapefruit, Super Size, 6.7 Ounce]] but wanted a second wash to use in the morning so I thought I would give this one a go.  This cream cleanser is very thick and actually takes a bit of time to wash off as compared to other cleansers but leaves your skin feeling very smooth afterwards.  The cream itself really has no scent at all, so it&#x27;s perfect for anyone who can&#x27;t stand scented products.  Overall I would recommend giving this cleanser a try, especially if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrant products!</li>
    <li> This product really does reduce redness and helps exfoliate at the same time.  Neutrogena cleansers are generally really great but this one is my favorite because it leaves no trace of having just scrubbed your face; on the contrary, it leaves your face looking refreshed and without inflammation or redness right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I hope they keep making this product because it&#x27;s the best for my face. I can&#x27;t find another redness soothing cleanser out there at a good price. I have a little rosacea, and within a week it was so much better. I cannot find this in the store at all, but I found it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser for men.  It does have a soothing and soft effect, which is what I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t know that it lowers redness, but compared to other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ll go back for this one again.  The size is average, kind of small, but I don&#x27;t have to use it every single day either, so I can make a tube/bottle/whatever last for quite a while.  Not to mention, Neutrogena has always been a reliable label, so it&#x27;s no surprise I&#x27;m happy overall with this product.  No breakouts, no drying of skin, no real negative experience at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in an attempt to try and clear up my skin.  I dont have full fledged acne, but I do have some stubborn blackheads and occasional pimples or redness.  Neutrogena is a reliable and proven name in skin care, so I decided to go with this relativelt inexpensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival,  I looked over the label.  The main ingredient is Salicylic Acid, a common ingredient in many skin care products.  The acid allows skin cells to shed more easily, penetrates pores to destroy bacteria, and helps ease redness.  This wash has a higher percentage of acid compared to other comparable washes,  so you definitely get your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon applying this cleanser,  I could detect a slight burning.  Now I mean extremely slight.  It wasnt uncomfortable or painful at all.  But it told me that the acid was doing its just.  I leave it on for around a minute, then wash off.  I noticed results of clearer skin after using this cleanser twice a day for about a week.  It has definitely become a part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for an effective solution to redness and light acne.  Definitely a great product.</li>
    <li> A little too oily for my taste.</li>
    <li> helped to slightly reduce face redness. works better than lotion did there, however does sort of dry your face out a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for at least 2 years now.  I have sensitive skin combo of mostly oily in t-zone but dry around cheeks and chin.  This product is gentle, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dry from everyday use. It&#x27;s soothing and really cleans the pores good.</li>
    <li> the description of the product sounds amazing. i used it for 3 weeks and my skin kept getting worse and worse. its been 2 weeks since i stopped using it and my face is still trying to recover. it was dried out and i broke out everywhere.so far the best i have used is the simple brand. it isn&#x27;t harsh and leave my skin with a glow.</li>
    <li> First, the company that sent the product was expedient with delivery and I have no issues with them whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to calm redness on your face and work with sensitive skin.  It contains salicylic acid and started burning me immediately after application.  Instead of redness reduction, my face is now extra red.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t say much about it&#x27;s acne fighting so far, but when you put it on and then wash it off, your face gets a cool, tingly, minty feeling. As for redness reducing, it&#x27;s completely true. My nose and sometimes my cheeks are always red, especially as the weather gets colder, and from the first time I used it, not only was my face soothed and mostly redness free, but I think it is still redness free by the end of the day. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan on the creme texture (I like something to scrub with), but overall I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> I had a different, but very similar, Neutrogena product that had beads in it that cleansed the skin a little better, but this cleanser works well too. It makes my skin feel very soft and feels wonderful when you put it on. It&#x27;s helping with my acne, but not as quickly as I would like.</li>
    <li> It works, but maybe a little better for someone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> works well doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a consistent issue with acne, only the occasional breakout on my chin and along my jaw. I also do not wash my face - my routine is any shampoo suds that get onto my face is basically my face wash. I&#x27;ve tried a few facial cleaners, but they either dried my skin out or didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because it claimed to help with redness and I thought it was worth a shot. At the time I started using it I was having a minor breakout (as described above) and the first few times I used it I loved it. It burned/tingled a little, but was not unbearable and my skin felt so smooth and soft. My breakout however got worse and worse, and spread to my nose, cheeks and forehead where I never usually have problems. Not only was new acne coming up, the stuff that was already there was not healing up at all and getting reinfected again and again and again.&lt;br /&gt; I used the product every day for about three and a half weeks and decided to give up because I was getting embarrassed by my skin. People started to notice and ask me why I was so broken out.&lt;br /&gt;About a week after I stopped I had a noticeable improvement but it has taken about a month for my skin to be back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;I might just have sensitive skin, and other than the uncontrollable acne, I did like the product. I liked the smell, the tingling and how smooth my face felt. Another odd observation I had was that it did seem to help with my blackheads. Just not for me, back to the shampoo suds I go.</li>
    <li> i love this face wash</li>
    <li> This was purchased as part of a gift that included several items. My friend loved every single one of them, including this Neutrogena product. She loves it so I gave it to her. It was delivered very fast too! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent 5 years of my life trying to figure out what product is best for my skin and I have finally found it! I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Acne-Free, Clean &amp; Clear, and MORE. NOTHING worked anywhere NEAR how this product has worked. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, makes it feel very clean, and smells good. I will NEVER use anything else!</li>
    <li> Use this product everyday for more than 2 years, it is gentle yet helps me not to have outbreaks almost ever.</li>
    <li> It does help reduce acne but my issue with this is that even after using half the tube, every time I use this, it gives a slight cool-burning sensation. I would say it is probably best suited to young adults with very acne prone skin. But if you are, like me, 30 years old with combination skin, or older, and just have a few small breakouts once a month or so, then you might be better off using a gentler cleanser that does not burn every single time you wash your face. Does not dry out my skin though. Just feels too strong for every day use for someone at my age and my kind of skin.</li>
    <li> Ya its really effective for acne....it leaves ur skin soft and smooth.</li>
