<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We did not receive the size we ordered.</li>
    <li> Really love the fragrance of this body wash, it kind of wakes me up.  Just a nice clean scent.  it is rather expensive, so I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> I enjoy a nice soak in the tub at the end of the day and, for me,  luxurious bubbles enhance the experience.  Bubble bath is difficult to find.  I had used vitabath years ago when I purchased a travel kit.  At the time I thought it was a great product and remembered reading that the bath gelee could be poured under running water to create bubbles.  I bought the large bottle and it arrived with a pump.  The pump had several advantages.  You can pump an exact number of times to create the amount of bubbles perferred.  For my large soaking tub I use 5 pumps under full running water.  The bubbles are plentiful, last the entire bath, have a wonderful fresh scent, and really soften my skin.</li>
    <li> i have been using vitabath for the last 30 years, it is the most amazing product of all time.maqkes you fel alive..</li>
    <li> This keeps my skin from becoming dry.  Its expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I get this for my mother in law for Christmas and have for years, except I haven&#x27;t been able to get out to shop.  So I tried Amazon and found it.  She works in her garden a lot and has very dry skin.  She loves this stuff so I wanted to get some for her this year.</li>
    <li> I first starting using this in the 60&#x27;s because I read the Jackie O used Vitabath. Then it became very hard to find the original Pink product.  Gave Amazon a shot and happily there it was.  It&#x27;s so wonderfully moisturizing and the smell is like nothing else.  So clean and fresh.  So happy to have Vitabath back in my life.</li>
    <li> Most all products were excellent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  I have used it for several years and nothing can come to this for dry skin relief.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom.  I never used it but she hasn&#x27;t complained so I guess it&#x27;s OK.  If anything was wrong I would have heard it from her.</li>
    <li> Vitabath shower gel is a great product. I have been using it for many years. I like the moisturizing one because I have dry skin. It feels great and smells nice - not too strong. It also helps keep the tub and shower cleaner because you do not get a build up of soap scum. I was glad I could find it on line because the retail stores where I used to purchase it do not carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> This body wash smell&#x27;s great and doesn&#x27;t strip your skin dry. Who could ask for anything more? Happy I purchased and will keep doing so.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin like you have used lotion on it and you can also shave with it, not having to buy extra products to save with. It leaves you smelling wonderful. I am allergic to a lot of products but this one does not bother me at all. I love it and will continue to use it as long as it is made. I don&#x27;t care for the other ones as much as the pink one, for dry skin!</li>
    <li> I live in an apartment complex and the managers will not allow me to install or have installed a soft water filter.  The water is terrible.  So I found the Vitabath products, and bought the Vita-c-bath Effervescent tablets for my baths.  They&#x27;re great.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.  For showers, I saw this gelee and decided to try it (even though that wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem of having dried-out hair).  It does make my skin softer for sure.  But it smells horrible.  The fragrance is extremely powerful and smells unnatural, as if they used low-quality perfume products.  The gelee also has a screaming hot pink color that leaves pink marks on the bathtub if I don&#x27;t wipe it off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;So even though my skin is softer, I am not comfortable with using a product that has really overdone it with the chemical ingredients to achieve the overwhelming scent and staining color.</li>
    <li> Great smell not duplicated anywhere else!</li>
    <li> Although I am not crazy about the smell of this product, it is most definitely moisturizing my tired, menopausal-aligator skin.  I love the crazy lather and although it may seem expensive, you truly only need ONE pump to wash your whole person.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I will replace the used bottle with a new one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitabath gel for 40 years.  On and off I have tried other products [mostly because I&#x27;ve lived in odd places and could not find it], but nothing compares.  My skin is very dry and I grabbed the pink stuff as soon as it came on the market.  I noticed the difference right away.  Nothing leaves my skin as soft.  It is expensive to buy, but this is mitigated by both what I save on body lotion and the fact that a little goes a long way.  I need only about 1/2 teaspoon for a shower [that is WAY less than one pump full].  It is wonderful to be able to get it online now. Oh yes, I also save on perfume.  I never wear any, but people are always asking what makes me smell so nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitabath for years, have tried other shower gels, including more expensive ones, but keep coming back to this one ....it has a lovely non-perfumey smell. I usually don&#x27;t like perfumed products but this one is very fresh smelling and doesn&#x27;t follow you around all day...just smells fresh and clean. It suds up nicely and a little goes a long way. My skin tends to be dry so the Plus Dry is good for a little moisturizing, although I still need to add a moisturizing lotion after I shower.</li>
    <li> Thank you for not changing this product; its wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love Vitabath, have been using it for 25 years......</li>
    <li> Vita bath has a mild fragrance, lots of bubbles and makes bathing a delightful experience.....leaves skin silky and soft to touch.</li>
    <li> I love to soak in the hot tub and this seems like the perfect ingredient to add. It has a very mild fragrance, and four full pumps from the bottle seems to be just the right amount to use. My skin has been very nice for years.</li>
    <li> Of all of the Vitabath Products this one truly leaves your skin feeling clean AND moisturized. Expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much and worth it. Especially good for those heels I always forget to cream afterwards.</li>
    <li> This product dries my skin less than other bath products I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s a big plus. The negative is that it smells like a blend of old lady perfumed powder and men&#x27;s after shave. If they changed the smell, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years!!!</li>
    <li> Have loved this for years and always will.</li>
    <li> Most products (soaps and gels) that I have tried leave my skin feeling dry and itchy - Vitabath Plus for Dry Skin is the only product I have found that does not irritate my sensitive skin. I love the light floral scent and the 32 oz bottle lasts the whole year.</li>
    <li> Love Vitabath Moisturizing shower gelee and have used it for years.  I like the fragrance and the feel of it on my skin.  My only problem with the product is that it has paraben, which I&#x27;m trying to avoid using since it&#x27;s been found to be carcinogenic.  That said, I haven&#x27;t stopped using my Vitabath, but don&#x27;t use it every day and alternate it with a paraban-free bath gel.</li>
    <li> At risk of disclosing my age, I have been using Vitabath products for over 40 years.  Vitabath Moisturizing Bath &amp; Shower Gelee, Plus is everything they claim.  I have lived in the desert, have backpacked at altitude, and I ski all of which are very dry environments.  This product is part of my arsenal to keep my skin smooth and moist.</li>
    <li> Very good product, pleasant scent, although I wish the dry skin formula was offered in other scents such as the spring green.</li>
    <li> Beautiful floral scent, simply luxurious. Perfect for both bubble baths and showers, a little goes a long way leaving you refreshed and moisturized. The competition pales in comparison...  yes, even the expensive name brands :) For those who like to layer scents, there is also a coordinating lotion available. Another wonderful product from Vitabath!</li>
    <li> Covered the questions I needed to have answered.  Concise, descriptive, well grounded of a center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supports statements with facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernardine Mays Lacey</li>
    <li> My wife has used for years She loves it</li>
    <li> Love the Vitabath for Dry Skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this products for years.  The 32 ounce lasts a long time.  Very fast shipping and nicely packed.</li>
    <li> Tried and true. Oldie but a goodie. I wish they would reevaluate their fragrance though. It is a little cosmetic compared to more sophisticated frangrances that are out there now.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitabath Gelee, Plus for Dry Skin, for about 15 years and I LOVE IT! I don&#x27;t need to use a lot and the 32 oz bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for dry skin... Makes a HUGE difference year round!  I Love it!!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, stays in your washcloth during the entire shower, feels luxurious.  I received my first bottle as a gift and have kept on buying it.</li>
    <li> I use to love this product years back. I bought this with wonderful memories. I guess shower gel has come a long way. There are better products on the market today at a much lower cost. It does go a long way, so I will get to relive my youth for a while.</li>
    <li> Bring back the pink, the very first glee.</li>
    <li> The whole bathroom smells grand.  Softens my skin and moisturizes completely.  Everyone should try.  It works great for shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> This product is very heavily perfumed. I&#x27;m sensitive to strong floral perfumes and this was not for me. The package came damaged and some leaked on other items in the box so was hard to get rid of.  Ive used other vita-bath products and liked them a lot so i ordered this because said for dry skin. It may have some oil in it but its also heavy with soap and perfume. Ill stick to the other less floral fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent in Vitabath and I&#x27;ve used it for years. I don&#x27;t need to moisturize after a shower when I use this. The scent is light, it&#x27;s foamy, and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This not only smells good but is so good for your skin.  Also I use it on my dog.  Cures all his skin problems too.</li>
    <li> I picked the extra moisture kind as my skin is super dry.....It smells good .....lasts a good long time and it is good for my skin....For me it is the best.....AND it never needs a blessing.....It is already the best!!</li>
    <li> This product was shipped very quickly, smells nice but not better than the original green scent. It last all day and is perfect for my sensative skin.</li>
    <li> I have given Vitabath every year as a present to my step-daughter who loves this product.  This year I decided to also order the plus for dry skin for myself for the first time.  I love the smell and how clean and moist my skin feels after my nightly showers.</li>
    <li> I have bought both Vitabath Green and Vitabath Moisturizing Bath and Shower Gelee for years. The quality never varies. Added to a warm bath, they add a relaxing and refreshing moment to the end of a long day. As a bonus they never leave a ring around the tub or its occupant.</li>
    <li> Wonderful produce, great skin moisturizing in shower.  We recommend this to everyone who has dry itch skin. and the price is excellent!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin smelling great, skin is soft n smooth. Love it. Plan to try othere vitabth products. Thank amazon</li>
    <li> I first used this product when it came in a sample set over 40 years ago, if you can believe that.  I have very little problem with dry skin in the cold winters and will no longer buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago, but got away from it because it was expensive.  The price was great on Amazon - about half what it is in stores.  Lovely fragrance, very moisturizing, scent lingers for some time.  I also use it as a bubble bath for a relaxing experience.  I&#x27;m hooked again!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It has a marvelous fragrance and is good for dry skin. Thanks. Truly yours, Scarlet Cannon</li>
    <li> Great.  Have very dry skin so this great.  I don&#x27;t itch as much when I use this to bath with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Moisturizing.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> I have loved this Gel and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  My sister got me started using it and I&#x27;ve never stopped.  It really helps my skin stay moist all day and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great as a shower gel or for bubble bath - it&#x27;s thick and leaves your skin soft.  However, its smell is VERY strong.  This particular kind (pink bottle) smells like men&#x27;s cologne.  The smell will stay on your skin for a while, so if you&#x27;re a woman (or are getting this for your child to use in baths), consider opting for a different scent.</li>
    <li> So much better than Badedas.</li>
    <li> Has a very nostalgic smell to it, makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> This product is THE BEST.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I&#x27;m consistently trying other products that my friends recommend or that I see out in the shops and, hands down, this one beats all of them.  I have been living internationally and have tried everything abroad also and still - nothing comes close to this product.  The smell is beautiful, it does not go away, it makes a zillion bubbles in a bath or just cleans away everything and leaves you fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery. I ordered two bottles and there was some oozing around the cap on one bottle from transit. Very little product was lost and I kept the bottles rather than returning them. This gelee is one of my favorite bath products and I have used it for years. Price was good.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent and gel composition. Can be used as all-in-one bathing and hair-washing, and leaves a delightful scent in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I used this product several years ago as it was sold in the major department store. Sadly it became increasingly hard to find. Amazon to the rescue.  I love Vitabath. I use it in my bath water and it makes your skin very soft. The scent is very pleasant too. My husband likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite bath soap!  It smells awesome, leaves my skin nourished, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my shower, and lasts.  For the best smelling day, follow this wash with the Vitabath lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the fragrance of the original green vitabath. I ordered this one because I thought it might be more effective at softening my dry skin. I had no idea that the fragrance would be so super sweet that it would be offensive to me.  I haven&#x27;t even used it.  I offered it to a friend who uses the original vitabath and she didn&#x27;t want it because of the smell.</li>
    <li> Love vitabath gel. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I&#x27;m always looking for a sale to stock up.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for more years than I can remember.  I can no longer buy it locally so I buy it when I am in LA, however,&lt;br /&gt;I ran out &amp; really missed it as I have dry skin.  I didn&#x27;t want to bother anyone there to send it so I went online &amp; found you not&lt;br /&gt;only carried it, but at a cheaper price than I usually pay, &amp; you ship free.  I tried other brands but none compare to the&lt;br /&gt;Vitabath.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and moisturizing.  One bottle lasts a year!  Pump bottle is convenient for shower and for filling travel bottle.</li>
    <li> It was a mess and leaked out a lot in the package.  I love the product but it wasn&#x27;t packed well.</li>
    <li> My hot bath in a tub surrounded by Vitabath bubbles is my nightly treat to myself - insures a good nights sleep. The smell is delicious. Been using it for a very long time. Highly recommend. The less expensive products generally make me cough when I breath the smell in - not a problem with Vitabath.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 30 years.  It is the VERY BEST for smooth, clean smelling skin.  Your skin will be silky smooth.  I use it with a loofa.  There is another product that I also use, that is quite good (my 2nd choice - Nivea Almond and Tea rose) as this product is expensive, so I use it judiciously - at least 2-3 times a week.  If I could, I would rate this product at a 15!!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Vitabath (Badedas at that time) when my parents brought some back home from a trip to Europe, when I was 15. I have used it ever since. I&#x27;ve used the original Green and the Plus for Dry Skin the most. Tried the Spa once, but prefer the Plus and Green. Not that I had an issue with the Spa, but I&#x27;m a creature of habit. It&#x27;s an engineer thing.</li>
    <li> I remember liking this product more than I do now.  I used it back in the 1980s and it was very gentle and not as strong smelling.  I still like it, but I am thinking about watering it down or something because of the strong smell.  Also, I don&#x27;t remember it burning when you washed your \\&quot;parts\\&quot; with it.  Now, it burns!  I think I may go back to my Neutrogena or Arizona Sun.  Arizona Sun is quite similar, but with a lovely smell that isn&#x27;t as strong and doesn&#x27;t burn.  It is quite expensive though.</li>
    <li> Nothing else compares!!! Does anyone know why they discontinued it??? It was a Very sad day when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. It is a wonderful moisturizer it does a good job and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 86 year old mom loves it. I purchase this for her in this larger size. Always a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Changed my life. I navigate better now.</li>
    <li> Great product cannot live without it.  I have ordered this every year for the last fourteen years. Wish they would not change a good thing</li>
    <li> I have used Vitabath Shower Gelee Plus for about 20 years.  I would not be without it.  I still get comments on how nice the fragrance is everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> This product use to readily available at most department stores, but not anymore.  When I finally found it, I order the large size.  It is great for the person with sensitive skin. Have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> Finally received my wonderful Gelee after a lot of problems from both ends!!!!  My error started it all!!!! :.(&lt;br /&gt;The bottle that I did receive had spilled out into the inner box and was a real mess...however, the outer mailer box was ok...thank goodness.  The spigot also did not work for about a week for some reason...I unclogged it several times...but it finally got tired of my hasseling it and began behaving as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wanted to order this product for sooooooooo long because I just love gelee; however, finances wouldn&#x27;t allow it...and I purchased this bottle when my sweet daughter  gave me a monetary gift.</li>
    <li> Order this for a friend who is in a nursing facility.  She just loves it and we are happy to send it directly to her so we love it too.  It lasts her longer than anything she has used for several years and doesn&#x27;t burn her skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitabath green for many years, but I decided to try Vitabath Plus because of all the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent a lot, so much that  I&#x27;ve ordered the Lotion hoping it will smell as good; but sorry to say I don&#x27;t notice any improvement in my dry skin problem.  My skin feels the same as it does when I use Vitabath green.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product so I buy it as a gift for her. It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but worth it.</li>
    <li> I use the Vitabath moisturizing gell and body lotion together to get a silky feel to my skin.  The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> First, while the product arrived very quickly, the bottle was damaged inside of it&#x27;s box and had leaked. What a mess. Should have returned it, but decided it was too much trouble. Than fragrance was so strong I had to put it in one of the guest bathrooms, with the door closed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitabath for over 20 years...because I like it.  My dermatologist always compliments me regarding my skin conditioning.</li>
    <li> It is most refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Softens skins and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem it is pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Vitabath Moisturizing Shower Gelee.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Been using it for twenty years</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and it is a good product.  I have been using this product for a long time.  I am going to buy more to give away as gifts to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This was a valentine gift for my wife, and it made her happy.  She has been a fan of Vitabath for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the product and have used it for years, but the gelee in this bottle smelled like plastic and I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This shower gelee is great for dry skin, used it years ago and decided to try it again recently.  Highly recommend Vitabath.</li>
    <li> I REALLY don&#x27;t like the smell. It is not pleasant at all to my nose, and is quite overpowering. I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the product, as I haven&#x27;t been able to get past the perfuminess of it to use it more than once.</li>
    <li> I love how much it foams up in the shower and the fact that it leaves my skin feeling so soft.  The fragrance is awesome.  So different from a lot of the shower gels on the market.</li>
    <li> nothing better than vitabath!!!!  love the stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the Gelee, I use with Vitabath moisturizing lotion, just love it. you are sqeeky clean and smell great. It is gentle to your skin and I have sensitive skin, and it does not bother it. Will continue to buy it as long as I can find it on Amazon as it is hard to find in stores now as Vitabath has come out with a new line of scents I don&#x27;t like as much</li>
    <li> I have exceptionally dry skin. I have used this product for years and I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product for skin and leaves tub squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> This was a gift, smells amazing, I love it and would suggest it as a gift for any woman if you need a suggestion.</li>
