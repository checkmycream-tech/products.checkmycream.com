<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The attachments don&#x27;t stay in, so it makes it very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use!</li>
    <li> This works really well on my husbands thick toenails.  Saves me a lot of filing time.</li>
    <li> The nail care system was great!  I have thick, strong nails and could not afford a manicure and pedicure, each week.  How, I can do the care myself and save money. I have to find the time.  The product was great and my husband has one for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Great set for the price.  It does what it was advertized to do for very little money.</li>
    <li> When trying to trim my toe nails the device almost stopped.  It is not what they said it was, &amp;#34;Professional quality.&amp;#34;  I doubt I will  have any use for this product.</li>
    <li> it does the job on those hard nails and it is easy to use and that&#x27;s all I needed, so I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This set was exactly what I wanted.  It is efficient and small enough for travel.  The attachments were perfect.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was the cost of replacement parts.   I don&#x27;t know how long an attachment will last and to replace it is rather costly,  I think.   Am very glad that I bought this one.</li>
    <li> Very good for the time it worked. I just wish I do not have to replace it every year.</li>
    <li> Love this Nail Care product \. It is a real help doing my nails in between and pedicures for me and my Husbands and the price was rght.  Thank You  Amazone.com  cmo88@cfl.rr.com</li>
    <li> The product is totaly useless. If you apply any pressure at all it stops working. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Since Ive had diabetes I have to be carful how I treat my nails.This set does a great job.I can recomend this to anyone.I dont have to worry about cuting myself with the wheels because they have protectors to put against your skin.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who has toenails from H--L. Now he can do his own tonails and I don&#x27;t get cuts in my sleep.  LOL Every man needs one. He has had it almost a year and it&#x27;s still going strong....</li>
    <li> I had doubts about this product when I ordered it, but after using it two or three times it is quite useful and powerful enough to do a good job for pedicures and manicures.</li>
    <li> This product is cheaply built. Spend the extra money and get a quality product. It has a flimsy plastic outer shell. The attachments wobble when inserted. I dropped it from less than three (3) feet onto carpet and now the switch will not stay in the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; position. I would have sent it back but my 30 day trial period expired. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, please.[[ASIN:B000KGRNMM Nail Care Plus Personal Manicure/Pedicure Set]]</li>
    <li> Is it still a couple of weeks till payday and your nails are a wreck, but you don&#x27;t want to dip into your savings just to get your nails done?    Well, buy this manicure/pedicure kit as a one-time investment, and you&#x27;ll take care of that problem. For the price of one mani-pedi session (I dunno how much you tip, though) this kit lets you do your own nails, on your own time.    For what it is -- a budget nailcare tool -- it&#x27;s pretty good, but I do wish the build quality was better. It feels a little cheap, lacking a solid feel of a quality machined product. The metal parts of the tool also seem like cheap stamped steel and not quality precision parts, so keep that in mind if you buy this.    But all things considered it&#x27;s not so expensive and it gets the job done. You&#x27;ll still have to apply polish of course, but this set takes care of the shaping and smoothing. If you&#x27;re looking for a relatively inexpensive solution to avoid spending too much time and or money at nail salons, this kit may be just what you need.    If you&#x27;re not concerned with price though, the quality of this set is lower end and you&#x27;d do better to aim a bit higher.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I still have the first one I purchased over 25 years ago and it is still going. It&#x27;s slower now but still works for smoothing heels. It has out lasted two electric professional manicure/pedicure tools by many years. Don&#x27;t let the look and feel fool you. It&#x27;s a long lasting powerhouse tool that will out last more expensive tools!</li>
    <li> I had a chance to test the Nail Care Plus for both manicure and pedicure purposes. It did an excellent job in a short amount of time.  The various attachments were very useful.  Compact, portable, and reasonable in price.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A powerful little unit.  Have to get use to it like anything else.  At first you have to pay attention to what you are doing.  A good item, but practice first.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little set with more accessories than I will use.  It is light weight and does a fair job of trimming toenails, which is what I bought it for. This set replaced a Dr. Scholls trimmer that I used for several years.  It was better made, lower priced, and had a variable speed.  I bought this item because the Dr. Scholls was no longer available.  While it gets the job done, it is a little pricey for a light weight, single speed model.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy. I guess I was hoping for something more professional and this is not. The motor is weak and there were really no instructions; just a list of what was inside.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Package nicely.  Work really great.  Quiet to use and the job is done in no time at all.</li>
    <li> Has good power.  Exceptional product.</li>
    <li> Very light, portable kit.  2 AAA battery operated drill quiet but powerful.  Versatile set o f drill bits</li>
    <li> This is the second nail care kit I have purchased.  I bought the same product because it works better than any other I have tried.  I had to buy the second because I dropped the first and it did not work anymore.</li>
    <li> I have very poor toe nails and this product has helped me shape up my toes tremendously.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it enough to evaluate any better</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Nail Care Plus Set.  I use rechargeable batteries.  I am very happy with the power and the battery life.  I have looked for this machine for months in stores &amp; finally found it on line at Amazon.  Other reviews concerned me about battery only lasting 5 minutes. My batteries last all week with several uses.  Very Happy</li>
    <li> I have found the Personal Manicure and Pedicure Set to work well. It has all the power you might need. But, I think it is substantially overpriced.</li>
    <li> A friend for whom I help needed nail care. He had a less expensive product that was similar to this one but after a couple of uses of the other the various grinders lost function or would not stay in the unit. This seems to hold up better. Does the job satisfactorily, though one does need to be careful to select the correct insert for the care, not get carried away or go too far with any one function.</li>
    <li> JUST A LITTLE LIGHT ON POWER WITH SOME OF THE LARGER ATTACHMENTS.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately not worth the money!  It is not powerful enough to handle rough skin or heels at all. Therefore the batteries need to be replaced regularly, which is a big bummer.</li>
    <li> Works well, makes nail care much easier.    The provided files do a well-rounded job. There&#x27;s an insert that allows you to order more bits, I would recommend the small diamond one, it&#x27;s the only one that allows for precision detail work (around, say edges or cuticles).</li>
    <li> This item is so poorly made and does not work as advertised. It has so little power that the moment you touch the attachment to the nail, it stops rotating. I tried to return it immediately and was told by the seller that the item is non-returnable. However, I cannot find anywhere in the description where it states that the item cannot be returned.  I am very disappointed with this purchase and feel that I was swindled out of $41.</li>
    <li> Good way to keep the thickening nails of older years under control at home. Easy to use attachments and convenient storage case.</li>
    <li> This little kit comes with it&#x27;s own travel case. The nail tool is fine to use for a pedicure as that was what I purchased it for. My toenails are difficult to care for and since going to a podiatrist is a bit pricey for my budget I decided to purchase this set. You have to decide whether it&#x27;s worth it for you, but for me it is much easier to use than a clipper, nipper, hedgetrimmer, dremel tool, etc. You get the drift!! It gets the job done for me and I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews before ordering this product, so I was expecting more power and a better result. This is about the same as a &#x27;cheapo&#x27; one I got at a local drugstore. I wish I&#x27;d plunked down the extra $$ and gotten a &#x27;real&#x27; one. Now I have two sets I can&#x27;t use!</li>
    <li> Bought one of these in the 1990&#x27;s and have used it all this time, it finally died after about 20 years.  I loved it.</li>
    <li> under powered give it more power. it certainly cost to much.&lt;br /&gt;but, you market it like its some great device.&lt;br /&gt;nice job on false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;i should be given a credit i threw it away.</li>
    <li> Really works well and great for a quick manicure when I can&#x27;t get in to have the manicure done.  Turnaround of processing was great.</li>
    <li> I have used this item several times and find that it does everything I expected.</li>
    <li> I have not given this as a present as yet.  It looks very easy to use.  Unique and cheery product</li>
    <li> I love this tool! It is the perfect pedicure tool. It is powerful enough to trim nails and smooth rough skin but not so powerful that it is easy to hurt yourself. I have always had trouble keep my toenail cuticles looking perfect but not any more. I was able to get rid of all the excess dried skin around the nails quickly and without any pain or accidental cuts. I love how it smooths the nail edges. If you like to give yourself professional looking pedicures this is a must have.</li>
    <li> I have thickened toenails that do not take well to scissors or clippers, so this is the tool for me. It works well and does the job, but for some reason, I have to hold it at a certain angle to keep it running. It seems that at some angles, the battery loses contact. I would still buy it again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000KGRNMM Nail Care Plus Personal Manicure/Pedicure Set The NailCare Plus is a compact battery powered manicure and pedicure set. It should be used on natural nails and is ideally suited for diabetic foot care]]    Today&#x27;s difficult economic times have forced most of us to cut back on \\&quot;non-essential\\&quot; expenditures like manicures and pedicures.  Well, here is the answer to the need to still keep our hands and feet looking good.  This small but powerful tool kit works very well on issues such as rough skin around nails (toenails too) and on the heels and balls of feet.  The buffing tool is excellent as well.  I tried another mani/pedi set several years ago and was really turned off by its inability to work but this petite yet powerful kit gets 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Does everything it claims it can!</li>
    <li> It is strong, handy,you have many different tips for all your needs, for the fingernails, toenails or callus.You cannot hurt yourself You can carry it with you.  It works on batteries, . Everything you need you find in this little set. .It is even more efficient than the expensive sets. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Was very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase of this product.  I am a senior citizen on a fixed income so going to have a professional pedicure every 3 months just isn&#x27;t in the budget.  But I knew I had to do something about my toenails.  They were out of control.  This set has allowed me to not only trim them back but reduce their thickness.  I would recommend this product to any senior citizen with the same problem.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with my nail care kit.  I am in my 80s and my toe nails have thickened with age.  It had been increasingly difficult to trim my toe nails until I received my kit.  The little \\&quot;machine\\&quot; works perfectly, and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap manicure set...I wish I could have returned it but now it is too late. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past two years to take care of my elderly father&#x27;s feet. However, I use only one of the attachments--the small conical one--which serves our purposes best. His toenails were thick and deformed by nail fungus. I have gradually buffed down the surface. After each buffing (and in between pedicures) I clean his nails with colorless iodine. The result has been a tremendous improvement in the condition of his toenails. I like this device because it is gentle and easy to control--very important when working on the elderly. Shortening his nails with this is a slow process but safer than clippers or scissors. Anyhow, he doesn&#x27;t care how long it takes me--he absolutely loves the way it feels!</li>
    <li> I needed a nail kit to take care of my Mother&#x27;s nails.  She is aging and is becoming unable to take care of her own nails.  I don&#x27;t trust myself to use nippers and such on another person.  After looking at a number of nail kits, I chose this one based on price, tools included, size and portablility (I liked that it was battery and I could use it anywhere.)  I am very pleased with my purchase.  It arrived quickly and does exactly what I needed it to do.  It has plenty of power and we did her nails in no time and they looked really good.  It&#x27;s not a sexy little nail spa, but it is a perfect little nail kit.  Now I&#x27;m going to get one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-21-13 Update&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this original unit for my Mother&#x27;s nail care and the second one that I bought for myself.  I read some of the reviews about the power and I would say that the unit is designed to stop if you press too hard against the nail.  It may take a little longer, but if you let the tool do the work it will limit the risk of burning yourself or someone else.  I appreciate this feature, because I use it on another person. I follow the 3 second rule on my Mother and keep the tool moving, so I don&#x27;t burn her.  Also, it will slow down or stop more easily when the batteries need changing.  With regular use of this kit we have returned her nails to healthy.  I have used this kit once a month since my original review in 2008.  It still works well and the tools have not worn down.  When something does happen to this little kit, if it&#x27;s still available I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is great. I can file my nails much more precisely with this than a manual nail file.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, and the usual excellent service, thank you.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Better than clippers</li>
    <li> Great gadget for low cost....Will have nice smooth heels for my sandals and I can toss out all my Emory boards which break and don&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Extremely useful especially w/diabetic feet!</li>
    <li> Cheap quality, but a worth!</li>
    <li> This is much more powerful that I had thought it would be.  It works great, the assorted tips are very versatile, and the battery life seems to be good.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this file&#x27;s effectiveness, speed especially.  I&#x27;ve used the Dual-Speed, 2 attachments, for years ($9.99 + ship.) but it is very slow to file down thick toenails.  Just insert the attachment straight down into opening.  It took just a couple of minutes to file down what was previously about 1/2 hour per big toe.  Nail Care Plus is more expensive, but the results are warranted (free shipping even lowers the price.)</li>
    <li> This was for my Mom and she loves it !  She is already ordering another platinum file for my Dad&#x27;s use.  Thanks for the quality product.</li>
    <li> This has worked Great for me.</li>
    <li> It makes toenail care easier for people with diabetes . It is easy to handle. It has it&#x27;s own little case so everything stays put.</li>
    <li> Worse purchase I ever did in drills. Very disappointed, total waste of money.Had to purchase extra batteries because they are not included. Bits don&#x27;t hold in place securely. NO POWER. Better off purchasing an ELECTRIC drill that doesn&#x27;t cost as much and has PLENTY of power and last. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Like I read in the other reviews, it is a useless piece of JUNK. It slows down and stops when using it. Has no power diabetic or not. Only one speed.Item can not be returned even tough it doesn&#x27;t say so. I was swindled $30 (plus extra batteries that needs to be purchased separately). So disappointed with performance.Would not recommend. Don&#x27;t waste you money. STAY AWAY</li>
    <li> With my priority to buy a battery operated Manicure/Pedicure set, this one was a simple choice with the number of good reviews it has got. Though a touch pricey, it sure is a quality product, which I belive will last for a long run.    And I wasn&#x27;t dissappointed post its delivery, I gifted it to my neice and she likes it very much.I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the main filing attachment.   Really chops up the nails</li>
    <li> I got this to work on toenails that are difficult to cut, but this thing didn&#x27;t work that much better than normal clippers, and it took forever to do it. Perhaps using it on someone else would work fine, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional product.  Lightweight, portable and easy to operate, requiring only 2 AA batteries, this personal manicure/pedicure set is absolutely ideal for my diabetic patients.  Foot care is of major importance in diabetes, where the combination of poor circulation and peripheral neuropathy often leads to significant foot injuries or lesions.  For decades, I have always taught medical students, interns, and residents who trained under me that it is imperative to examine a diabetic patient&#x27;s feet, with special attention to toe nails and even the spaces between the toes, on each and every office visit.  I will now be recommending this nail care kit, which is quite reasonably priced, as a preventative tool for all of my diabetic patients.  It is also great for a much broader range of people, from older patients with thickening toenails that may be difficult to keep properly trimmed, to a younger population wanting a device like this for everyday and travel grooming.  Special Note:  one of the notable features of this product is that, unlike quite a few other electric nail filing devices which from from household current rather than batteries, this device will not cause injuries if improperly used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I wanted to find a small portable nail buffer.  I buff my nails by hand and they come out wonderful but it&#x27;s tiring so I wanted an electric buffer, but it doesn&#x27;t really do the job.  it works so much better when I do it manually with an old Revlon hand buffer and some buffing cream</li>
    <li> The On/Off switch was intermittent and barely worked. Overall the product appeared to be cheaply made. Product returned to seller. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with perfect results&lt;br /&gt;Small inside pocket could be roomier as tools tend to roll out</li>
    <li> Product came as delivered. Unfortunately the item I received did not work and I sent it back</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! If your a hard working do it yourself kind of guy that&#x27;s sceptical about the saloons...buy this and a good footbath and you&#x27;re set!! Using this is like a very small rotery saw. Nothing recharable batteries can&#x27;t fix with this as well.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep your nails--both finger nails and toe nails--trimmed properly.</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment. The tool was entirely useless, as the power level was so low that the tool stopped rotating the minute you touched ot to the nail. While the selection of accessories looked like they may have been useful, none of them worked because there was not sufficient rotational power to make them work. The price is a joke. Amazon should remove this item from their roster as it is a complete waste of time.</li>
    <li> I wanted this this for the nail buffer, but that generates so much heat on my nail that it is very painful!  The other attachments leave a distinct ledge on my nails when they grow out, and weaken the nail.  The only good use I have found for this is when I broke a tooth, I used it to file down the sharp edge until I could see a dentist.  Of course, this is not its intended use and should not be attempted by anyone ever...</li>
    <li> Easier to use since it uses bagteries and do not have to struggle with electric cord.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s compact and works very well. I used it in a nursing for shut-in because I didn&#x27;t like they way they handled her nails.&lt;br /&gt;get your own and use your own</li>
    <li> Great experience.  Just as expected.  Works great.</li>
    <li> This product does a pretty good job. Ease of use is not bad. Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This does a good job making nails look nicer.</li>
    <li> I had a previous version of the product and liked it. This is about the but the carrying has improved.</li>
    <li> Excellent fast service from Amazon &amp; Excellent product with easy to understand instructions.</li>
    <li> This item arrived within a week of my ordering it.  It has taken some to use it properly.  The attachment bits are easy to attach, the battery operation is quiet.  As with any tool, its only as good as the  operator.  That said, I can keep a pedicure looking good for longer than usual.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product yesterday.  It is definitely what I ordered and arrived in a timely manner.  However, I am having a hard time using it with having to hold down the \\&quot;on button\\&quot; all the time.  Wish it would stay on automatically, if you wanted it to.  It is powerful enough to do what it is suppose to do.  A lot of this is on my end as I have severe back trouble and it is hard for me to bend over to work on my toenails.  However, I will keep trying and maybe I can get it done.  It is better than paying for a trip to the podiatrist, which my insurance does not pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one I bought.  My girlfriend liked it so much, I got one for her.&lt;br /&gt;Cher Keffer</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a 20 year unit for a relative. Bit stops rotating with very little pressure, returning.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for pedicures and I plan to order two more for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I will a little nervous about using this product.  I was concerned that it would hurt.  But this items works really well.  Will save me a ton of money instead of going to get pedicures.</li>
    <li> Stronger motor than most.  Good selection of tips.  Very convenient.  Will be good primarily after trimming&lt;br /&gt;toe nails with a good clipper or scissors.</li>
    <li> This little tool didn&#x27;t cost much and is worth less than it cost.  I will get a more expensive one of better quality next time.</li>
    <li> Excellent and helpful tool.</li>
    <li> I received my order before it was actually scheduled to be delivered, and upon using it I have decided that it was money well spent. I do not like to spend 25-30 on pedicures and this little kit is perfect for maintaining sexy healthy looking feet. The only piece I feel is obsolete is the flat diamond; its supposed to file the nail, but it doesn&#x27;t. The little piece to remove dead skin from the cuticles is excellent. The piece that works on thick nails was my biggest curiosity and it actually works, my pinky toe never grows in right and has to be filed flat; I was able to do so with this. Good Purchase.</li>
    <li> Looking for something simple to do my own pedicure at home. This works easily and it&#x27;s very compact. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I am dissapointed with the this kit. The last one I had lasted 20 years. This one makes a funny clicking noise when I use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great set, the batteries seem to last quite a while, even with disuse in between, so that means the product isn&#x27;t very draining. The different tools are great and the case is small so it&#x27;s good for travel. I would recommend this to give yourself a professional manicure and pedicure and for upkeep.</li>
    <li> I can now take care of my toenails myself instead of going to the podiatrist every two months, so it not only does a great job, it saves me money! I still go to the podiatrist every 6 months for a checkup as I&#x27;m diabetic, but with this machine I can take care of my own feet on a more regular basis. And the fact that the machine will stop if I apply too much pressure is a good safety feature.</li>
    <li> Worked so well, my daiughter took it!  It was easy to control and to use on both feet (not easy on all machines).</li>
    <li> I have tremors and my hands shake so much I about lost the whole nail.  Be sure if you buy you have steady hands</li>
    <li> My Mother loves this! She is legally blind, but she can use this just fine!</li>
    <li> It was the start of doing awawy-with going to the Foot Doctor although a Scissor still had to be used in addition to it to complete the job effectively.</li>
    <li> A bit less than I hoped for.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Great for those problem areas on your feet. Battery operatged so no cord dangling in your way.</li>
    <li> This was a piece of junk. Poorly constructed of cheap material. I took it out of the box, used it and sent it right back. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Yes, the bit / attachment will slow down or grind to a halt if too much pressure is applied, but one wants to do that after seeing how slowly the nail is being reduced. Getting replacement attachments isn&#x27;t easy, and kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I found a better alternative:  the Dremel 7300-PT 4.8-Volt Pet Grooming Kit.&lt;br /&gt;(It works fine on people, too.) It comes with 120 grit Dremel ½&amp;#34; sanding drums - replacements are inexpensive and easy to find.  Two speeds, Low and High. Rechargeable battery with a convenient charger.</li>
    <li> Did not like better to go to salon that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> This is a mostly useless toy quality device. It is cheaply made but most important has insufficient motor torque to accomplish anything. The motor stalls with very little pressure. It is virtually impossible to adjust for a light enough touch and not stall out the motor. If it were offered for $5.00 it would still not be worth it.</li>
    <li> This little nail set is exactly what I was looking for, and it works just fine.  I recommend it to anyone who simply wishes to groom their nails. Works great! Does the job.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very easy to get your toenails nice and smooth on edges. So much easier than having to file and buff with emery board.</li>
    <li> Was not near powerful enough to file my toe nails as was posted in other reviews and which is why I purchased it. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and it appears to be one of the better shapers.  I have had several that were weak and am hopeful this one lives up to the previous reviews.  It came quickly and was packaged appropriately.</li>
    <li> This is truely a great product!    Very affordable and easy to use, I marvel at how long it has taken for me to purchase this!  Being so light, it carries easily wherever I need it, and it&#x27;s supplied case keeps all the attachments secure.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great item for any one who has difficulty cutting their toe nails. There are higher priced ones, of which I once had, but this battery operated version I found just as good. I haven&#x27;t tried all the various attachments but the ones I have used have done the job.</li>
    <li> It really works in maintaining toe nails with older people that need help. It seems quite strong and gets the job done as advertised.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product. Very cheaply made. Battery operated and didn&#x27;t even include battery. Worth about half of what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Not terribly strong but the price is right. I use it and I know it is not as strong as some of my other tools. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but powerful.  Need to be careful and know what you are doing.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy and compact Mani/Pedi set. The pouch it comes with is a perfect size and I will definitely take it on vacation with me. This is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to file down my claws.</li>
    <li> My father-in-law has ALS and this was a big help keeping his feet manicured (is that the term?)</li>
    <li> Have used it a few times, and it is manageable and light. Wonder if in the long run it will hold up, as it does not have a tough and sturdy body, but as long as the attachments stay connected it will do the job. Unlike others I looked at, the AA battery is an economical bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a similar device I owned for years. It works great except that one of the attachments (the small grinder for cuticles, etc.) falls out and does not fit into the unit like the others. The shaft is not the exact same diameter or length as the rest. I&#x27;m hoping it is just a factory misfire on and if I buy a replacement part, it will be a proper fit.</li>
    <li> I had purchase one more than 10 years ago-same brand but for some reason this one is not very powerful as the previous one.</li>
    <li> The off/on switch malfunctioned on the first use.</li>
    <li> This device is powerful and works well. Customer service is great!</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. Should have returned it right away. Does not work. Would not but again or tell anyone to buy this.</li>
    <li> Over many years, I  have owned 4 of these Nail Care Plus manicure sets.  One was gifted and when the attachments wore out, I replaced the entire set because it seemed more cost effective to do so.  Each of the tools work great - I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this set.</li>
    <li> Good quality item delivered on time.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to do a mini pedicure I loved it!  Very compact and holds everything in its case so you won&#x27;t lose any parts.</li>
    <li> very dissatisfied not as advertised</li>
    <li> This pedicure grinding machine is well worth having</li>
    <li> works great-only problem replacement parts cost are high</li>
    <li> This file did exactly as stated it took care of my thick toe nails making them look thinner.  File and shape tool work great on both my finger nails and toe nails and would definitely recommend this file to everyone that needs a professional manicure without the hassle of going to a salon.</li>
    <li> I have a very  hard nail on my small toe and this product is the only file that can work to reduce its size.</li>
    <li> Updating this on May 8, 2013.  I just changed it from 3 stars to 5.  (more after the original review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating may change later because I just received mine this afternoon and have not yet tried it.  I&#x27;m very confused by all of the different attachments.  Couldn&#x27;t figure it out before I ordered and hoped that it would be more apparent after I received the product -- but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the attachments I have don&#x27;t seem to be listed and some (if not all) of the ones that are listed I don&#x27;t have.  The ones listed on this site don&#x27;t have numbers, either.  I received six: numbered B1 through B6. On this page they are all called replacements and as far as I can tell they don&#x27;t list what actually comes with the product.  Now I admit that my vision is bad, but how can you want a replacement for something you never received in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t read all the reviews (it&#x27;s not that easy for me to read) so I&#x27;m unsure whether others have had this problem.  I&#x27;ll try just using what I have and update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(update continued)&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m still confused about the attachments but this thing really works!!  I was surprised with how powerful it is.  No stalling at all so far.  Feels like it wants to jump out of my hand.  By the way, I realized that I should have listed the names of the attachments I have so here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B1  Flat diamond disk&lt;br /&gt;B2  Diamond cone&lt;br /&gt;B3  Tiny diamond ball&lt;br /&gt;B4  Felt cone&lt;br /&gt;B5 and B6 are both emery stones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I got these listed right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly. My toenails are very tough, probably from both age and diabetes, and this works well on them.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  Does everything I hoped for and more.  Good product</li>
    <li> This one works just as well as the first that I have had for years.&lt;br /&gt;Nice not to have to look everywhere for something to fix a hang nail.</li>
    <li> I got the nail care set, found out it&#x27;s a toy, not fit for any manicure, maybe it will be able to polish some baby nails, not much more.</li>
    <li> I am using this Nail Care Plus Manicure set to keep my Yorkie nails trimmed.  I always feared cutting them too short with a scissors.  With this manicure tool, I have much more control on the end length.in a much quicker time than using a file.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is really great. Manicure and pedicure in about 20 minutes, and it did a great job.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this product, the bits work well and the unit had enough power to do what&#x27;s supposed to do. My problem was that the unit lost the grip on the bits after some months of normal use. I sent it back and got it replaced, but after a couple of months the same problem arose again. It doesn&#x27;t hold onto the bits hard enough for a good rotation. Because of that, I can only give it 3 stars</li>
    <li> I liked this, but there was a tool missing and one of the tools was taped to the outside of the package. I&#x27;m afraid to use Amazon again. :(</li>
    <li> I actually replaced the same item with this purchase, as the first one I had was well over 20 yrs old and just quit. This is very efficient at what it does so your touch must be very light. Runs well and the accessories are very easy to change. Not for someone who has dexterity issues. I love mine and would be it again if it is around in another 20 years!</li>
    <li> very happy with this product, works well in hard to get  to areas, I am concerned about where to get addtl parts when needed, works well, has adequate power and easy hand maneuvering-good product</li>
    <li> Very weak. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Useless, flimsy and cheap. The set had no power to file nails down. Very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I had one like this for years, and loved it, but it finally died after many drops on the floor.  Works great!</li>
    <li> It is supposed to take 2 AA batteries, however I cannot get my AA batteries to fit.  I&#x27;m afraid to force them because I might break it. I purchased this item to replace the identical one I had for over 6 years!  I plan to return it if I cannot get batteries to fir.</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly for filing down thick toe nails.  And it does it&#x27;s job!  It&#x27;s also great that it comes complete with the little case to store it in.</li>
</ol>
