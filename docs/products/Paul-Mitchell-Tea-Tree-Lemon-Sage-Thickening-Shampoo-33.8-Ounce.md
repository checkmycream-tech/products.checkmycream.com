      <li>Also, it cleans pretty good.</li>
      <li>Packed nicely and quick shipment.</li>
      <li>just clean hair/&lt;br /&gt;definitely buying more.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a strong shampoo.  </li>
      <li>went fine.</li>
      <li>It does work on my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Product was accurately described.  </li>
      <li>Learned my lesson not to use cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>I used to use the cheap stuff like Herbal Essences or whatever they had at Costco, which made tons of hair fall out every time I showered.</li>
      <li>paul mitchell is the best...and its animal cruelty free</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that&#x27;s thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the fact that it cleans thoroughly without stripping my hair too much.</li>
      <li>This helps tremendously</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Having used the original Tea Tree for years I was ready for a change.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it cleanses my hair &amp; scalp unlike other cheap products out there.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel very clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
      <li>Exactly the product for which I was searching....</li>
      <li>I really love the clean smell when I wash my hair and the slight scent it leaves.  </li>
      <li>After using this shampoo, besides very well cleaned scalp without feeling dryness, my hair did thickened much more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I have  Fine flat hair.</li>
      <li>Also, the shampoo itself has a different consistency than the original one.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The shampoo was very watery, and was clear.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i have long hair, 1 wash is enough to get it clean!</li>
      <li>I have just purchased this, and immediately after the first use, I did not have the same feeling at all.</li>
      <li>no other shampoo can do that/ no feeling of grease afterwards.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and it really makes my blonde thin hair have more body.</li>
      <li>I dread the difficulty of scouting out something else that I really, really like to use on a regular basis, and it seems inevitable that &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; eventually eliminate such items from production.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going back to the old stand-</li>

<li> I thought I can trust amazon with authenticity of the item, but this item is completely fake.</li>
<li> I have bought it through Amazon.com as a vendor, and they have still sent me a fake one.</li>
<li> Although, it is a bit expensive at around $30 per 1 liter bottle.</li>
<li> Very disappointed with the packing!!!</li>

    <li> I love this shampoo.  It smells very good.  It makes my hair feel very clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a nice citrus smell which is very appropriate for males. It leaves hair looking fuller and eliminates that oily look.</li>
    <li> I use it daily and it really makes my blonde thin hair have more body.</li>
    <li> I wish it had more tea tree fragrance, but it is very good nonetheless. My hair is very fine, and this helps alot./</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that&#x27;s thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older and I&#x27;ve used many thickening shampoos much more costly than this one, &amp; this is definitely one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used. Does what it says, &amp; has a light great smelling fragrance. One of my favorite things about this shampoo is the fragrance. Great product I&#x27;my always stocked up on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tea tree lavender mint, and was very pleased with that one. So I decided to give this one a try. It turned out that Paul Mitchell has always done a good job in their product. After using this shampoo, besides very well cleaned scalp without feeling dryness, my hair did thickened much more than I expected.  I not sure if it&#x27;s because I had my hair permed or not. The scent of this shampoo, I think, is more like lemongrass. Lemon plus sage equals lemongrass? ：） It&#x27;s very fresh and clean, makes it very perfect shampoo for hot summer. Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have the bought the same Tea Tree shampoo from a hair salon in the past, and provided a tingling sensation when it was used.

    <li> Repeat user, love this product. Doesn&#x27;t fade my color. Love the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past three years. Having very thin color-treated hair, I&#x27;d had difficulty finding a shampoo which didn&#x27;t weigh it down and strip color. This one has far surpassed any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love the product.Supplier delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things I fret will be discontinued.  I dread the difficulty of scouting out something else that I really, really like to use on a regular basis, and it seems inevitable that &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; eventually eliminate such items from production.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers and toes crossed about this shampoo--it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> A good shampoo- not as well formulated as I would like. Would need several applications  to do a satisfactory job.</li>
    <li> Exactly the product for which I was searching....</li>
    <li> Product was accurately described.  Product shipping went well.  Would do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> leaked...  lost about 1/3 in shipping&lt;br /&gt;sad</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for several years.  Love the smell and the fact that it cleans thoroughly without stripping my hair too much.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this procuct and we ordered it and recieved it.  went fine. i would do it again thanx</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK at best. Having used the original Tea Tree for years I was ready for a change.  I&#x27;m definitely going back to the old stand-by when it&#x27;s gone!!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Would buy again.  It leaves hair very dry and stripped but it&#x27;s a strong shampoo.  Deep cleaner.</li>
    <li> Learned my lesson not to use cheap stuff. I don&#x27;t know if this is making my hair thicker, but I think it is just NOT making my hair fall out! I used to use the cheap stuff like Herbal Essences or whatever they had at Costco, which made tons of hair fall out every time I showered. The result is my hair does look thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, very happy with this product. Not too perfumy and does a good job cleaning my hair. My wife likes it a lot too.</li>
    <li> Was leaking and did not smell the same as the shampoo purchased in salon - seemed watered down....</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo ever.</li>
    <li> The pump itself was broken upon arrival...</li>
    <li> Love, love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling like I was 20 again!  Doesn&#x27;t strip color.  Smells great.  Packed nicely and quick shipment.</li>
    <li> both the shampoo and conditioner are great... they do just what it says...great product...paul mitchell is the best...and its animal cruelty free</li>
    <li> I have  Fine flat hair. This helps tremendously</li>
    <li> i bought it for my husband. tell you what - i stopped finding his hair all over the bed. it&#x27;s so great! i loved it too. he of course did as well&lt;br /&gt;nice smell&lt;br /&gt;i have long hair, 1 wash is enough to get it clean! no other shampoo can do that/ no feeling of grease afterwards. just clean hair/&lt;br /&gt;definitely buying more. and for myself too))</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for everyday use. This is my 3rd or 4th bottle</li>
    <li> I especially love this shampoo for more than one reason.  It does work on my fine hair.  I really love the clean smell when I wash my hair and the slight scent it leaves.  It&#x27;s the first shampoo I have found that does what it says it will!!!</li>
    <li> My package arrived with the shampoo leaking thru a flimsy pieces of plastic wrap.  The Christmas cards were in the same box as well as the candles.  One box of cards was torn open and am not sure yet if the shampoo ruined any or not.  Very disappointed with the packing!!!</li>
    <li> Love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Lemon Sage shampoo. Fragrance smells soo good, refreshing, and clean. Love the way it cleanses my hair &amp; scalp unlike other cheap products out there.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. I can feel the volume of the hair. Also, it cleans pretty good. Of course, nice smell too. I like lemon flavor. Highly recommended. Although, it is a bit expensive at around $30 per 1 liter bottle. It is an average price for this shampoo.</li>
