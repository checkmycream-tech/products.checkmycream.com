      <li>Love the smell!!</li>
      <li>This shampoo does the job well, and smells very nice in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathered up very nicely, and rinsed well.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>so the price seems fair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve loved how my hair has smelled since.  </li>
      <li>I have always loved tropical smells</li>
      <li>/&gt;Herbal Essence is known for having good scents.  </li>
      <li>and it smelled good</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shampoo seems concentrated, and so a good value for the</li>
      <li>shampoo that would clean my hair well and NOT coat the shaft with ANYTHING for the best adherence of the dye.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is pretty good, not the best I have tried, but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
      <li>When I opened the bottle to smell it I was very pleased however scrubbing it into my scalp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I love this scent!</li>
      <li>I feel amazing.</li>
      <li>I actually liked this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I told her I knew from their own website they did not test</li>
      <li>It does work well as a shampoo, I liked the lather and how my hair felt afterwards.</li>
      <li>Although as much as I lose in a day I suppose I could say this shampoo is working just because I haven&#x27;t found any bald spots, which is impressive</li>
      <li>But I always liked their product and thought I would give it a shot again.</li>
      <li>I told her I knew from their own website they did not test</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an herby kind of citrus smell, like a spiced orange (it is supposed to be a grapefruit scent, but I didn&#x27;t quite smell that, but then again, grapefruits are not as strong a smell as oranges!)  </li>
      <li>The coconut oil works like a leave in conditioner, and make my hair feel very strong.</li>
      <li>Everyone has their own ideas of what they want to smell like, so keep that in mind before you purchase, but if you like a fruitier scent and have oily hair then this could be something you’d love to try.</li>
      <li>Not the most amazing shampoo I have ever tried</li>
      <li>Those two scents are scents you imagine as being very light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>My hair is kind of fine although there is a lot of it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Herbal Essences shampoos ever since my family bought them from Costco many years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love how this product smells.  </li>
      <li>Love the volume.</li>
      <li>If you love the smell of grapefruits in the morning; well, maybe this is the shampoo for you.</li>
      <li>My favorite is CO Bigelow Mentha, however at $15 a bottle</li>
      <li>might give this a try again when winter hits; maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with it when the air is a bit drier.  </li>
      <li>favorite  is Hello Hydration Coconut Essences.</li>
      <li>My favorite is still Color Me</li>
      <li>and then \\&quot;for the love of my hair\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I shampooed again and again one more time.</li>
      <li>People have told me they love my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Most of those compliments come from MEN.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it was ok.  </li>
      <li>However, on my sister&#x27;s hair, which is curly, it made her hair more manageable as she uses a lot of product</li>
      <li>lather was ok.  </li>
      <li>This one has a nice light citrusy scent with a hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also love the fact that it is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>This did quite well on most fronts.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I love Herbal Essence products</li>
      <li>I don’t find it overwhelming or off-putting at all.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using the shampoo, my hair felt very clean and light which I liked.</li>
      <li>Leaving it with a very light but strong feeling.</li>
      <li>The liquid has a gel like texture, and it smells pretty good in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Then using this shampoo with it, it makes it very clean and strong, without any greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>, it seems to work okay, but I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone unless they need really light cleansing.</li>
      <li>When it said white grapefruit and mint extract, I wondered how it would smell, but it turned out real nice.</li>
      <li>Which for me is a good thing, as I don&#x27;t really like mint.  </li>
      <li>dang, I love the scent so much!!!  </li>
      <li>It smells clean to me, and I just love the minty, citrus smell.  </li>
      <li>But I was pleased to discover that it also made my hair look unusually clean and shiny, so in the end, I was well</li>
      <li>This particular flavor, Mint and Grapefruit, does smell good.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a type of hand soap sold at Trader Joe&#x27;s that had a similarly strong scent.</li>
      <li>It does not have an objectionable or strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It had a pretty strong smell, but I liked it.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair clean, shiny, and most important to me, fuller.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34;, i.e., clear and does a good job of cleaning your hair squeaky clean!</li>
      <li>was a child of the 70s and early 80s, when Herbal Essences was a huge name in shampoos, and I&#x27;m glad to be able to try them again!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one could fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one could fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to say that I really, really, enjoy the fragrance of this product.  </li>
      <li>For my specific hair type, this is great shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It has a light fruity smell that on the front states it is from a mixture of grapefruit and mint.</li>
      <li>It gets me feeling really clean, and the drying aspect that so many others have noted on is a bonus for me, since it helps my scalp not feel so oily so quickly.  </li>
      <li>For me and my needs, I am very pleased and give it 5 stars as there is nothing to improve as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>When I checked the ingredients I got excited because I saw that it had both peppermint oil and menthol listed as well field mint.</li>
      <li>Herbal Essenses has always had a unique scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would have to say I am knocking a star off because of the non-relation to the original smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tried this shampoo and my first thought when using this is, refreshing.</li>
      <li>; I used to use the original Herbal Essence shampoo when it was on sale.</li>
      <li>The scent is a significant detraction for me.</li>
      <li>but it is a very fresh, not too sweet</li>
      <li>and my hair actually looks and feels great right now.  </li>
      <li>and my hair actually looks and feels great right now.  </li>
      <li>my impressions for the first few uses were impressive.</li>
      <li>It smells, sweet fruity, and doesn&#x27;t have a hint of mint scent that I could distinguish.  </li>
      <li>full stop.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this scent! I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils from my hair, which can be a problem because my hair does get quite dry.  I do an oil treatment in my hair a couple of times a week and some shampoos leave my hair looking flat and oily afterwards, but this shampoo removes the excess oil leaving my hair soft and smelling great. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell!! Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo to help with volume in my hair.  After several weeks of usage the Shampoo didnt really help but overall was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I was looking for a sulfate-free volumizing shampoo. Many SLS-free or organic shampoos that I have tried have made my hair flat and greasy, and at least this shampoo didn&#x27;t do that, but it did not add any significant volume. The worst part was that this gave me terrible dandruff, which I never had before. I usually try to finish up a product even if I don&#x27;t love it, but I threw this out before the bottle was even half empty. I appreciate that Herbal Essences is trying to make sulfate-free products, but this does not do its job at all.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am surprised by some of the product reviews.  I absolutely love this shampoo!  I have been searching for a shampoo for years and have tried just about everything out there.  Being someone who has very thin, straight hair (medium length) I am always searching for something to add body and volume.  I have had no luck finding that product until now.  My hair is soft, shiny and has the mad volume I expect from a volumizing shampoo.  I do not use the matching conditioner;  use Dermorganics Masque instead.  No dryness, no static, lathers well.  I love the scent which does dissipate after your hair is dry.  I also love the fact that it is a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product&amp;#34;.  Hope this product stays around for a very long time!</li>
    <li> An answer to my fragile hair has arrived at last! I am blond. My hair has always been wispy, and now that I am older, it is in places barely there. This Herbal Essences Naked Volume Shampoo really seems to work. It leaves my hair clean, shiny, and most important to me, fuller. I feel amazing. I bought the conditioner of the same brand (also offered on Vine) only because I couldn&#x27;t wait to try both together once I had such a good experience with HERBAL ESSENCES NAKED VOLUME SHAMPOO.</li>
    <li> First off, I really like the light scent that this shampoo imparts on my hair, not a heavy perfumy scent but a fresh clean one. I dye my hair with the Clairol Natural Instincts semi permanent dye and was looking for a &amp;#34;pre-dye&amp;#34; shampoo that would clean my hair well and NOT coat the shaft with ANYTHING for the best adherence of the dye. This certainly did the trick. It also left my hair very full and fluffy which is something new for me as I have baby fine, limp, straight hair, so you can see why I am really liking it! Now if you have dry curly hair that needs some built in sealer/conditioners into the shampoo, then this is NOT the one for you unless you always apply a conditioner after shampooing. For me and my needs, I am very pleased and give it 5 stars as there is nothing to improve as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty good, not the best I have tried, but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers and washes my hair decent enough, although I don&#x27;t care for the scent that much.&lt;br /&gt;There are better Herbal Essences shampoo&#x27;s on the market I prefer more.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite  is Hello Hydration Coconut Essences.</li>
    <li> Often have trouble when using a new product on my hair - and I know most others don&#x27;t have as many problems with various shampoos as I do.  I&#x27;ve got shoulder-length, multi-layered, colored, curly hair that is prone to frizzing. The combination of my old standby shampoo, conditioning balm and argon oil works out well for me in defining my curls and cutting way back on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried this shampoo and my first thought when using this is, refreshing. I LOVE the soft, natural smelling scent that isn&#x27;t anything like perfume. And with allergies to chemical scents, the fact that I don&#x27;t smell this after rinsing it off is a plus.  It lathers up well and leaves my hair feeling lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my impressions for the first few uses were impressive. Since my hair is thick and already has body, it would be difficult to notice if this shampoo actually added more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using this a few times, found that my hair is more frizzy than it had been.  I guess what made it lighter was also stripping out what I needed to help tame it, even though I was still using my conditioning balm and argon oil. It&#x27;s actually looking drier and I&#x27;m seeing more flyaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m having to give up on using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dang, I love the scent so much!!!  It would be great if someone came out with a moisturizing body wash with this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it 5 stars for the scent and only 2 for how my fussy hair reacts to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love the volume. Cleaned it cleaner than even their other shampoos. Could be really BAD thing right after coloring, but in the summer you need a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the smell. I REALLY did not like the minty smell. Unlike everybody else, I would have liked more grapefruit and less mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the cleanest freshest smelling shampoo I have tried. But Herbal Essence is about the smell after you shampoo.  My favorite is still Color Me Happy. Goes perfectly with the Set Me Up hairspray. People have told me they love my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;  So then I tell them it&#x27;s hairspray. Most of those compliments come from MEN. (ladies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#x27;t think grapefruit and mint go well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be just me.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thin hair, and have since I was young. I like shampoos that add some volume to make it look thicker. This shampoo does the job well, and smells very nice in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is more natural than what I currently use, although this is not something I am that concerned about. The only drawback for me is that the price is a little high for what I, as a guy, would normally pay for shampoo. Overall, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I selected this shampoo, I was leery. I am a huge animal lover and have not liked Procter and Gamble for over 20 years. I have followed their animal testing throughout the years. 20 years ago P&amp;G was heavily involved in animal testing and I did not buy their products then. However, throughout the years, they have changed their practices. The FDA requires certain chemical be tested on animals. P&amp;G could have avoided that but they did not. However, a few years ago, a friend that works for a rescue group that I am connected to, took a job with P&amp;G, she explained they no longer test. That was not enough for me. However, there is still a lot of negative press out there regarding their animal testing. If you want the FACTS you can go to their website and it reads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Herbal Essences products tested on animals?&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately some misinformation has recently appeared which may have compromised your trust in Herbal Essences. rather than trust wrong information here are the facts:&lt;br /&gt;* Herbal Essences products are not tested on animals. full stop. nor do we ask any supplier or contract lab to test them on our behalf. all messages implying Herbal Essences or any other P&amp;G Beauty &amp; Grooming product was tested on animals are wrong!&lt;br /&gt;* we passionately believe that ending animal testing is a benefit for all--consumers, animal welfare and industry. in fact, P&amp;G is a global leader in supporting alternatives to animal research, having invested more than $250 million to date in helping to develop more than 50 proven alternative methods. we collaborate with governments and universities to promote acceptance of alternatives. if you want to learn more about our efforts, please visit http://www.pgbeautygroomingscience.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that their products do not state they are not tested on animals. I called customer service and spoke to &#x60;Jasmine&#x27; and she was not professional and very misinformed. She kept telling me I had to speak to corporate reading the animal testing. I told her I knew from their own website they did not test but she kept saying she was a consultant only there to help consumers. I then asked if I was as consumer wanting products that do not test on animals, which one would she recommend. With a bad attitude, she said again, I had to speak to corporate. So even though their website states they do NOT test on animals, their customer service is lacking in knowledge and education. Had I just been a consumer, I would never buy their product with her lack of knowledge and her attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have used this product several times and it does clean well. I have really long curly hair and it cleaned it each time. I could smell the grapefruit and the mint scent. It did not leave any residue. I use a different conditioner but I could tell it cleaned well. The first time I just used a diffuser on my hair and it was very curly and full. That is in high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but and on the fence if I would buy it again. It cleaned well but if the company does not know what they are talking about when I call them and they also get an attitude, I am probably not going to buy their products. My mother also buys their products and also has the same ethics I have and she was upset the company was not only evasive, but rude. I think I will stick with another brand that cleans just as well with great customer service.ng the animal testing. I told her I knew from their own website they did not test but she kept saying she was a consultant only there to help consumers. I then asked if I was as consumer wanting products that do not test on animals, which one would she recommend. With a bad attitude, she said again, I had to speak to corporate. So even though their website states they do NOT test on animals, their customer service is lacking in knowledge and education. Had I just been a consumer, I would never buy their product with her lack of knowledge and her attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have used this product several times and it does clean well. I have really long curly hair and it cleaned it each time. I could smell the grapefruit and the mint scent. It did not leave any residue. I use a different conditioner but I could tell it cleaned well. The first time I just used a diffuser on my hair and it was very curly and full.

    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling really clean, but slightly wiry. There are some shampoos that make you feel you don&#x27;t need a conditioner - this is not one of them. I tried using just the shampoo with no conditioner, and it did make my hair feel fuller. Whatever fullness I perceived seemed to last the whole day. I didn&#x27;t feel my hair was limp or flat at the end of the day.    The scent is a significant detraction for me. The label says it&#x27;s grapefruit and mint. Those two scents are scents you imagine as being very light and refreshing. The scent you get is heavy and sweet. Seems a scent that would be intended for children.    The easy lather, deep cleaning, and fullness of hair from using this shampoo made me feel uplifted washing my hair, but the scent brought the experience down.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant scent. When it said white grapefruit and mint extract, I wondered how it would smell, but it turned out real nice. It does work well as a shampoo, I liked the lather and how my hair felt afterwards.</li>
    <li> Since all hair care products affect hair differently based on hair type, I will preface by saying that I have very long, thick, wavy, aging (I&#x27;m 50) hair which is not color treated. My problems are generally that I lack shine and have a tendency for some frizziness. Some products can also tamp down my hair&#x27;s natural body. What I look for in a shampoo is how it makes my scalp feel, how well it promotes shine, how it makes it feel, and whether or not it strips away previously applied products. This did quite well on most fronts. It didn&#x27;t leave my scalp itchy and cleaned to the root. It did, indeed promote even more body/volume than I already have, but I don&#x27;t normally have flat hair anyway. Shine wasn&#x27;t really affected, but that is no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this shampoo is unusual in that it has a sharp almost minty smell. It reminds me of a type of hand soap sold at Trader Joe&#x27;s that had a similarly strong scent. It seems like the makers were trying to make a &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; scent that straddled between what men and women want. I think that was a success, and, while it was a little too pungent for me when I was using it, the scent did not linger in my hair the next day (and some of the more perfumey scents do that). All in all, I think this is a great shampoo, but it&#x27;s on the expensive side (at least through Amazon). Other outlets have it at a substantially cheaper price.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo today. I squeezed out about a quarter-sized blog (for my head hair and beard), and my first impression is that it got my hair and scalp squeaky clean without a lot of scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo seems concentrated, and so a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is herbal, as expected, and tangy, a slight bit strong--not a problem, though.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed too that my hair (including my beard) is soft and smooth and easily manageable.&lt;br /&gt;When this bottle runs out I will likely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> When I opened the bottle to smell it I was very pleased however scrubbing it into my scalp I found it was very lacking on smell.  I like to get a burst of freshness when I am lathering up and did not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather was ok.  I actually had to get more out of the bottle so I could get that sudsy lather I am use to with my other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt very stiff after I rinsed.  There was no way I could skip conditioner after using this product.  Perhaps this is because there is no silicone in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had went two days (which is the max for me) when washing my hair.  I felt after my blow dry that my hair was clean and there was no oil left in my hair.  My hair looked and felt normal after using for several days.  I didn&#x27;t feel I got any benefited volume from it but I feel that is pretty typical for me with volumizing shampoo.  I have never meant one that really made my hair reek of volume so I wasn&#x27;t surprised this one did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was ok.  Not the most amazing shampoo I have ever tried but it probably won&#x27;t be in my shampoo rotation in the future.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Back in the day&amp;#34; I used to use the original Herbal Essence shampoo when it was on sale. It had a pretty strong smell, but I liked it. Who knows what kind of chemicals it had in it because that is not the sort of thing that got my attention when I was a teenager back in the early 70&#x27;s. Fast forward forty plus years, and we have a bunch of new knowledge about toxicity and other issues. So, we have the new version which is apparently without some of the questionable content of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It seems to clean my hair about as well as my other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not seem to be less concentrated than Pert, which is one of my more recent shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;3. It does not have an objectionable or strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it does not have the classic Herbal Essence smell at all. It is pretty light on the perfume. In a way, I was slightly disappointed since I had hoped for a bit of the old Herbal Essence aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say I am knocking a star off because of the non-relation to the original smell. The performance of the shampoo itself is more or less average. If you get it on sale, great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essence shampoo for years, not since they used to come in the fancy bottles. But I always liked their product and thought I would give it a shot again. Plus I like a little morning mint or tea tree oil in my shampoo to give me an extra wake-up boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this was a decent shampoo. I don&#x27;t have high shampoo expectations other than that they lather well and get my hair clean. This one does the trick on both counts. I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; my hair. I certainly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. Supposedly its an organic shampoo, if that is of interest to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I really want out of a shampoo is a nice smell, and this Herbal Esseences fails on that account. It isn&#x27;t bad, just way too much grapefruits and way too little mint.  The grapefruits smell is overpowering, and not nice--at least not to me. If you love the smell of grapefruits in the morning; well, maybe this is the shampoo for you. But I don&#x27;t think I will be getting another bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned that clear shampoo is the way to go.  Any coloring in the shampoo is not good for your hair, or at least unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Herbal Essences shampoos ever since my family bought them from Costco many years ago.  They are all clear, with only a little bit of color.  This one, however, is naked clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star because I don&#x27;t like the scent.  It smell like fruit candy.  It&#x27;s different from the other Herbal Essences shampoos I&#x27;ve used that have classier scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like clear shampoo, and don&#x27;t mind fruit candy scent, this is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have shorter, oily hair.  I can’t help it.  For my specific hair type, this is great shampoo.  It gets me feeling really clean, and the drying aspect that so many others have noted on is a bonus for me, since it helps my scalp not feel so oily so quickly.  I can wash my hair in the morning and not feel like I need to rewash it at night.  I also really like the scent.  It smells clean to me, and I just love the minty, citrus smell.  I don’t find it overwhelming or off-putting at all.  Everyone has their own ideas of what they want to smell like, so keep that in mind before you purchase, but if you like a fruitier scent and have oily hair then this could be something you’d love to try.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the bottle. I expected either a white bottle or a clear bottle that dispenses white shampoo due to the product image. Its actually a clear bottle with clear liquid. The liquid has a gel like texture, and it smells pretty good in my opinion. I have always loved tropical smells and this smells like both mint and grapefruit. Its very pleasant to me. However, I can see why others may not like it (it really depends if you like mint or not)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have dry hair, and my sister has oily hair. Checking out the ingredients list, it has a lot of detergents: Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Chloride&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sodium laureth sulfate is a milder cleansing agent while Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (the 2nd detergent) pretty much strips curly hair or dry hair of its moisture in higher amounts. This is why a lot of products geared towards women of color&#x27;s hair (which tent to be more fragile) eliminate or substitute Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience is that the shampoo is a bit too drying for my dry hair. However, on my sister&#x27;s hair, which is curly, it made her hair more manageable as she uses a lot of product and it eliminated both the oils and the products out of her hair without stripping her hair&#x27;s moisture levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see by all the reviews here, its pretty mixed between people loving it and people hating it. I do think this shampoo is a step in the right direction: it doesn&#x27;t use any artificial colorings and it does contain actual essential oils (peppermint and mint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give this product 5 stars for oily hair, 3 stars for dry hair. There is also 0% Parabens and 0% Silicones, which is why I gave this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essenses has always had a unique scent. In this naked volume shampoo they have added mint to their trademark fruity/flowery smell and it is strong, so only buy if you like minty scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo, my hair felt very clean and light which I liked. It is a big bottle of shampoo so the price seems fair. I appreciate that P&amp;G is changing products to take out the parabens and dyes.</li>
    <li> What you first notice about this shampoo is that it&#x27;s totally clear.  I know that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s all natural automatically, but it does seem to speak to a lack of dyes!  As I started using it, I was drawn to the scent.  It&#x27;s an herby kind of citrus smell, like a spiced orange (it is supposed to be a grapefruit scent, but I didn&#x27;t quite smell that, but then again, grapefruits are not as strong a smell as oranges!)  It lathered up very nicely, and rinsed well.  I like how my hair looks after using it!  I also used it on my daughter, who is sometimes irritated by shampoos, and she seemed to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is quite big, so this will last a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a child of the 70s and early 80s, when Herbal Essences was a huge name in shampoos, and I&#x27;m glad to be able to try them again!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this was pretty standard cheap shampoo: does the job, medium lather, rinses well, COMPLETELY OVERPOWERING SCENT while shampooing that thankfully dissipates quickly with dry hair. But I was pleased to discover that it also made my hair look unusually clean and shiny, so in the end, I was well pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overwhelming fruit punch scent (were you expecting grapefruit and mint, based on the \\&quot;white grapefruit and mint extracts\\&quot; mentioned on the label? uh-uh.) was strong enough to choke a horse, so I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this shampoo. I was looking for a shampoo that would get my hair super clean, because I just recently started using coconut oil on my hair, and I leave it on over night. So I wanted a shampoo that would get all the coconut oil out of my hair without leaving a greasy residue. This shampoo fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a citrus smell with just a hint of mint, which I like very much, it gives me a feeling that my hair is super clean. After using the coconut oil, and washing it out with this shampoo, I don&#x27;t even need to use a conditioner. The coconut oil works like a leave in conditioner, and make my hair feel very strong. Then using this shampoo with it, it makes it very clean and strong, without any greasy feeling. This shampoo is very thick and clear, and it really gets in there and cleans your hair. Leaving it with a very light but strong feeling. I am very satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells.  It has a light fruity smell that on the front states it is from a mixture of grapefruit and mint. Not sure I smelled the mint, but I loved the grapefruity smell.  The shampoo is &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34;, i.e., clear and does a good job of cleaning your hair squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> I have a finicky scalp that gets dry and flaky with most shampoos. Something about this particular shampoo (most likely the more simple ingredient list) does not cause my scalp to get flaky. I&#x27;m not thrilled with it because it leaves my hair feeling stripped, almost like a clarifying shampoo. To combat this, I use a high quality conditioner from a different brand. Until I find another alternative though, I will keep using this shampoo. It smells absolutely glorious!</li>
    <li> I love Herbal Essence products so I was excited to try out the Naked Volume shampoo, especially after a nice summer with sun and surf.  I used it as soon as it arrived and I&#x27;ve loved how my hair has smelled since.  It has a different scent than most shampoos, sort of a minty/citrus smell.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair - it didn&#x27;t weigh it down or give it that &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; feeling that some body boosting shampoos can.  It just gave it a nice shine, a bouncy feel and at the same time it smoothed out easily with a flat iron - no frizz.</li>
    <li> As a child of the 60&#x27;s, I love seeing the old brands come back. I passionately loved Herbal Essence shampoo back then, and have tried several of the new ones, trying to find that fabulous scent again. None of them so far have even come close. This one has a nice light citrusy scent with a hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is clear, a nice surprise, and thick, making it easy to get the small amount I need. It lathered up very well and rinsed out easily. My hair is baby fine, razor cut short, and graying.. My non-gray hairs are half the thickness of the gray hairs, and much less dry. This can make finding the right hair products a bit difficult! Naked Volume left my hair feeling soft and full, and very clean. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I really, really, enjoy the fragrance of this product.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d describe it as &#x27;grapefruit/mint&#x27; (which is what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like) but it is a very fresh, not too sweet a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair type, which is very soft, fine and straight.  First day results weren&#x27;t bad but things went considerably downhill as I transitioned into day two and three.  Basically, the hair closest to my scalp started to look like it wasn&#x27;t washed with anything at all but water (and I know what this looks like on me because I went through a phase where I tried to skip shampoo every now and then \\&quot;for the love of my hair\\&quot;.  That phase of my life didn&#x27;t last very long...)  The result was something like an oily/waxen and somewhat stiff look, closest to my scalp.  Basically, it makes my hair looks dirty in a bad way, not even a pony tail can make it look presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might give this a try again when winter hits; maybe I&#x27;ll have better luck with it when the air is a bit drier.  Until then, it&#x27;s just going to sit in my shower as backup for those days where I&#x27;ve ran out of shampoo but haven&#x27;t made it to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;***Update 9/19***&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;Okay...  I&#x27;ve decided to bump this up from my 3 star review written back on 8/27th to a 4 star review.  When I started using this product I had already ran out of my normal shampoo and lo-and-behold, even though it was doing funky things to my hair my laziness beat me out and I never did get to the store to buy my normal poo ;)  Don&#x27;t judge...  I live alone, work 40+ hours and go to school full time, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, somewhere between then and now, this shampoo started working for me.  I think it was about a week later that I stopped having even the slightest bit of tacky, waxy, dirty feel to my hair - just soft, silky, and light like I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it the product, was it me, or did I just need time to adjust to a new brand?  Not sure/can&#x27;t say.  I thought maybe it was because of the conditioner I had been using and the difference was that I had stopped using it on my scalp and instead, just on my ends.  I did attempt to recreate that matty, dirty hair look with my conditioner by using it on my scalp again (for science!!!) but nadda.  All I can say is that this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve been using since I first wrote this review and my hair actually looks and feels great right now.  I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star review because it did make my hair look gross for like a week but I also can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a terrible shampoo now that it&#x27;s working for me; plus, I really like the fragrance.  I might actually make the switch to this brand if it continues to work for me./can&#x27;t say.

    <li> Ok, I have to admit, I just got this shampoo because I thought about all the old commercials where those women were having a fantastic time in the shower because of this stuff.  Sadly, reality is not like that at all, but it&#x27;s still a pretty decent shampoo if all you&#x27;re looking to do is get your hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essence is known for having good scents.  This particular flavor, Mint and Grapefruit, does smell good.  It smells, sweet fruity, and doesn&#x27;t have a hint of mint scent that I could distinguish.  Which for me is a good thing, as I don&#x27;t really like mint.  The smell goes on in the shower but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair (and it&#x27;s gotten me some weird looks as I sniff my hair throughout the day trying to decipher if I can still smell it or not).  What&#x27;s nice about this, is just because it smells like a fruit, there aren&#x27;t artificial dyes trying to make it look fruity.  This is a clear shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this bottle of shampoo aren&#x27;t too bad either.  It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; (they really are trying to go back to their commercial glory days!) and that means it has no parabens, silicone, or colorant in the mix.  There&#x27;s still some sulfates and other things, but largely, for a conventional shampoo that&#x27;s not bought in a specialty store, this doesn&#x27;t have that bad of ingredients.  Still, if you&#x27;re in the all organic, all natural, all healthy crowd, this may not be a shampoo you want to use.  There are a few ingredients in here that I couldn&#x27;t begin to pronounce, let alone spell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, my hair is its usual clean.  And it will stay that way for a day or so, depending on how active I am or how sweaty I get.  Which is pretty standard for any shampoo.  For the volume part of this, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference.  My hair has always been the thin type, and as it gets longer it seems to stay that thin.  Although as much as I lose in a day I suppose I could say this shampoo is working just because I haven&#x27;t found any bald spots, which is impressive considering I could make wigs out of what I take out of my brush every week (you really wanted that detail didn&#x27;t you?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this shampoo and will probably continue to use it.  I rotate through the shampoos I use just to keep my hair guessing, but I like to have a few different ones that I consistently come back to.  This one could fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M.

    <li> What a surprise!  Using the [[ASIN:B00F4TQ4QG Herbal Essences Naked Volume Shampoo 23.7 Fl Oz,]] has provided me with a new favorite shampoo.  Prior to this huge bottle of clear, fragrant cleanser, I was using the [[ASIN:B00FRDPOVU Fekkai Full Blown Volume Shampoo 8 Fl Oz]] which is creamy, but has a similar fragrance and feel after shampooing.  I am happy to be alternating the two so that my hair can experience variety.  This is quite a bargain for a quality product.</li>
    <li> The first thing I check for in a new shampoo that I am trying is the smell. If the smell is a no go then I am not going to be using it for very long. Surprisingly my whole family likes the scent too. Makes my hair feel full and manageable-my wife says the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With her response it will be bought and used in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair from waist length up to shoulder length. My hair is kind of fine although there is a lot of it. I don&#x27;t use heat styling, coloring or chemicals, and the only styling product I use is mousse and my hair is neither very oily or very dry. So the main thing I look for in a shampoo is something that gets my hair clean, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and smells nice. I saw this shampoo at the drugstore and it caught my attention because it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or silicone. When I checked the ingredients I got excited because I saw that it had both peppermint oil and menthol listed as well field mint. I LOVE shampoos and conditioners that leave a slight cooling or tingling feeling in the scalp. My favorite is CO Bigelow Mentha, however at $15 a bottle I can&#x27;t afford it for everyday use. Anyway, with the above listed ingredients, I expected to get at least a little bit of a tingle out of this and I was thoroughly disappointed that I did not. Even still, it seemed to do the job and it smelled good so I continued to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did however knock another star off due to my experience tonight. Earlier today I had a bad neck ache so I rubbed some pain cream on my neck which extended up to and around the hairline. The cream seeped into my hair and made it feel very greasy. When I took my shower and washed my hair with this, I noticed that after rinsing the shampoo out, I could still feel the greasiness in my hair where the cream was. I shampooed again and again one more time. I let my hair air dry and the section that had the cream in it still feels just as greasy as before I shampooed- there is literally NO DIFFERENCE. It did not remove any of the cream&#x27;s residue. Now I know that getting a pain cream in your hair isn&#x27;t a normal occurrence, however after THREE shampoos, it should have been washed out with no problem- especially with a volumizing formula which typically is supposed to cut oil and remove residue. I can&#x27;t see how this shampoo would remove hair product residue for anyone who uses a lot of leave-ins, gels, or other styling products. I also don&#x27;t think that it would do a sufficient job in cleaning hair for someone who naturally has oily hair. Tomorrow I will have to go buy another shampoo to get this stuff out of my hair. I will likely finish out this bottle since for my everyday needs (non oily hair with little product usage), it seems to work okay, but I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone unless they need really light cleansing.ir product residue for anyone who uses a lot of leave-ins, gels, or other styling products.
