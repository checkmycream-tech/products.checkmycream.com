      <li>I love, love, love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>to spray and smells lovely still.</li>
      <li>Upon arriving, the perfume was very strong smelling and not at all like the original.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use to fill my infuser (?)</li>
      <li>It smells a little woodsy and sweet, a great mix of good girl.  </li>
      <li>Love it, smells just like the original , price is just right 😉</li>
      <li>An incredibly unique fragrance; not cloying at all.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell right, too strong and wood smelling.</li>
      <li>I love the perfume and it is so economical because I don&#x27;t have to buy a new spray bottle every time I need a refill.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it and with the refill you are helping to save the planet</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, when I first tried it I thought whoa way too strong but after a bit it settles into the best scent I have tried.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
      <li>Sexy, mysterious, full of love and energy, tender and agresive at the same time.</li>
      <li>Makes much more sense to buy the refills given that this particular perfume is quite expensive, so I was super pleased!</li>
      <li>And to boot, I saved a whole lot of money.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to find a refill perfume for my favorite glass decanter and was thrilled when I found Thierry Mugler Womanity.  </li>
      <li>Wow, that&#x27;s a ton of pefume!  </li>
      <li>But was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The color of the perfume is yellow (whereas Womanity is pink) and doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the original.  </li>

    <li> This perfume smells delightful! I was taken aback with the color but it lasts as long as the perfume that I&#x27;ve gotten from Saks. And to boot, I saved a whole lot of money. $$ Will definitely be back for my next refill.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell right, too strong and wood smelling. Purchased it, wore it once, and it&#x27;s been in my drawer ever since.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price and fast shipping. Makes much more sense to buy the refills given that this particular perfume is quite expensive, so I was super pleased!</li>

    <li> I love, love this fragrance never before has so many people, men &amp; women, stopped me to ask what I was wearing.  It smells a little woodsy and sweet, a great mix of good girl.  A little goes a long way, when I first tried it I thought whoa way too strong but after a bit it settles into the best scent I have tried.  My only objection is it&#x27;s a bit pricy but it&#x27;s well worth it and with the refill you are helping to save the planet and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
    <li> An incredibly unique fragrance; not cloying at all.</li>
    <li> The package came as promised. The scent is fair.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t even smell like womanity nor was it the correct color.  It was yellow.  The perfume is pink in color.</li>
    <li> Great price. Smells good</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find a refill perfume for my favorite glass decanter and was thrilled when I found Thierry Mugler Womanity.  I love the perfume and it is so economical because I don&#x27;t have to buy a new spray bottle every time I need a refill.</li>
    <li> I will never purchase perfume online again- my order was shipped from Fragrance.net  and I received fakes, a yellow substance of some sort and then had to go through all the steps to return. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I can&#x27;t imagine why it had been discontinued</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. :)</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this fragrance. It has a distinctive scent just like all Thierry Mugler collection.</li>
