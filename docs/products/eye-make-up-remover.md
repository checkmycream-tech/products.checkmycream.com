<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What a great product! Thanks for prompt delivery!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this make-up remover. I&#x27;ve always been a little less motivate to use liquid bottled make-up remover, and have always been using individual sheets make up remover for convenience, but those don&#x27;t remove all the make up. This does, it does an amazing job too. All of my eye make, and sometimes I wear layers of mascara and primers, were removed. I used to wake up to leftover eye make up smudging from ineffectively removing it with the sheets before, but this make-up remover solved that problem. I gave it a 4 stars because it did claim to be Oil-Free and it is not. The bottle has 2 liquid of different density so they don&#x27;t mix (it&#x27;s really really cool looking), one of the layer is actually the oil. You&#x27;ll have to shake it up to blend the two liquid before use.</li>
    <li> After the handful of eye makeup removers that I had picked up from my local drugstore had left me with the dreaded “raccoon eyes” at nighttime, I decided to give this Mary Kay one a try. Prior to this product I had never tried anything by Mary Kay before, namely because the overzealous soccer mom sales ladies in my area were a big turn-off (but I digress). Nerveless, I was beyond satisfied with the quality of this eye makeup remover and will be trying out more MK products in the future. Now onto the product review: I absolutely loved this eye Makeup remover; it gets the job done, yet is cost effective. I can remove all my eye makeup, yes even the stubborn water proof mascara and the “stay-all-day” eyeliner and not have ANY leftover residue. And you know what else? I can do all that without using half the bottle in one night. Also, this product does not sting my sensitive eyes, which was a problem I experienced with other eye makeup removers in the past. Furthermore, the best way I have found to use this product is too simply squirt some of it on a cotton pad and hold it over my eyes for about 15 seconds, then begin wiping away the makeup. This way you are first breaking up the eye makeup and then it swipes away like a dream! In terms of product longevity, I have been using this remover every single night for close to a month and a half now and have about 1/4 of the bottle left. I am guessing this product will last a little over two month’s total. And I think $14.00 every two months for a phenomenal product that I consider vital to my skincare routine is a pretty swell deal. There is only one eye makeup remover that I have tried that is better than this Mary Kay one and that is the one by Lancôme. Though that one is around $30.00 for only about half an ounce more, so I will be sticking with this one! Bottom line: I consider this a Holy Grail product and when I run out I will definitely be repurchasing as I will not be without this eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Cannot find a better eye make up remover out there! This is the best bar none!</li>
    <li> works great and good price!</li>
    <li> Best eye-makeup remover I have ever used for a good price. I was very happy to find it on Amazon since nobody likes buying from the Mary Kay sellers. It&#x27;s silky smooth, clears the eye-makeup right off and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other stuff has.</li>
    <li> The best!  I have sensitive skin, sensitive eyes.  FANTASTIC product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good and effective. It&#x27;s the best at getting all my makeup off, and I&#x27;ve even used it to take off stubborn halloween makeup from my husband&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> I really like this product I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years now and it does a great job. Not oily , and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes or anything like that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of eye make up remover, but this stuff really does the trick, I can&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> This is the only eye makeup remover that I will ever use. I love Urban Decay eyeshadow and always use primer so that it is bold and stays all day. I also always wear eyeliner and mascara and this product always works perfectly to remove it. All I have to do is take out a cotton makeup remover pad, shake the bottle a few times (the product stratifies), apply a few drops to the pad, and swipe my makeup off. It&#x27;s just fantastic! I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before.</li>
    <li> This make up remover is smth very special for me, because i have already used 2 bottles of this and now i bought the thrid one.once you use this you wont ever want to use anything else, it is very fresh, not oily at all, does not spread your make up but cleans it from the first try. No need to keep rubbing over the face, it cleans very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the feeling i get after using it. I would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the only product my wife will use and we basically have it on auto order due to the fact that you can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND LOVE WAY IT WORKS OIL FREE.  GREAT PRODUCT AND ACTUALLY USE IT WHEN I GET MY HAIR COLORED TO GET DYE STAIN OFF FFROM AROUND MY FACE AND HAIR LINE.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an oil-free makeup remover after getting eyelash extensions. This one got good reviews, so I purchased it. Wow! It&#x27;s truly a fantastic product. I am a girly, full makeup wearer of many years. I&#x27;ve tried all different removers - department store, drug store, etc. Every one I tried I would only try once. They are smelly, oily, irritating and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this one, I put a few drops onto a cotton ball,  and carefully swabbed my eyelid. Almost everything came off. Eyeshadow, eyebrow powder, and liner. Some of the liner close to the lash line was still there, so I folded the cotton ball and swabbed as close to the lashes as possible. All gone. And no smell. No stinging. And no oiliness. I did the other eye, then my whole face.  It does leave a little residue, so I rinsed with tepid water. Didn&#x27;t need to wash with soap after using the remover, which is what I had to do with all the other brands I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was absolutely no irritation to my sensitive eyes. My skin felt soft and not dried up.  Using so many different makeup and skincare products, when I find one that&#x27;s as effective and good as this, I want to share that info. So much out there is bad quality. This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Is the second time I buy here, but long time ago I used this product, I love Mary Kay...</li>
    <li> I read all the race reviews about how this would take off waterproof mascara and so I bought it...big mistake. I am so disappointed, I&#x27;m barely 1/4 through the bottle and it might work well on non waterproof but doesn&#x27;t work at all on my waterproof mascara. I wanted to like it, but will go back to my Makeup Forever Sense eyes remover...</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years</li>
    <li> This works great to get all my eye make up off.  Even eye lash glue.  Not greasy either.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I have ever used.  I usually pay $16 retail - nabbed two for the price of one.</li>
    <li> The product works fine however the bottle that it is provided in doesn&#x27;t stay tight enough to keep the liquid inside the bottle so it leaks if it falls over. Therefore a lot of product is wasted</li>
    <li> I use waterproof Dior mascara, which is very dark and difficult to remove.  I&#x27;ve used other eye-make up removers and the only ones that I really LOVED were this and the Shiseido make-up remover.  A lot of others leave a kind of film all over your eyes.  At $15 vs. $26 though, hands down the Mary Kay remover wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Waterproof LashBlast Volume Mascara.  The Mary Kay doesn&#x27;t work quite as well on it as it did on the Dior, but it still does the job quite well.  I&#x27;ve found I do need to let the mascara \\&quot;soak\\&quot; in the solution for a bit though.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue.  I have been using it for over 5 years and have tried several before including high end products.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup remover I&#x27;ll use.  Mascara comes off gently and thoroughly - no rubbing required.  I&#x27;ve tried other products and nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> I had to write a review. I have tried countless eye makeup removers, all to no avail. High end like Estee Lauder, and low end like Neutrogena-- nothing worked well. I have very sensitive eyes (allergies), and I also wear contacts. Every eye makeup remover that I tried left a residue or was irritating, until Mary Kay. I had never used the line before, but read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try. So glad that I did!! Makeup comes off almost instantly, no tugging or constant wiping, and absolutely no residue or irritation. Love!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST makeup remover! Dont&#x27; even waste your money on anything else... I wear waterproof mascara, because... well, WHY not?  you never know when your going to cry, have problems with your contacts or jump in water or a hot tub... so I always bought water-proof... the one draw back was always taking it off at night... its like plaster to your eyes... but NOT with this make up remover...takes all of my makeup off with ease and doesn&#x27;t dry out my pours... hands down the best makeup remover!</li>
    <li> I live by this stuff!  Great product!  Easy on your eyelashes, removes eye makeup quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn if you happen to get it in your eyes.  I am a contact lens wearer but always take them out first before using this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best eye makeup remover ever! It works with all makeup and you don&#x27;t have to scrub at all!</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye makeup removers and the one I have used for many, many years is by a major cosmetic company, beginning with an \\&quot;L.\\&quot;  This product even surpasses that one.  With just one swipe, everything comes off!  I will continue to use this as long as I wear eye makeup.  Thanks for offering it on your website.  I found it just by browsing :)</li>
    <li> I should preface my review by stating up front that I have very sensitive eyes and have often had negative reactions to products that I have used to remove my eye makeup or even in the eye makeup itself, so I&#x27;m always very careful about what I use.  Having said that, this is the first eye makeup remover that does what it promises to do: it removes my makeup without irritating my eyes.  Because I have cats I have found that mascara, on me, works like a cat hair magnet, and my cats are short hair, not long, but it is that fine filament micro fur that they have that seems to be what is lured by my mascara, so I never dare sleep in my makeup.  I read the review that stated that this leaves an oily residue on the eyes, and the first time I tried it I found it to do the same to me, however, I believe my mistake was in putting too much remover on the eyepad I was using.  It did not sting my eyes or iritate them, it just made a bit of film on my eyes when I blinked for a bit after using it.  So, I adjusted the amount the next time I used it and had a great result. It removed my mascara and eye pencil cleanly, without leaving me with that &#x27;raccoon&#x27; smearage around my eyes that would require additional time when I cleansed my whole face, and the eyeshadow disappeared in a single swipe.  It is also cool and refreshing when I use it, a benefit after a long day.  I use the remover to get that hard to remove makeup from my eyes, then wash my face and when I&#x27;m done, there is nothing left but fresh, dewy, clean skin and for a woman in her mid forties, that&#x27;s a nice thing to be able to say!</li>
    <li> Used this product for 5 years would not use anything else for eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> great remover very gentle</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different makeup removers and am challenged because I love my dark mascara.  The best thing about this one is that it truly is oil-free.  I&#x27;ve tried others that are so oily, I can&#x27;t see clearly for an hour after using.  The consistency is perfect.  I would give it a 5 star rating if I didn&#x27;t have just a little residue when I wake up - and I am soaking the cotton ball and holding it to my eye.  But I&#x27;m OK with that as I&#x27;ll do a quick swipe with a washcloth in the shower.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I had been using the expensive dept, store remover. This works equally as well as is less expensive. Removes all eye makeup, and I use the waterproof kind. Does not irritate my eyes and is not drying. I will be buying this regularly.</li>
    <li> Quite simply, the best eye makeup remover I have ever used.  My eyes are very sensitive and it never causes a problem.  The product is half the price of one I used before that did irritate my eyes, and it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a gift set.  It works great, takes off make up well without much of a struggle.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling uncomfortable either.</li>
    <li> Take the eye makeup off better than anything else Ive tried, and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT!!</li>
    <li> It was sensitive and yet strong enough to get all that eye makeup off. :-) It also wasn&#x27;t as small of a bottle that I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> I tried once .Is works very well,Can remove all of water profe eye make up .I&#x27;m gald I had this one</li>
    <li> This is absolutely one of the best products that Mary Kay makes! I have sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t bother them one bit! You don&#x27;t have to use a lot or rub your eyes hardly at all! I switched from MAC eye makeup remover to this and I love it!</li>
    <li> The best eye make up remover there is....and I&#x27;ve tried many! I always go back to Mary Kay!</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover EVER! I have tried other brands but nothing compares to MK. This is hands down their best product. Even the toughest waterproof eye make up is easily removed. The bottle lasts forever because you can use less than other types. MK also nourishes your eye lashes as an added bonus. Fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> I needed some eye makeup remover because I ran out of my Lancome samples. I read the reviews and definitely agree - this remover works extremely well. I wear brown or black eyeliner every day, and just use a cotton ball with a few drops, and everything comes off right away. I have also been careless and gotten a little bit in my eye, and it didn&#x27;t sting. I have sensitive skin and eyes (I have had bad reactions to mascara, etc.) and this works well with no irritation!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best eye makeup remover on the market.  This is the only MaryKay product that I use and I could never live without it!!!!</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s super gentle, and removes makeup very quickly. I wear contacts and it doesnt irritate my eyes eiether. I will continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover EVER! I have been using this eye make up remover for years and have not found anything better! Plus, one container lasts like 6 months!</li>
    <li> Best eyemakeup remover. Very gentle on the eyes. I tried a lot of brands out there and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover ever!!! Believe me I have tried many and this is by far the best. I have very sensitive eyes and my eye makeup and mascara comes off cleanly without any residue or oily feeling, no burning sensation either. It costs a little more but it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Removes my mascara effortlessly, great price comparing with Lancome.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like an eraser ! Just wipes off all and any makeup left on my face. Leaves my skin feelikg really soft afterwards and non irritated. Which makes it easier to reapply any new makeup right away.</li>
    <li> I received this product and was immediately confused by the fact that it had separated into two layers. One layer on top and another layer on the bottom. I am confused that is and &#x27;oil-free&#x27; product but yet looks very much like it is an oily product. I read the directions and shook the product up thoroughly before using and found it to be effective but it felt heavy and greasy to me. I purchased a different product and will pass this on to someone else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and just LOVE it!  There is no oily residue and I can re-apply makeup over it if I&#x27;ve made a mistake.  It&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> Great makeup remover for eyes! No more tears.</li>
    <li> i have tried other make up removers and always go back to this</li>
    <li> It works like every other makeup remover. It&#x27;s oily as hell and broke out my skin. To be fair I&#x27;m allergic to most everything.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye makeup remover I can use. I&#x27;m allergic to everything, and this miracle potion gently and effectively removes my admittedly egregious amounts of eyeliner without shredding my eyelids or irritating my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have been using it for some time now, and I have very happy with the way how it removes the make up quickly and without hurting or burning the eyes. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Melts eye make up away! I will always continue to use this produce. I even got my mom hooked on it.</li>
    <li> I like the way this takes off my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like the Holy Grail of mascara removers!  Quick and easy and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.  Waterproof mascara is just gone.  Where has this been all my life?</li>
    <li> Definetly the best make up remover ever!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of the best and this is top of the list!</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy on my contact wearing eyes. At times doesn&#x27;t  remove all my eye make up but then works on the second round.</li>
    <li> I dont really wear enough makeup to really do a good review. It arrived, good condition, great deal. good buy</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I don&#x27;t ever want to run out again.  There are no substitues...</li>
    <li> This is the #1 best selling makeup remover on the market.  It will take Permanent marker off a car without hurting the paint!  I get this in my eyes when taking off my eye makeup and it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything.  It&#x27;s really the greatest product out there, and really, really affordable, too!</li>
    <li> This removes any eye makeup so easily and gently while removing all old mascara residue to prevent clumping and it also conditioning your eyelashes. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Mary Kay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover. I have been using for many years. Eye make up comes off quickly no oily mess, I do recommend trying this product you won&#x27;t regret.     M. Hernandez</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover is the best remover I have used in many years.  I recommend it to anyone who has trouble getting stubborn mascara off! It&#x27;s gentle on the eye area and leaves no residue to rub.  A very clean product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other eye makeup removers--both liquid and wet pad forms--and this is my favorite one. A small squirt into a cotton pad is all it takes to remove my makeup. I don&#x27;t wear very much eye makeup, so maybe it would take more for heavier makeup. I like that it has a squirt top--no more dumping the bottle upside down to get a cotton pad wet! I notice my eyelashes grow longer and fuller when I use this product, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!!  No harsh rubbing is needed to get eye makeup off with it, just gentle swipes with a cotton ball and it&#x27;s all gone!!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Advertised as being oil free but left an oily film on my eyes which results in adding another step of cleaning my eyes before putting on makeup. I would never buy this again. How do I return it? Or give it away?</li>
    <li> Perfect! Will order again!</li>
    <li> The ONLY one to use for removing eye makeup!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually ENJOY removing my eye makeup with this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different removers, and this is by far the best. I pour a little onto a q-tip, and it just melts the eyeliner right off with a single swipe.</li>
    <li> I like this eye make-up remover because it is gentle around my eyes. It easily removes make-up. Just use a round cotton ball with this and make-up is removed. Very safe and gentle to use around eyes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to find this on Amazon.com. Its the best eye makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> This is watered down or they added something else. I compared it to the one I still had which I bought from a trusted Mary Kay rep. And this ones smells and feels different. Do not buy here!!</li>
    <li> This product is probably the best eye makeup remover ever.  I wear liquid liner and waterproof mascara; it comes off clean and my skin stays soft with this remover. I&#x27;ve used other drugstore brands or even The Body Shop and they will leave a residue or sting your eyes. The $15 price isn&#x27;t too bad either. One bottle lasts me about a month or 2 depending on whether I wear eye makeup every day. I soak one cotton pad and then gently press and wipe with my ring fingers to avoid ripping out my lashes. I&#x27;ve also used makeup removing wipes, but I feel like I have to really rub and wipe hard or use multiple wipes and I end up irritating the skin around my eyes. I think this is the best eye makeup remover if you care about your eyes, eyelashes, and the skin around your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have used so many other products, Mary Kay eye make up remover works the best, you don&#x27;t need much of it!!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup remover. Very gentle and effective. What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Maybelline Clean Express Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover but I bought this on a whim. I LOVE this stuff! I would recommend these duo makeup removers instead of the single ones. Oil-free so my face doesn&#x27;t feel disgusting AFTER makeup removal. It takes off waterproof eyeliner/mascara and removes much more makeup then Maybelline ever did.</li>
    <li> E͓̽x͓̽c͓̽e͓̽l͓̽l͓̽e͓̽n͓̽t͓̽</li>
    <li> Will never buy anything else!</li>
    <li> I normally used Eminence Organics eye makeup remover (which I LOVE, but it is expensive) so my friend recommended this to me. She wears tons of mascara so I trusted her opinion and tried it out. Very pleased! This stuff takes off EVERYTHING, I mean it! You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and you don&#x27;t have to pull or rub at your eyes to get things off, they just wipe off after one wipe. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Smooth but not oily, and powerful but gentle. Love it!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay has the best make up remover hands down.</li>
    <li> Seriously believe the hypes for this one! They are all true! This is a fabulous makeuo remover for my extremely sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> The product is great because I used it before awhile back. When arrived the box was intact but the bottle was not closed properly as of it&#x27;s been used before. The product leaked out in the box.</li>
    <li> The seller was extremely punctual in sending the item to me.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for faster service.  The product was in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This is the very best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used. It does not burn or sting and it removes every trace of shadow, liquid liner and mascara. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love Mary Kay products. This is top of the line.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite eye make up remover after using a variety i have been loyal to this brand for two years.</li>
    <li> this makeup remover is great and gentle on your eyes, i highly recommend it and it scent free which is a plus for me</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this online, so I read the reviews and made sure people had had positive experiences with the product not being old or otherwise defective. But I had no issues, the product is wonderful! It is very light, doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of oil and greasy residue, but takes off my waterproof mascara and eyeliner. I usually wake up with raccoon eyes even after washing my face the night before, but this takes all of it off. Plus the new bottle is much nicer than the older style and looks very pretty on my bathroom counter. Very pleased with my purchase and would order additional Mary Kay from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover ever! This is a must have. Non irritating and does not leave a greasy feeling or make me blind for a bit like other eye make up removers. I will buy this product again and again!</li>
    <li> MaryKay makeup remover is THE BEST ~ and I have tried MANY different ones!</li>
    <li> gentle and reliable, even removes water proof mascara with ease!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a good eye makeup remover until this one. It&#x27;s not oily and removes my waterproof makeup in no time.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly &amp; exactly as expected!</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover!</li>
    <li> Very good eye makeup remover. Don&#x27;t need much to take it off. Gentle and very effective.</li>
    <li> Best remover. Need to look for pads in travel packets.  Feels moisturizing but is oil free. Takes off waterproof mascara easily, too</li>
    <li> Shack before using it, and it works as well as Lancome&#x27;s Bi-Facil Eye Makeup Remover ( at least no difference for me). Just be careful not to get it into eyes.</li>
    <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been using Sonia Kashuk&#x27;s Remove for cleansing my eye makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t do as great of a job with thicker mascaras or Urban Decay eyeliners.  I thought I&#x27;d give this Mary Kay one a try since it won an _Allure_ magazine award, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, and takes off even the toughest makeup.  Great product that I will definitely be re-purchasing!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for even black gel eyeliner and heavy black mascara.  Works EVERY bit as good as Lancome&#x27;s eye-makeup remover at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased oil-free eye makeup remover, the product came in 3 days, nicely packed, also with little present - mini eye makeup remover and few chocolate kisses:-). I love this product, the best eye makeup remover I have ever had and I have been using it for years now. The little minus: the bottle of product that came is different then on the picture. I guess an older design. Anyway I will order from auntie&#x27;s closet next time again.  Thank you Sherry!</li>
    <li> The best non stinging, non greasy eye make up remover I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and takes the make up off!</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I read here, I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I am very pleased that my eyes don&#x27;t sting or burn when I use this product.  I really expected some irritation because whatever is in my eyeliner and mascara is liquefying when I use the remover, right?  Oh, and I use waterproof of both.  But I have been pleasantly surprised.  No discomfort.  Have to admit that the makeup doesn&#x27;t just magically slide right off, but with some gentle massaging, it all gives up the ghost after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive eyes &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Product works well with any kind of makeup including waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I no longer buy any other type of eye makeup remover. This stuff lasts me over a year, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue around my eyes, which is great because I already have oily eyelids. On the flip side, it also does not dry out eyelids during the winter. It seems to have the perfect balance of makeup remover and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND GIVE YOU A TAB BIT MOISTURE THE BEST EVER ON THE MARKET</li>
    <li> I wear contacts but I still like to wear eye-liner &amp; mascara. This is the only eye makeup remover that I can use. I don&#x27;t ever feel like it is seeping into my eyes &amp; contacts. It works gently &amp; wonderfully taken off all evidence of makeup.</li>
    <li> This does the job without oily mess, smell, or irritation.  A few years ago, I thought this was pricey so I switched to drug store products. Big mistake.  I came back to it now that it can be ordered online.  I am more than pleased.  Modern bottle design.</li>
    <li> I must say I was surprised to find Mary Kay products on Amazon, but what isn&#x27;t these days?? As an a actual current beauty consultant for Mary Kay, I see nothing wrong with someone wanting to reach out to women and help them be able to afford our wonderful products. I myself offer 30% off to my regular customers and free shipping when they don&#x27;t live close enough for me to take it to them personally. I even hold phone consultations to talk about their skin needs and check up with them weekly over the phone or email, so sometimes I never meet my clients person to person. So really what is the real difference? Our job is to help educate and help women with feeling more beautiful about themselves no matter where they are located or what their \\&quot; Budget\\&quot; is. Other than having less customer quality control and it being against our rules and regulations for sales, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it, so as long as they are able to stand by the 100% money back guarantee that only a current consultant is able to provide. Just don&#x27;t get caught!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said... seller, please make sure you are giving the customers what they order in the right packaging and within use up date!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know if something is current just go to our website or I would be happy to answer your questions before you purchase from someone selling our products on Amazon. I do recommend finding a local rep who can offer the 100% money back guarantee and send you samples and flowers and get the real service you deserve as beautiful women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping Ladies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coty Geiser&lt;br /&gt;Independent Beauty Consultant for Mary Kay Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I also appreciate that Mary Kay is not animal tested.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time to remove eye shadow and a few hours later felt itching in outer corner of right eye. The next morning it was swollen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend due to the skin reaction I experienced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and it works for me.  Make-up comes off easily.</li>
    <li> thank you so much, and thanks for everything, i need, i want, i love it, its excellent, wonderful, forever thanks</li>
    <li> This stuff does not sting my eyes at all and takes makeup off wonderfully, but it is pretty darn oily. I have to avoid touching the cotton pads when I&#x27;m throwing them away because my fingertips get oily. I also have to pat my eyes with a towel after using this if I am going to put makeup on soon after to avoid having it smear.</li>
    <li> I had been using my towelette wipes from Trader Joe&#x27;s for years when I realized I was rubbing my eyes too much to get makeup off - I like wearing eye liner and mascara on top of regular eye shadow and take it off every single night before bed. So I switched to an old brand I was using: Lancome&#x27;s bi-facil and I loved LOVED it, it worked so well without rubbing required. When I ran out, I was looking for a replacement and Mary Kay&#x27;s eye makeup remover came highly recommended, and was a lot less expensive than Lancome, and I am THRILLED with it. I use cotton balls to apply it and yes I still have to do more than just patting my eye, there is some very gentle rubbing but it comes off just fine but I also have tried using Q-tips and that works even better.&lt;br /&gt;Love this - will be my go-to eye make-up remover. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for several years and absolutely love it!  My eyes are sensitive and it takes off my eye makeup without any irritation and does a great job.</li>
    <li> It takes off most of my mascara. Is much oilier than stated and leaves lots of smudges</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye makeup remover!  It removes all makeup so gently.  It feels slightly oily and moisturizing, I like the feel of it.  I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> BEST EYE MAKEUP REMOVER EVER. I will never buy another brand again. I wear waterproof mascara and no other brand has ever removed my mascara as well!</li>
    <li> This is the best make up remover on the market. it is worth every penny. definitely would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I have had no problems with this product. It works well and has no side effects. Other products I have tried don&#x27;t work and or leave my eyes red and puffy.</li>
    <li> I wish I read more reviews first, this doesn&#x27;t appear to be the original Mary Kay brand, it seems tampered with. It is very oily and doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
    <li> In love with the product! Works like magic! Best eye makeup remover out there! I will buy and buy again. Delivery was fast and packing was ok.</li>
    <li> good quality, better than going through mary kay and all their crap. will order this again when i run out</li>
    <li> I just got finished using this. I decided to use waterproof mascara today and it took all my makeup off including the waterproof mascara. That alone speaks volumes to me. The bottle is big so I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll have to buy it often so it&#x27;s a good product and a good price. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Leaked all over box 😢</li>
    <li> When you cannot find a neighborhood Mary Kay representative, Amazon is the place to go.&lt;br /&gt;Gave this to my daughter and she was very happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> I love this mary kay eye makeup remover. So easy to take off makeup and in one swipe! No irritation either!&lt;br /&gt;Works perfect!!</li>
    <li> Best make up remover ! I do make up as a side job n this is the best remover I&#x27;ve found - gets everything off even bill face paint and no oil or residue after - doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes to get it in them either - a favorite !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of eye makeup remover and nothing compares to Mary Kay&#x27;s.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, it removes everything in  two wipes, and is relatively affordable.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to eye make up remover, and this is the only kind I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  With amazon prime, it is a better deal to buy online than to go through a mary kay rep!</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> After seeing how totalbeauty.com, i decided to try this make up remover out. However, the product felt oily on my kin And the bottle is small. I&lt;br /&gt;Used it a few times and it is already running out. For removing make up it was OK. For the price i spent for it, i dont think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought it because of tons of compliments on Amazon. It&#x27;s fine, but it seems it has not enough function to remove eye makeup. It takes more time to remove makeup totally than using other remover.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have been buying this for years from a distributor.  She didn&#x27;t get back to me so I ordered it through Amazon who I really love and trust completely.  Prime is awesome.</li>
    <li> In general I like MaryKay stuff but this doesn&#x27;t work any better than the stuff I buy at Walgreens. I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t leave residual like the others I&#x27;ve tried, but not the case. I will save my money and just buy the cheap stuff, it takes care of my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Like the product but the boxes were all ripped up and looked like they came from some old storage shelf. Sent them back but will order more</li>
    <li> I did not find that this remover worked any better than the less expensive Almay brand, actually, I think Almay works a little better at removing my eyeliner and mascara.</li>
    <li> i love this makeup remover. so gentle, easy &amp; it really really works!!! this is the first makeup remover i&#x27;ve used where i don&#x27;t have to rub &amp; rub &amp; rub. a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Oily! I&#x27;ll never buy it again! I prefer pads, no oil. I really hate oil. Maybe, I don&#x27; t sound very persuasive for somebody, but I really hate oil and I hate when people say &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s actually not true.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other eye makeup remover&#x27;s but once I tried this one I fell in love. It does a great job removing the eye makeup and does not leave any oily residue behind.</li>
    <li> I think this eye makeup remover is perfect. Not too dry or oily. I prefer it over the many other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye makeup removers I&#x27;ve ever used. You only need to use a small amount. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It works fabulously to take off make up, leaving no &#x27;raccoon eyes&#x27; or greasy film. I&#x27;ve used it for years and wouldn&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> However, I ordered 4.  All four came in the same envelope, yet I was charged 4 times for shipping for a total of more than 30.00 in shipping charges.  That&#x27;s absolutely outrageous.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  As far as rating the remover...I chose 5 stars because it&#x27;s the only one that won&#x27;t burn your eyes, and has no scent.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly on all make up on my face. Especially if I&#x27;m in a hurry or super tired, dont feel like spending 10 minutes Scrubbing my face, and just feel like crashing in bed. So yes this works and not just on eye make up.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s Eye makeup remover takes off eye makeup with ease.  No hard rubbing required.  It is the only kind that I buy.</li>
    <li> I was able to get two bottles for the price of one if I had made my purchase through a home party. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does remove ALL your eye make up! Even the toughest, clumpiest mascara!! Be careful when you rub it off on your eyes, there IS alcohol in it and it WILL burn your eye if you open it right away. I suggest, wipe off, remain eyes closed for a few seconds, and you will be fine!</li>
    <li> Love this eye makeup remover. I have used this for many years and will use nothing but this eye makeup remover! Perfect for sensitive eves .</li>
    <li> Clinique take the day off is better but this works ok</li>
    <li> First of all, this product is advertised as oil free when it&#x27;s not; you can literally see huge oil slicks floating inside the liquid. I personally do not mind oily eye makeup removers but I do mind false advertisement.  Second, I bought this product based on the reviews but personally I find this product over rated. It does the job but I find myself having to go over my eye a couple of times before it&#x27;s completely off; and I still end up with raccoon eyes in the morning; nothing special. I just bought the bottle 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s almost finished; which I am happy about because I&#x27;m eager to buy a different eye makeup remover.  If you want to save money use baby oil instead. It works much better.</li>
    <li> I love this because it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue in my eyes as if I put drops of oil in them! Most eye makeup removers are too oily. Light, clean feeling and yet doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dry. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Very gentle. It is a little pricer than drugstore brands, but I would buy again. It removes makeup and is not oily.</li>
    <li> I usually use Lancome Bi-Facil, but was looking for something cheaper. At $4/ounce, this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Is 40% cheaper than the Bi-Facil&lt;br /&gt;- Has the same dual-action formula&lt;br /&gt;- Works just as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or contacts, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> I see why this got so many good reviews. It feels like an oil, but says it is oil free. I use the Kiss Me mascara remover first, let set for a few minutes and then use this to get off my very hard to remove mascara. Only need a tiny amount at a time.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of removing waterproof mascara and eyeliner.  Other eye makeup removers just didn&#x27;t cut it (or if they did they were a lot sore expensive).  I will continue to se this one as long as it is made.</li>
    <li> the best eyemakeup remover ever removes even all dau wear mascaras</li>
    <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and it removes the mascara with ease. Telling my friends-Thank You</li>
    <li> I love this product. It not only removes any kind of mascara and eyeshadow. It leaves your eyes and face feeling oil free.</li>
    <li> I had this many years ago and remembered liking it. After having trouble with every other eye makeup remover on the market I purchased this online. It isn&#x27;t any better than the over the shelf stuff IMHO. I still have to use this, wash my face, use this again and the next mooring, raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> I wanted Mary Kay eye makeup remover but didn&#x27;t want to order from a Mary Kay consultant as doing so would make me a regular customer. This remover is hands down the best remover I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Is one of the best products on the market.  have not found any thing better to remove eye makeup. Great.</li>
    <li> Love the eye makeup remover.  I use it to remove my mascara, and It works great!  I will re-order when I run out.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as great a product as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Only remover that I&#x27;ve ever found to work!</li>
    <li> I received this exactly when it said it would come! I&#x27;m such a happy customer because I absolutely love this product! It wipes away the makeup on a person with like two wipes. It leaves you oil - free and refreshed feeling. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Easily removes waterproof mascara :)</li>
    <li> Really love this make up remover.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes while getting all the make up off. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many eye makeup removers, and Mary Kay is BY FAR the best. I sometimes wear a thicker waterproof mascara, and nothing touches it but This product. Lifetime favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> i bought this makeup remover because of rating but I am disappointed. For me it is just mediocre makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover on the market.  Easily removes makeup without a lot of scrubbing.  I would recommend this to anyone who wears makeup and hates the process of removing it or who gets abrasions from scrubbing your makeup off.</li>
    <li> This product takes off the eye make up very well, but sometimes I may still see some mascara on the cleansing pad  if I did not wash my face first. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It really helps to completely remove eye make up. Washing the face alone will not cut it.</li>
    <li> I am familiar with Mary Kay eye makeup remover (old style bottle white lid). This formula seems different. It seems lighter and I do not use as much. However it also seems to make me break out around my eyes. I am not sure if I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye make-up removers in the past, and this one is the best for sensitive skin. I use it every night without any eye irritation and it gets off all of my make up. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great eye makeup remover - it does a great job with my eye shadow and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the raves are about. First off, it stinks. But more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup very well. It&#x27;s just really watery and I find myself repeatedly tugging on my skin. Did mine go bad during delivery? It has been pretty hot and humid lately. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just extremely disappointed and would not could not recommend this in the least.</li>
    <li> I like it--is not too greasy, doesn&#x27;t smell strong, doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes, the price is right and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye makeup remover I have ever found (and I have tried a lot) that took off all the makeup and never irritated my eyes.</li>
    <li> Packaging was very bad. Received half empty</li>
    <li> I always likes Mary Kay. I&#x27;ve used it for 15 plus years now. The product works great at removing makeup as well as wax from waxing one self.</li>
    <li> These products are my staple for the last 8-10 years now so they must be effective because my face is smooth in my 60&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Used to purchase directly from Mary Kay and felt that the product I get direct vs the product I received on line were different.  When I have purchased direct in the past, seemed like I used less product and the make up came off effortlessly.  The online purchase, seems I use more product and have to rub firmer to get the makeup off and that irritates the skin under my eyes.  Not a fan....will go back and try and purchase direct again and see if I see a difference still.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very fast shipping! I recommend this products!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find another product that can beat this.</li>
    <li> I had tried diffrent brands of make up removers in the past but I haven&#x27;t found one yet that works as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Gets the job done with a lot less rubbing my eyes. I put it on a cottonball and hold it on to my eyes for a couple seconds and then just wipe like 3 times and its all gone. Also noticed that my eyes don&#x27;t burn afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof eye makeup is still a pain to come off.</li>
    <li> best eye makeup remover on the market.  cant go wrong with the price. great value.</li>
    <li> Great make up remover. Not oily and does not sting. Cleans the regular mascara very well.</li>
    <li> this product works really well - much better than other brands - even on the darkest shades of eyeshadow - i would buy again</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had a difficult time finding an eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin until now.</li>
    <li> Need to package these better, surprised it didn&#x27;t leak. Maybe put them in a box and not a bag? Just a thought.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best eye make up remover! I have tried over 10 different ones!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay eye makeup remover is the best product that I have found for removing eye makeup and mascarra. It does not burn your eyes and removes completely. I would recommend this product to friends and family members.</li>
    <li> At night I used to use Loriel towelettes thinking my face was clean and my makeup removed, when my Mary Kay consultant introduced me to this product she had me remove my makeup and than use this stuff to go over my eyes, you would not believe how much more crud and left over makeup it gets from your face.  When I am running late I sometimes use this for my entire face, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye makeup removers. This is by far the best. It takes off waterproof mascara and eyeliner fast. Also it does not dry out skin.  I always buy a few to stock up.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup remover. Doesnt leave your face feeling oily</li>
    <li> This is the only product that gently removes waterproof mascara. It&#x27;s wonderful I wouldn&#x27;t be without it! Good size bottle for the money.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, fast service!</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis on one of  my eye lids and this product made it worse! It says oil-free, but i think it did have oil inside it. that&#x27;s why i think my eye got even more red and itchy.I could not get rid of my make-up properly with it either. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite makeup removers! I used to use the Neutrogena make up remover but I will have a difficult time removing my eye make up. This only takes one try and it&#x27;ll remove my waterproof eyeliner. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is really a great product at a very reasonable price. I no longer know a Mary Kay consultans so I was glad to see I could purchase this product online from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many different eye make-up removers in the past 35 years or so. All of them have been \\&quot;name brands\\&quot;. From top of the line, and very expensive to less expensive name brands at your local drug store. This is the only eye make-up remover that I have used that does not sting or irritate my eyes when I use it, and it really works. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and one bottle will last for months. Just a dab on a cotton ball and your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product removes the toughest eyeliner and mascara. One swipe and it&#x27;s gone and leaves no residue. I love buying it online so I don&#x27;t have to deal with a sales lady. I gave it 4 stars. There is another product that is better but I won&#x27;t pay the big $ for it. MaryKay does the job very nicely.</li>
    <li> Best ever. Great for false lashes or eyelash extensions</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I bought the Clarins at twice the price.  It works well with heavy makeup removal, but is still rather irritating to my eyes.  The MK works just as well with no irritation, at half the price.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I have used yet.  It goes on like water and the makeup comes right off. I use Younique 3D fiber lashes and this remover takes that mascara right off. Most remover wipes etc irritate my eyes and cheeks but this remover does not irritate my skin at all!! It&#x27;s fantastic!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover so much that I have given it as a gift before. I have sensitive skin, and drugstore makeup removers will sometimes irritate my eyes - especially if I have to scrub at my face to get the makeup off! This works great and lasts for a while since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover! Easy to eye area without irritation.</li>
    <li> Excellent Eye Makeup Remover. Can&#x27;t find anything close to the ease of taking eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> Great product! I decided to try with this one after a life using makeup removing towels and it changed my life!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Nothing I have found works better at gently removing my eye makeup without irritating my eyes or requiring me to scrub them.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I usually use Lancome products but was out of the country and realized that when I came home, I would be without an eye make up remover. I went to my favorite shopping site, Amazon, and lo and behold there was the Mary Kay Oil-free eye make up remover. After reading some review, I decided to give Mary Kay Eye Make up remover a try. It does a great job, and does not pull on my tender skin around my eyes. I like this product and will buy again! I love the variety of items on Amazon because Amazon shopping is easier for shopping, takes less time than malls (where I can easily get distracted). The item reviews are the icing on the cake for me. I forgot, I am reviewing Mary Kay Oil Free Eye Make up remover, which is a great product!</li>
    <li> I got this a while ago and I feel about ready to get another one! I mean, this really took off my eye makeup nicely and gave it a real cleaning, know what I&#x27;m talking about? Anyways, I gotta get another one of these fast!</li>
    <li> The only eye makeup remover that can take all the eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara off. I love it. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup remover</li>
    <li> This is the best Water Proof eye makeup remover around. I have been looking and trying to make my own, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that compares. The only problem with it is too expensive, that&#x27;s why Im only giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife uses the make up remover and she is very happy with it. she will continue to buy it. No oily or hard on the skin</li>
    <li> The best eye makeup remover. Period.</li>
    <li> Removes difficult eyeliner without problems. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works great - especially on waterproof make-up!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. Prefect make up remover</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this item from amazon but my mother in law sells Mary Kay and I get my things free from her and she had given this to me. And let me tell you, AMAZING. By even kidding in one swip my makeup is like gone and it leaves my face softer then ever!</li>
    <li> I have been removing mascara and all sorts of eye make up for years and this is absolutely the best eye make up remover I have ever used.  It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t require a lot of rubbing in order to be effective, and as others have said it conditions the eyelashes and if you&#x27;re a bit over 40 and need a bit of extra care it also conditions the skin around your eyes. The first time you use it it may take a few times to get your own technique down because it is a very watery, but after you figure out how it works for you, you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is one of those products that I panic-buy when my bottle gets down to about one-quarter full.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I read about the product, I expected to love it.  I was sorry I bought it and paid what I did for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to require too much swabbing for removing water soluble mascara.  My upper and lower eye lids were tight and dry when I finished, hardly worth the struggle to put them through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a poor rating compared to Clinique or L&#x27;Oreal eye makeup remover.  Even Walgreen&#x27;s brand is much better and gentler on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much for all of the reviews, they did not assist my purchase at all</li>
    <li> I have tried many makeup removers and this is by far the best.  Easily takes off waterproof eye makeup that is put over urban decay eyelid primer.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years and its great to be able to purchase this online and receive in less than a week without having to search for it from someone in the area. Great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara remover for many many years.  There&#x27;s nothing better out there for removing waterproof mascara, and the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; type of mascara glides off even more effortlessly.  I&#x27;ve strayed from time-to-time - trying mascara removers I bought in a drugstore - but I always ended up throwing them away and ordering Mary Kay.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.</li>
    <li> This product was too watery. I&#x27;ll stick with the products from Seacret.I love this product for my skin. However after purchasing I found a more affordable price athttp://www.seacretdirect.com/jadecker/en/us/products/shop?special&#x3D;1&amp;CustomerType&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I have decided I absolutely cannot live without this product. My last bottle ran out about a month ago and so I opted to run to the drug store and pick up some generic remover and BOY was I sorry ~ it made my eyes blood red!     I then opted for Avon&#x27;s remover and hated that I had to practically scrub my mascara off my face, plus it barely removed it!     So I called my Mary Kay lady last week and begged her for a bottle which she gladly brought over! I&#x27;ve since thrown away my other non-Mary Kay bottles!     This is the best product on the market! Eye makeup comes off so easy and gently with a cotton ball and no rinsing required!     I LOVE IT!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and easy to use.  No harsh rubbing to remove mascara.  Highly recommend.  Have used for years and can&#x27;t find anything that compares.</li>
    <li> Love the product... Removes eye makeup with out stinging or drying. It is a must have for eye makeup wearers. Especially waterproof.</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover I have ever used. It&#x27;s also great for cleaning make-up brushes. Just getting that out there.</li>
    <li> I have been happy with the oil free makeup remover. I usually use Lancome eye makeuo remover and&lt;br /&gt;I do think it does a better job but it is oily and this one gets the makeup off.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Arrived early.  thanks!</li>
    <li> The product was given to me by a coworker several years ago and I haven&#x27;t looked back. Does the job great (I wear mascara and eyeliner everyday) and this product does not make me breakout and removes everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Lancôme Bi-facial eye make up remover. I hated everything else. This Mary Kay make up remover has the same quality but half the price. I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
    <li> It appears to watered down or not really mary kay.  I have used the eye make up remover for long time and this is not good.  Something is wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Never burns my eyes! Takes even the blackest of eyeliner off</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It takes all the make-up and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes as other products/baby oil does.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything... aside from spending $30 for eye remover, this works the best!  Removes eye makeup and is not really greasy.  And the eye makeup melts away unlike every other eye makeup remover I have bought.</li>
    <li> Works definitely better than all other brands. Removes makeup faster and with ease, especially mascara and eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Very gentle and never fails. No scrubbing,  rubbing or irritation.  Hands down the very best eye and 24 hour lipstick make-up remover EVER</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t rate this remover back when I was using it, but I thought it worked fine. Well, turns out I just didnt know any better. Sure, it worked. But more for face makeup OTHER than eye makeup. I&#x27;d scrub at my eyes while using this stuff and still end up with racoon-eyes if I rubbed my dry eyes later. Now I&#x27;m using another product that I apply and don&#x27;t have to scrub my eyes and everything comes off! Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm. That&#x27;s an awesome remover!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews on Amazon.  Every other eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried has irritated the skin around my eyes (made them red, flaky and itchy).  This one is fantastic.  It takes the makeup right off with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this make up remover for years and I love it. I wear water proof make up and it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> I wear LOTS of eye make-up and this is the best remover I have ever used. Feels gentle but does the job.</li>
    <li> It was here on time, the product was not damaged, and it really works!! I buy this product often and use it every night! I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> this is the only item that will take off all my makeup. Will never switch to anything else. Love it.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover is so gentle..doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, removes any makeup I slap at it, and I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face afterwards..Simply can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite MaryKay product by far...</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover hands down. I even use it to remove false strip lashes. The best!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye makeup remover. It is not oily amd it is very gentle when used . No stinging in the eye. It removes eye mascara,eye liner easily.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay eye make up remover for years and it is the best I have used compared to any product you can buy at the store. Removes make up easily, with out rubbing and does not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, gentle to your eyes, and a little amount goes along way. :D</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 5-years now and it is the only one that I use. It is not hard on your skin and is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I love this eye makeup remover. It does not leave an oil feel to my face but it does a great job getting all my eye makeup off.</li>
    <li> This is the best make up remover I have ever used.  It takes my eye make up off all at once-including my waterproof mascara-without any issues or need for scrubbing.  Although it is oil free my eye area does feel a little greasy for the first few minutes after I use it.  I&#x27;ve accidentally gotten this in my eye on 2 occasions and my eye was just fine and it didn&#x27;t hurt/burn (not that I recommend doing this).</li>
    <li> Thinking the makeup remover is very old, been on the shelf a bit beyond its normal 3-year shelf-life.  Please advise.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better!  The neutrogena or ponds products just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Removes mascara very well.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Mary Kay eye Makeup Remover for 10+ years.  I wear waterproof mascara and this brand in the only one that wipes the mascara away easily without much rubbing. I have tried others and always go back to Mary Kay&#x27;s.  I also use it to clean the makeup residue on my compact mirrors, works great!  :)</li>
    <li> I have used this eye makeup remover for years.  It is the only one that I found removes makeup quickly without oily messes.  I love it and wouldn&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
    <li> This helps to keep my skin soft around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This oil free eye makeup remover takes off all my eye makeup without any tugging or pulling in the eye area. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Quick, VERY fast delivery.  Impressive and reasonable priced. Love Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#x27;t tried this brand of eye makeup remover... there is nothing on the market better. I&#x27;ve tried it all. This is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to eye make up removers. I used to simply wash off my eye and face make up before bed with facial wash, but I know now how important it is to remove makeup properly. The first time I used this I was completely astounded at how well it removed my makeup. Eyeliner, mascara, brow powder and eye primer all dissolved in a single swipe! This is the first eye make up remover I have tried and I&#x27;m certain I will continue to use it forever. Very gentle on my skin, didn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and it actually left my eyelids smooth and soft. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Ever since buying a bottle of this eye makeup remover because I felt pressured at a MK party that a friend was running, I have absolutely loved it and cannot live without it. I have tried others and nothing lives up!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay has the best eye makeup remover.. I have used many in the past and keep going back to this brand.  When it is hard to find a representative. just go onto Amazon and get it there.  Very reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many removers and always come back to this one.  It just works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve switched a couple times over the years and always end up coming back to this one. It&#x27;s just amazing. I wear waterproof mascara on a daily basis... I use a round cotton swab to remove my mascara. I squirt a little of the remover on the swab and hold it on my lashes for about 10 seconds then start to gently rub back and forth, then I do the other eye. It works awesome.</li>
    <li> really nice, and I can use it with my contacts in as well and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate them, and gets really everything off!</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before I go bed to remove my eye makeup. Not oily at all. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a makeup remover that didn&#x27;t make me rub my eye raw.  This makes my makeup come off so easily.  Other friends have tried it and were amazed. I now have a friend that sells Mary Kay so I&#x27;m going to be going to her for this product in the future so she can get the business.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews and can see why people like it, in that it isn&#x27;t greasy. But, I must admit that I&#x27;m not convinced it is that much better than others for the Lancome mascara I use--which wears like iron, but isn&#x27;t easy to remove without an oil-based remover. For other kinds of mascara, I find Yonka make-up remover lotion to be better because it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all and this tend to do that a little. I think it&#x27;s a good product but not the best for me. I guess that is why there are many formulas on the market and all of them are making money!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this eye-makeup remover.  I find it to be effective and non-greasy.  A bit more effort to purchase it since I can&#x27;t just run into a store, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now and I have not found its equal.  It gently removes mascara quickly and effectively.  I am beyond pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has pretty high rating. It has just normal quality but it&#x27;s not a super eye remover. It works well though.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye makeup remover I use. Love that I can buy it on here. I would recommend it to anyone who uses mary kay.</li>
    <li> Fantastic makeup remover, make sure you stir it (shake it otherwise it separates into 2 phases) well before pouring on the pad. Place a little bit on the pad and put it in contact against eye lid and hold for 20-30 seconds and do not move. After you detach it all your eye makeup will be on the pad (no need of rubbing and disturbing your skin!). Definitely worth recommending.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this and I am glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is without a doubt the best make-up remover ever made. It takes off every last bit of make-up. Love It!</li>
    <li> I love how easily my make-up is removed while using this product.  Compared to other removers this one is the quickest and best for removal of my eyeliner (Urban Decay 24/7).</li>
    <li> This stuff is greattttttttttttttttttt.I order this lotion a lot.This is not oily.No bad smellThe delivery was so fast.Alittle goes a long way.I will continue to use this lotion</li>
    <li> I lov this stuff! I got an awesome price for this item. And it shipped right away &amp; I received in just a couple of days.. AWESOME JOB!</li>
    <li> This oil-free eye makeup remover is non-evasive and works well.  It doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes when applied to remove mascara.</li>
    <li> Great eye make-up remover. A little goes a long way. Will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Removes waterproof mascara.  Works as well as (or better than) other expensive makeup removers at a much more reasonable price.  Does not irritate my eyes.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Takes all make up off without having oil. I love it cuz I have eyelash extensions and u can&#x27;t use oil based products when having them.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of gently removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover is awesome. I have sensitive eyes &amp; this doesn&#x27;t sting at all. It also doesn&#x27;t take a large amount so the product last awhile. I use it on those lint free round circle cotton eye pads you get at any big store chain. It will leave a little bit of shine to your eye but it says wash off with water after which removes it easily. Just shake it when you got to use it to mix it up. Very happy with this product. Also this seller shipped it quickly, packaged welled &amp; product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever tried, that&#x27;s precisely why I purchased it a second time 👌</li>
    <li> I tried going back to drugstore brands after trying this, but I just can&#x27;t do it.  This stuff is great.  It&#x27;s worth having to order it, and it&#x27;s also worth the extra cost, it truly eliminates all residue, and even if there is still a bit left, it makes anything left a ton easier to wipe off with my regular Yes To Blueberry face wipes.  I just can&#x27;t go back to drugstore brands, and I&#x27;m kind of reluctant to try any other brand of eye makeup remover, when this works so well!</li>
    <li> I guess it is alright. I had a CVS eye make up remover that worked better and was much cheaper! And it is oily so you have to wash your face with soap after using it.</li>
    <li> reminds me of Lancome&#x27;s make up remover, but 1/4 the price.  I wear water clean up, but like to use make up remover because it conditions my lash.&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle and cleans up mascara well.</li>
    <li> Took more than 3x to removed some of my eye makeup. My lower liner was still present.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Makeup remover.  I had looked for years for a good eye makeup remover and Mary Kay has produced it.  This removes my mascara without having to rub my eyes significantly and makes it easy to then clean my face.  Will be continuing to use this product for years to come!</li>
    <li> I use this every night. It removes everything including my waterproof mascara with no problem, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> Loved it. It arrived on time, it was the correct product. It was exactly what I had wanted-- and that&#x27;s when everyone wins!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay oil-free makeup remover  is the very best eye makeup remover that I have ever used. I would recommend using it. last a long time goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other brands and ONLY this one works as I want. The eye makeup comes right off without pulling, tugging, and rubbing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other eye makeup removers - this one is tried and true and I am not allergic to it.</li>
    <li> You have to use a lot of this product for it to be effective, which obviously gets quite pricey. I&#x27;ll continue my search for the perfect eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I never use anything else but this eye makeup remover.  It takes off my eye makeup without having to wipe hard and does it in a couple of swipes with a tissue.  Love it !!!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best makeup remover I have ever used. I had been very loyal to the Sephora brand eye makeup remover, but not anymore. I only use waterproof mascara, so I need a pretty good remover. Anyway, I found that the Sephora brand does an ok job, but I always had some black residue under my eyes, even after thoroughly removing the makeup and washing my face. Plus it always felt oily. This gets all the mascara off and has no oily residue. Oh man. This is the best. I&#x27;ve been hoping to find something this good, but honestly didn&#x27;t think it was going to get better than the Sephora brand. Trust me when I say that it can. And this is it ladies.</li>
    <li> Takes ALL makeup off with ease and moisturizes my skin and lashes. I think they are longer now that I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This product works like magic!  I&#x27;ve tried so many other brands but always go back to this one.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t leave with out it!</li>
    <li> I feel that this is a great makeup remover. I like that the dispenser has a small hole to let out only a little bit of remover at a time. Other bottles with wider openings can let too much liquid remover out and  you end up wasting too much liquid. It&#x27;s also a great size bottle - lasts a long time.  Great for sensitive skin like mine.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other websites in addition to Amazon rate this as an excellent makeup remover. I agree. Reasonable price for what you get. No need to buy the department store brands and pay much more.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover.  Hate when I run out.</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover there is, it&#x27;s just that simple.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I have used it about ten times so far. I have sensitive skin and eyes and I&#x27;ve had no problems thus far. The eye makeup comes off really easy. I pour a little in the lid and dip a q-tip in there, perfect for racoon eye. Four starts instead of five only because I wish it was a smaller container so I can fly without checking a bag.</li>
    <li> This product really will remove all my mascara and eye makeup without any eye irritation.  It takes just a couple of seconds of wiping around each eye with a cotton pad and everything will be gone.  You barely have to use any of the liquid too.  It&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought off amazon...especially because items like this are a little bit risky if you&#x27;ve never used them.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it if you need it.</li>
    <li> I always use wipes for my face but when I need to take a break from those I use this, I love this brand of makeup remover it comes off so easy no matter how much make-up you have on :)</li>
    <li> Great remover - doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and gets everything off without leaving black smudges everywhere.  Make sure to shake product before use.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs a good make up remover. It&#x27;s very gentle, and works very well. I don&#x27;t need to scrub my eyelids when I remove my makeup-- and that&#x27;s the only thing I was looking for when purchasing this product. I don&#x27;t need to worry about residue left behind when I take off my eye make up anymore! :D</li>
    <li> I like ordering my beauty products online, because I can pick my price, they&#x27;re always in stock, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for the local representative to deliver it to me.</li>
    <li> been using this for years now, love it, easy, one swipe , makeup off. non greasy! does the job. hooray!</li>
    <li> I have used Mary Kay products for 35 years and this eye make-up remover is the best!  Doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue in your eyes like other removers do.  I had an issue with the product when I first received it, but the seller contacted me immediately and sent a replacement product shortly after.  Would definitely recommend purchasing Mary Kay from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup remover. Had never tried this brand before. I works great in just a few wipes. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I needed a new makeup remover didn&#x27;t know what to order then i heard a lot of good reviews on this product. I got it and it works like magic. One light sweep across the eyes and my makeup is all gone. I definitely recommend this product. Totally worth the price and it lasts a  long time.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay eye make up remover is the best product of this kind that I have ever used.  I have been using it for years.  Also, the service provide by this seller was exceptional.  I received the product in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I use waterproof mascara &amp; it takes it off very easily. Just be sure you shake the bottle before applying it to a cotton square.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye make-up remover. It takes it of in one or two swipes, lasts a long time and is gentle. Only complaint is it&#x27;s a little greasy compared to others.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as I expected. I recommend Mary Kay eye makeup removers as the best brand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a number of years.  Removes eye makup easily without irritation.  There are a number of eye makup removal products on the market but I find this one the most effective and economical.</li>
    <li> I hate after using makeup remover my face will turn out super oily. BUT, this one won&#x27;t end up this way!!!! My face comes out fresh and not oil after using it (of course still need to wash my face, haha). It&#x27;s just a little bit pricy for me.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever found. Takes everything off (mascara, eyeliner, shadow) with one or two swipes without having to scrub your eye a million times with a cotton ball. Gentle and super effective. Very high end product.</li>
    <li> Great service as usual!</li>
    <li> This product is non-oily yet removes all eye makeup without pulling on the skin around the eyes. It is the best such product I have ever used, because it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I highly recommend it.  It doesn&#x27;t sting, or blur my vision for hours.  I use Maybelline Great Lash Waterproof mascara and at times I have literally peeled the mascara off because nothing else would remove it.  This product removed it with a few swipes of a cotton ball.</li>
    <li> It only take one wipe on a cotton ball to get the job done. Excellent.</li>
    <li> This product works so well, and it has not irritated my eyes in the slightest!  My skin is prone to break outs and this has never irritated my skin either.  This is one of Mary Kay&#x27;s best products and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover is great. I had previously been using Almay, both moisturizing and non-moisturizing, but there were problems with both. The moisturizing lotion made my eyes greasy, the non-oily one didn&#x27;t do a thourough job of removing eye makeup, but the Mary Kay Oil-Free just gets the job done! I am particularly impressed with how well it removes mascara, formerly a real ordeal, and leaves my eyes clean and residue free. I will continue to use this eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This oil free makeup remover works miracles!! I use them for my eye makeup (I wear eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner, and mascara). It comes right off with no hassle, and you don&#x27;t have to use that much. It comes in the perfect size that lasts me awhile, and it&#x27;s totally affordable. Doesn&#x27;t really leave a greasy feel unless you use too much of it. I always wash my face right after removing my makeup with this product, so the greasy feeling people are commenting about shouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem. Best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many products, and this one removes ALL makeup WITHOUT drying out my skin, especially the sensitive eye area!</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best eye make-up remover I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve used so many products before and always come back to this one. I&#x27;m convinced this is the best remover.  Easy to wipe off your make-up without tugging or rubbing and doesn&#x27;t leave any resi&lt;br /&gt;due.</li>
    <li> Purchased 5, love them so much.&lt;br /&gt;remove eye makeup easily.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have to use too much strength..&lt;br /&gt;recommend for you guys</li>
    <li> I hope everyone is purchasing their Mary Kay products from a reputable Mary Kay representative and not from sites like this. If you don&#x27;t know your source, who knows how old this stuff is or how it is being stored! Make sure you visit www.marykay.com to find a representative who can supply you with all the wonderful eye makeup remover you need!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for nearly 15years, and won&#x27;t use anything else. I love not having to rinse, and after I use it I can apply fresh makeup without any running, etc.</li>
    <li> This make-up removal is the best I&#x27;ve ever had! It removes all the make-up really gently leaving your skin nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, I love it. It takes waterproof mascara off and leaves your eyes fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> Does not remove Clinique waterproof mascara. Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> Great product - great seller...5 stars!</li>
    <li> I use this make remover daily.  Mary Kay makes a great product and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate the eyes.</li>
    <li> works much better than the Neutrogena oil free eye make-up remover I have used forever.  I use waterproof mascara and this stuff takes it off easily.  Will definitely be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take off all eye makeups</li>
    <li> This is authentic, arrived on time, cheaper price. I will recommend n I will buy again. I&#x27;m a happy costumer 😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this makeup remover for over a decade and it&#x27;s just wonderful. It glides on so smoothly and removes everything gently. And it lasts a very long time! Just make sure to mix well before use!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; seller!</li>
    <li> This is the only eye makeup remover I will use anymore. It makes my mascara slides off gently; I lose far fewer eyelashes with this than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Also great for taking off long-last lip color.</li>
    <li> Personally, I found it was more gentle than the popular Lancome eye makeup remover which was recommended to me by a friend, and yet it is still effective. This would be my first choice at this point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this as my make-up remover for 8 years now, and I absolutely love it. I would recommend to anyone who has issues with cheaper removers</li>
    <li> The best gentle eye makeup remover and not super oily</li>
    <li> The best to clean up the mascara from your eyelashes . Love it.</li>
    <li> BEST eye makeup remover not greasy does not irritate my eyes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye makeup remover for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried others and always come back to MK. It&#x27;s the best -- providing quick and easy removal.</li>
    <li> It came very quickly and also it was exactly what I had ordered. This is my favorite eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Eye Makeup comes off nice and easy.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to Neutrogena&#x27;s eye makeup remover except it does not sting. It has a similar consistency; however, I really like the bottle it comes it because it is very tight!  The bottle&#x27;s design really prevents spillage, which happens a lot (I have pets).  So I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover ever</li>
    <li> I love how it removes my makeup.....&lt;br /&gt;Excellent remover!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve used only this for 20+ years.  won&#x27;t use anything else on my eyes.  Especially since I wear waterproof mascara.  Takes it off in a snap and lashes are conditioned.  Ordering through Amazon was cheaper than through a consultant, even with shipping.</li>
    <li> Best eye make up remover I have ever used. I tried going cheap and getting a $5 one at walmart before... never again. It burned my eyes and did not even work properly. I stick with Mary Kay for this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. Every once in a while I try something cheaper, but always end up regretting it.</li>
    <li> I always use this eye makeup remover. Non oily, don&#x27;t have to rinse off after, gets the makeup off gently, even waterproof makeup. Been using it for a few years</li>
    <li> Oil-free? This product is oily. I see they don&#x27;t write the ingredients anywhere, that&#x27;s just weird. Yes, it removes makeup. But I would have bought something else if I knew it wasn&#x27;t oil-free.</li>
    <li> Pour just a little bit on a flat cotton pad and gently press over eye for a few seconds and voila! Most of the makeup is off. Then gently dab off the remaining makeup. It comes off very smoothly and NO RUBBING NECESSARY! I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money. Also, this product goes a long way. So I definitely recommend this product ladies!</li>
    <li> For $15, I expected more from this. It does remove my makeup well, but I have to use it like 3 or 4 times to remove it completely. What I like about this though is I can use this to remove my concealer on my face, not just my eye make up. Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty decent make up remover.</li>
    <li> Only makeup remover I will use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the Mary Kay eye makeup remover there is no better product out there.</li>
    <li> Product received was not as pictured.  Old packaging and therefore possibly old formulation.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my eyes like other brands. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Love all Mary Kay products!</li>
    <li> Best eye makeup remover you can buy! Does sting a bit if you get it in your eyes... lol... so don&#x27;t do that! But fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have tried several other eye make-up removers and none compare to what all this can remove!!  I usually order a couple at a time just so that I have a spare in-between orders.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, great product!</li>
    <li> My makeup removed easily and this product lasted a long time for me. The bottle is not easily breakable and since it has a small hole where the liquid comes out, it&#x27;s not very likely for spills or losing a lot of remover when it&#x27;s knocked over. No leakage either and the cap is secure.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product.  It&#x27;s the only kind I will ever use from here on out. I wear eye make-up every day so I find this very useful. The best part is a little goes a long way. I have had my first bottle for almost a year and am just now getting a replacement!</li>
    <li> I was SO happy that I could get this on Amazon!  I couldn&#x27;t find a sales rep to buy it from and was out of it for quite a while.  While it says &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; and it is, it does leave a sort of &amp;#34;slickness&amp;#34; on your skin.  But it is sort of moisturizing.  It removes even waterproof make-up easily.  I love it and am so glad I have a place to buy it again.</li>
    <li> best eye make up remover out there, i have tried so many over the counter products over the years and this is by far the best, and lasts forever</li>
    <li> I really loved this when i first bought it but even though it&#x27;s oil free-it still leaves your face have an oily residue. However it does take off ALL your makeup. As long as you dont mind wiping off the excess oil i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> no other cleanser removes mascara like this one!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel greasy or oily but removes all traces of makeup. I&#x27;ve even used it with my contacts in without any ill effects.</li>
    <li> Best make up remover out there. This works better than any other I have tried and is far less greasy than some I have used.  I don&#x27;t see myself ever trying another brand.</li>
</ol>
