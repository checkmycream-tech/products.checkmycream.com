<li> I threw it away and vowed never to purchase parfum from an unknown vendor again.</li>
<li> Fragrances have a limited shelf life, and then they break down and the scent changes.</li>
<li> even though the bottle is tiny and the price is expensive it still last a long time the smell does not fade like alot of perfumes</li>
<li> I wanted to try a small size before springing for a full-size bottle.</li>
<li> Small bottle for pricey amount</li>
<li> It stinks!!!</li>

    <li> My wife used to smell like this all the time, but she got sucked into the &#x27;perfume of month&#x27; Cosmetique&#x27; club and the wanna be Celebrity perfumes.  I never realized how much I missed the sweet smell of Beautiful on my women.</li>
    <li> Perfect - only kind I can wear.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law was very pleased to receive this perfume for Christmas. A  lovely scent, delicate and not too strong. The shipment arrived earlier than I had thought and meant I could wrap all the gifts at one time. Very pleased with every aspect of this purchase.</li>

    <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t come in a box but it seems kind of sketchy that it doesn&#x27;t. The perfume wasn&#x27;t for me but I know a lot of mid age woman that swear by it</li>
    <li> It was my Mom&#x27;s perfume she wore and she passed away in December. Needed to have her scent.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. Can be tucked inside your handbag.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scent.  I have been wearing this scent for many years!</li>
    <li> A purchase for traveling.  I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I wore this back in the 80&#x27;s...and I spritzed this on at an Estee Lauder counter. You know, this doesn&#x27;t smell dated to me. It is still so wearable and lovely. I wanted to try a small size before springing for a full-size bottle.</li>
    <li> It was a gift I am sure it will be appreciated even this size works when your out of your fav and trying to stay in a budget.</li>

    <li> I love Estée Lauder Beautiful Parfum and wear it all of the time. I don&#x27;t know if this was old but it did NOT smell anything like what I wear. It smelled as though it was old and &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34;. I purchased it to take on a trip and didn&#x27;t try it before I left. I was stuck. I threw it away and vowed never to purchase parfum from an unknown vendor again.</li>

    <li> I was trying to find a scent that I liked and did not want to pay full price for a big bottle that I might not like.  This size is the perfect way to try.  The scent is light, just what I wanted and clean smelling a perfect match.  I did not want to be one of those women who smell comes in before they inter a room.  This is quite delightful.</li>
    <li> It stinks!!! So glad I didn&#x27;t get a large bottle.</li>
    <li> My husband gave me this years ago on a recommendation by clerk in store, love this also.</li>
