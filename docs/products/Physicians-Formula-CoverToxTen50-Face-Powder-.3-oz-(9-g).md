      <li>I love this powder!</li>
      <li>I love this powder!</li>
      <li>but I just purchase my own foam pad applicators and no problem.</li>
      <li>Love the click open/close case, one of my favorite things about it.  </li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok after it has a bit of product build up.  </li>
      <li>Love this Powder and the price point was fantastic!  </li>
      <li>and I love this product on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Its the best for under eyes circles an also covers dark spots</li>
      <li>It stays true to color and doesn&#x27;t oxidize into something orange-y, like most powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for the &#x27;over 50&#x27; crowd--it is natural and flawless.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a few years now since becoming &amp;#34;middle-age&amp;#34;, LOL,  and I just love it!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and controls shine.</li>
      <li>It takes away the shine but does not clog your pores or settle into fine lines.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t melt off in the heat.</li>
      <li>A total stranger.... was so nice of her, it made my day!</li>
      <li>I had to go search for another powder and actually found one I loved but would not recommend this to anyone who is searching for any type of coverage.</li>
      <li>Although I had to pay more due to shipping costs,  I am glad to have been able to avoid trying to find a comparable product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s seriously the best stuff around.</li>
      <li>I actually had a woman talk to me in the line at the drug store recently saying my skin was beautiful!  </li>
      <li>have used this wrinkle power for several years off and on, it works, I use it over tinted moisturizer, does not go on &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, I use a good powder brush, the one provided does not work at first</li>
      <li>really does lessen the appearance of fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>Aside than the irritation, the powder works as expected for reducing shine and making my skin tone appear more even for most of the day (unless I&#x27;m sweating).</li>
      <li>I was using bare minerals but like this MUCH better.  </li>
      <li>it sheds too much!</li>
      <li>I was able to find this powder in only one store in my area after I bought this.  </li>
      <li>Love it and can&#x27;t find in my local businesses any longer.  </li>
      <li>only wish it was more moisturizing,</li>
      <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it makes much of a difference in reducing the appearance of my forehead creases.</li>
      <li>I love this powder, it doesn&#x27;t settle like other powders.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>There was absolutely no coverage and didn&#x27;t cover any of my fine lines, it looked like I was wearing nothing.</li>
      <li>Total waste of money, I was looking for a light coverage powder to cover fine lines and any minor imperfections.</li>
      <li>Looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>Skin gets really tight with excessive application,  be sure to apply moisturizer first!  </li>
      <li>I often get a mild burning sensation on my skin after I apply this powder, especially if I&#x27;ve used any topical acne treatment the night before or if my skin is dry or sunburned.</li>
      <li>I plan on reordering this item in the near future.  </li>

    <li> I love this powder, it doesn&#x27;t settle like other powders.</li>
    <li> I am 52 and I love this product on my skin.  It goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this Powder and the price point was fantastic!  Sure hope to acquiesce another great deal on this product going forward!</li>
    <li> My favorite powder ever, hope they never quit making it! Silky smooth feel, not chalky or irritating.  Love the click open/close case, one of my favorite things about it.  I do not like the brush applicator they switched to a few years back but I just purchase my own foam pad applicators and no problem.</li>
    <li> Best coverage and truly hides/helps wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 49 and told I look much younger.  I was using bare minerals but like this MUCH better.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines and controls shine. I bought three because they are harder to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as just a stand alone product but when applied over foundation, yes wrinkles start to disappear and it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t melt off in the heat.</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup I wear... just this powder and powder blush over my daily sunscreen.  Looks so natural.  I actually had a woman talk to me in the line at the drug store recently saying my skin was beautiful!  A total stranger.... was so nice of her, it made my day!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this powder to a friend.  I plan on reordering this item in the near future.  Yours Truly</li>
    <li> I often get a mild burning sensation on my skin after I apply this powder, especially if I&#x27;ve used any topical acne treatment the night before or if my skin is dry or sunburned. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a powder before. The burn goes away within five minutes and I haven&#x27;t noticed any lasting signs of irritation. Aside than the irritation, the powder works as expected for reducing shine and making my skin tone appear more even for most of the day (unless I&#x27;m sweating). However, I don&#x27;t think it makes much of a difference in reducing the appearance of my forehead creases.</li>
    <li> This powder appears to do what it says and it doesn&#x27;t settle in the lines.  I do see improvement  in my skin, although now that summer is here I&#x27;d like a slightly darker tone which I notice this online doesn&#x27;t carry.  I was able to find this powder in only one store in my area after I bought this.  The price was about the same too.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! It stays true to color and doesn&#x27;t oxidize into something orange-y, like most powders I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve used it over liquid foundation, and over nothing but sunscreen, and in both cases it cuts the shine and evens out my skin tone. It lasts a long time, but I usually need to reapply in the afternoon and again in the evening. The brush that comes with it is useless - it sheds too much! I bought a proper powder brush and use that instead with it. That said, this is the fifth time I am buying it!</li>
    <li> have used this wrinkle power for several years off and on, it works, I use it over tinted moisturizer, does not go on &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;, I use a good powder brush, the one provided does not work at first but it&#x27;s ok after it has a bit of product build up.  only wish it was more moisturizing,</li>
    <li> Its the best for under eyes circles an also covers dark spots my friends asked what its that im using</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now since becoming &amp;#34;middle-age&amp;#34;, LOL,  and I just love it!  It takes away the shine but does not clog your pores or settle into fine lines.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now. Love the product. I wear it over sunscreen foundation. Works great. Leaves my face looking great!!</li>
    <li> This is the only powder I use. It&#x27;s seriously the best stuff around.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised,  firms and tightens your skin, but use sparingly as sometimes works &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; well. Skin gets really tight with excessive application,  be sure to apply moisturizer first!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and it&#x27;s difficult finding a powder that doesn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines. This one is great; absorbs oil &amp; keeps foundation flawless. It seems to just float on the surface. I have a hard time finding it in the stores anymore so buying it here is very handy.</li>
    <li> Did not realize it&#x27;s transparent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for a long time, but recently found it impossible to find my shade (translucent light).  I hesitated to buy the product online as I was concerned about it arriving without crumbling or breaking.  Although I had to pay more due to shipping costs,  I am glad to have been able to avoid trying to find a comparable product.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, I was looking for a light coverage powder to cover fine lines and any minor imperfections. I have always been impressed with physicians formula powder in the past but decided to try one of the other makes, very disappointed. There was absolutely no coverage and didn&#x27;t cover any of my fine lines, it looked like I was wearing nothing. I had to go search for another powder and actually found one I loved but would not recommend this to anyone who is searching for any type of coverage.</li>
    <li> Physicians Formula has the BEST products, but this one in particular is something to be RAVED about!!!  Highly recommend for the &#x27;over 50&#x27; crowd--it is natural and flawless.</li>
    <li> Love it and can&#x27;t find in my local businesses any longer.  The only powder I&#x27;ve found that has not settled or &#x27;caked&#x27; into the facial lines and wrinkles by the end of the day</li>
    <li> My skin is on the dry side so I don&#x27;t use much but a few minutes after applying it really does lessen the appearance of fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
