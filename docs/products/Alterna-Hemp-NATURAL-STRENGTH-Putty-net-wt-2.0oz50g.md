### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product and received as promised.  </li>
      <li>smells great and not greasy.</li>
      <li>&quot; look, this product works great.  </li>
      <li>LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>Good packaging.  </li>
      <li>I used the Alterna  Mud product and loved it--</li>
      <li>Good luck trying to find this product anymore.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for \\&quot;scrunching\\&quot; and getting that tosseled, sexy, look.  </li>
      <li>but my style holds up nicely for a couple of days.   </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why such a popular and excellent product was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Alterna is simply the best.  </li>
      <li>I did hair for many years.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have even using it for a couple years</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as sticky as what I ordered but it still does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product for years from a local beauty chain and counted on it for it&#x27;s great hold.  </li>
      <li>so it is worth the money for sure</li>
      <li>The product has the perfect texture to provide the styling I want without being too heavy.</li>
      <li>They have recently changed this product, and I must admit I much preferred the delicious scent of the original.  </li>
      <li>This is no even close to the original stuff that I bought.</li>
      <li>However, that said, it works great for my perm in terms of defining curls and holding in place the messy look without being goopy.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, spiky hair that stands up at the crown when I wear it short.</li>
      <li>This more recent/current version lacks the hold ability I need for my thick, very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Obviously I don&#x27;t like the new version as much as the original formula, but haven&#x27;t found anything better, so the five star rating remains.</li>
      <li>It also gives it nice shine (not dull and dry).  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper here at Amazon rather than Ulta.</li>
      <li>A very natural look, but the key is to use the right amount in the right places</li>
      <li>Good for short hair, not suitable for medium length hair.</li>
      <li>--too much will produce a mess or look unnaturally clumpy, but that is true of any texturizer.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Alterna Hemp Sculpting putty and I was instead sent the Alterna Hemp Natural strength putty.  </li>
      <li>I did not like the Natural strength Putty because of the smell.</li>
      <li>It smells like an old mans hair glue.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Organics Sculpting Putty from Amazon but they substituted it with the Natural Strength Putty...?</li>
      <li>What was sent is a new formula that is quite different in consistancy and fragrence than the product contained in the old jar(as pictured).</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this sculpting putty at the salon when I got my short spikey new hairstyle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to forgo a little added shine for a style that looks natural, yet well-defined.  </li>
      <li>Apparently Alterna discontinued hemp products and replaced them with a Bamboo line.  </li>
      <li>I went back to an old amazon order and re-ordered.  </li>
      <li>so much I asked the hairdresser about Alterna&#x27;s other styling products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for short, choppy haircuts--gives definition without looking greasy or weighted down, and tones down fly-away, dry hair a bit.  </li>

<li> I can change my whole look with this in less than a minute!</li>

<li> product is very sticky and hard to work with.  </li>
<li> One jar lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> In my opinion it&#x27;s too heavy for fine or thin hair.  </li>
<li> Same as the other Alterna product I bought.</li>
<li> I would have sent it back, but it&#x27;s just not worth my time.</li>
<li> The only down side is this sculpting putty does not provide shine like some other texturizer brands do (even though it says it does on the jar).  </li>
<li> I have very thick naturally wavy, fairly short hair and this product can lift and separate it like nothing else.</li>
<li> Product has changes, new one is not good</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> It never hardens like some other products, just gives the style that you can continue to fix throughout the day.  </li>
<li> The one I had used in the past was orange in color and this one is white.  </li>
<li> I use this product to lay the hair down and give it that \\&quot;piecy\\&quot; look.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m sad to see that Alterna doesn&#x27;t have another product that works as well as the older formulation.  </li>
<li> You can apply a small amount and it does the job without making your hair sticky.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s hard to keep it styled.  </li>
<li> It no longer has the same consistency or smell--more gooey rather than putty-like and stinks.  </li>
<li> Sorry, it was expensive, and was totally un-useable for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also a little difficult to wash out</li>
<li> Introduce your video to other customers (Recommended)   To insert a product link use the format: [[ASIN:ASIN product-title]]</li>
<li> and it is very sticky and leaves you hair dirty looking, but the worst is the smell!!  </li>
<li> This smells horrible, and makes my hair feel gross!  </li>
<li> I was disappointed when I received this order as this product was not what I had ordered in the past.  </li>
<li> Disappointed,  Nothing like the Alterna styling mud in the violet jar, that I&#x27;ve used for years and is now discontinued.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product for years from a local beauty chain and counted on it for it&#x27;s great hold.  This more recent/current version lacks the hold ability I need for my thick, very fine hair.  There is mousse that does almost the same job as this product and I&#x27;m sad to see that Alterna doesn&#x27;t have another product that works as well as the older formulation.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, but will have to use hairspray along with it.</li>
    <li> The product has the perfect texture to provide the styling I want without being too heavy. I have very fine, spiky hair that stands up at the crown when I wear it short. I use this product to lay the hair down and give it that \\&quot;piecy\\&quot; look.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser told me about this product.  If you have short hair and you need some spike or separation or a \\&quot;piecey\\&quot; look, this product works great.  It never hardens like some other products, just gives the style that you can continue to fix throughout the day.  Much cheaper here at Amazon rather than Ulta.</li>
    <li> I did not like the Natural strength Putty because of the smell. I ordered the Organics Sculpting Putty from Amazon but they substituted it with the Natural Strength Putty...?</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on me the 1st time I tried it. That&#x27;s when I got hooked. I have very thick naturally wavy, fairly short hair and this product can lift and separate it like nothing else. I can change my whole look with this in less than a minute! It&#x27;s great for \\&quot;scrunching\\&quot; and getting that tosseled, sexy, look.  I get lots of compliments on my hair when I use it.   I did hair for many years. In my opinion it&#x27;s too heavy for fine or thin hair.  It&#x27;s also a little difficult to wash out but my style holds up nicely for a couple of days.

    <li> Product has changes, new one is not good</li>
    <li> This is no even close to the original stuff that I bought. This smells horrible, and makes my hair feel gross!  Don&#x27;t order It!!</li>
    <li> I used the Alterna  Mud product and loved it-- I ordered this and it is very sticky and leaves you hair dirty looking, but the worst is the smell!!  It smells like an old mans hair glue.  Sorry, it was expensive, and was totally un-useable for me.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this order as this product was not what I had ordered in the past.  I went back to an old amazon order and re-ordered.  The one I had used in the past was orange in color and this one is white.  My hair is short and curly so it&#x27;s hard to keep it styled.  This stuff keeps my hair from getting frizzy and curling up. It also gives it nice shine (not dull and dry).  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Same as the other Alterna product I bought. smells great and not greasy. Good for short hair, not suitable for medium length hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  It&#x27;s great for short, choppy haircuts--gives definition without looking greasy or weighted down, and tones down fly-away, dry hair a bit.  A very natural look, but the key is to use the right amount in the right places--too much will produce a mess or look unnaturally clumpy, but that is true of any texturizer.  The only down side is this sculpting putty does not provide shine like some other texturizer brands do (even though it says it does on the jar).  I&#x27;m willing to forgo a little added shine for a style that looks natural, yet well-defined.  One jar lasts a long time.  By the way, I like this product so much I asked the hairdresser about Alterna&#x27;s other styling products.  She thought the pomade, modeling clay, concrete were too heavy for the look I am trying to achieve, so this is the only one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10-23-2012  Good luck trying to find this product anymore.  Apparently Alterna discontinued hemp products and replaced them with a Bamboo line.  I unsuccessfully tried to find a Bamboo product that was sculpting putty&#x27;s equivalent.  Contacted Alterna (via consumer email) with this question but never received a response back.  If anyone uses an Alterna product in lieu of this, please let me know what it is and if you like it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-2013  Alterna reformulated their hemp putty.  It no longer has the same consistency or smell--more gooey rather than putty-like and stinks.  Obviously I don&#x27;t like the new version as much as the original formula, but haven&#x27;t found anything better, so the five star rating remains.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and received as promised.  Good packaging.  I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this sculpting putty at the salon when I got my short spikey new hairstyle.  LOVED IT. You can apply a small amount and it does the job without making your hair sticky. Reapply the next day without a problem of residue build up.  This is about 1/3 the price that my salon charges!</li>
    <li> They have recently changed this product, and I must admit I much preferred the delicious scent of the original.  However, that said, it works great for my perm in terms of defining curls and holding in place the messy look without being goopy.  A little goes a long way so it is worth the money for sure</li>
    <li> I ordered the Alterna Hemp Sculpting putty and I was instead sent the Alterna Hemp Natural strength putty.  It&#x27;s not as sticky as what I ordered but it still does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Disappointed,  Nothing like the Alterna styling mud in the violet jar, that I&#x27;ve used for years and is now discontinued. Don&#x27;t know why such a popular and excellent product was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very sticky and hard to work with.  Will not buy again</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Alterna is simply the best.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have even using it for a couple years but why is it $55.00?  It sells for $17.00 everywhere else!</li>
    <li> The product I received is not what is pictured. What was sent is a new formula that is quite different in consistancy and fragrence than the product contained in the old jar(as pictured). I would have sent it back, but it&#x27;s just not worth my time.</li>
    <li> Received order as ordered, product just not for my hair type.  Returned without any problems.  Will try alternate product .</li>
