<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughters blow dryer died the day before she was to start a new job.  I ordered this one for her and she absolutely loves it.  Simple and reasonably priced with the attachment.</li>
    <li> One of the switches is stiff and difficult to operate.</li>
    <li> great for the guest room</li>
    <li> good quality dryer for a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Plenty of both air and heat.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easy to use.  Two heat settings and two speeds dries hair quickly.  Cushioned grip is comfortable to use.  Good value for the price.  The only down side is the cord could be a little long.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER!! There may be some that work fine, but the one I bought BURNED OUT HUGE CHUNKS OF MY HAIR. It worked fine for a few months. I only used it a few times a week. One day it started making a loud whirring sound, and shortly after I could smell something burning. I turned off the dryer thinking there was something wrong with the fan, and when I looked down there were thick chunks of hair in my brush and on the ground where I could see that the ends had been singed off. This is clearly a defective product. There are other reviews where the dryer ACTUALLY CAUGHT ON FIRE. For your own safety stay away!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for over 3 years and it still works perfectly. No other dryer I&#x27;ve used has ever had the airflow power this one does ( I use the turbo button most of the time. High heat is very hot, Medium heat works perfectly for me, and I have very thick hair. I have used other more expensive brands as well and none have compared. I have never used the diffuser so I cannot rate that accessory.</li>
    <li> I have owned previous models of this dryer and they all have performed admirably well.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome blow dryer.  I tried buying a super, duper cheap one at a drug store.  I know better.  It only had two settings:  Burn your scalp or stand outside, it will dry quicker!  This one is light weight.  Has all the settings one could possibly need.  I like the feel of it even.  It is quite powerful as well.  Very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Faster drying without overheating one&#x27;s hair, when compared to our previous hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving these a 3/5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival.  I thought it was strange that it didn&#x27;t get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don&#x27;t want to straighten it (or when it&#x27;s humid outside).  It&#x27;s ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer because it has the three heat settings which works well for my curly hair.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel the defuser  has the potential to be a problem popping off.</li>
    <li> I was recently traveling and the hotel had this hairdryer in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s much better than the one I have at home - great controls and lots of power for a fast dry.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to find one for myself.</li>
    <li> Bought for a present..was well liked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this dryer over and over because I love it so much. I purchase it once every 6-8 years (depending on how harsh I am on it) and use it for haircare needs, crafting and grooming my furbabies! LOVE this inexpensive dryer. (Also, pay attention to the back of the dryer as it has a vent to remove  lint. If you don&#x27;t clean it out about once a week or every two weeks it will die on you!)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer puts out much warmer air than my old one.  I also like the diffuser.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer! It is so fast and dries my hair very quickly. I have very long, thick hair and this is the only blow dryer that works for me! Also, they last a LONG time! I had my last one (same kind) for almost 7 years and it worked great until its last day. It is just great.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. Dries my hair quickly</li>
    <li> Works great.  No complaints.  Fyi: I&#x27;m 28 &amp; never owned a hair dryer before so I dont have anything to compare it to.  BTW If you think it this product sucks, it doesn&#x27;t; it blows.</li>
    <li> Has all the settings I want...hot with low or high, warm with low or high, and cool with low or high speeds. The diffuser plumps my gentle curls. Turbo for a burst of extra energy and a cool button.</li>
    <li> I have had this model for many years, I ordered a replacement after my last one broke (I never really cleaned the filter). love the turbo feature and the fact that is is very lightweight (I am tiny). I never use any of the attachments, but the hairdryer itself works fine on thin hair like mine. I&#x27;ll try to keep this one clean as a whistle so it lasts for longer.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this dryer!  After using it for less than one week, the handle would become so incredibly hot I could barely hold on to it.  I noticed that the protective covering had started to dimple and come apart. I continued using it being very careful where I put my hand on the handle. Now, after less than one month, it quit working all together. It shut off after smelling very hot and will not turn back on.  Junk!</li>
    <li> Replacement dryer for the original one I broke. Love it.</li>
    <li> So far I love it, paticularly the different speeds and different heat settings.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!! Handle gets very hot after 1 month, and then it stops working.....it almost started a fire.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, not any better than other hair dryers in that price range.</li>
    <li> My old Revlon dryer died when my hair was half dry, so I quickly drove to the store and spent three minutes picking out this hair dryer. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair is extremely thick with many layers and takes a long time to dry. The turbo setting allowed me to dry my hair in almost half the time. Even better, the hair&#x27;s texture was perfect. Shiny and alive, not the texture of straw you get when the hair is over dried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic feels cheap, the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser, i feel as i may break it. The plug isn&#x27;t the most secure either, seeming to fit loosely in the socket. Despite this, it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet after about 6 months of use. If you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick.</li>
    <li> came on time and the pwer it throws out is awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do which is dry my hair. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this hair blower. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> It has several heat settings and several speeds.  The options are great!</li>
    <li> Has TWO turbo buttons.  One for cool and one for hot.  great price and love the hot burst.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good price. Just as described</li>
    <li> it started smoking and broke within 3 weeks of purchase.  It worked great...for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, fine curly hair and needed a low setting and warm air and good diffuser that won&#x27;t sit right on your hair...check, check and check. Perfect for drying while not blowing your hair around so to break the curl or cause frizz. And it&#x27;s lightweight..a real gem.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair pretty fast and leaves it bouncy!</li>
    <li> Worked great for ten whole minutes. Then, the off button stopped working. I had to unplug it to stop the motor! Wow. I&#x27;m pretty easy to please and I hate writing negative reviews - but ya&#x27;ll... THE OFF BUTTON STOPPED WORKING.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after the second use...</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer, it is very light to hold even with the large diffuser attached. The diffuser is nice and large and dries my curls with no frizz. I would definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Certainly outperforms my current blow dryers. The immediate difference is the drying time. I wouldn&#x27;t say it halves the time it takes to dry my hair, but it makes a noticeable difference. It&#x27;s also relatively quieter than my other blow dryers, though as soon as you use the &amp;#34;turbo,&amp;#34; it gets louder. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it a quiet blow dryer, but it is more comfortable to use. One odd thing, though: it seems to have a lot of suction (it&#x27;s the only one that sticks to my shirt if I get it too close), but not a very strong air flow output for the amount it seems to be drawing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4-stars so far because it&#x27;s about its price; outperforms my current blow dryers but not by a significant margin. I&#x27;ve also read numerous reviews that this doesn&#x27;t have a great product life, so I&#x27;m waiting to see about that.</li>
    <li> Smaller in size and light in weight. I ordered this to send to my mom&#x27;s house as I was going to visit her and didn&#x27;t want to pack all the hair things I use. She has a blow dryer that is circa 1980 (no power at all) and given my very long and fairly thick hair I decided to give this a shot to leave at her home for my sisters and myself to use when we visit. It&#x27;s a GREAT dryer and has a giant diffuser which is nice, but since my hair is fairly straight I didn&#x27;t use the diffuser. I highly recommend it and when my personal dryer goes I will get this for my own home use.</li>
    <li> This dryer is exactly what I wanted very lightweight and does the job</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because I wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair. This dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair. Cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier.</li>
    <li> This dryer has great air flow and heats up instantly.  The only negative is that the attachment is difficult to get onto the dryer.</li>
    <li> It works like a blow dryer. I would have loved it if it came with a focus nozzle too (I don&#x27;t know what they call it).</li>
    <li> It made my hair very puffy...very, very, way too puffy</li>
    <li> My first hairdryer, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> Great product it was everything I was looking for at a perfect price!</li>
    <li> Bargain price for a great hairdryer - several heat and speed settings, dries your hair quickly! Haven&#x27;t used the diffuser yet but it is looks good.</li>
    <li> Up until I bought this hair dryer I had only ever used a &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; type diffuser which had a tendancy to leave my hair a bit frizzy. I LOVE this hair dryer and diffuser set. The dryer has multiple speed and heat settings which is very nice. I recently cut my hair up to my shoulders and I was having a harder time keeping my natural &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; looking good. To get the best looking hair I wash my hair upside down over the edge of the tub and squeeze upwards with a towel. I then scrunch in mouse and while my head is still upside down I scruch the hair to my scalp using the diffuser. This method helps get my wavy hair into actual curls and keeps frizz to minimum.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this hair dryer was less than $20. The hot setting helps speed up my dry time (which is quite lengthy) and the cool setting helps set my bangs. The diffuser is nice and big and makes wavy days easier. A fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great on curls!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on schedule.  Have looked for several years for a decent, reasonably&lt;br /&gt;priced hairdryer which is lightweight with several heat settings, and not too loud!&lt;br /&gt;The decibel level was always the deal breaker.  Not with this Revlon hairdryer.  Very&lt;br /&gt;pleased!!</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself.  My mom used it and was amazed.  So I got her one also.  It really makes a difference.  I dye my hair a lot, and this dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like hay. Edit...looks like it barely lasted 3 years. Seems short to me...I&#x27;ve had dryers last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I love the Revlon Perfect Heat Volumizing Turbo Hair Dryer. It is lightweight to handle but a real heavyweight when it comes to getting the job done quickly and efficiently. I have carpel tunnel syndrome and this lightweight dryer has been so much better to use than my previous heavier hand held dryers. It has excellent heat and speed control options and plenty of power to dry my hair in less time. I have never used the attachment, but it is a good option to have if I ever need it.  So glad I found this dryer, just wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair very quickly, the different heat settings are wonderful! It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Light weight, dries efficiently. I reall like this dryer.</li>
    <li> Used this to replace the same type/brand of a much older hairdryer that wasn&#x27;t heating anymore. Highly recommend it as it&#x27;s easy to operate, has several heat ranges, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Love it!  great price, great value.</li>
    <li> It is great. Not too hot, light and easy to hold. Not too loud either. Cord is easy to maneuver and wrap around dryer for neat storage.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I bought this blow dryer was that my other hair dryer gave out on me and due highly to the reviews.  The positive reviews were right on with the product.  I would highly recommend this product to the 3 settings for your hair and the add-on.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer. I love it because I can get very high heat on a low or high blow setting. Also it cools down quickly on the cool air setting to lock in styles. Just enough blow power and plenty of choices for temp and speed. Easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Priced to move and relatively lightweight, easy open back to clean lint filter, but not anywhere near as hot or &amp;#34;turbo-y&amp;#34; as the dryer I&#x27;m attempting to replace, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Great power blow dryer for wonderful price.</li>
    <li> I have 3B curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots. The dryer is super lightweight and is very quite. I keep it on low and the power is still amazing, it cut my hair routine by half. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 3B curly hair.</li>
    <li> The diffuser part was very hard on the scalp.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer itself is great; but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible.  The fingers on the attachment are made of rubber and break off.</li>
    <li> junk... the diffuser does not fit on the dryer. My whole reason for purchasing this item!</li>
    <li> I use it on my curly air.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This has a lot of different drying options (cool to high heat), although it only goes from low to high on the speed. A medium speed would be great as the low is a little TOO low.</li>
    <li> My favorite. I&#x27;ve owned three of these and will buy a fourth when it dies.  My hair dryer gets a workout and last about a year. Easy to use the buttons one handed, cool medium, hot options and easy to clean lint trap.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. I needed a big diffuser for my hair. My other dryer had a wimpy sized one.  This one is perfect. Had hard time attaching the diffuser at first. But then found a little ridge inside opening of dryer end that you hook the diffuser on first. Works beautifully. There was not any instructions in the box with a hint of how to attach the diffuser. I thought it was defective. Other than that, great heat and air volume settings available.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair. The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn&#x27;t get near hot enough. She was drying her hair for</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and boy. Both of them having long hair, they took time to dry their hair after bath. Now no more wet hair. Both are enjoying it and have no complain so far. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works great, lots of settings, and it dries my thick hair in a flash. The only thing i could possibly complain about is that the diffuse can be a bit of a pain to attach to the blow dryer, but it was definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I love the number of options this dryer gives you as far as heat and intensity. The attachment is smooth and the dryer is quiet. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Here&#x27;s hoping it lives a long and service-oriented life.</li>
    <li> its just heavy and its temperature doent go high enough!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is everything that I could have expected. The diffuser is perfect for my curly hair. It dries quickly and efficiently. Plus, I love the controls. I&#x27;m 61, and my hair has become quite thin. This dryer really volumizes and gives my hair the perfect curl. A MUST buy.</li>
    <li> Dries well..fast shipping. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Amazing at first. It gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had to re-place it.</li>
    <li> All in all I think this is a very good hairdryer though I wonder if it&#x27;s unusual for it to get overly warm on the outside during use.  My last two Revlon blow dryers did not have this external heat issue.</li>
    <li> This was a great hair dryer....for 8 months.  Yesterday the heating element stopped working and now it only blows cool air.  I thought since it was a Revlon product and it wasn&#x27;t cheap that it would last for years.  I was wrong :(</li>
    <li> My hair dried in about 3 minutes, which was great.  However, if you have curly hair, you definitely have to keep it on the low setting to begin the drying process (with the diffuser), or else the curl won&#x27;t hold (because of how fast/hard the air blows on the high setting).  I really like this hair drier!</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time researching various dryers and was willing to pay around $100 to get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; one.  I was intrigued by this dryer because of the Tourmaline, Ceramic and promise to boost shine.  I was also drawn to this particular diffuser because of the long prongs.  I was turned off by the low price because I assumed it would be poor quality.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  The dryer is light weight, quieter than my former dryer and much more efficient.  I have long, curly and very thick hair.  This dries my entire head in 15 minutes without burning my hair.  My former dryer took 30 to 35 minutes and didn&#x27;t give me the shine this one does.</li>
    <li> Works good and outside stays cool.  Durable and heats and cools quickly.  Turbo mode great.  Be aware this dryer is very large.  The plastic hair thingy is a gimmick, but the dryer is good.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer, ti does the job well,  I have  not used the attachment since I have short hair, So I have to review just the hair dryer alone it&#x27;s really good, I recommend this one. Plenty of choices for air flow.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dryer by far. I have thick hair and it takes a while for it to dry this blow dryer cuts that time in half. When I&#x27;m done the finished look is amazing my hair is shiny and healthy looking I have received many compliments on how shiny my hair is. I defiantly recommend this! I am a product guru I&#x27;v tried many different straightener blows, curling irons and of-course blow dryers and I am very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!!!  It gets hot enough and blows hard enough to dry your hair quickly!!!!  My teenage girls with long hair love it too!!!!  It also lasts forever!!!!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter picked it...received it....likes it!  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> Mixed reviews here but I decided to buy it anyways. I am in love with it, the price can&#x27;t be beat and I&#x27;m mainly using it for the diffuser which dries my hair faster and it looks wonderful</li>
    <li> Dries my thick hair quickly and makes it really smooth! Awesome!</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift&lt;br /&gt;and the person really likes this</li>
    <li> I like how big the diffuser head is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve traditionally purchased Conair brand hair dryers (most recently, the Conair Eco Hair Dryer, which no longer appears to be available).  I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button and also using the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer&#x27;s nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn&#x27;t really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).  I was able to clean the filter and put the back back on, and now it comes off easily with a slight turn clockwise.  Still very happy with this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Heavier and Bulkier than my previous blow dryer. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this blow dryer pictured and the one I received was a blue and black one. There was nothing on the page when I ordered that said they could come in different colors so I was very disappointed. The blow dryer itself is fine I just don&#x27;t think they should send a different color than pictured.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good option for my curly hair and found it. Great product. Came in super fast</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer at a great price.  My wife already had this one and has been using it for several years.. So when my other brand hair dryer died, I bought this one and so far so good.  I have been using it for about 3 months now.</li>
    <li> Returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best. I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn&#x27;t buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Works just like it should.</li>
    <li> Works well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. A little quieter than many other hair dryers, but not exactly silent. The switches are a bit slippery-- fingers may just slide over them without changing the switch position.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price. Not the strongest blow but good enough for me. I love that is super light so I don&#x27;t get so tired drying my hair. I like also that it includes an attachment.</li>
    <li> I have very curly and voluminous hair and this dryer was my best investment. I usually dry my hair on high/cold and it takes less than 10 minutes which saves me time and energy. I also use the dryer when i want to straighten my hair and it&#x27;s amazing and dries my hair in rollers really fast.</li>
    <li> Wanted a bowl diffuser to dry my curly hair and this is great at a good price.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for me.  A good price, and reasonable quality.</li>
    <li> Hardly any power. Should have returned it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hair dryer becaus it fits well in the hand and it has a turbo dry button.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had.  The price is great too.  This is my second one after having the first one for many years.  Because I was so happy with it I had to get the same one.  I trust Revlon as a good brand name.</li>
    <li> I actually got this for a second home, but I like it so much that I kept this one for home. Great power, easy settings, lightweight and comfortable to hold!</li>
    <li> Love the varying speeds and temperatures. Diffuser piece keeps my curls nice and stable.</li>
    <li> While staying in a motel I used this and fell in love! My hair comes out smoother.. love the multiple settings.. this works so well I purchased a second for when my new one wears out!!! Good blow dryers are hard to come by.</li>
    <li> best ever.  we have owned 2.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great buy for the money.  Has 3 different speeds and 3 different heat options.  Diffuser is enormous though</li>
    <li> Love this dryer!  Lightweight, dries quickly, and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic blow dryer! The diffuser worked really well to form my curls and I love the varying temperature and speed options. However, this is only getting 3 stars because the switch to turn the blow dryer to low or high power is extremely hard to push up. I actually had to use force on mine to get it to move. I&#x27;m not sure if everyone had this problem but I will give it a few more tries to work it in, if it doesn&#x27;t work then I will have to return it.</li>
    <li> To me a dryer is a dryer, but when it came time for a new one, I decided to so with Revlon. On Amazon it&#x27;s so much cheaper than in stores!! By like $10 - $15!! It works great!! Best dryer I have ever used!! And the defuser works awesome!!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as her old hair dryer stopped working. We&#x27;ve had it for a while now, and she says it&#x27;s one of the best hair dryers she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Quiet. Multiple settings. Lightweight.  Easy to handle.  I liked the one at home so much that I bought two more for guest baths.</li>
    <li> Gf loved it! Uses it constantly.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, light-weight &amp; easy to hold. My one complaint is that the diffuser was quite difficult to attach &amp; the instructions did not mention how to attach it. I had to read other reviewer comments for advice.</li>
    <li> Pro: it has a very fast Cool cycle - something I&#x27;ve always wished for in other dryers. Cons: The controls are very difficult for me to work with the machine running - the placement is maybe made for a bigger hand, but I can&#x27;t reach the cool button comfortably when I&#x27;m using my right hand. The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I tried attaching the concentrator  from my Revlon dryer that just stopped working, and it doesn&#x27;t fit. (Shouldn&#x27;t they be universal?) Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging after I checked to make sure it worked upon delivery. Otherwise I would return it.</li>
    <li> For under 20 bucks, it’s a decent dryer. I needed something in a pinch and purchased this dryer as it had plenty of high reviews. I had previously had a professional dryer which I needed to replace ( it was $150) and wanted to see if the cost of this dryer was really worth it…now I am convinced it is. While this dryer works, it’s really like comparing a Geo Metro to a Bentley. I will be buying the $150 dryer after using this for week and being very underwhelmed. But like I said, for under $20, at least it got me through the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser stays on nicely&lt;br /&gt;Has multiple heat and speed settings&lt;br /&gt;Low speed is gentle enough for fragile styles&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;This may be just mine, but the motor seems to really struggle/vibrate a bit more when it is not upright. Being that I have curly hair, I use the dryer at different angles. This dryer vibrates a bit more when I flip my head and tilt the dryer sideways.&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever for my hair to dry.. and I have fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is the length in the description, but it feels too short. I prefer 6-9 feet so I don’t need to stand right by the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap – does not feel like it will last too long</li>
    <li> Due to a medical condition we have to dry our baby&#x27;s hair at bedtime, and this has worked great for us for that purpose for a couple of months now.  It is rare to find a dryer that has a very low heat setting (rather than just cold) as well as a low flow setting.  This is really flexible in that regard, and especially with the diffuser fitted it is very mild and gentle on the lowest settings and has worked great for us.</li>
    <li> Great buy, fast shipping, didn&#x27;t have to leave the house, works perfectly</li>
    <li> It never worked. Not dual voltage as it is said to be. Will never buy any electric item from Amazon again. Epic waste of my money</li>
    <li> Drys my thick hair fast!!</li>
    <li> Good, basic dryer. Liking it a lot.</li>
    <li> I waited until I used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review.  I have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week.  So far this hair drying has held up very well.  It&#x27;s light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous Revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use.  I don&#x27;t use the diffuser because it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my board straight hair.  For the money this is an excellent dryer.</li>
    <li> Everything is working well. No problems after a month. Happy with everything.</li>
    <li> Amazing product works great for naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer.  It&#x27;s the 4th one that I&#x27;ve bought over several years.</li>
    <li> This is a really good dryer. I have had it for five months, and it works well. I wish it was higher powered, but I wouldn&#x27;t return it!</li>
    <li> This dryer is powerful but light weight and easy to handle.  The diffuser is large and the settings make styling easy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been more than a year since I made this purchase (dropped it a few times) and the dryer works like new.</li>
    <li> this is a good dryer with nice attachments...very light and powerful. The only drawback is the switches. If your hand has any mousse or oil on them, forget turning this on without a struggle. The switches have no grip nor heavy grooves on them that make turning on/off easy. But, overall good.</li>
    <li> A hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t catch my hair in it and makes my hair look so full</li>
    <li> I really like all the settings this hair dryer offers. It&#x27;s also very aesthetically pleasing. I like the attachment and I like that the dryer feels sturdy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this dryer. Fast drying and makes my hair shiny and  feels  soft after drying. I do color my hair so I am pleased with this dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer certainly does everything that a dryer should.  It&#x27;s light-weight, powerful and relatively quiet.  I do have a gripe, however...the control buttons on the handle are slide mechanisms that regulate on/off and temperatures.  Unfortunately, they are slippery plastic with almost no traction designed into the surface.  My fingers are always damp from the shower and my wet hair, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to turn this thing on and off at the first try.  Aggravating!</li>
    <li> I love the heat and volume controls  - a great hair dryer - and it is relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> Lots of power for a little dryer!</li>
    <li> Excellent light hairdryer. This is great for curly hair as it is no an ion dryer which straightens hair. It is hard to find a non-ion dryer. This dryer also holds up well for years.</li>
    <li> Good dryer at good price.</li>
    <li> Nice and lightweight!</li>
</ol>
