    <li> good for a quik after lunch clean up at work or little touch up just before a meeting.  the taste does not interfer with most beverages or snacks.  wish it had single blisters for easier in pocket carry.  pick can be a bit hard for the more sensitive.</li>
    <li> For instance, when you&#x27;ve been visiting and you&#x27;re traveling home at night and the kids are all going to fall asleep in the backseat and you don&#x27;t want them to go to bed with unbrushed teeth.</li>
    <li> These are great to keep in your desk for after lunch or in your purse for anytime.  There are plenty of foods/drinks/coffee that make your breath not so great or have an all day long taste that a mint or tictac just briefly over shadows.  This allows a fully clean scrub your teeth kind of clean that can&#x27;t be acquired without a toothbrush.    However, why does Amazon only have cinnamon?  I would think the most popular would be a toothpaste flavor like the peppermint or spearmint(thought I&#x27;m not a fan of spearmint).</li>
    <li> All my family likes this item. We carry it for travel, work, college and school. Very good.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I will continue to buy, very handy while traveling, easy to carry in your carry-on luggage, use once and throw it away. I like the fact that each \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; is individually wrapped so you know that each brush is sanitary.</li>
    <li> I bought this same package when it included 32 brushes a few weeks ago. They&#x27;ve left the price the same and are giving you only 16 brushes now. It says the brushes are 30 cents each but if you do the math, they are twice that - 60 cents each. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my desk at work because I&#x27;m too busy to go brush my teeth during the middle of the day.  If my lunch is haunting me after a few glasses of water, these get me by until I am able to go home and brush.  I also keep a pack in my purse for when I&#x27;m out, because I don&#x27;t carry a toothbrush with me normally.</li>
    <li> Does what its intended to do, my only problem with it(as with any disposable product) is that its wasteful. Not good for the environment if used regularly, but great for the teeth</li>
    <li> Who ever invented these is a genius. One side keeps your teeth well brushed and the other keeps stuff from between your teeth.</li>
    <li> colgate wisp are great for brushing and flossing on the go.  its a mini brush with freshing beads.  theres no water or rinsing necessary.  single use only.  comes in 3 flavors peppermint spearmint and cinnamint. find in your oral care aisle.  recommened for brushing on the go.</li>
    <li> I saw the new Colgate Wisp little toothbrushes and gave one a try. It&#x27;s 10 minutes after I used one and my mouth still feels minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting product. Each little toothbrush (they&#x27;re about three inches long) comes individually wrapped. The idea is not to use with water. The small brush is made of flexible plastic bristles, and it&#x27;s got this tiny little bead in the center. The bead is kind of like a miniature mint candy that doesn&#x27;t get all sudsy or anything. It&#x27;s like a little balled up piece of one of those dissolvable mint breath strips or a tiny piece of a Life Saverish mint. You rub the bristles and bead over your teeth then toss the thing in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wouldn&#x27;t it have just been easier to pop a [[ASIN:B001872OHG Tic Tac]] or one of those [[ASIN:B00153BDH0 Listerine Cool Mint Breath Strips]] versus trying to find a discrete place to give my teeth a quick brush???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the question is not do you think your breath could use a little freshening but do you find yourself with something stuck in your teeth very often? If you suffer from the latter, then these little Colgate Wisp toothbrushes are your aspirin to a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, on the other hand, prefer the old fashioned hit the restroom after dinner on a night out and look in the mirror. Something in my teeth? Use a paper towel (or use my tongue...ewww) to get it out then pop a mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me that if you happen to be out clubbin&#x27; or somewhere dark where there were some nice tasty spinach snacks that might leave something behind in your teeth, that having a Colgate Wisp might come in handy if you get in a moment where you must immediately brush your teeth. But in my experience, pulling out a toothbrush and giving myself a quick once-over would scare away most hot blondes, not make them say, \\&quot;Ooh, I gotta get some of that clean mouth!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed the promotion that runs when you bring up the Colgate Wisp web site seems to be targeting exactly the clubbin&#x27; crowd. And hey, I still do a club every now and then. But I think I&#x27;ll just stick to mints.xactly the clubbin&#x27; crowd. And hey, I still do a club every now and then. But I think I&#x27;ll just stick to mints.</li>
    <li> I love keeping a few of these in my purse and in my desk drawer at work.  Carrying a toothbrush in my purse is not appealing but this is super easy and works well.</li>
    <li> Basically a mini toothbrush with a blue alien fish egg in the middle filled with minty freshness. The opposite end has a flexible point that serves like a toothpick while overall it&#x27;s about as long as my middle finger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I Could not open the package until I spotted the pull tab. They should really make this more obvious. Even then, you have to fish the thing out, a two handed job. Could the packaging be bigger and waste more plastic please? They&#x27;re packaged two in one blister so with this much space I could actually store a travel toothbrush and a travel toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) They say that you don&#x27;t need a sink or water, but my experience was that after I was done using it, you have enough saliva from the minty capsule that you really want some place to spit and rinse. You also have to be careful about how you hold it when using it, otherwise you end up with saliva on your hands. Now you show up to your meeting with fresh breath....and sticky hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Brush is way too small (smaller than my pinky nail) so it takes a while to get good coverage - oh yeah, also those bristles are STIFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Iffy ergonomics - it&#x27;s small, remember? Oh, now it&#x27;s covered with your spit, so kind of slippery too. There&#x27;s a groove to help prevent it rotating in your fingers but it does take some coordination and attention to use properly. Forget about using it while driving. If you try to use this after a late night at the bar - you&#x27;ll probably drop it on the floor, and that puddle isn&#x27;t beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) This product wastes a reasonable amount of plastic with each use. Of course this might be a positive if you are an environazi hatin&#x27; SUV driver and want to freshen up after eating your BK double cheeseburger with beef from clear cut rainforest...;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this four times I decided the only advantage this has is that it&#x27;s smaller (not by much) than the smallest travel toothbrushes and you don&#x27;t have to carry around any toothpaste - you can also use those without a sink if you have a kleenex to spit into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I recommend the Oral B Brush-Ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000296Z08 Oral B Brush-Ups Textured Teeth Wipes, 3 Wipes]]&lt;br /&gt;These are textured sleeves which fit over your finger, impregnated with minty freshness.

    <li> These are great! I keep some in my purse and travel bag for that &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; time when I feel like there&#x27;s spinach in my teeth.  Also good for general freshening -- when you can&#x27;t use your regular toothbrush -- makes my mouth feel clean and my teeth smooth. I love the Cinnamon taste!</li>
    <li> Favorite flavor but hard to find. Can&#x27;t find them in my area!!  Good for a quick refresher after lunch to go back to work</li>
    <li> What can I say? I travel with Wisp. They are great for a quick pick me up. No more excuses. Brush those pearlies!!</li>
    <li> I keep these in my desk at work for after lunch or just to freshen up.  My dentist has noticed, my last visit lasted about 4 minutes, there wasn&#x27;t even a need to clean.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this flavor in the store &amp; then they stopped carrying it. I tried the other flavors &amp; thought they were awful...not a big fan of mint.</li>
    <li> This item is great if you are out and need to brush your teeth after a snack it works and makes your mouth cleaner</li>
    <li> It is a great product and a good flavor I have been used it for a long time and it is really good specially when I&#x27;m not at home</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and will buy more.  I love the quality of the product and it is exactly what I wanted.  Everyone should buy this it is worth the money Love it</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with stubborn plaque..tarter . No matter what kind of brush I used it just didnt seem to get it all. By mistake, while on a camping trip, I used one of these little desposible  WISP brushes . WOW. My teeth instantly felt clean when I touched them with my tongue and on the entire camping trip my teeth stayed clean of plaque. I have been using them on a regular basis now. They are disposible but I keep them clean after  each use and can use a brush for 3 or 4 uses. Even my dentist says he sees a remarkable difference in the condition of my teeth. I still use my regular brush but use these little WISP brushes once a day. Maybe its because of the hardness of the bristles and the design but they work exceptially well to get out the most stubborn of built up plaque and tarter. I hear that the product has been discontinued and for that I am sad...they are great !</li>
