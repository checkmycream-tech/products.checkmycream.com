      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it and bought 2 in case it is discontinued.</li>
      <li>Great Brush!  </li>
      <li>This is a great brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for teasing your hair or smoothing it out.  </li>
      <li>Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my fine hair...</li>
      <li>I bought the brush pictured about 8 years ago or so and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It was new and in excellent condition.</li>
      <li>It is a very strong, sturdy brush.</li>
      <li>Also it does not create static electricity.  </li>
      <li>However, it is very effective for natural hair (also).</li>
      <li>The Goody Full size hair brush is nothing like the pecture, which is what I based my order on!</li>
      <li>The handle is is curved ergonomically and it is easy to hold so you can achieve your desired</li>
      <li>When I opened my goody brush it was broke and feels so cheap.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>So when this brush began to deteriorate I was so happy to have found the exact same one right here.  </li>
      <li>This is the best brush for African American hair.</li>
      <li>It is not made from boar or the other materials that are more popular.</li>
      <li>I was trying to replace an old Goody hairbrush that I really love, but is falling apart.  </li>
      <li>Great after teasing hair and smoothing it down!!</li>
      <li>Thanks Goody and Amazon!</li>
      <li>Broke the first time i tried to use it.</li>
      <li>These brushes last so long, are sturdy, detangle nicely (wavy hair) while stimulating the scalp to promote hair growth!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush, but IS made of nylon bristles which do not go well with my fine thin hair.....</li>
      <li>This hair brush is really unusual.</li>
      <li>This bristles in this one is made from plastic, but it really brushes the front of my hair very neatly.</li>
      <li>I think this brush is very expensve for what it is.  </li>
      <li>But what really bothers me</li>
      <li>gentle, does not pull.  </li>
      <li>the most is that the photograph displayed on Amazon wasn&#x27;t clear enough for me to distinguish the fact that the bristles were not bristles, but plastic spears which rip and tear at your hair.  </li>
      <li>The 3 other brushes were fine.</li>
      <li>The entire group of bristles came off right after I stroked my hair with it.</li>
      <li>My first goody brush last for 20+ yrs.</li>
      <li>plz don&#x27;t buy this cheap piece of shit.</li>
      <li>so naturally I wanted another Goody.  </li>
      <li>The one I received is all black and the bristles are quite harder than the original, making for a less comfortable brushing experience.  </li>
      <li>Not pink, but I&#x27;ll get used to it.  </li>

    <li> I received my brush today july 8th 2013. When I opened my goody brush it was broke and feels so cheap. I tried putting it back together but no luck. plz don&#x27;t buy this cheap piece of shit. 7 bucks what the hell was i thinking.</li>
    <li> I think this brush is very expensve for what it is.  THe plastic is cheap, it is uncomfortable to hold.  But what really bothers me the most is that the photograph displayed on Amazon wasn&#x27;t clear enough for me to distinguish the fact that the bristles were not bristles, but plastic spears which rip and tear at your hair.  What we have here is a very expensive dog brush!</li>
    <li> I was trying to replace an old Goody hairbrush that I really love, but is falling apart.  This is not quite the same, but came closer than several other brushes of other brands I&#x27;ve purchased recently.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for African American hair. My first goody brush last for 20+ yrs. I actually still have it as a back up. I can&#x27;t seem to find these in the store anymore. I emailed Goody and they ignored me, as to why they no longer stock these type of brushes. I should have looked for another brand, but I found this on here. It was new and in excellent condition. It is a very strong, sturdy brush. It is impossible to break it.....</li>
    <li> I have always used a goody brush, I even kept one until the bristles began to fall out.  And that was only because I could find another brush that compared to it for me.  I finally found it here! Thanks Goody and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this package of 3 to have at least for the next 6 years or so!  These brushes last so long, are sturdy, detangle nicely (wavy hair) while stimulating the scalp to promote hair growth!  Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought the brush pictured about 8 years ago or so and loved it.  It&#x27;s perfect for my fine hair... gentle, does not pull.  Also it does not create static electricity.  It&#x27;s great for teasing your hair or smoothing it out.  So when this brush began to deteriorate I was so happy to have found the exact same one right here.  HOWEVER,,,,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive the brush pictured.  The one I received is all black and the bristles are quite harder than the original, making for a less comfortable brushing experience.  It&#x27;s usable but it is NOT the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, the hunt for the brush pictured begins again.  Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> These bristles will never fall apart nor wear out. Plus, will never mistreat your hair! I usually &amp; accidentally misplace mine every few years. I hope they never stop making these.</li>
    <li> This hair brush is really unusual. It is not made from boar or the other materials that are more popular. This bristles in this one is made from plastic, but it really brushes the front of my hair very neatly. I have thick hair and at first when I looked at it I though, oh no I have bought another wig brush. However, it is very effective for natural hair (also). The handle is is curved ergonomically and it is easy to hold so you can achieve your desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it and bought 2 in case it is discontinued.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too flexible.  I expected them to be stiffer.  When I blow dry my hair the brush doesn&#x27;t hold onto my hair.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I thought it would be, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; Goody hair brush, this is it. I guess they went out with the eight-track tape cartridges.</li>
    <li> One out of the four brushes was defective. The entire group of bristles came off right after I stroked my hair with it. I tried setting it back but to no avail. It needs to be glued or something. The 3 other brushes were fine. I&#x27;d give this a 3.5 stars review. Thank you and have a pleasant day ahead.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected and can not use it for daily use for my hair texture.....that is all.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time i tried to use it. The bristles are hard plastic, def not intended to be a smoothing brush.</li>
    <li> By looking at the picture I thought this was going to be like our current Goodys brush with the hard bristles but when it arrived it had the flimsy plastic ones that do not work well on my childrens hair at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased a similar Goody brush about 18 years ago for my daughters to use.  They didn&#x27;t like it, but I did.  It is pink and white, but I have used it all this time.  I am still using it but needed a second brush so naturally I wanted another Goody.  I was not disappointed.  Great Brush!  Well made.  Not pink, but I&#x27;ll get used to it.  Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today. The Goody Full size hair brush is nothing like the pecture, which is what I based my order on! I am a long time Amazon customer and this just irks me! It will probably be my last order.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. I Can&#x27;t find this brush anyware else. Great after teasing hair and smoothing it down!!</li>
    <li> Terrible .This broke within 4 days of using!!!!</li>
    <li> Was not as I expected, but after looking at the description again, I could understand why. It&#x27;s a nice brush, but IS made of nylon bristles which do not go well with my fine thin hair.....shipping costs were to costly to return. Plus, I had just not read the description correctly. I just keep it around for when company or my grandkids come to visit.</li>
