      <li>good for brush cleaning</li>

      <li>Easy to use, stays where you put it.</li>
      <li>Not so great with larger ones.</li>

      <li>Hard to clean large brushes.</li>
      <li>a little small but great to use for smaller brushes</li>
      <li>Way to little and doesn&#x27;t clean all the way</li>

    <li> Falsely advertised. Comes with two mini pads advertised as facial scrubbers.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of this product....but its way too small and made of gel so not sturdy enough to really clean brushes except small eyeshadow brushes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit small but works great. Works well for small brushes. Not so great with larger ones.</li>

    <li> Got here sooner than expected, good product</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to wash my gel liner brush!  Like it</li>
    <li> I am a pro makeup artist and I have used different types of brush cleaners. I expected this product to be bigger. The description does not state the size. The size of this brush cleaner is comparable to 2 quaters placed side by side. Its hard to clean bigger powder brushes with this product, it works ok with eyeshadow brushes.</li>
    <li> pad seems much larger in picture but it is even smaller than the pad that comes with the L&#x27;oreal face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Not good for brush cleaning</li>
    <li> Much much smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Does the job but too small. Hand cramps after a while of holding it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay I could&#x27;ve lived without it.</li>
    <li> I thought the cleaning bristles would be stiffer for better cleaning.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, stays where you put it. Cleans the brushes exactly as it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter a pink pad at Sephora.  I wanted my son to have a pad too.  He loves cleaning his teenage face with this soft and unique product.  I like how the pad stays clean use after use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a convenient travel size. You can easily store it in your makeup bag. The color is just as it is shown in the picture. I think it&#x27;s great and would recommend it to anyone looking for something to clean makeup brushes with.</li>
    <li> I wish it was a little bigger but it works great and keeps my brushes clean and ready for use!!</li>
    <li> perfect for deep cleaning all of your makeup brushes with out getting the ferrel wet</li>
    <li> This brush is very tiny and really doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Works great, could have been bigger and would have been perfect!</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> This product is okay.  It is a lot smaller then what it appears to be in the picture. My hands grew so tired from trying to hold this and wash my brushes against it, because of its micro size. If I had known, I may not have bought this.  It works though, just a tad too small.</li>
    <li> The size of it was a shuck to me. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s enough to clean brushes and lasting for a long time.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger but it works very well and makes cleaning my brushes way easier.</li>
    <li> Smaller than what i expect however its good</li>
    <li> This product is sooooo much smaller than what it looks like in the pictures but got the job done and cut my brush cleaning time in half so I&#x27;ll overlook the size.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of women are disappointed... maybe it&#x27;s because this product was originally created in Asia years ago as a skin cleaning pad. I purchased one over 10 years ago at a local drugstore in Hawaii.  This company is just marketing as a brush cleaning mitt/pad.</li>
    <li> I was terribly disappointed when I received this product! It is extremely small, to the point that it feels lost in the palm of your hand. Very uncomfortable to use.......</li>
    <li> I really like how my skin feels and looks while using this cleaning pad. I&#x27;ve bought several for gifts.</li>
    <li> this little guy just cut my brush cleaning time in half... LOVE IT! don&#x27;t be fooled by over priced products! this works just as good!</li>
    <li> Its a good product for cheap but I&#x27;d recommend getting a bigger one its small.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use with a solid cleaner.  It gets my brushes so clean.  I clean them weekly now.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this. I thought it was bigger.</li>
    <li> This is not for cleaning your make up brushes. It&#x27;s a face cleansing brush</li>
    <li> the size was deceiving when order was placed and poor quality - did not expect what I received</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the quality, quite disappointed actually. Very flimsy, not at all sturdy, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This brush cleaning pad, a product I was previously unfamiliar with, is very small &amp; it seems larger sizes are not available. It is fine for cleaning very small brushes , like for ute-liner &amp; possibly smaller eyeshadow brushes  but would not clean anything larger. If you want an inexpensive, small, brush cleaner, then this is the one. But in no way will it clean any medium to large brushes. Please note the dimensions.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. It works so well to clean brushes quickly and thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Way to little and doesn&#x27;t clean all the way</li>
    <li> I just received this product and it was amazing. It is definitely a little bit smaller than the picture. I anticipated it to be a bit bigger, but the smaller size was not a problem. The color is more of a light blue than lavender in my opinion, but I don&#x27;t really mind the color. This product works very well I was able to clean all 20 brushes in under 10 minutes. It saves a lot of time. The best way to use it in my opinion is to put the suction end in between your middle and ring finger and hold the pad in your palm as it provides for the best grip for your brushes. The product arrived earlier than the expected delivery date and I as so excited to use it!</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s about 1/3 the size of my palm. I was expecting at least for it to be the size of my whole palm. It works fine (on small brushes) I suppose, not so much on medium to large brushes though. Color is the same as shown. Just wish it was a little bigger</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good but the size of the pad is much smaller than I expected. Would be nice to know how big it is. Hard to clean large brushes.</li>
    <li> Did not realize how small this is</li>
    <li> a little small but great to use for smaller brushes</li>
