<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The bottom of the water chamber came off while cleaning.  They are not meant to be taken off and cannot be replaced by consumers.  It was a little old so I was not surprised.  The replacement fit perfectly.  If the CPAP machine continues to operate properly I would not hate to re-order one of these water chambers should I have a replay.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my machine!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works, and it doesn&#x27;t leak yet.  I can&#x27;t explain why my original Water chamber developed a leak at the bottom where the heat transfer plate is, so I replaced it with this unit..</li>
    <li> Everything was as pictured. Great delivery time.</li>
    <li> The lid won&#x27;t close and stay shut.  So I had to go back to my old chamber and lid.  I bought them together so they would fit together.  Not happy!</li>

    <li> And priced well to boot.  Would buy again.  It&#x27;s always nice to have a backup, so I bought two.  Nice.</li>
    <li> We found this product to work well for us. It is easy to clean. it is very helpful to be able to order direct.</li>
