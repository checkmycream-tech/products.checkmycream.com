<li> Usually buyfrom Nantucket site, but got a real deal from Amazon.</li>
<li> A bath or shower is not complete with out applying my powder after each.</li>
<li> soft, delicate, long lasting.</li>
<li> guess it doesn&#x27;t show the merchant so I&#x27;ll add that now along with an update that I received a rude short reply regarding my shipping issue.</li>
<li> Because I guess common sense wouldn&#x27;t be enough to know</li>
<li> The powder is in a cardboard container...and it was shipped in a slightly bubbled plastic bag.  </li>
<li> I was not familiar with the scent</li>
<li> When I opened the bag, the bottom had been broken and powder spilled into the bag.  </li>
<li> a thin cardboard container would not ship well the way they packaged it.  </li>

    <li> the smell was as I remembered. soft, delicate, long lasting. Yes, I would say anyone would be delighted with this powder.  Wish they had the sachet packets and the incense again. Loved, loved, loved them</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Just love the aroma. Usually buyfrom Nantucket site, but got a real deal from Amazon. Body products are a matter of personal taste, so I would just purchase this for someone I knew loved it.</li>
    <li> An old favorite - classical!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product as a gift for my grandmother for the holidays and she absolutely loved it! Everything came as described.</li>
    <li> almost like a baby powder meets the beach scent. Very clean and calming, nice to sprinkle on sheets and pillowcases also!</li>
    <li> I rely on this product as a part of my daily ritual. A bath or shower is not complete with out applying my powder after each. It leaves me feeling fresh and feeling clean and smelling pretty.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent.  I will continue to purchase in the future.  It&#x27;s the only powder I use.</li>
    <li> I love this dusting powder.  It makes me feel very elegant!</li>
    <li> Nantucket Briar has always been one of my favorite scents.  Love being able to get it without having to go to the mall</li>
    <li> Have used Crabtree and Evelyn products for many years. Somewhat pricey but good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent.  I was not familiar with the scent so I will still use on occasion.  Thanks</li>
    <li> A lovely container and a nice scent that is not over powering. A good size. Very enjoyable. Also makes a lovely gift.</li>
    <li> I received it as a gift in the past and really loved the scent. I tried to find it locally and couldn&#x27;t so I ordered it and am very pleased to have it  again</li>
    <li> Favorite fragrance...</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. Anything Crabtree &amp; Evelyn is great! I save the puffs just as a sachet, it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this powder. It has the most awesome fragrance and is silky smooth on your skin.  It makes you feel fresher, longer.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am available for commercials!</li>
    <li> The powder is in a cardboard container...and it was shipped in a slightly bubbled plastic bag.  When I opened the bag, the bottom had been broken and powder spilled into the bag.  When I submitted a request for a refund...I was asked for a picture of the damages.  Because I guess common sense wouldn&#x27;t be enough to know a thin cardboard container would not ship well the way they packaged it.  Really???  Love the powder scent...but I won&#x27;t ever order from this place again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it doesn&#x27;t show the merchant so I&#x27;ll add that now along with an update that I received a rude short reply regarding my shipping issue. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this powder or anything else from Freightfreebeauty.</li>
    <li> Love the entire Nantucket Briar line!</li>
    <li> I purchased this body powder for my mother. It&#x27;s her favorite and has a soft clean fragrance. It is a much silkier powder than the same body powder in the cardboard shaker container. An outstanding product!</li>
    <li> Silky smooth, lightly scented and perfect after bathing.  I even puff a bit on my sheets to freshen them!</li>
    <li> I am just over the moon with this powder but I can not believe that it has a price tag of $41.00 which is double what the crabtree charges. Other then that I love it. When I get out of the shower I but it on and I feel and smell great. I have been using this powder for&lt;br /&gt;3 years now. My family know to give me it for my birthday and Xmas. I will be buying at the crabtree store.</li>
    <li> Been loving this powder for 20 years!  Fresh and clean scent!</li>
    <li> I have been buying Nantucket Briar Scented powder, sprays, etc for years.  Everyone that smells it buys it, it&#x27;s the most pleasant scent for all.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This powder has a great scent.  I also have the perfume that goes with it and I love both of them, although the perfume can tend to be overpowering if you use too much, not so with the powder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for body power for quite a while.  My favorite scent is hard to find.  I tried this and fell in love.  Not too strong or overpowering.  Great after a shower.  Everyone I know loves the scent.</li>
    <li> Nantucket Briar is my favorite fragrance! I have asthma and can&#x27;t tolerate most fragrances. Iwas so glad to find this fragrance in so many products. I have the room spray and body lotion, also.</li>
