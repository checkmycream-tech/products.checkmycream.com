### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stock pile this conditioner since I&#x27;ve experienced the heartbreak of loving a product</li>
      <li>so I knew I was getting a good rinse</li>
      <li>Good description.</li>
      <li>but I never bother and my hair is lovely!</li>
      <li>Love your hair!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s better for the environment!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!     </li>
      <li>I tried to, just out of my own frugality, but 1/3 of the way through, and I can&#x27;t go another day feeling like I washed my hair in butter.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, if I could, I would give this no stars.</li>
      <li>and I could tell that there seemed to be some kind of coating or film on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the benefits.</li>
      <li>hopefully, garnier will revamp because eco friendly is a great idea.</li>
      <li>It has a very strong scent which reminds me of Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
      <li>I have liked most of the fructis shampoos and conditioners and 2, I liked that it was environmentally friendly.  </li>
      <li>When washing with conditioner, allow it about 5 minutes to soak in and focus more on your scalp than your length.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I have been buying Garnier Fructise conditioners for years now, and have always been pleased with the result.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to see the commercials for an eco friendly option.</li>
      <li>Nothing spectacular but not bad either.</li>
      <li>I was excited to find a more eco-friendly product, so I tried it.  </li>
      <li>Rinse thoroughly for 3-5 minutes with warm to hot water.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is fine, no problem with how it lathered or made my hair feel.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what everyone&#x27;s problem is, but this conditioner is working fine for me.</li>
      <li>For this, I would give it a 1/5 except that it doesn&#x27;t matter to me since I never brush soaked hair and it was fine when just damp.     Softness when hair dries:</li>
      <li>The shampoo is fine.</li>
      <li>Medium length, fine and wavy  </li>
      <li>When you wash it out of your hair, you don&#x27;t feel that silky smooth feeling...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather go conditioner free than ever use this again.</li>
      <li>This conditioner, which is silicone free, was used to cowash my hair.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good enough to buy more than once.</li>
      <li>I bought this as a curiousity - a bio friendly conditioner.</li>
      <li>I got really excited when Garnier announced their line and rushed out to buy it.  </li>
      <li>when I took it out of the pony tail, it felt a lot better than the first night</li>
      <li>Today I switched to Pantene Aqua Light (still in quest of a lightweight shampoo and conditioner combo), and it feels nice and soft.</li>
      <li>It rinsed out clean.</li>
      <li>yet they also clean out your hair just as well.</li>
      <li>I tried the product on three separate occasions just to be sure before I threw the whole bottle in the trash where it belongs.</li>
      <li>Texture of conditioner: creamy and much thicker than most &#x27;cone-free conditioners.</li>
      <li>I also had high hopes for this conditioner and even suffered through a whole month of using it just to see if it would get better!  </li>
      <li>When your hair gets greasy during your first month or so of CO, use a boar bristle brush to distribute it and appreciate your sebum instead of attacking it!     </li>
      <li>Like I&#x27;m not crazy.</li>
      <li>I switch brands and types of hair care products fairly frequently and am usually mostly satisfied but this \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; was not at all conditioning.</li>
      <li>There is a distinct smell</li>
      <li>Overall, the product is nice and I&#x27;ll probably buy it again instead of another brand to try.</li>
      <li>My hair is so greasy right now</li>
      <li>Again, I can wear it in the wind and a quick, gentle brush through resolves everything.</li>
      <li>First, let me point out that I do not use shampoo and haven&#x27;t used shampoo for 6 months.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money, and do not use it, even if it&#x27;s free.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
      <li>at first some of the reviews made me want to just return the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not one to write reviews for often, but I&#x27;m pretty astonished by this conditioner.</li>
      <li>Not a perfect conditioner but still awesome!     </li>
      <li>you could actually make your hair more tangled.    </li>
      <li>At first I had dandruff from it but nothing a boar bristle brush couldn&#x27;t resolve.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never reviewed a beauty product before, but there&#x27;s a first time for everything.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just me, but these other reviews have made me feel much better!  </li>
      <li>I have normal hair, nothing out of the ordinary, but I take great pride in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have straight relatively healthy asian hair - not dyed not permed.    </li>
      <li>I also avoid curlers, blow-dryers, etc. and style my hair in an easy Chinese bun with a hair stick if I have to go somewhere.</li>
      <li>My hair is healthy and nice enough that I can go two or three days of neglecting it completely and wearing it down, even in the wind, without needing a wash.     </li>
      <li>I normally have oily hair too, so that is very unusual.  </li>
      <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought such a huge bottle.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair feel very waxy, and I could tell from the moment I put it in my hair in the shower that it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m throwing out the whole bottle.</li>
      <li>But then I noticed my hair seemed really greasy.  </li>
      <li>, I blow it straight, with bangs, and I don&#x27;t use hair color.</li>
      <li>The conditioner I don&#x27;t really care for, however.</li>
      <li>but when I tried this Pure Clean Shampoo and Conditioner I DEFINITELY saw a difference.</li>
      <li>At first I thought maybe I&#x27;d done a poor job of washing it and made a point to wash it very well (with the Pure Clean shampoo, which I don&#x27;t really have a problem with although it&#x27;s not my favorite).  </li>
      <li>Overall my hair came out feeling clean and my curls were well defined.</li>
      <li>I put my flat-ironed hair up in a pony tail because it wasn&#x27;t going to look good left down.</li>
      <li>When rubbing in the conditioner, make sure you get it all the way down to your scalp but put it in as though you are using your fingernails to brush your hair.</li>
      <li>I noticed at first that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft as normal and figured it must have been the lack of silicone.  </li>
      <li>and I had to use a decent amount to drench my hair in conditioner.</li>
      <li>This has completely destroyed my hair and created so much residue just from me using it for two weeks.</li>
      <li>The shampoo works very well for me but the conditioner is pretty gross afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on going to buy a new bottle of conditioner</li>
      <li>When I run my straightener through it, it stays limp, flat and \\&quot;oily\\&quot; looking (and most people comment on how much body my hair has, even when straight)  </li>
      <li>I myself have been looking for a good shampoo/conditioner for over a year now, and have tried at least seven different brands.    </li>
      <li>The first time, I thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s distractingly soft!    </li>
      <li>My hair was completely de-volumized and WAY sticky!</li>
      <li>I actually thought I didn&#x27;t rise it all off the first time I used it.     </li>
      <li>or maybe I was running my hands through my hair more than usual.</li>
      <li>If you rinse thoroughly for about 3-5 minutes with long hair it definitely comes out fine.     </li>
      <li>I will credit that this product works better than the two previously listed conditioners at volume!!    </li>
      <li>(it was soft and not greasy feeling).</li>
      <li>My hair is much healthier overall since I stopped using shampoo, so my review may be a little biased, especially since my other conditioner (silicone-free from Whole Foods brand) is amazing.    </li>
      <li>The second time I made sure to fully rinse my hair, longer than usual.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be lightweight (hence the \\&quot;pure clean\\&quot; claim), but it was the total opposite!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been back to the store to get new shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I used it for the first time the other day in the morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch and usually I don&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
      <li>It feels really weird putting it on - kind of a dragging feel to it</li>
      <li>As some other posters said, this product feel very waxy after use.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is probably okay on it&#x27;s own, but this conditioner was just awful.</li>
      <li>I love the Body Shop&#x27;s Rainforest Shine shampoo &amp; conditioner, but the price was starting to wear thin on me.  </li>
      <li>I hate that I wasted money on it, but it makes me feel better to be able to warn others about it!</li>
      <li>I only shower every other day because my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy fast, so</li>
      <li>I found all these other negative reviews and I feel a lot better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the Body Shop&#x27;s Rainforest Shine shampoo &amp; conditioner, but the price was starting to wear thin on me.  I got really excited when Garnier announced their line and rushed out to buy it.  The shampoo works very well for me but the conditioner is pretty gross afterwards.  I have very thick, wavy hair and even it get weighs down by the residue left over.  As some other posters said, this product feel very waxy after use.  If I run my hands through my hair after blowdrying, it feels like butter residue.  I&#x27;m going to try to stick with it and finish the bottle because I hate wasting products, but this one might end up getting tossed before I can finish.</li>
    <li> After using this one time I thought maybe I had not rinsed my hair.  The second time I made sure to fully rinse my hair, longer than usual.  My hair felt just as greasy and heavy.  It was like I had just used lotion in my hair.  My hair felt heavy and weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product unless you want your hair to feel and look like you haven&#x27;t washed it in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to give Garnier Fructis a second chance after purchasing another conditioner from them a few years back and really not liking it.  This is a brand I am going to stay away from.</li>
    <li> This conditioner made my hair super-greasy and gross, even after just getting out of the shower.  I keep a VERY simple beauty routine, and I am honestly not very picky about the products I use.  I was excited to find a more eco-friendly product, so I tried it.  I can&#x27;t finish the bottle.  I tried to, just out of my own frugality, but 1/3 of the way through, and I can&#x27;t go another day feeling like I washed my hair in butter.  Disgusting!  Don&#x27;t waste money on this...I&#x27;ve never reviewed a beauty product before, but there&#x27;s a first time for everything.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone&#x27;s problem is, but this conditioner is working fine for me. And it&#x27;s better for the environment! Killing two birds with one stone. At least try it once!</li>
    <li> Hair Type: Short, thick, curly    I myself have been looking for a good shampoo/conditioner for over a year now, and have tried at least seven different brands.    I have to admit, at first some of the reviews made me want to just return the product. However, I decided to just use the product. I really liked the benefits. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or overly conditioned, but it left my hair feeling soft. It did what the product offered, and didn&#x27;t smell bad. The conditioner I don&#x27;t really care for, however. It was just the same as all the other conditioners out there that I&#x27;ve tried. Overall, the product is nice and I&#x27;ll probably buy it again instead of another brand to try. I wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t difficult to open, though.    Personally, I haven&#x27;t found any conditioner that left my hair feeling \\&quot;light.\\&quot; It&#x27;s not just this brand.</li>
    <li> This product is awful!  I have been buying Garnier Fructise conditioners for years now, and have always been pleased with the result.  I have long curly hair that I straighten about 2-3 times a week. My hair is extremely thick, so I can get away with not washing it for 1-2 extra days after shampooing because of its&#x27; thickness.  I bought this conditioner b/c it was on sale for $1.00 cheaper than the regular GF bottles, and I was curious about the new formula.  What a terrible mistake.  When you wash it out of your hair, you don&#x27;t feel that silky smooth feeling... it almost feels sticky and as if you have used a gel to condition your hair.  When you blow-dry your hair, it feels like it isn&#x27;t getting dry enough... the conditioner weighs it down so much that it doesn&#x27;t feel like the moisture is leaving your hair.  When I run my straightener through it, it stays limp, flat and \\&quot;oily\\&quot; looking (and most people comment on how much body my hair has, even when straight)  I&#x27;m planning on going to buy a new bottle of conditioner just b/c I refuse to continue using this and have my hair looking like an oil-spill until I run out of the big sized bottle!  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is awful.  I also had high hopes for this conditioner and even suffered through a whole month of using it just to see if it would get better!  It feels like I&#x27;ve been washing my hair in shortning!  I&#x27;m going to call the company today because they need to re-think their recipe!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to see the commercials for an eco friendly option. however...the conditioner is awful. it leaves my hair greasy and looking dirty. so disappointed. hopefully, garnier will revamp because eco friendly is a great idea. but i will definitely not buy again unless they deal with the grease issue.</li>
    <li> I thought it was just me, but these other reviews have made me feel much better!  I noticed at first that my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft as normal and figured it must have been the lack of silicone.  But then I noticed my hair seemed really greasy.  At first I thought maybe I&#x27;d done a poor job of washing it and made a point to wash it very well (with the Pure Clean shampoo, which I don&#x27;t really have a problem with although it&#x27;s not my favorite).  And it was still greasy!  And it looks very dull - not shiny at all, except for the greasiness.  I don&#x27;t like to waste money either, but I have to get something else.  I can&#x27;t stand my hair looking so gross.  I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner for 2 reasons: 1 I have liked most of the fructis shampoos and conditioners and 2, I liked that it was environmentally friendly.  I was extremely disappointed with this product.  It made my hair feel very waxy, and I could tell from the moment I put it in my hair in the shower that it wasn&#x27;t going to work.  For me, while my hair was wet it felt like there was a layer of wax over it and it was not soft or detangled much, and when it dried it was very dry! I have curly hair and my curls were weighted down, even though my hair was so dry just from one shower with this stuff it felt like straw.  I normally have oily hair too, so that is very unusual.  Don&#x27;t Buy It! I&#x27;m throwing out the whole bottle. The only plus, I like the smell.</li>
    <li> Hair type: Medium length, fine and wavy  Unfortunately, this conditioner left my hair feeling greasy and waxy, just like the other reviewers said. I&#x27;ve been using the GF Sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner, which works relatively well...it&#x27;s good enough to buy more than once. I decided to try this conditioner when I ran out of my other one, but I&#x27;ve used it twice and I&#x27;m no regretting my decision. The first time, I thought I hadn&#x27;t rinsed well enough. I put my flat-ironed hair up in a pony tail because it wasn&#x27;t going to look good left down. I only shower every other day because my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy fast, so when I took it out of the pony tail, it felt a lot better than the first night (it was soft and not greasy feeling). I used it again tonight and have suffered the same, greasy result. I hate that I wasted money on it, but it makes me feel better to be able to warn others about it! This conditioner is horrible, just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo and conditioner as samples. For this review, I&#x27;m letting you know I have hair just past my shoulders, somewhat wavy, I blow it straight, with bangs, and I don&#x27;t use hair color. SO, here goes. The shampoo is fine, no problem with how it lathered or made my hair feel.  The conditioner is another story.  I could feel a problem as soon as I started rinsing.  So I rinsed again (I was in the shower so I knew I was getting a good rinse, nothing should have stayed in).  After wrapping my hair in a towel for about 5 minutes I toweled it dry, it still felt like something was on my hair. And not a GOOD something.  I rinsed again (A LOT). I then blow dried my hair.  My hair was flat, didn&#x27;t style well and I could tell that there seemed to be some kind of coating or film on my hair.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe what it felt like, I guess &#x27;greasy&#x27; since I can&#x27;t come up with anything else.  I was so disgusted that I shampooed/conditioned with my usual products. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a NASTY, ICKY PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this a 1 star because you have to enter something, but it deserves nothing.  Well actually, it deserves a minus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment edit (5 minutes later): I have since read another persons review that said her hair felt &#x27;waxy&#x27;.  Good description.</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman and Have 4c type hair. This conditioner, which is silicone free, was used to cowash my hair. It works wonders. I love the smell. It is on the thick side and I had to use a decent amount to drench my hair in conditioner. Overall my hair came out feeling clean and my curls were well defined. I didn&#x27;t experience any frizziness or build up on scalp. It rinsed out clean. Overall I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a curiousity - a bio friendly conditioner. But it&#x27;s nasty. I have used the other Garnier Fructis and this just makes my hair feel greasy and nasty, like I haven&#x27;t showered in days. And this is even after just getting out of the shower. I would get a refund on this if I could. I wish they had a \\&quot;customer satisfaction guarantee\\&quot;. I&#x27;d definitely use it. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here, I regretted buying it and Target but decided to give it a shot anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did!     Hair type: thick strands, thick overall, straight.   Hair length: almost knee.  Hair care routine: conditioner only.    First, let me point out that I do not use shampoo and haven&#x27;t used shampoo for 6 months. My hair is much healthier overall since I stopped using shampoo, so my review may be a little biased, especially since my other conditioner (silicone-free from Whole Foods brand) is amazing.    Ratings/Description...    Smell: 3/5 Nothing spectacular but not bad either. There is a distinct smell but it&#x27;s not noticeable to me after my hair dries.    Texture of conditioner: creamy and much thicker than most &#x27;cone-free conditioners. I found this misleading since thick seems to usually mean you can get away with less, but you really can&#x27;t with this one. I actually find myself using four handfuls instead of my usual two when I use Tresemmé Naturals or Whole Foods cone-free conditioners. The texture can also make it difficult to realize whether or not you rinsed thoroughly enough, thus many of the comments about it not rinsing out well. If you rinse thoroughly for about 3-5 minutes with long hair it definitely comes out fine.     Texture of hair while wet: silky soft while still in running water but very difficult to detangle if you absolutely need to detangle when wet. For this, I would give it a 1/5 except that it doesn&#x27;t matter to me since I never brush soaked hair and it was fine when just damp.     Softness when hair dries: 5/5 and I could seriously cuddle with my hair. It&#x27;s distractingly soft!    Shine: 5/5 My hair would make me look like a movie star if I weren&#x27;t so short!! Seriously, I get comments at least daily about how healthy my hair is.    Greasiness: none. At first I had dandruff from it but nothing a boar bristle brush couldn&#x27;t resolve. My hair is healthy and nice enough that I can go two or three days of neglecting it completely and wearing it down, even in the wind, without needing a wash.     Washing: works just as well if not better than all shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. Although, again, you have to give it a couple of days to transition and one day of dandruff doesn&#x27;t phase me.    Detangling/etc: 5/5 Again, I can wear it in the wind and a quick, gentle brush through resolves everything. I don&#x27;t get knots like I used to and I haven&#x27;t seen a split end in a month or two!    Volume: 5/5 I will credit that this product works better than the two previously listed conditioners at volume!!    I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars if I could. Not a perfect conditioner but still awesome!     My hair care advice for this product:  If you can, go conditioner-only (CO). Conditioners don&#x27;t ruin your hair follicles like shampoo does and yet they also clean out your hair just as well. When your hair gets greasy during your first month or so of CO, use a boar bristle brush to distribute it and appreciate your sebum instead of attacking it!     When washing with conditioner, allow it about 5 minutes to soak in and focus more on your scalp than your length. Condition your length to detangle but condition your scalp to wash and hydrate. I use the time to shave, stretch, and attend to dental hygiene. Rinse thoroughly for 3-5 minutes with warm to hot water. While hot water is generally considered bad for your hair, that heat helps to remove the conditioner. I suppose you probably could end with cold water but I never bother and my hair is lovely! When rubbing in the conditioner, make sure you get it all the way down to your scalp but put it in as though you are using your fingernails to brush your hair. I glob it over an area then finger-comb it in. If you just rub it in all willy-nilly you could actually make your hair more tangled.    When you finish washing, NEVER brush wet hair, at least if it is past shoulder-length. I also avoid curlers, blow-dryers, etc. and style my hair in an easy Chinese bun with a hair stick if I have to go somewhere. Usually, I bathe at night so I can just sleep until it is dry. If you want curls or waves, there are ways of getting them without using heat. I recommend the articles at the Long Hair Community (google it!). They are extremely helpful.     Thanks for reading! Love your hair!</li>
    <li> I have straight relatively healthy asian hair - not dyed not permed.    I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 weeks now.  The shampoo is fine. I&#x27;m puzzled at the conditioner and for a while was thinking that garnier accidentally put hair creme or gel in the bottle...    When the conditioner rinses off, my wet hair doesn&#x27;t have that typical just been conditioned soft feeling. After I dry my hair it feels like it has sticky residue in it.  I actually thought I didn&#x27;t rise it all off the first time I used it.     I haven&#x27;t been back to the store to get new shampoo and conditioner.  So now I shampoo, condition and then shampoo again to get the conditioner residue off. I guess I should just use the shampoo by itself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews for often, but I&#x27;m pretty astonished by this conditioner. I like to switch shampoo and conditioner brands all the time, just to experiment. I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch and usually I don&#x27;t see much of a difference no matter what I buy... but when I tried this Pure Clean Shampoo and Conditioner I DEFINITELY saw a difference. The shampoo is probably okay on it&#x27;s own, but this conditioner was just awful. I thought it would be lightweight (hence the \\&quot;pure clean\\&quot; claim), but it was the total opposite! As soon as I squeezed it from the bottle, it felt like a waxy paste, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I was wrong to have done so. It poured out waxy, went on waxy and STAYED waxy on my hair all day. My hair was completely de-volumized and WAY sticky! It was even hard to wash off at the end of the day. Today I switched to Pantene Aqua Light (still in quest of a lightweight shampoo and conditioner combo), and it feels nice and soft. What a relief!</li>
    <li> This is the worst conditioner I have ever used. I switch brands and types of hair care products fairly frequently and am usually mostly satisfied but this \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; was not at all conditioning. It left my hair feeling waxy and dirty after use and it looked oily after my hair dried. My waist length hair was completely tangly and terrible. I tried the product on three separate occasions just to be sure before I threw the whole bottle in the trash where it belongs. Do not buy this junk!</li>
    <li> I thought I was going crazy because my hair felt greasy after using this product. Then I found others who had the same results. Honestly, if I could, I would give this no stars. It is the worst conditioner I have ever used. Do not waste your money, and do not use it, even if it&#x27;s free. I&#x27;d rather go conditioner free than ever use this again. And that&#x27;s coming from a girl who needs conditioner. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think it all depends on the type of hair you have that will determine if you like it.  I have long,  blonde, color treated hair.  I MUST use conditioner or my hair will tangle.  When I put this product on after shampooing, I didn&#x27;t get that immediate silk like feel to my hair; I was nervous that it wasn&#x27;t working and I needed something stronger.  All I can tell you is that after I was done blowing my hair, I looked like I just came out of a salon.  This product is not loaded with oils and other chemicals that make your hair look greasy in  2 days.  I&#x27;m going to stock pile this conditioner since I&#x27;ve experienced the heartbreak of loving a product and then they discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I had to take another shower after I had already put makeup on and dried my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t go out of the house feeling like I had a tub of lard in my hair.  Nasty!</li>
    <li> This has completely destroyed my hair and created so much residue just from me using it for two weeks. I have never had greasy hair a day in my life and this has created such build up by the roots of my hair. I hate it. It is taking days to come out. I will never buy this again and I would never ever recommend any garnier fructis product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day and will be returning it. It made my hair so greasy and unmanageable. It&#x27;s disgusting. It feels like you have washed your hair with body lotion or like you didn&#x27;t wash your hair at all. I have normal hair, nothing out of the ordinary, but I take great pride in my hair. This is probably the worst conditioner I have ever used in my life. Buyer beware! I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could! I&#x27;m returning it!!!</li>
    <li> Got this Shampoo and conditioner a few days ago. I used it for the first time the other day in the morning. That same afternoon after my hair had dried (which took a lot longer than usual) , my hair was greasy and felt heavier than usual. I thought maybe I had left the conditioner in to long or maybe I was running my hands through my hair more than usual. Than today I took a shower and used it again. I left the conditioner in for only a couple minutes than rinsed it out well. My hair is so greasy right now it&#x27;s disgusting. It makes me feel so gross. I decided to try and find out online what it might be. I found all these other negative reviews and I feel a lot better. Like I&#x27;m not crazy. This stuff sucks. Never getting it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this twice with terrible results.  I have long thick hair with loose curls.  The product is very thick and comes out in a blob.  It feels really weird putting it on - kind of a dragging feel to it like it&#x27;s sticking to my hair.  Even after rinsing much longer than usual my hair still felt coated.  It has a very strong scent which reminds me of Head &amp; Shoulders.  Now hours later my hair still isn&#x27;t completely dry and when I run my fingers thru it it actually leaves a residue on them.  My hair feels both sticky and greasy.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought such a huge bottle.  I&#x27;ll just use it as a shaving cream instead.  Maybe Garnier can remarket it for that purpose.  What were they thinking??</li>
    <li> After experiencing the same waxy build up from this product I contacted garnier through Facebook and they simply said \\&quot;sorry.\\&quot; Horrible product and bad customer service.</li>
