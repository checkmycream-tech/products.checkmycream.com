    <li> Works well, I would recommend it</li>

    <li> Sleek and light, just how I like it!</li>
    <li> Great case and much cheaper than the otter box</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with it functionally. You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t be cheap on your electronics case. Or you will be buying 2 of them.</li>
    <li> I love itI am very pleased with thatthank you</li>
    <li> Great item was exactly what I order fits perfectly, fast shipping</li>
    <li> The case was what i expected.</li>
    <li> With the cost of a ipad Air 2 the case is what I needed. Kid proof and my wife loves it</li>
    <li> Very nice item thank you</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to fit on my IPad. Has withstood being dropped.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Have not used the stand yet due to reports that it is hard to pull out other wise very nice product</li>
    <li> I purchased this case for one of my child&#x27;s IPads.  So far after 4 months it&#x27;s doing a good job of protecting it.  The only concern or wish I have is that it was a little thicker and/or had more cushioning which may benefit more if dropped from a higher distance.  So far so good though</li>
    <li> This case is very comparable to the Otterbox at a fraction of the price. Been working great for my husband&#x27;s iPad for about 6 months now.</li>
    <li> It looks great but it doesn´t fit 100%. I feel it like a little bigger and when I take the ipad, I have the sensation that the ipad is moving inside the case. The screen protector doesn´t fit. When I touch the screen, I feel like bubbles between the screen protector and the ipad´s screen so I had to remove it.</li>
    <li> Super solid case. Well built. Thick. Great to protect our expensive electronics from the abuse of little kiddos.</li>
    <li> I have owned and loved Otterbox cases in the past.  Decided to go with this case for my sons iPad from the positive reviews.  The case is very nice and I am overall very pleased.  The only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 star is that the rubber part of the case, in my opinion, is not as heavy duty as an Otterbox case.</li>
    <li> Very nice, comfortable to hold and built in stand works great.</li>
    <li> not so childproof...the baby drools and the moistures get underneath the screen, needed to by another childproof case so our 500 investment did not get ruined</li>
    <li> These are the best cases for kids.  Never broke an IPAD with two kids using it.  Fits the iPAD Air 2 great!</li>
    <li> Wanted a case that covered the screen - my mistake</li>
    <li> My wife was pleased with the iPad case.</li>
    <li> excellent case, by far the best tough case for an ipad air 2.  many friends have since purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think the stand was too tough to get out, but I can see it being difficult for some without nails or a key or something flat.</li>
    <li> This product, I do not recommend it. Because it broke me. Clamp case . in two months No me duró nada.Case   en 2 meses es un material malo </li>
    <li> Great little protective case, couldn&#x27;t be happier with quality and price!</li>
    <li> This is actually a very nice cover.  It does what you want every iPad cover to do.  That is protect those corners.  We are extremely happy with this. It is a non-slip case and gets the job done, nicely.</li>
    <li> The case was not the correct one because it did not fit. I ended up purchasing one from the local store. It just happen to be on clearance I returned it</li>
