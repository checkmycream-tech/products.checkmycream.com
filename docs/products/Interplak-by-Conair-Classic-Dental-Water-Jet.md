<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this twice a day ,and feel that it keeps my teeth and mouth clean of food particles</li>
    <li> This item has been a waste of money for me. Since I have had the item, I have only been able to use it a few times. The water will never come out, even when I leave it running for thirty minutes. The item has never worked properly for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality, perfect speed</li>
    <li> Works great! Water pressure is just enough to clean and not hurt.</li>
    <li> Was received with a break in the base. Could not use; sent it back.</li>
    <li> Much better product than the waterpik. It is not as harsh on the mouth.</li>
    <li> The machine works well and does what it is supposed to do. In this respect it is much superior to the Water Pic which 35 years ago was a good product but has worsened in performance while its design has been incorrectly and unnecessarily enhanced to look \\&quot;21st. Century.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Plenty of water and power.  Does a great job getting those bits of food unstuck from between teeth.  Wouldn;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift. My  daughter  just love it! I was happy with the service &amp; the quailty of this product. Pat</li>
    <li> What a wonderful way to clean the plak off your teeth- this unit not only looks nice but works very well.  We like it better than the last one we had by another manufacturer.  We highly recommend this item.  It was shipped quickly and works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Interplax waterpic is great helping with gum control  a must for anyone with gum problems.  Had owned  the conair waterpic. Before this one and would not own any other  brand.</li>
    <li> If you go to my review of WaterPik&#x27;s oral irrigator, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m quite critical of their product, although I own one and use it regularly. In fact, Interplak has improved upon quite a number if issues I took with WaterPik. However, Interplak&#x27;s irrigator simply doesn&#x27;t measure up.&lt;br /&gt;Although I very much like their tub being able to be removed with water still in it without spilling, it&#x27;s simply too small. Having to add water half way through is a pain in the keister. Also, it&#x27;s much quieter than WaterPik, but the reason for that is it&#x27;s motor is much less powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;In my mind there&#x27;s only one decisive factor for choosing this irrigator over WaterPik -- cost. It&#x27;s half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if Conair ever puts out either an improved version of this one, or if they release a Professional version, I myself will burn my WaterPik in my yard and make the conversion happily!</li>
    <li> This is only my second water irrigator. My first was a waterpik (worked awesome for a couple of years then pooped the bed on me).  &lt;br /&gt;It had been a while since I&#x27;ve owned one so I figured I would give interplak (conair) a try.  &lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed is the water pressure isn&#x27;t what my old waterpik was (there&#x27;s plenty of pressure with this unit, just not as much). How much pressure do we need anyways...I mean does our gums truley need to be super-pressure washed? &lt;br /&gt;No matter where I went I noticed that both manufacturers had a bad reliability ratings, so I went for consumer advice. I looked up as much info as possible on both makes. An online consumer guide rated the interplak best overall. There was my deciding factor. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned this unit for only a couple of weeks and am satisfied with the build quality and features of this unit. After several months of usage I will post an update of this review. I hope I don&#x27;t have problems like the others did. One thing I was sure to do was register my irrigator on Conair&#x27;s website, just in case of future problems. &lt;br /&gt;Time will tell.</li>
    <li> This product is great for cleaning your mouth and teeth.  Most of the other Water Jet products only come with the jet spray and hurt your gums.  This one comes with a brush that cleans without hurting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a ok product it&#x27;s not very quiet... Think next time I&#x27;ll spend a little more money for something a little better.... It&#x27;s a get by</li>
    <li> Just a quick review to reinforce what&#x27;s been said by many others. Compared to the old Waterpiks I&#x27;ve had for years (and for which I can no longer get parts -- hoses are the weak spot -- otherwise I&#x27;d gladly repair them; I could go on at length about our throw-it-away society, but I&#x27;ll spare you), this is a vastly inferior product. As others have noted, the water pressure is very weak, and the reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to clean your teeth properly. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Had to send it back.  Really, really loud.  Had one before, this was not the same machine.  They made me pay shipping both ways for something that did not work.  A rip off!  Avoid!</li>
    <li> I am very well pleased with the product. This is the third one I have purchased. The shipment time was great and mdse in perfect condition. I am very happy with amazon.com and do most of my internet purchasing through them.</li>
    <li> I had 2 Interplak water jets in 6 months..both worked well for a few (3-4)weeks and then the water pressure dropped to a dribble or nothing at all.  My purchase was the compact rechargeable water jet... $52.00 later I am returning to the good and  reliable WATER PIK</li>
    <li> I had an older Conair Interplak WJ7 model for several years. It worked very well, so well in fact that when it finally lost it&#x27;s pressure I immediatly ordered another to replace it. The new model WJ7B looks very similar and it does come with extra cleaning tools however it&#x27;s quality and performance is a far cry from the previous model I had. When my old one gave up the ghost I ordered what I thought was the identical replacement model. Boy was I mistaken. This model is much noisier. It has decent pressure but only after you fiddle with the knobs and wait for it to do it&#x27;s thing. I went a week without a water jet. I use it so often that I was going through withdrawls. I was so exited when it arrived. That joy didn&#x27;t last very long. After I opened the box it came in I noticed that it was much lighter than the older model. If your not careful just by turning the dials you can tip it over. It is much noisier as well. I will give it a chance, however it&#x27;s so much louder and feels so much flimsier than it&#x27;s predecessors. I realize in this world you get what you pay for however the older model I had was around the same price and I was hoping that this model would be at least as good as my previous one. I will most likely buy another one from a competitor soon for I think this one will only work a mere fraction of the time my old one did. Regardless of the 2 year warranty when it goes I will just toss it in the trash. Why bother paying for shipping just to get another cheapo replacement. Way to go Conair. Replace a decent product with an inferior one for a similar price. I didn&#x27;t buy another Interplak unit to be cheap. I bought it because my older model worked so well for so long. If you buy this product the only winner will be Conair. So much for quality and reputations.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice item.  The water comes out strong even I only use level 3..  I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this appliance to replace an old, old, old WaterPik. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, about 26.00. My dentist wants me to use a water jet to help with gum problems. I have to say that this little device works exceptionally well. It has 7 pressure settings, which are plenty, and comes with 5 attachments -- 2 \\&quot;regular\\&quot; tips, a sublingual tip for the gums, a brush head tip and a tongue cleaner tip -- so there&#x27;s plenty of versatility. It&#x27;s a bit noisy, so I use it in the downstairs bathroom at night so I don&#x27;t wake my husband. It&#x27;s also nice looking. But the main point is that it works very well. The handle has a button that allows you to turn off the jet of water (not the appliance). Per dentist orders, I use a mix of 1 part Listerine to 3 parts warm water and flush the machine out with about 1/4 reservoir of plain water after each use. I think this machine has been a great addition to my dental routine and would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month with no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kids. After awhile I noticed they weren&#x27;t using it. They said it didn&#x27;t do much, so I took it into my bathroom. It&#x27;s definitely not a Water Pik -- I have had several of those when I was a kid, when I was in college etc, and those all worked great. This thing is terrible! Absolutely no power on any setting and my biggest regret is taking too long to notice -- it was bought many months ago. I will be trashing it and looking for a \\&quot;real\\&quot; Water Pik soon.</li>
    <li> Prir!eatce was right.  Product works g</li>
    <li> The water takes time to make its way through the hose, but it gets the debris out well.</li>
    <li> The pressure is good so I feel the cleaning is effective. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a messy affair. The button to stop the flow of water doesn&#x27;t work consistently so water still flows when I open my mouth to release water. Another drawback is that the different tips do not connect firmly to the base so they constantly fall off when I unplug and/or move the unit. I would not recommend because of these design flaws.</li>
    <li> I have found this model to work best for flushing tonsil stones (tonsilloliths). Bad breath may be caused by tonsil stones (among other possibilities). Your tonsils are filled with nooks and crannies where bacteria and food debris may accumulate or become trapped. When this happens, the debris can become concentrated, and form what MD&#x27;s call tonsil stones. Among other things this makes your breath stink. Careful not to use too forceful spray or setting. I use lowest setting (1) or least powerful spray along with standard nozzle attachment. I found other brands have nozzle openings that are too small resulting in a too concentrated jet or spray which can cause bleeding when flushing out nooks and crannies of your tonsils. Other tips: when filling the water reservoir or cup, mix in one pack of NeilMed Sinus Rinse powder which is basically a mix of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonite (salt and baking powder). Also you&#x27;ll have to hold a good LED flashlight in one hand and the water jet in the other to do the task.  If you have a strong gag reflex and/or are not familiar with throat/mouth anatomy, best to check with your Otolaryngologist, or ear nose throat doctor, for professional advise before trying any of the above.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these a couple of years ago so I would have a replacement when the first one broke.  Guess what?  I haven&#x27;t had to get out the second one yet.  The first one is working and I use it every day.  Stay away from the Waterpik and get the Interplak.</li>
    <li> Good price and  nicer than the Waterpik it replaced</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to others from my personal experience. Like other 1 star reviews, mine leaked from the bottom and the handle. It works fine for a few weeks, and suddenly leak. It leaked while the the machine working, so I afraid it will have electronic problem. Therefore, I returned it. Amazon&#x27;s service is always superb. No problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If the water jet work, i will probably give it 4 stars (minus one star, because of noise level). Now, one star for the product, another for amazon. peace.</li>
    <li> I had used this product years ago when I first started water piking.  I have used the larger one for years and I am not  happy with this one.  No one&#x27;s fault but my own.  This one is  noisy and does not work as well as the more expensive ones.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The product is perfect for my needs. Could use a taller tank to put more water, I have to refill during each use. It is a little load when it&#x27;s on, otherwise , it is a good machine &amp; does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite good as I wish.</li>
    <li> great power but the tank is small,,,still it works great for me</li>
    <li> This product is a real disappointment to me since I&#x27;d so enjoyed its predecessor ...it would still be in use if I hadn&#x27;t broken the well.  The new one has a very irregular water flow going from Niagara Falls to a slow trickle on its own without touching the controls. It is very irritating and I would not buy one like it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this water jet from another retailer and it worked well for quite a while (when I remembered to use it) - fine for the price.  I bought it to clean around my new crown (protecting my investment, you know).  It worked very well for that purpose, and since I am the type that detests flossing, this water jet stuff was great.  Admittedly, this has been mostly a bathroom counter decoration for me.  I clean the dust off occasionally.  Last week when I tried to use it, nothing noticeable happened other than a slight \\&quot;hum\\&quot;.  I tried another outlet, I tried scrubbing parts clean - nothing worked.  I would say the total useable life of my product was perhaps a year (I&#x27;ve had it for around two years).</li>
    <li> This is the best that we have used. Performs better than expected, based on other reviews. Will buy Conair again, if replacement needed.No leaks  thus far. Pressure adjustment is ideal and variable. Cannot say enough good things about it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Best ever!  I use to wear braces and have tried many water piks but this is by far the best I love the pressure settin 7 has although its been many years since Ive wore braces I still love the clean feeling wqter piks give love this product it gives me my crest smile back! A plus plus plus on this product great investment!</li>
    <li> This interplak water jet cleanses my mouth with a smooth flow of water. This machine is small and compact and does its job well.</li>
    <li> Compared to our (ten years?) old broken Conair Interplak Waterjet, the new model is about 1/3 the weight of the original.  I took out the case screws to look inside of both new and old models.  Differences are minor, except for the motor.  The old motor is massive.  The new one is not.  Pressure of the new one goes up to about half of the old one.  It is strong enough for me, but my wife would prefer more pressure.  The new one is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old one is broken because of a leak in the plastic pipe that connects to the nozzle.  Sprays the whole room.  I failed in my attempts to repair the leak and don&#x27;t see any way of disconnecting the high pressure pipe from either the nozzle or the pump.  So it is broken for good.</li>
    <li> I had this for well over a year and its working great, only thing is the knob to chnage pressure gets stuck but otherwise good working order.</li>
    <li> The product works great! It helps keep food particals out of my teeth. It also keeps my teeth clean and bright.</li>
    <li> It thoroughly cleans my mouth and keeps my gums healthy!  I had another brand (which I bought when my previous Interplak kicked the bucket after 10 years)  I bought a Water Pik because it was the only appliance I could find in a store near me, but it sounded like a jackhammer and was equally harsh.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve owned. They don&#x27;t last more than around 3 years due to the pump wearing out. If they only make the pump parts more robust, it could last much longer. Ultimately the motor turns but the plastic pump doesn&#x27;t pump. I don&#x27;t know if other brands that pump so hard will wear out slower, but I&#x27;ve stuck with Conair. The nice part is that the water container holds enough for two thorough cleaning. The extra tools are not useful. One caution: DO NOT PUT MOUTHWASH IN THE TANK!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m blue.     This is a POS. Do not buy. Stay away from all blue receptacle waterpik&#x27;s that cost below 50.    You&#x27;ll regret it. My last waterpik was Hydrafloss. It lasted two years. I went with el cheapo thinking it would do much the same thing for my teeth.    WRONG! It&#x27;s all cheap plastic. So the water can&#x27;t get up through the hose due to--poor design. If you do get it to work for a day or so, I commend you.     But be warned, if all you hear is motor and there is no water coming up to irrigate your teeth, do what I did; smash it into a thousand pieces and take it back to customer service at Walmart.     No you won&#x27;t get your money back, but the look on their faces is worth the 30 for crap I paid for!</li>
    <li> If you go to my review of WaterPik&#x27;s oral irrigator, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m quite critical of their product, although I own one and use it regularly. In fact, Interplak has improved upon quite a number if issues I took with WaterPik. However, Interplak&#x27;s irrigator simply doesn&#x27;t measure up.&lt;br /&gt;Although I very much like their tub being able to be removed with water still in it without spilling, it&#x27;s simply too small. Having to add water half way through is a pain in the keister. Also, it&#x27;s much quieter than WaterPik, but the reason for that is it&#x27;s motor is much less powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;In my mind there&#x27;s only one decisive factor for choosing this irrigator over WaterPik -- cost. It&#x27;s half the price.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if Conair ever puts out either an improved version of this one, or if they release a Professional version, I myself will burn my WaterPik in my yard and make the conversion happily!</li>
    <li> This is a worthless product.  It makes a lot of noise, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Most of the time I cannot get the water to come out and the heads are easy to come off.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheaper than a WaterPik (which I used before).  Big mistake.  Very weak water pressure even on its highest setting.  Very small water reservoir which isn&#x27;t enough for a thorough cleaning.  Then the water pressure went to almost nil after just one year.  I didn&#x27;t even bother getting it replaced under its 2 year warranty since it performs so inadequately.  Got a WaterPik again - recommend you spend the money correctly the first time instead of wasting money on this.</li>
    <li> I had a water pik and it died early on.  I bought the Interplak WJ7 - old old model - and loved it for probably three years when the hose split.  Repair was unsuccessful so I bought the later B version - the only one available.  Disappointed in the pressure - yes, but I noticed the slow down when adding the fluid, adjusting the pressure knob and realized the lack of pressure is due to excessive drag on the piston.     Solution - fill with water and put the handle back in the container to circulate the water and run for 5 minutes.  After a few cycles the piston wears in and it works just like the old model. Lots of pressure.  It might even blow out the hose like my old one after a couple of years.    Oops - after about a month I still put the handle back in the container and let it run a few minutes till the pressure builds - then it&#x27;s OK.  Not great but OK.</li>
    <li> Broken.  Used once and water would not come out again.  Spent 60. At target to buy one that works.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a Interplak Water Jet I had for approx. 7 years.  This product is not as satisfactory.  It is really pretty noisy and doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
    <li> I followed instructions exactly as enclosed with product.  It worked off and on for about two weeks and then would not work at all.  I contacted the company directly and basicly was told \\&quot;to bad\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the product back to Amazon for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this flosser because my sister needed it in order to improve my mom&#x27;s way to clean her teeth..  My sister tried it out and said to me that it left her bathroom a total mess... water by everywhere.... no matters the speed of the flosser. That&#x27;s why i give 3 stars to this product...</li>
    <li> It was helpful reading the other reviews, I had to be patient and change the pressure (1 to 7) quite a few more times than the instructions stated. Once I got pressure, it has worked great since, I have used the product for 3 months, 3 times a day. It works so well I have purchased 3 others for relatives.</li>
    <li> I find that this model does not always come up to full pressure until I&#x27;ve turned it on and off a few times.  Very Frustrating.  I rarely had that problem with my previous purchase, which I used a couple times a day for over three years.  (I replaced the old model because the hose developed a hole.)</li>
    <li> The Conair water irrigation device is truly great.  It&#x27;s compact, yet does a better job easier than the other leading cleaner.  Would recommend this to any prospective purchaser.</li>
    <li> Disappointed by the decreased quality in is really a medical care device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Conair WJ7 Interplak cleaner worked perfectly for about five years.  When it finally wore out, I bought a WJ7B from Amazon.  I tried it for the first time last night.  I was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model has significantly less water pressure.  When I accidentally touch the tip of the jet to a tooth, the motor bogs down.  The base unit of the new one only weighs about 1/3 as much as the old one, which suggests they&#x27;ve put a much smaller motor inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE AND A HALF YEARS LATER:&lt;br /&gt;This water jet is still going as strong as ever. It may not be as powerful as the old model, but it&#x27;s durable. I&#x27;d add another star if I could.</li>
    <li> Ranks among the poorest quality products that I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.  The water jet power is marginal. It is very difficult to insert or remove the water jet tips and became more difficult with use. The knobs are difficult to turn and don&#x27;t operate smoothly. I almost returned it shortly after purchase, but made the mistake of keeping it for several months before throwing it out and replacing it with a Waterpik product that is much better in every respect and well worth somewhat higher price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a 10 year old unit that failed.  It works well, but seems to operate at a higher noise level than our first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it does great and I get good reports from the dental hygenist.</li>
    <li> Not made as well as previous owned unit.less power resulting in lower preassure.Doesn&#x27;t alwsys work must keep turning preassure nob to get stream to flow.</li>
    <li> Purchased this unit two weeks ago and finally returned it.  It was less money than water pick---well, you get what you pay for.  Half of the time while on the high setting I would only get low power surges.  I would move the unit around and this would correct it until the second week were it was just low power.  Also, the irrigator tips moved around too easy and I would have to constantly adjust to keep the jets of water in the right direction.  As far as I am concerned, this unit is garbage.&lt;BR&gt;I went to Bed and Bath and purchased a Water Pick WP-65W and am extreamly happy with its performance.  Now get this--this unit on the Water Pick site goes for $$$$, I found it at Bed and Bath for $$$$$, plus I had just received a 20% off one item mailer coupon.  At the store, there was also a $$$$Water Pick rebate promotion, until Sept 2003.  My final cost was $$$$ plus tax.  This ended up costing me less money than the Interplack!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Conair WJ7B Interplak Water Jet.  The settings did not work. I emailed to request a replacement and received an immediate response.  The replacement came in five days. The Conair Interplak Water Jet works perfect and I am so pleased with the customer service!</li>
    <li> Professionally, I am really amazed water jet is not recommended by all of the hygienists. Please, purchase it and use it daily. Do not look at it as another daily boring routine. Think of it as a shower for your teeth. Benefits of this water jet are tremendous! You will see (and hopefully hear) the results by yourself. Stay healthy! :) &lt;br /&gt;Respectfully, &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Dontsova &lt;br /&gt;P.S. Conair water jet is the most user-friendly. :) &lt;br /&gt;     For majority of people, far from ideal daily flossers, it is an excellent back up.</li>
    <li> This is a well made system, works really great, cleans well, and the price is right. I will order more of these.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think this model is good.  We had one that lasted for more than 3 years.  After the first year, the tube started to leak.  Howevere, it still functioned well.  When turned the knob to start, it took a few seconds for the water to start coming out.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recently, we bought this same model again for my daughter to use.  She experiences the same sympton, except it hasn&#x27;t leaked yet.</li>
    <li> this was a replacement for mine which wore out after several years.  a lot more noise than previous water jet.</li>
    <li> I have never been an advocate of water-flossing, but now I&#x27;ve come around.  I dislike the models that spray with too much force, even on the gentle settings, and I really can&#x27;t stand those that are loud.  This model is perfect for me. The settings offer a wide range of pressure, and the machine is really quite quiet.  Also, it&#x27;s small--doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the sink. This is my second one, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these for Christmas presents. They both said they loved them. My sons&#x27; teeth are very tight and has always had a problem using dental floss, it would get stuck. He said this was great, no more floss stuck in his teeth. The water pressure was perfect according to both of them.</li>
    <li> This product did not work, the water did not come out.  It is just sitting on my sink doing nothing.</li>
    <li> Model WJ7 was used for about a year with no problems during the time I had braces. I was happy with its performance. However, after a year&#x27;s use, the white water hose became embrittled and cracked, thus I was not able to use the unit. Customer Service provides no replacement hose making the unit worthless. Website provides no useful repair / replacement information. So I surmise this model is a throw away. Very sad!</li>
    <li> works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> I have always bought the same model of Conair Interplak water jets and this recent water jet is not as good. The jet spray is so much weaker than previous Interplak water jets of the same model.</li>
    <li> just what I needed to help clean between my teeth after brushing and flossing very good product I recommend this for good dentil care</li>
    <li> bought this and looked all over to fine one and bought this made a big bo bo.this doesn&#x27;t get the job done, well shop for anouther in the furture.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I had a WaterPik many years ago, and have really missed it.  The Interplak just doesn&#x27;t have enough power.  I was able to use Level 7 from day 1.  Since it doesn&#x27;t have much power, I run out of water before making it around my whole mouth.  It is better than nothing, but I wish it had more pressure so I would feel more refreshed.  My suggestion is - keep looking for a WaterPik.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well. &lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger.</li>
    <li> You only need one or two heads so the additional ones look nice.  It has a good amount of force, but if you&#x27;re use to a high end product with a tremendous amount of pressure then this isn&#x27;t for you.  I recommend this for people trying out water jets to see if they&#x27;ll use it and benefit off of it.  This is a great product though, just not high end.</li>
    <li> Very user friendly, my dad uses it every night as a routine and it works perfectly. Small size makes it convenient</li>
    <li> its an ok item, it works for what you pay for it. holds alot of water, so your not having to fill alot.</li>
    <li> Conair Interplak Water Jet is the way to go. My first is still working very well after five years. I bought this one for my daughter, who calls it &amp;#34;addicting&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, box was really oversized for the machine. This is a replacement for my old on and this one works perfectly and is even quieter.</li>
    <li> No cavities in 15 years. This is my second waterjet by Conair and it works great. Use it every night before bedtime. Use in conjunction with an electric toothbrush and you&#x27;ll save on expensive dental work.</li>
    <li> Very noisy and the unit moves around when turned on.  It&#x27;s like a cheap toy.  I like the Waterpik better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it works great for orthodontia work.  I particularly like this model because it is simple and very easy to use for the kids, who use it by themself - which just can&#x27;t be overstated.  And, it is compact and small.  You can&#x27;t tell from the picture, but it&#x27;s compact compared to the Waterpik brands, which at $50+ I threw away because it was too big and cumbersome for the kids to use and for the small counterspace I have in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t drip or spray like some other models, works better than dental floss. I put in a little mouthwash, fill up the rest with slightly warm water, and love the results.  I can tell by the report from my dental hygienist that it makes a long-term difference as well.</li>
    <li> We highly recommend this product for anyone out there that would like to protect their teeth &amp;amp; have healthy gums because this item really cleans between your teeth with water pressure.  Also a great way to get your kids to keep good dental habits They will think this is a fun way to keep their mouth clean &amp;amp; fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> We have one of these, it worked fine for awhile, but now its hit or miss if it will actually pump water.  Our water is filtered/softened - so I doubt that there is anything from our water that caused it fail.</li>
    <li> I have one for longer than a month now.  It worked great every time I used it.  I could find no use for the the extra attachments.  So next time I may go for a simpler model.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the pressure could be a little higher and the reservoir much bigger.  Other than the two complaints I am happy with the product.  Waterpiks are just a little too rich for my blood, so Interpak will have my business again.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, this piece of equipment should have worked perfectly.  A strong sream of water should have been jetting from the hand-held spout but alas, the stream of water reminded me of one of the stone cherib statues peeing water into a fountain basin.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that maybe I got a lemon, but after reading other comments regarding this piece of junk, the odds are I didn&#x27;t. I will be returning it to where I purchased it for a full refund, unless, between now and then, my opinion on this product can be altered. &lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time and money for me as a consumer, the store from which I bought it, and finally the manufacturer.  Did they think that letting this mistake of a product was going to be accepted by the public as a vaiable dental aid?  What are some of these corporate decision makers thinking?  Why?  If the answer is money, then that doesn&#x27;t even make sense.  Because everyone loses money on this kind of product offering.</li>
    <li> First of all, Target.com is selling the wrong unit.  The WJ7 has received rave reviews elsewhere, and I made my selection based on those.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; Unfortunately, what I received was a WJ7R.  That &amp;quot;update&amp;quot; has not been as well received.  I have seen a number of complaints concerning low-pressure on the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; To make matters worse, the unit wouldn&#x27;t pump.  I followed the instructions, including the adddendum inside the reservoir, to the letter and got no water to pump.&amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62; When I took the defective unit back to Target, all they had on the shelves were the WJ7B, still not what I ordered.</li>
    <li> The Conair WJ7B Interplak Water Jet works but the noise level is high and nearly vibriates off the counter. However, after a few months the water pressure began taking a few minutes to get up to jet speed.  The lack of water pressure when you first turn it on is too big of an annoyance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00000J9DU Conair WJ7B Interplak Water Jet]]  I love this product, have used it for years and was glad to find it on the internet.</li>
    <li> this is a great product and i have nothing but raves about it.  My wife and i both use it up to three times a day. And for all those who it doesn&#x27;t have enough pressure-what kind of gums do you have. If we turn it up to three it hurts our gum. It works very well and i&#x27;m not trying to sand blast my mouth.  The only drawback is the small cup size- i believe it only hold s about 10-12 ozs.  needs to have a bigger resevoir.  Other than that this is a great product. I&#x27;m to going to buy a couple more for our sons to use at their homes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely completely satisfied with this product.  Best price I could find, and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It often stops working (I think due to air bubbles in the tube), then starts working again.&lt;br /&gt;Could be better</li>
    <li> Shipping on time and product is awse!</li>
    <li> I read the instructions and followed them. I turned on the interplak and it sat there making noise and vibrating like it should be working normally. After about 20min. of trying to get it to work, I gave up. It doesn&#x27;t work, the water resivoir is too small, and after using a Waterpik, have decided that the Waterpik is better anyway.</li>
    <li> I got this thing as a Christmas present from my mother.  We had a WaterPik at home, but I was away at college and so my mom got me this one.  I was overall pleased with it at first; although the pressure is certainly not as great as the WaterPik, I was able to get a satisfying clean feeling at level 7.  Note, however, that this was the first time I had used such a device in quite some time and my gums were not prepared for it; I could NOT have used the WaterPik at the highest level without first gradually building up the pressure for a few weeks.  &lt;br /&gt;I too was disappointed in the size of the reservoir.  It is indeed a pain to refill in the middle of a cleaning.  Indeed, with the WaterPik I would often go through two full reservoirs, so I often find myself refilling and re-refilling the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now it&#x27;s nearly Christmastime again, and this Conair Interplak water jet has gone south.  The water pressure is miniscule on all settings; it doesn&#x27;t change at all from 1 to 7.  It&#x27;s basically useless now.  &lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, and I instead recommend that you get the real thing, a WaterPik.  My family&#x27;s has lasted over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Updating my prior review.  The product generally works OK for a month or two and then it dies.  I&#x27;m now on my 2nd unit and it has gone bad.  Warrant service is great, but the product lasts only for a month or two of active use.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a year.  Hose is crap. Had two, both failed.</li>
    <li> I wish the tank held a little more water, otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> this item  works great and does the trick , I recommend  this item to anyone who needs a water jet.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve owned the same previously for the last 5 years and the tube finally punctured spraying water out below the stand.  Purchased this new one which is supposed to be the same but what a BIG dissapointment.  Turning up the power knob to the maximum of 5, this didn&#x27;t even provide anymore pressure out of the nozzle than a setting of 3.  This one is much noisier than our first Water Jet.  They must have some third world country putting these together.  I would not recommend purchasing this model.</li>
    <li> Many years and several types of water jets, I had to replace the exact same product having plugged it into Argentinian 220 outlet and burned it out. Before this new one arrived, I had a small battery operated travel unit and with twice daily use, continues on its 2 batteries for more than 5 weeks! Amazing.    Reading other&#x27;s reveiws before buying the new product, I bought it anyhow as noise level, etc. was not a concern. The design and large water reservoir makes it available to use 3-4 times before refilling. Its size makes it possible to travel with, too.    Anyhow, it is better than the previous one which I loved having and using! I&#x27;ve a mouth full of crowns and my gums and teeth are better for using a water jet.  By the way, it is quieter then I expected and plenty of water pressure to spare.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Just use at a very low setting as to not damage your gums. Love the brush. Not so happy with the tongue scraper</li>
    <li> Works just like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Plenty of power.  Don&#x27;t know if this is helpful, and Interplak probably discourages it, but it&#x27;ll put out a candle from about 25&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it was almost 1/2 the price you see in all the department store. And my gums and teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two identically-looking Interplak Water Jets before.  Both went bad after a couple of years -- when turned on, I had to fiddle with the power setting, change the water temperature, or empty and refill the reservoir to get the water pressure strong enough to work.  They worked well enough (when they worked) that I was happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered a new one when I could no longer get the old one to achieve an acceptable water pressure (no matter how I fiddled with the settings).  The new one came with instructions in the box to reduce and then increase the power setting 3 times to get it to work.  This worked sometimes, but not always.  I had to fiddle with the power many times more to make it work, turn the power off and back on, suck on the pick, etc..  It seems to me that Conair could not figure out how to make the product work properly, so instead of fixing the product they included instructions in the box saying that you have to fiddle with the controls to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it with them and returned the product to Amazon within a week.  Fortunately, Amazon is a very good company and accepted the return with no penalty.  I ordered a WaterPik (different manufacturer) from them at higher cost and it is working so far.</li>
    <li> this is the second set i bought for this model . Accessories are more practical and effective. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; Conair as in underpowered cheap motor, UNLIKE the heavy, strong power sprayer ORIGINAL motor.&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the thing. If you want an new tooth sprayer, don&#x27;t get this one, the spray is wimpy and the motor is loud.&lt;br /&gt;If, on the other hand, you HAVE AN ORIGINAL Conair  and your original MOTOR is still working good, then if yourst looks exactly like this &#x27;new&#x27; one, then this is all you need to swap-out the parts to make your old unit, new again.&lt;br /&gt;You remove 4-screws from the base, and you can swap the plunger and plunger body, the handle-hose combo and end up with a new blue cup and attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Again, use this for PARTS to fix your old original unit, but don&#x27;t buy this new-one and expect a strong spray!</li>
    <li> tried it twice, did not work, then the third time it did work, however, not sure if i will keep it. very noisy, sloppy, water does not come out right away, then all of a sudden it shoots out. maybe i don&#x27;t know how to operate it correctly, but i am still undecided if i will keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally figured it was a defected model, returned it to Amazon, no cost to me, they picked it up at my house..(LOVE THAT). Sent me a new one, it works great,and my dentist said that my gums are looking better from using it,along with the bloodroot liquid that the dentist suggested i add to the water.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it for my gums and added to my daily routine the waterpik is a great addition for me.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer was disappointed that the new units did not have quite the power of the older units.  I agree, although I feel that the highest setting is sufficient to do the job.  My previous Interplak irrigator finally died after 6 years of regular use.  I am a practicing  dentist so I have seen first hand the benefits of this irrigator.  The pulsing action of the water improves the circulation of the gums.  This is a great instrument for everyone but especially those who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t floss.  I like putting a tablespoon of mouthwash into the water to make the water taste better and it kills a few bugs at the same time.</li>
    <li> Does the job. A little noisy but for the price I can live with that</li>
    <li> Easily this is the best product of its kind on the market.  Much more powerful than other brands  (which I&#x27;ve tried and returned), and totally reliable.  This is a second unit for my other home.  Original product is still working perfectly three years later.  Gets stuff floss will never reach.  Quite amazing.</li>
    <li> I have used dental water jets for many years. For me I could use more pressure at the end of the pik. So far my unit works good</li>
    <li> this is a excellent product. I know someone who has one and it was highly recommended.</li>
    <li> broke 2 days after we got it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years &amp; love it. In fact, I believe that it has saved me a lot of dental work.  I purchased this last one for my Grandson who has braces &amp; feel that it will be very beneficial to his dental hygiene.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife, a dental hygenist, brought home a couple of these, one for us and one for her sister&#x27;s family.  Everyone likes it.  I then bought another from Amazon (for cheaper than she got it from her office) for her sister&#x27;s young son, who likes it a lot, but wanted one of his own. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had ours for close to a year, and we use it every day, usually twice each.</li>
    <li> I just bought this last week and tried it out lastnight. I owned one of the older models previously but never used it. Well, I bought this item as a gift from my father (he had given me a gift card) it is a cute little set up. The kids liked the looks of it, but were scared when it came time to use it. My three year old daughter tried it but my five year old son would not come near it. The water-pressure is very strong. I have no complaints about the power of this item. My only complaint is that I wish there was a way to suction all of the water out of your mouth like at the dentist office. My daughter simply swallows all of it. I prefer to spit it out. Any ideas? Overall it is pretty good to clean your teeth and gums!</li>
    <li> Great aid for oral hygiene. It is compact and excellent for travel.  Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have had a Conair Interplak Water Jet for many years, using it every night. My dentist says it has been doing a very great job on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get a backup Water Jet in case my existing one stops working. I was delighted to find that this new one is just as fine as my old one and now I have two!&lt;br /&gt;I love my Interplak Water Jet!</li>
    <li> The Conair water jet is the best, uncomplicated to use and  much less expensive than others that do the same job.</li>
    <li> This is the best water jet product out there, I think I&#x27;ve been using water blasters since I was 16 Today is Oct 15, 2016 and I&#x27;ve used this product since 2011 I&#x27;m happy!  I would also recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Although there is a strength setting 1-10, there isn&#x27;t much difference in the force of the water. It would be nice if setting the spray at 1 was more gentle than it actually is.</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; I have used an older version of the Interplak for about 3 years before it lost pressure.   We decided it was a pretty good buy for $25.99.  WRONG!   The \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; is not the same at all.  It is: &lt;br /&gt;NOISIER &lt;br /&gt;HAS LESS PRESSURE &lt;br /&gt;THE PRESSURE DOESN&#x27;T adjust &lt;br /&gt;AND WORSE, it causes static to occur on the TV while running. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste you money on this one.   We are very disappointed!</li>
    <li> It ran good and I liked the different attachments, but I gave it away because I was uncomfortable with not having a lid like my previous one did.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with purchase. Had used Conair in the past and worked wonderfully. Expected newer version to be at least up to par or even better. Instead, water pressure is very weak and barely cleans my teeth. Take that into account when purchasing your next irrigator.</li>
    <li> I use this several times a day for irrigating my teeth and gums.  It has several pressure settings and I use the lowest as it is gentle but does a thorough job.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about 5 months, lots of water pressure. Then one day, very little water pressure. Next day, no pressure at all.</li>
    <li> I loathe flossing. So sue me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t convict me of gingivitis. This Water Jet has removed all the little \\&quot;sore spots\\&quot; that I was concerned about - they show up as places where the bubbles collect if you gargle with half-strength hydrogen peroxide - with two uses. That&#x27;s a single day&#x27;s usage. You bet I&#x27;m going to be using it twice daily from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Interplak!</li>
    <li> Had one previously. Had Water Pick and it did not last but a year or two. Have bought one for daughter and granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these for my Grandchildren. They love them. Great for people who hate flossing. Most kids do not and this they will use.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  It is flimsy, horribly loud, and has to be coaxed to start up.  Really junky plastic.  Not a bargain.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product. I think that the highest setting has enough pressure to work effectively but it might be a little weak compared to others. I believe this product to work decently well and you can add hydrogen peroxide or other antiseptic cleaners to it. The reservoir is short lasting but not a big deal...</li>
    <li> Works good and does the job, plenty of power, dentist said not to run on high but about midway.</li>
    <li> My original Waterjet (20+yrs old) was taking a very long time to do its job and, even at the max setting, was not pulsing as it should.  Looked all over and decided why change what works so I purchased the same model only, obviously, newer.  Excellent choice.  I am very pleased and enjoy the pulsing as it should be.  Actually had to dial it down a bit.  Amazing how you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been missing till it works like it should.</li>
    <li> Had same machine for over 9 years till the tube got old. Tried different machines. Didn&#x27;t like any of them. Went for same Conair Interplak machine! Seems like the pressure is lower than in previous one but it is still best value on the market. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> could use a little more water storage, but perfect for everything i needed!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, and easy setup! Best price.</li>
    <li> Can floss, brush and drive to the dentist before this item begins to work! Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money!</li>
    <li> Great product and on time delivery</li>
    <li> I had one of these for 15 years and it worked great until the hose sprung a leak. I got a new one and the psi is way down. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> This was the best deal on a water jet &amp; it works GREAT! use it twice a day love it so much</li>
    <li> Although I use it and it appears the same as the original older version looks at a glance,  it&#x27;s not.  There is NO comparison  It is lighter weight (motor) which means it vibrates off the counter as it is being used.  I must be careful to watch that it does not fall off the counter.  It&#x27;s power (motor) is  weaker and that is quickly noticed. It does not perform the same as the old version.  Even the water pik attachment choices,  one has already broke off.  I&#x27;m  looking for a replacement because I am very disappointed with this Conair Interplak Classic Dental Waterjet.  When it comes to choosing a Star Rating, here it is.  I&#x27;m really between  (I don&#x27;t like it)  and wish I could find a better one. And, ( I like it) because I don&#x27;t have anything else and need to use something.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Conair interplak water jet with this purchase.  I was happy to see it was still available and still very REASONABLE!!!!  It&#x27;s the SAME as it was more than a decade ago.  I rated it a 4, however, because the implements fit so TIGHT, I need to use a towel to get a secure grip to remove them from the squirter.  Also, the flow of water appears to be \\&quot;stuck\\&quot;, but once I give a \\&quot;suck\\&quot; on the water jet implement, it works just fine.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this. For your dental hygiene, this is a must.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used dental irrigators for years, including veru expensive, name brand unit.  This particular model I&#x27;ve used daily for the past 5-years plus.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I&#x27;m 65-years old and have all my teeth - thanks in part to this device. It cleans to the gum line without damaging the gums.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer says that this device is a supplement to floss. In other words, it cleans the dirt out from between your teeth and thatr is it. You are better off using floss to clean between your teeth plus your gums. My dentist does not  recommend using this alone, so why bother and use floss in the first place</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this would be a good replacement for a ViaJet water flosser ($45.95) that I had for two years until the tubing cracked.  This Conair unit is relatively quiet, at least compared to the ViaJet.  The water tank is rather small, but I kept a glass full of water next to it while using the device so that I could easily refill the tank.  It worked fine, at full pressure, for five or six times.  Then no pumping action.  The motor ran, but no water came out.  I checked the valve at the bottom of the tank, and it was not stuck.  I tried all the pressure settings.  Nothing helped.  Returned the item.</li>
    <li> Loved this but water flow started crapping out after about six months despite cleaning with vinegar and water as Conair suggests. Waiting for replacement.</li>
    <li> This broke within 45 days of purchase.  Last person to discovered floss was both cheaper and more effective.</li>
    <li> Worked ok, but the filter was gone in less than a month and I cannot use it without the filter because the water runs out everywhere. wish I could have returned the product</li>
    <li> I bought this because my old unit stopped working. I prefer interplak to waterpik. So far works well. I am happy.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Been using since the first time I saw one.  Conair makes great, useful products.  When my old one broke, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, then I was so grateful to find it here!  Turned a friend on to it, and he bought one, too!  I couldn&#x27;t live without it!  Use it every time I eat, before AND after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I wish could be improved is the size of the water container - needs to be filled often, but it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
    <li> The last Conair water jet I had lasted at least 15 years before it slowly died--(gave me a warning!)--and this one works even better than my old one--my granddaughter has just gotten her braces so I bought 2 of them--she loves it--and her siblings --without braces--are also using it--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great oral hygiene--I use it probably 3-4 times a day--I don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; between my teeth after I eat--</li>
    <li> Machine does not have as much pressure as I thought it would. Machine worked maybe two times and that was it, now the water doesn&#x27;t come our so it&#x27;s basically sueles. Is there anyway that i could returned it?</li>
    <li> I  already  own  one  so  this  was  just  a  spare  and  for  traveling  .  I  am  very  happy  with  both .</li>
    <li> I love it! After brushing, I use itand the remaining material it  removes is substantial.</li>
    <li> Works good so far.  My gums are definitely more clean.  The 3 foot cord for the pik itself could be longer.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement of one that I had for about 10 years. Same model &amp; brand. First one lasted a long time, why not replace it with same thing.</li>
    <li> Wasted my money this water pic doesn&#x27;t have any power the tank is too small also...</li>
    <li> product arrived in good condition,</li>
    <li> Easiest way to take care of the health of your teeth.  This little unit will do all you need to keep your teeth water pik clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have an old one and when the dentist told my husband to get one I came right back here to Conair....tried and true and doesn&#x27;t matter how old the unit...mine still works perfect and it is 10 years old...</li>
    <li> I have had 2 Interplak Water Jets identical to this one which I bought from my dentist. They work a month or two, then quit. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Not as powerfull as the &#x27;other brand&#x27; but gets the job done.Still working after all this time too. Very sturdy machine.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time - was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Kinda of archaic, but it does the job and is indispensable once you get in the habit of using it every day. And I&#x27;m sure it has prevented at least one cavity. I wish it were more durable -- I&#x27;ve had 3 of these the past 7 years.</li>
    <li> I recommended water jet using for teeth cleanning. This product is very useful and practical for a good hygienic of the mouth.</li>
    <li> Works well at first but looses its effectiveness as a function of time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works on the teeth, but I will keep tying. nice with warm water . and you have to learn how to use it with out having water all over.</li>
    <li> I bought this Conair Water Jet to replace my old one. This is obviously built much more cheaply than my old one. It&#x27;s lighter (no leaded weight to hold it in place) and the stream seems a lot less powerful. It does the job and I do like it, but am disappointed in the cheapening of their product.</li>
    <li> The device has several issues. 1) Both of the tips for basic cleansing are defective.  One of the 2 is virtually plugged and the other has too large an exit orifice.  The result is almost no flow in one case and too-rapid flow in the other.  2) The pressure/volume control is so difficult to turn that one has to hold the unit down with one hand and crank the knob with the other. 3) a pair of design flaws exists.  My old unit (virtually identical) worked well for years. The former and current products share one design flaw:  The knobs are so close to the bottom of the unit that they are hard to turn - especially on the replacement.  A human finger does not fit between the counter and the bottom of the knob - making it inconvenient to turn - aggravating issue (2) above. In a less crucial vein - the tank is now blue vs the former clear.  My dentist suggests that I had Listerine to the water to kill off bacteria while power washing my teeth.  The blue color makes it impossible to judge the amount of Listerine in the water.  This is a minot point - but one I encounter with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom lione: I would recommend this product to no one.</li>
    <li> This machine is easy to use. Does an excellect job. I just wish reservoir for water was larger.  It is a good buy well worth the cost. I will be ordering two more for my grandchildren.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it all the time. Even a perfect fit for the location I use it in.</li>
    <li> I used to by the InterPlak at Target and couldn&#x27;t find it now that I needed it again. So I thought I would check to see it I could by it on Amazon. I found it and bought it. I have been using the InterPlak for 15 years and the motor gave out on my second one. Thank you for having it in stock. I will purchace the InterPlak at Amazon from here on out!    Patti Camp</li>
    <li> Unless you want to buy a whole new unit every time yours breaks, keep in mind that there are no replacement parts (other than tips) available after two years.  My reservoir valve on the holding tank started to leak and I couldn&#x27;t get Conair to sell me either the valve or a new reservoir because I was out of warranty.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years - really cleans the space between the teeth .</li>
    <li> Two years ago I bought this to replace the Interplak water jet I had used (and loved) for years.  On this new model the water pressure is very weak, the motor sounds inadequate and like it may quit at any time and strains and slows if you turn the pressure setting higher.   Since purchase I have occasionally attempted to use this product again, thinking I must be &amp;#34;doing something wrong&#x27;.  Even at its highest setting, it produces a meager stream of water that is totally inadequate.  Are the newer Conair Interplak models better?  I&#x27;m not wasting any more money to find out and I am divesting myself of this useless dental paperweight today.</li>
    <li> Had a Conair WJ7b water jet, excellent for years, changes in this new product bearing the same number degraded performance - it doesn&#x27;t pump as smoothly, removed a cord storage compartment which makes it less convienent. Unfortunately I bought two of them!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement for one that I had used for years.  It is compact and more comfortable to use than the Waterpik flosser that I used prior to this purchase.  Only bad thing is that it is noisy.  Delivery was quick</li>
    <li> Works great to clean teeth and gums. Sometimes hard to get it pulsating on forceful setting after reservoir is empty &amp;  refilled. Best to not let reservoir run out of water.</li>
    <li> this is my wifes 5 one. they all seems to stop working. no pressure or the ac eventually break where it enters the unit</li>
    <li> To be good: if it send to Europe, I want to saw a notice about need adapter from 120V to 220V</li>
    <li> The pressure spray did not change with the knob that was supposed to work for that purpose.  There is no difference in setting 7 from setting 1.  This is a major disappointment for me and its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Very useful product for cleaning in between the gums and teeth to remove minute particles.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th water jet I&#x27;ve bought even though none of them ever worked. Sadly, it is the only model I can use on my hybrid implants, so I just keep buying more. This lousy device is without a doubt the most maddening thing I&#x27;ve ever dealt with and I actualy threw the third one I tried against the wall in a fit of utter and complete frustration. After you fill it with water, you turn the knob to the ON position and a stream is supposed to emerge immediately, but with this piece iof crap it takes up to an hour before any water spews forth. I used to stand in front of the sink holding the jet, waiting for the water to start flowing, but this either took 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes and sometimes it didn&#x27;t happen at all. It&#x27;s a truly useless piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> Did what they said before first use.  Got lots of noise and a drop or two of water.  After ten minutes got an intermittent, about 30 seconds between weak, skinny stream that just dribbled into my mouth.  Never got better.  After three tries, packed it up for return, not exchange.  In 20 years I have had two Via Jets that worked perfectly.  One turned yellowish after about 6 years, possibly due to what my housekeeper cleaned it with, but I cleaned the new one myself and just threw it away the day I ordered this Conair WJ7BR.  A guest had knocked it into the basin while it was plugged in and it shorted out.  What a loss.  I have bought numerous items on Amazon and this is first I have ever returned.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t buy this useless item.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these as a back-up a couple of years ago&lt;br /&gt;went to use it today and  you guessed it ..  the hose had&lt;br /&gt;apparently dried out and broke into pieces in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;When I called customer service to order a new one, they&lt;br /&gt;said Conair doesn&#x27;t carry spare hoses  and that there is&lt;br /&gt;no way that you can buy one,  other than to buy another&lt;br /&gt;new unit.... the rest of the machine is fine..... This&lt;br /&gt;is a lousey way to run a business .... Don&#x27;t waste you&lt;br /&gt;money on this product with planned obselescence quiet&lt;br /&gt;obviously  built in .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little surprised by most of the comments here. I&#x27;ve had this model for about four years, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it (although, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently). I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s any noisier than the Waterpik. It may be a little weaker at its lowest settings, but that&#x27;s the point - it has a continuous power adjustment, as opposed to the Waterpik, which has only three settings (I think). I set it at about the middle of the range. I feel that this is adequate, as a couple of hygienists have told me that, when used at their highest settings, irrigators can be damaging to teeth and gums (Actually, one tried to warn me off of them altogether!). The last Waterpik I tried (which was, admittedly, four years ago when I bought this one instead) was too forceful, and had a water hose that was much too short.    My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little ungainly looking on the bathroom counter. It looks like a sixties artist&#x27;s conceptualization of a futuristic oral care device, like something from the Jetsons! When I have company, I put it under the vanity.    All that said, it has been an extremely useful adjunct to brushing and flossing. My mouth is small, my teeth are spaced very closely together, and my gums are sensitive, so I&#x27;m never able to get all of the debris out by flossing alone. I recommend it.    Edit 03/06/2009: My original review was for the WJ7. A number of people have complained that this newer model, the WJ7B, is underpowered.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and am very satisfied with it.  The pressure that it produces is more than enough to clean my teeth.  The water resevoir is a little small, but I just use a glass to fill it adding some mouthwash and then have a second glassful of water that I pour in when the unit empties the first time.  If you have trouble getting the water started, just suck on the tip of the irrigator head and the flow will begin.</li>
    <li> Having nursed a Braun water jet to its extinction, it was difficult to choose a new unit.  Having owned the Conair Interplak Water Jet for almost 2 years now, I know that I made the correct choice.  The unit is compact, adjusts to 7 different speeds, comes with four heads, and cleans easily.  The noise level is acceptable.  And, it has no metal parts exposed that will rust.  What more can I say?  The only glitch is that occasionally the water flow does not start right away (happens less than 1% of the time) -- easily remedied by sucking on the head like a siphon.</li>
    <li> It works like the old one did for 12 yrs</li>
    <li> My dentist insists I use a water jet once a day preferable before going to bed. This one is a good price, is attractive, and does a good job. But unlike other brands that I have used in the past, this one seems to need to be &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34; nearly every time I use it. That means turning the intensity switch back and forth rather than leaving it at my preferred setting. Once it starts, it has a nice pulsing action which i think does a great job cleaning food particles from my teeth.</li>
    <li> I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it&#x27;s completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn&#x27;t pump water anymore. I wouldn&#x27;t get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they&#x27;ll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I&#x27;d rate this unit as \\&quot;build quality: poor, life span: short, effectiveness: disappointing\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is third purchase.  After many years the first one broke and reordered another.  The third one is that we need one for our summer home and would not order anything else.  It really works well. Highly recommend.  Need to follow directions when it is first used.</li>
    <li> This is my third copy of this product. The first one failed within a year but the second one lasted a couple of years and I was able to repair it using parts from the first one. The fixed version then lasted over 5 years. I use it for several minutes every day and am pleased with how it cleans my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is actually for my father and he was very pleased with it. A matter of fact he was happy enough with it. He had me order an extra. This is the extra one.</li>
    <li> Stick with a better brand.  This has a lower price but you&#x27;ll soon see it in the bottom of the trash like me.  It was okay at first -- not as good as the water pik it replaced but alot cheaper.  it then steadily lost power until it was down to a trickle after about 9 months.  why does nothing last anymore?  well, the walmartization of the country demands everything be under a certain dollar amount no matter what a piece of you know what.    I&#x27;m going back to the better brands that do what they say they&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try despite some of the negative reviews.  I was disappointed with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t have enough power, is rather noisy and makes a lot more mess than I expected.  Knowing it&#x27;s a water pik, I expected there to be water spillage, but this was just too much.  I had to clean the mirror, the sink and the floor when I was done.  I didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were any cleaner after using this tool.  I&#x27;ve since packed it away.</li>
    <li> Overall a good unit but not quite powerfull enough as against the standard &#x27;Water Pik&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to discover this model is a little too gentle for me.  Even at the highest setting it is gentle.  Lots of water comes out (good irrigation) but it is more of a stream than a pulse. The last time I owned this model it gave strong pulses.  This latest model makes me wish I had purchased a \\&quot;WaterPik\\&quot; instead (though my last Waterpik was hard to control which way it squirted!    It remains a good value and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and well worth the money and usage each day. It does a phenomonal job of cleaning teeth and gums comfortably. I am amazed at the cleaning depth and power, yet being comfortable at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to purchase this product retail, and was overwhelmed by the domination of Water Pik in the retail stores. My hygenist insisted on the Interplak product and it was a great purchase.Conair WJ7B Interplak water jet</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I find it easy to attach and remove plastic cup holder from base. Nice assortment of attachments. I use it daily after flossing.</li>
    <li> I have to use a water jet dental cleaning system and Conair has cut their costs in the mfg of this.  The  hose line cracked on my previous one in one yr. and it was out of warranty.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy another of this brand when this one goes.  My original Interplak lasted over 15+ yrs.</li>
    <li> Be careful not to lose the little plug from the inside of the reservoir; that&#x27;s the only reason I had to buy another unit.  I called Conair and they don&#x27;t ship replacement parts past warranty, sad but since I like the unit so much, I bought another one and am now more careful about that little plug piece.  I like the way my gums and teeth feel after using the Water Jet, seems to do a better job than string floss.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for a family member, looks like it will get plenty of use.</li>
    <li> Works ok. But pump won&#x27;t prime unassisted.  Have to work the pressure switch to get the pump to prime.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Does not have the jet tips that were in the advertised photo.  Only has 4 of the regular tips enclosed with unit.</li>
    <li> The product works but... it&#x27;s not quite as powerful/sturdy as the older version that it replaced.  The older one lasted for years.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these we&#x27;ve purchased because the quality of WaterPik has become so disappointing (I&#x27;m sure similar story as below). The first one from years ago was bulletproof and would still be working today had the cat not started chewing on the discharge tube. The second one was for our daughter and so we didn&#x27;t realized the change in the units (the model number in now slightly different even though they look the same). This 3rd one (a new model type as well) has almost no water pressure whatsoever. This third unit weighs almost nothing whereas the first unit was heavy. I have to assume it&#x27;s because a much cheaper pump is now being used in the unit. This new one is so light that slight tugging on the discharge tube while rinsing will pull the whole unit towards you- even with water in it. I think the plastic lid for the water reservoir weighs more than the whole unit combined. Also, even though I&#x27;ve learned to not run the water completely out of the reservoir, it still frequently loses it&#x27;s prime after you refill it and have to shut it off, hold the tip below water level in the sink, turn it on, wait for it to prime, turn it back off, then it will work properly. I&#x27;m sure the CEO&#x27;s kids of this company go to the best schools because he (or she) delivered shareholder value by making the stock go up by turning another good product to cheap junk. So many products have gone this way for the same reason. I&#x27;d rather pay more and have something that both works and will last. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does work, just not very well.</li>
    <li> This Water-Pik is everything that is stated and then some. I HIGHLY support it. It is also at a vantestic price too.</li>
    <li> Terrible product cheaply made and extremely ineffective.  Doesn&#x27;t work half the time.  VERY, VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> This unit will last between six months and a year before it fails. Maybe sooner if used daily. It&#x27;s a cheaply made knockoff that&#x27;s great initially but continually loses pressure with use.</li>
    <li> It is good, much better than Waterpik, not as good as one of its previous models. It will do the job.</li>
    <li> The water jar on my old Interplak broke -- after about 15 years -- and I didn&#x27;t know if I could order spare parts, so I purchased a whole new unit. It arrived in a few days, well-packed, and it looks about the same as my old one. Very few changes have been made -- which is good. It is a very reliable product, and, at my age I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never have to purchase another new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It works ok but is very loud.  If you put it on to high the water sprays everywhere.  Its just ok.</li>
    <li> The product works very well. The only reason I put 4 stars is that you kind of have to suck on the wand to get the water started right away. If you don&#x27;t do this, the water does come out but it just takes a bit longer. Otherwise, it is very comparable to a much more expensive water pic I have.</li>
    <li> The device comes with 4 different tips.  One of these has a small opening.  I bet that many of the people who find this device too weak are using that particular tip by bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Interplak is not as strong as a WaterPik.  But in my experience it lasts about five times as long, and is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> &amp;Eacute; simples e muito bom ,estava ansioso para usar ,pois havia lido algo a respeito do conair ,mas superou as expectativas,recomento a todos.Fiz o pedido via internet e recebi aqui no Brasil.</li>
    <li> My husband is over 70. Use of this product seems to have helped with receding gum issues, and made visits to the dentist less frequent.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad. He likes it and uses it every day. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 of these as gifts. One of them has already stopped working. :(</li>
    <li> Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet--Sounds like a Mac truck shifting gears.  Does not work everytime without moving the water cup over and over.  One time we just gave up.  Very irritating.  We have another that we had bought from the maker and it is still working wonderfully and is not noisey.  Not satified.What can I do in order to get one that works and be able to return this one that does not work?</li>
    <li> I am getting used to this, and I like it much better than using regular floss. It is a little messy at first, but when you get the hang of it the benefits are amazing. It is a must have product.</li>
    <li> I have this for years and gave it to my son for Christmas and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a great water floss. The container holds more than I use at one time. I love the different levels and different adaptors.</li>
    <li> I bought this since I had an older version (6 years old) that broke that I loved.  I thought this one would be as good but it is not.  it does not have as strong a flow and has bad vibration and is noisy.  IT is OK but not as good as the older version.</li>
    <li> I bought the Conair WJ7BR interplak water jet,  on the recommendation of my dental hygienist, who said she felt this model gave users the most control over the jet. I owned my first one for many years and when it finally broke I bought a Waterpik model as a replacement. Big mistake, I returned it the same day and ordered another Conair from Amazon. After trying the Waterpik I realized what I loved about the Conair. The water container fits under my vanity faucet - unlike the Waterpik which could only be filled from the tub faucet,but most important the switch on the Conair allows you to  very easily control the flow of water using both hands if needed.  The force of the jet is easily changed with many settings not just high and low and there are many available tips to use, although I am happy with just the one that suits me. The Conair was also less expensive than the other make.</li>
    <li> Great when you have braces</li>
    <li> Interplak IS the best, besides HydroFloss. I use Interplak for one of my bathrooms. Better pressure than Waterpic! Sorry, IMPO I&#x27;ve been through a few over the years.&lt;br /&gt;  Try 15 drops of Grape Seed Extract from Amazon (best price for large bottle) in your water, to flush your mouth! Awesome suggestion from my hygienist - good luck! Anti-oxidant with + results!!!</li>
    <li> Unit is very loud but works just ok.  Water stream is heavy no matter what setting.</li>
    <li> my old water jet ,Died, while looking online, There again , Amazon had ---THE  BEST Price, so I purchased this model</li>
    <li> fresh mouth works good</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a great water pick! It has enough water pressure and various attachments. It is also small enough to easily store when not in use.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with my teeth and use this waterjet several times a day - it does a great job - I&#x27;ve had the more expensive brands and styles but this is perfect for me</li>
    <li> Only had for a few days and it leaks. This item didn&#x27;t have exchanges or returns so money was wasted :(</li>
    <li> i loved it! only thing that stinks is you need to be careful or the water will go everywhere. it worked really well and had enough pressure!</li>
    <li> The product came quickly, and in good working order. It does run out of water quickly but it certainly does the job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> When my dentist recommended using a Water Jet, I thought it was going to be one of those things you buy, use a few times, and forget about it.  Not True!  My first one lasted 10 years with daily use and when it died, I bought another one immediately.  I went from nearly losing my teeth to severe gum disease to having the dentist and the hygienist marvel at how healthy by gums are, especially for someone 72 years old.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful and easy to use. I like it very much; good product. I hope this quality better than the old one</li>
    <li> This new version I bought several months ago is very reliable and does all it promises to do. I had an earlier version that lasted eight years and I have high hopes this one will last as long. I recommend this very highly.</li>
    <li> It simply does not have enough power! The water reservoir is way too compact as well. It&#x27;s merely 10 ounces! It was annoying to refill the water during the middle of cleaning. I bought a Waterpik brand oral irrigator instead and am much more satisfied.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I gave up on the WaterPik for various reasons. After my last Waterpik failed completely, I bought a Conair Interplak WJ7 which I loved!  I did the job plus it was simple in design, had plenty of &#x27;power&#x27;, a perfectly adequate resevoir (for me anyway), and a lower price that WaterPik.  I then proceeded to buy one more each for my brother in FL, and my sister in MA, as I MUST have my WaterJet whenever I visit them.  Later I decided to get another one for the downstairs bathroom, so ordered this one from Amazon in Jan 04, despite many poor reviews, which surprised me.  Most of these one-star reviews cited low power.  Not a problem I figured, so continued on with the order.  Bottom line, this new Water Jet was a Model WJ7B, included some hokey attachments, and horrors -- low power!!!  I tried to use it, but finally gave up and actually threw it away in disgust.  How could Conair ever let such a poor performer get into production?  On the good side, a search of Google/Froogle shows what appear to be lots of sites still offering the superior WJ7, which I am going to order for my downstairs bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;David Carlson &lt;br /&gt;Fresno CA</li>
    <li> This is not my first one. This unit is very noisy. Does not appear to be as well made, but is still a good value for the money.&lt;br /&gt; Does not have cord storage like the others. I will purchase another when this one goes bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LGB</li>
    <li> This water pick has 1/3 the spray force of a Water Pick brand model 72. Be careful not to put warm water in the resevoir of this Conair. The piston will seize and the unit will be done for.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased this particular water jet.  Twice in between I tried others - one larger and bulkier and the other a portable model.  Both were disappointments.  This is compact, efficient, has better than sufficient power and is easy to keep clean and smoothly running.  I will never buy another brand or model.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the money.  I wish it had a little more power, but I do like it.</li>
    <li> Hey, this thing works fine.  Plenty of power, unless you&#x27;re using it to clean off your sidewalk. Sure, it&#x27;s not as powerful, and it is a bit noisier that the previous version that I had for about 5 years, but hey, this one is lighter. Okay,  I sometimes have to mess with the pressure level to get it to the usual power at level 3... but hey, remember, this is only a $30 item, what can be expected?  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months with warm water and a bit of peroxide added (rinse out the peroxide when finished), and am expecting it to last for another fifty-four.  Oral irrigation is a MUST if you value your teeth.  It&#x27;s amazing what is left after brushing and flossing.  Buy, Buy, Buy!    1/3/10- Two years later and it&#x27;s still doing a great job!!!  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine instrument.  I use it daily and it does a very fine job, makes the mouth feel truly clean.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product that helps me feel assured that I am doing my best to keep my teeth and gums in good condition</li>
    <li> Just got my first bridge and this works great to keep it clean.  It&#x27;s small so does not hold too much water.  But for the price, filling it twice is worth it</li>
    <li> This is a newer version of my old one that worked for many years. This new one worked fine for two cleanings then leaked badly.</li>
    <li> Best way to keep your teeth clean--easy to use and clean. Good pressure.</li>
    <li> Best water pick in the world. This is my second one. First one lasted about 8 years.</li>
    <li> The Conair Water Jet works just as well, if not better, than other \\&quot;Waterpic\\&quot; devices at half the cost! It has everything needed including the tongue cleaner, adjustable water pressure dial, an on off button on the handle to pause the water, easy to use and every kind of pick needed! Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Conair Water Jet with this one.  The old one which we had for about one year just stopped working.  It would not prime and start pumping.  After getting the new one, I read and followed the directions especially how to remove trapped air which will prevent it from pumping.  After only three days the new water jet would not pump.  I tried the sequence the directions stated but it just stopped working.  I returned it and spent the extra money to buy a Water Pik brand water jet and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is an inferior piece of garbage. It lasted just over one year and never quite worked properly during that time. The reservoir is small so to properly clean your teeth and gums, it needs refilling at least once, more like twice. The pressure was low and the machine was noisy. After a year, water leaked out and it refused to pump. This is junk I can not recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is great and met my expectations.  It is compact and has a strong water jet which can be easily increased or decreased.  This is the second one purchased; the first lasted 11 years!</li>
    <li> Works okay. Hold button hard to stop water jetting out everywhere with a trigger thumb.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat satisfied in the beginning but then my water pik started leaking and the top of the pik broke! Now it&#x27;s completely useless (even if you try to fix it with duck tape) and I think it was a total waste of money. Nobody wants water everywhere!!! It makes a mess and it is cheap plastic. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this. Plus the button to stop the water doesn&#x27;t work very well unless you push as hard as you can which is difficult to do when you are trying to simultaneously use the product on your teeth. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water and there is no warning in the instructions that if you don&#x27;t hold down the button when you turn the water on you will get yourself soaked.  Nice one conair. 😠</li>
    <li> Very, very, very cheaply made.  I used this twice and it worked only after I struggled with it.  The clips that held the water container broke after the second use and then the water could not go through it.  It was almost impossible to turn the dials on it as they were so tight. Luckily, Amazon stood behind the product since water jets cannot be returned.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product!  I only gave it a 1 star since there was nothing lower to give it.  It is headed for the garbage today. [[ASIN:B00000J9DU Conair WJ7BR Interplak Water Jet]]</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my parents.. and I guess its good because they absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> The first of these lasted at least five years and was very satisfactory. Cleaned my teeth very nicely. dealing with Amazon is always quite satisfying. this is dictated on my iPad and leaves something to be desired in sentence formation and punctuation</li>
    <li> The motor is buzzy and the spray is weak. Can&#x27;t compare to the old versions, It&#x27;ll last till the hose breaks again.</li>
    <li> The dentist recommended a water jet system for better dental care.  I choose the Interplak because of the lower cost when compared to other brands.  Since I have never used any water jet sysyem before I cannot compare its performance to other products, but I can say I am very pleased with the Interplak. It has a great jet stream that invigorates my gums.  It is simple to use and is compact enough to fit nicely in my sink area.</li>
    <li> This item is of lesser quality with compare to a previous one I had. The knob of variable speed is producing basically the same speed. The stream of water is very weak.. I returned this item to the seller.</li>
    <li> 1. The attachments are held in place with an O-ring which lost its grip after 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The unit doesn&#x27;t build up enough pressure to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WaterPiks kept failing every 2 years, so I tried this and it is much worse.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I had a OLD one and is stop working after 15 years... I order the water jet and it was at my front step the next day. It&#x27;s a lot stronger then the old one. (I love it) the only down side is the tank arrived broken but my old tank fit amazing. So I&#x27;m happy over all.</li>
    <li> I Got It As A Gift For My Husband He Loves It , Great Deal</li>
    <li> The item broke in 2 months after I bought it. I haven&#x27;t seeing such a crappy device like this in a long time. How come anyone allows to sell such a useless machine like this?</li>
    <li> As two of the one-star reviewers had complained, the hose is a weak area.  I used it only a few times, because the pressure was only so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I tried to use it again and was surprised that the hose cracked.  I then found that the hose cannot be fixed because the entire hose has become brittle.  So I decided to come here to see if someone has similar problems and has found a solution.  Sad to say, there is no way to replace the hose and indeed there are others who experienced the same problem as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will need to get another brand.  Because this was a quality of material issue, I will not get Interplak but will try Waterpik instead this time.  The company could have easily used better quality hose but chose not to.  Most likely, I will have to toss the whole thing out, simply because poor quality plastic was used for the hose.  It&#x27;s planned obsolescence/failure, as I see it.  But the manufacturer forgot that people are unlikely to go back to the same brand for a replacement product and most likely won&#x27;t ever try the brand again, when the issue is very poor quality of material.  So it is not profit maximization, but customer loss maximization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is far better to use good material and quality to ensure that the device lasts as long as possible, and that&#x27;s how customer loyalty and brand loyalty is established.  Because there are competitive products, using poor quality is a sure way to lose first-time customers permanently and lose market share steadily over time as a result.</li>
    <li> Love this, have bought and returned other brands because they are just too noisy.  This makes noise, but not too much.  This is the second one I purchased.  My first one lasted 5 years.</li>
    <li> The water cup does a balancing act on top and is not sturdy. The motor or pump seems to start whenever it wants after I turn it on. Is this delayed start an intentional thing,or is this a problem?</li>
    <li> This is real good, I would have given it a 5-star, but sometimes it takes a little time to get started, so it kinda makes me nervous as to how long it would last, but I ordered another one for my friend anyway, because he needs one, and nothing else is more handy, either they are too awkward, bulky, or they are too expensive. Oh, well. You can&#x27;t have EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use and price was reasonable.  Would recommend this product to anyone, compared to others, works great...</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is very good, has given me a suitable oral hygiene, consumption of batteries is not very high.</li>
    <li> Yeah shipping awesome product</li>
    <li> It does a great job. However, it is a little cumbersome trying to pour water into it without having to remove the container each time.</li>
    <li> Bad product. Had to return it because the water was shooting out the brush wand from the bottom where the hose was connected. This product is noisy, moves, and the water drains out fast.</li>
    <li> I have had this for around 6 months and I like this one even better than my waterpic. Works just great for me.</li>
    <li> I like it.  The different options provided for tooth and gum care meet my expectations and are a positive addition to my equipment.</li>
    <li> Received unit today and tried it out.  Had used the old WJ7 for many years before it pooped out.  Bought this thinking it was the same unit.  They look the same but the old WJ7 weighs in at 2lb 6 oz and the new one weighs 1lb 3 oz. The most notable difference is the weight.  The new version actually is better looking.  Now for its performance.  I liked the old unit because it would deliver a steady stream at an adjustable force.  This delivers a stream with comparable force, and it is fairly non-pulsing like the first one.  If you don&#x27;t get a strong stream at first you probably have to make sure the pump is primed.  As  one other person said in his comments suck on the tip until it is primed.  The one big question is:  Will it last as long as the first unit?  My opinion is probably not.  But, overall I am happy with the unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. it was just as described.</li>
    <li> Liked the size &amp; style, but not enough power from water pick... had a Conair before which had more force behind the water... this one barely pulsates - makes no difference whether on low or high, just no water pressure :(</li>
    <li> The shipper was great. The product was a replacement for a Water Jet that wore out. Over the years it seems the quality of the product is not as good as it used to be. I don&#x27;t expect this Water Jet to last as long as my last one. I was disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> This was an overall great product. It shipped very quickly and is easy to use. The only problem I have is that I have to suck on the tip to make the water come out because of the air bubbles that can occur, but it&#x27;s nothing too bad. :)</li>
    <li> I recommend this product but if you dont have lots of bathroom counter space like me, it ends up in the cabinet and I dont use it like I should.  I should have purchased something smaller but this is a good product</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping - a very positive experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Water Pik flosser and so far I like it.  I like how easy it is to take apart. It is a bit louder than my old water pik but the pressure is fine and I like all of the attachments.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Did not work when I got it.</li>
    <li> A Waterpik I had for a few months died quite suddenly so I went online to review waterjets.  This Conair waterjet had several features I liked, and the price was very reasonable.  I have used this unit for five months, and it is much superior to the Waterpik I had.  It has considerably more water pressure than the Waterpik and the pressure can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> If this one lasts as long as our first one, we will be very happy.  The weak part was the hose.</li>
    <li> It has a lot less power than the one it replaced. The old one looks the same but has much more power.  took the hose from the new one and replaced the leaking hose on the old one. Now my old one works great again.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the Conair Interplak Water Jet.  This is my second of this exact same model.  My first one lasted about 8 years and 4 moves!!  I retired the old one last year and was so happy to find it was still being sold.  If this one lasts that long I will have spent my money very wisely.  It has good water pressure and is easy to use.  You can control the flow with the button on the hand held part so that you can take it out of your mouth and not shoot water all over.  It has another pressure control dial on the main unit so you can control the amount of pressure.  You can use mouthwash in it as well which is great because you are killing two birds with one stone.  I use it every day and my mouth feels so much fresher.  If I skip a day I can tell the difference in just a few hours.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a dental bridge (I have two).  It makes cleaning under your bridge so much easier than using the floss method and also, my gums are much healthier again.</li>
    <li> Excellent unit. Great pressure. A little noisy but OK. I do wish the water tank was a little bigger - so it doesn&#x27;t need to get refilled every 2 days.</li>
    <li> Very useful. I should&#x27;ve bought one years ago. It cleans your teeth extremely well. I mainly use the smaller diameter tip. It&#x27;s good for getting down inside your gums.</li>
    <li> This Water Pix is average, they all have built-in obsolescence. The pump, tubing &amp; tips are no better or worse than higher priced Water Pics. Be very careful not to “bite down” on the tip, even moderate tooth pressure will deform the inside diameter of these tips soft plastic causing water flow stoppage.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same make, model and size of the one I previously purchased many years ago.  However, this one is so light I sometimes accidentally knock it off the ledge  by the sink that it is on. The motor is evidently not as heavy.  And it does not have as intense a setting that my previous one did.  I&#x27;m not as happy with it as I thought I would be, but it is adequate.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a very old version which often would not start. Unit works fine and the pump starts promptly every time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it worked beautifully.  Ordered a new one since the tank cracked and could not be replaced.  The one sent is useless,&lt;br /&gt;the stop does not pop as it should to allow the water to flow.  Truthfully if I still had the box I would have returned it. I am beginning to wonder if there is a difference in the quality when order thru Amazon as opposed to the manufacture directly.</li>
    <li> Last longer and more affordable than the &#x27;other&#x27; water jet.  The last one we had lasted 4 years, can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I have 2 boys ages 15 &amp; 19 who I bought these for. They recently got braces and aren&#x27;t huge fans of flossing but definitely use this every day!</li>
    <li> I really love using this water flosser especially after my wisdom teeth were removed......</li>
    <li> I have used Conair products for some 30 years and have always been pleased with performance.  This product meets all my expectations and performance features.</li>
    <li> delivered in perfect shape</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these water pics and though it is the same make and model as my first one it doesn&#x27;t work as well.  The dials are hard to turn and it isn&#x27;t as powerful.</li>
    <li> Works as described and supplied tools easy to attach</li>
</ol>
