      <li>Love this item .....</li>

      <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>I got my hair cut at Supercuts or Great Clips and the girl used this stuff on my hair, I didn&#x27;t think much until that evening when I got home</li>
      <li>So glad to see Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I also love that Paul Mitchell is against animal testing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m desperately in love and hooked for life.</li>
      <li>I have used this for about 3 years and love it.</li>
      <li>The scent is very nice and the price is decent.</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, you will love this.  </li>
      <li>While giving great hold, it leaves your hair feeling soft and flexible.  </li>
      <li>This gel is great, I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>The best part is that I can touch my hair all day and it won&#x27;t frizz or fluff up.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but lots of it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this works wonders giving me a smooth, silky finish.  </li>
      <li>so you never run out and can enjoy the 15% discount in using it.</li>
      <li>But if she uses some of this stuff it will remain obedient.</li>
      <li>Flexible product that works great for my short hair.</li>
      <li>It is comparable to the Noodle Head Kick Up Your Curls or the Got2B Smooth Operator or Fantasia Liquid Mousse in my opinion</li>
      <li>It is a light styling product.  </li>
      <li>so my hair is pretty soft and shiny every day, but this stuff made it even more so and it smells so freaking good</li>
      <li>Nothing special, but it does the job.  </li>
      <li>This product smells wonderful - sweet orange - but it didn&#x27;t do the job on my hair, which, granted, is hard to curl or wave.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I really like that it is not like most hair gels.  </li>
      <li>I follow up with a quick spray of Hold</li>
      <li>I used to use gel to style my hair and then spray it down with hairspray to control fly aways.</li>
      <li>Yesterday my stylist gave me a barely used bottle of this because I loved the scent so much.</li>
      <li>This product works great with Paul Mitchell Round Trip.</li>
      <li>After standing in the isle at Ulta obsessing and debating on which hair gel to try I finally decided on this one just because I liked the style of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I first tried this product when my hair stylist recommended it to me.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately it never came.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care a lot for hairspray so this cream gel works really well!  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I have used that keeps the frizzies away.</li>
      <li>On my short hair I easily get 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>although, don&#x27;t put too much on or else you will end up with the helmet look.</li>
      <li>fast shipping A++++++</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>this really didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
      <li>Hope it is the REAL deal since it&#x27;s for sale from amazon.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem since I started using Fast Form.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need too much of it and it lasts well.</li>
      <li>I have very one hair and when the weather gets humid my hair gets frizzy and manageable.</li>
      <li>Whenever we visit her family by the coast, or when it gets really humid around here, her hair frizzes out.</li>
      <li>Never again will I use Amazon to purchase my Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy and the bottle lasts for months, I do not have to buy it very often.</li>
      <li>My stylist gave me a sample of Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like to use this product after a perm as it makes my hair much softer and easier to manage.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Fast Form Cream for over a year.  </li>
      <li>Tried other Paul Mitchell gels and they were much better.</li>
      <li>It was great when I used a small amount before drying and then another tiny dollop as sealant/shine serum.</li>
      <li>You only need a small amount for great results.  </li>
      <li>I am most surprised by how long this one bottle lasts.</li>
      <li>Price is alittle high for the quantity you get.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I have fine naturally curly hair and this keeps it in shape with out the crispy, wet look that so many other products do.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want crunch hair, this is the product for you.  It is a light styling product.  I can&#x27;t stand any perfumes or smells.  This has no smell.  I have curly hair, and it does not dry it out like other products.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when my hair stylist recommended it to me. When he stopped carrying it, I was really sad because it works wonders for my extremely curly, thick hair. It provides a great textured hold without making your hair look like its had any product applied at all--although, don&#x27;t put too much on or else you will end up with the helmet look. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great product, I am so glad I found it again for an even more awesome price!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, you will love this.  It is very lightweight, gives you volume without weighing your hair down.  Also, nice smell, sort of smells like peaches.  It is hard to find in alot of hair salons for some reason, glad I searched on Amazon and found it.  Don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product.</li>
    <li> I really like to use this product after a perm as it makes my hair much softer and easier to manage.  It keeps my hair softer than other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample bottle of this product at the salon and loved it.  When I went back and was going to purchase the larger bottle it was $32.  When I saw the same bottle for half the price on Amazon I had to go for it and I am glad I did.  The product arrived as described and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I will be buying from here again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and lots of it!  I&#x27;ve tried just about every styling product in my never ending quest to tame my unruly locks but nothing has ever really worked consistently well.  Sometimes I&#x27;d have a good hair day and sometimes a horrible hair day.  My stylist gave me a sample of Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and during that time have NEVER had a bad hair day - not even when it rains.  I also love that Paul Mitchell is against animal testing.</li>
    <li> The most incredible thing happened to me after submitting my order for this product: It arrived on time, and as described. I thought I might be dreaming, so I slammed my hand in a door as hard as I could -- nope not dreaming. After returning from the hospital I used this product to style my hair in a way that was so good I thought I might be dreaming, so I slammed my hand...</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the Paul Mitchell quality.  It makes my hair easier to style and gives it a soft touchable look not stiff and hard.  I dont have to use alot to style my med. length hair.  The product will last a long time.  Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> I have very one hair and when the weather gets humid my hair gets frizzy and manageable. This is the first product I have used that keeps the frizzies away. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A smooth product that works great for curling iron define curls&lt;br /&gt;* It is comparable to the Noodle Head Kick Up Your Curls or the Got2B Smooth Operator or Fantasia Liquid Mousse in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;* A great find for the price!</li>
    <li> I do like the product.  Leaves the hair very soft, but with body.  It seems to make drying time faster.</li>
    <li> After standing in the isle at Ulta obsessing and debating on which hair gel to try I finally decided on this one just because I liked the style of the bottle. But after using it I realized just how amazing this product is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the military and have to put my hair up every day. Even the smallest fly aways or frizz is frowned upon.  My hair is long, thin, and fine. I used to use gel to style my hair and then spray it down with hairspray to control fly aways. But now all I do is apply Paul Mitchells Fast Form to wet hair and my hair requires no other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I love this so much is that, unlike gel and hairspray it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and crispy, and there are no white flakes either. At the end of the day when I take my hair out of the bun and brush it out it doesn&#x27;t feel damaged at all. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it takes me no time at all to go through one of these little bottles i still give it 4 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this product I am now a dedicated Paul Mitchell consumer.</li>
    <li> works great to help manage frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> There is no better product for men&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Yesterday my stylist gave me a barely used bottle of this because I loved the scent so much. It was great when I used a small amount before drying and then another tiny dollop as sealant/shine serum. I co-wash exclusively so my hair is pretty soft and shiny every day, but this stuff made it even more so and it smells so freaking good I worked a bit more in several other times throughout the day. My hair felt (and smelled!) even nicer each time I reapplied, and 14 hours later it is still bouncy and shiny and not greasy at all. I&#x27;m desperately in love and hooked for life.</li>
    <li> Really a great product. I have naturally curly hair that can get frizzy in humidity. Stays soft and holds well. Only negative is the sent is really strong and a really sweet floral/fruity. The smell does become much less powerful once hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I use this all of the time.</li>
    <li> Flexible product that works great for my short hair. Is not as stiff as hairspray and seldom makes my hair look over &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; filled. I am most surprised by how long this one bottle lasts. On my short hair I easily get 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> Love This Hair Product! Works Well!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works wonders giving me a smooth, silky finish.  Recommend to me by stylist at Paul Mitchell school of Design.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find this again.  I have been using it for years...I have fine naturally curly hair and this keeps it in shape with out the crispy, wet look that so many other products do.  I recently went to Ulta to purchase it and was told that they no longer carry it.  The sales woman said they must have discontinued it.  I could not believe it....panic, panic.  So glad to see Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Do you have curly hair. Are you a guy. You should try this. I love it! It&#x27;s light, enahnces curl, smells great, makes me feel sexy. :-)</li>
    <li> Loved it...fast shipping A++++++</li>
    <li> Had used before.  My hair is addicted to it.  One of the best products I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I like this gel; good price too.  You don&#x27;t need too much of it and it lasts well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a long time. My hair is very thick and wavy/curly. When I let it air dry, it gets soo poofy due to the curly/thick combo. Normal gel makes your hair crunchy and have that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look all day. I hate that look. This cream gel helps my hair dry less poofy while still maintaining my curls. This product works great with Paul Mitchell Round Trip. It&#x27;s a great, medium intensity gel that won&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy at all. It&#x27;s a must for my hair products list.</li>
    <li> The BEST product for hair styling cr&amp;egrave;me on the market.  Use subscription service so you never run out and can enjoy the 15% discount in using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and speedy delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Works well when dealing with humidity but not 100% effective.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  My second bottle.  I don&#x27;t care a lot for hairspray so this cream gel works really well!  It holds my hair in place as I style it with my hands and it doesn&#x27;t leave a hard film</li>
    <li> Smoothes frizzy hair without making it sticky or heavy. I can use a very small amount and manage a headfull of wirey gray hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but lots of it. This gel gives me body and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I have used this for about 3 years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fast Form Cream for over a year.  I really like that it is not like most hair gels.  It is suble but it holds well.</li>
    <li> I like it but unfortunately it never came.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful - sweet orange - but it didn&#x27;t do the job on my hair, which, granted, is hard to curl or wave.&lt;br /&gt;But this really didn&#x27;t do much at all. My previous products though not perfect either, work better than this one. Back to the drawing table, I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have completely different types of hair, and we both would never want to do without our Fast Form Cream Gel.  It is the best styling product out there.  While giving great hold, it leaves your hair feeling soft and flexible.  It also smells soooo good!!  You only need a small amount for great results.  I follow up with a quick spray of Hold Me Tight (also Paul Mitchell).</li>
    <li> Lightweight product that smells nice.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist and I really like it. I have fine, thin hair and this product adds form and texture without weight.</li>
    <li> I continue to purchase this product!  Just a small amount gives you a lot of control! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more.  Price is alittle high for the quantity you get.  Hope it is the REAL deal since it&#x27;s for sale from amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Whenever we visit her family by the coast, or when it gets really humid around here, her hair frizzes out. But if she uses some of this stuff it will remain obedient. It will still get a little waviness to it, but it doesn&#x27;t look like she licked a power outlet.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, oily hair so finding a gel that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down is a challenge.  My hair also has lots of cowlicks in it that come out if I try to grow it out so I haven&#x27;t done that for the last 20 year.  I decided to grow it out and it was giving me challenges going all over the place.  My sister told me about this product and said it was very light in her hair and worked great.  I got some locally and it tamed my hair without added weight.  I can&#x27;t believe how well my hair is doing this long and it&#x27;s due to this gel.  I rarely even blow dry my hair anymore (had to do that for the &amp;#34;taming&amp;#34; factor)-just dry it off, put two squirts in my hair (well-the other day in the negative numbers I did dry my hair!), style it with my fingers and off I go!  It&#x27;s amazing.  Plan to purchase through Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> I use this on my short, unprocessed hair.  I guess you&#x27;d call my cut some sort of bob.  The best thing about this product is the lovely fragrance.  It also works great!  Gives my hair the lift and control I need.</li>
    <li> This gel is great, I have naturally curly hair and it keeps the hair from getting the frizzies in the humid weather.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years. It does a great job defining my curls and keeping them frizz free when it rains.</li>
    <li> Love this item ..... use it all the time</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the supplier of the product Cosmetics Liquidations out of Nevada sold me rancid, spoiled hair gel.  The smell was so putrid that I was close to vomiting as was my daughter.  There was also product spilled all over the packing paper along with smeared purple ink.  It was truly a mess.  I threw it in the garbage and took a chance I could find this cream gel at Regis hair salons at Brookfield Square Mall.  Yes, they carry it and I bought it from Regis.  Never again will I use Amazon to purchase my Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel.  Cost Cutters does not carry this product anymore which is why I went to Amazon to purchase.  My first purchase was fine, this second time I purchased it was absolutely disgusting.  Would recommend all to purchase locally from Regis and not Amazon.</li>
    <li> Tried other Paul Mitchell gels and they were much better. Besides for the amount of product you get this is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Never without this, it is not heavy in your hair and allows your style to stay all day!  It is not greasy and the bottle lasts for months, I do not have to buy it very often.</li>
    <li> Helpts to control the frizz, smells lovely and isn&#x27;t stiff on the hair but yet provides styling ease.</li>
    <li> This product is good if you use it with something else. It tended to be a little sticky and didn&#x27;t hold/define my curls as well as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and live in a humid climate. I usually weigh down my hair with lots of leave-in conditioner but I would go through those bottles every two weeks. I got my hair cut at Supercuts or Great Clips and the girl used this stuff on my hair, I didn&#x27;t think much until that evening when I got home and I noticed my hair looked good. No frizz. I went back and bought some and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. It&#x27;s a lightweight product that kind of tames my curls into waves. The best part is that I can touch my hair all day and it won&#x27;t frizz or fluff up. And for once in my hair life, I am only using small amount of product on my hair. Two pumps. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I just love it.  It provides body and hold without leaving your hair stiff and glued together.  You can actually comb or brush through your dry hair after using it.  My hair has a lot of natural curl and humidity can really do a number on my style.  I don&#x27;t have that problem since I started using Fast Form.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for curl definition I have lost count. I have a body wave and do not always want to blow dry my hair for 20 minutes. So when I want to have a loose wavy do. I apply and allow my hair to air dry. Voila-great looking hair for a perfect hair day every time. When I do blow dry the same result. Shiny beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> Of course my stylist uses this product on me and boasts about how wonderful it is.  For me, it&#x27;s okay.  Nothing special, but it does the job.  The scent is very nice and the price is decent.</li>
