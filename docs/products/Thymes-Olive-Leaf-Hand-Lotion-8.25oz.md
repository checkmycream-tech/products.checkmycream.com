      <li>I discovered this beautiful, clean, fresh hand lotion at a local gift store.</li>
      <li>is so clean.....</li>
      <li>It leaves a clean aroma and is not greasy to the touch.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice daytime scent, not a heavy perfume.</li>

      <li>For some reason it is hard to find in my area so was pleased to be able to purchase it on line</li>
      <li>really a skin saver in winter and a good overall moisture lotion even for facial use.</li>
      <li>Olive Leaf takes me back in time to the &#x27;50&#x27;s for some reason--a great, slow, easy time to be alive!</li>
      <li>too much alcohol.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and can be used on the body, not just hands.</li>
      <li>We know that there are hundreds of lotions on the market that all do the same thing - they soften, smooth, protect, etc.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and gets into the cuticles to keep your hands feeling soft and smooth without having rough areas around your fingertips.</li>
      <li>so I have went on Amazon for so many other things and decided to give it a try,thanks Amazon without you</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The minute I started using this lotion I fell in Love with it,the smell the way it felt but little to my surprise the store I purchased it from went out of business.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and it last a long time.</li>
      <li>I purchased this in a little boutique shop and now see it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon, should have known to look here first.</li>
      <li>would like to see another top since the pump wastes a lot of the lotion and requires maneuvering to get the last few dabs.</li>
      <li>I am new to the Thymes brand, but I am eager to try their other products.  </li>
