    <li> My daughter gets extremely bad razor burn and ingrown hairs every time she shaves her legs.

    <li> well  i have not use this product  long enough to really tell any difference in my skin  and  I  am also Using  the  SKIN TIGHT. But WHAT I will say, about this product is that it smells really good and it does not burn at all. I only use it after hair remover via veet. maybe that&#x27;s why it does not burn because I am not using razors. but so far my razor bumps have cleared  but I don&#x27;t know if it is because of this or the skin tight. but I will keep this as an after shave, simply because I like the idea of having an after shave. hey better safe then sorry.</li>
