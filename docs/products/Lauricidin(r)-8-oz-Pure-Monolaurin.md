      <li>UPDATE: When I opened the cellophane on the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; package, underneath the barcoded label on the outside of the cellophane, the original product label had been whited out with some sort of covering material.</li>
      <li>I use this product for internal cleansing and feel good after a round of using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted with the results after only taking this for a few days.  </li>
      <li>Take a small amount at first at work your way up in amount, it will upset your stomach if you don&#x27;t :)  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>Amazon typically offeres better prices than local vendors.</li>
      <li>I had been on many antibiotics for an extended period of time and when I came off of them, I was concerned that my immune system, which had compromised with all of the antibiotics, might need a little boost to get back up and doing its thing.</li>
      <li>Helps your body fight it naturally with the aid of Monolaurin.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe the infection has cleared up completely, but I do think that this product is helping with the inflammation and pain.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product, just as expected</li>
    <li> I love this product and take it daily! Super for fungal, viral or even bacterial infections!  I have been taking it for about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m delighted with the results after only taking this for a few days.  I am suffering from a sinus infection and the pain and pressure in my head has been unbearable.  I&#x27;ve had several rounds of strong antibiotics and steroid shots but nothing has helped. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different remedies but my headache didn&#x27;t subside until I started taking this. I don&#x27;t believe the infection has cleared up completely, but I do think that this product is helping with the inflammation and pain.</li>
    <li> First time I or anyone in my family used. Arrived just in time for my daughter who was quarantined.  My daughter had a diagnosis of H1N1 aka swine flu from which several people have passed away. It&#x27;s pricey and only available online, but was worth it.  She recovered and is back at work and with her roommates.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> excellent product, make sure to follow the directions! Take a small amount at first at work your way up in amount, it will upset your stomach if you don&#x27;t :)  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference from when I wasn&#x27;t taking it</li>
    <li> I use this product for internal cleansing and feel good after a round of using it. I&#x27;ve used it several times now (about once a year)</li>
    <li> A few years ago someone recommended I try monolaurin for my allergies.  Over the years I discovered the commercial version from Lauricidin the best, as it appears to be of higher quality than the competition with consistent results.  Amazon typically offeres better prices than local vendors.</li>

    <li> I use this product everyday to keep my EBV titers low.  Great immune support supplement!</li>
    <li> It is helping my husband and I with different health issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I think it is beneficial</li>
    <li> Be careful when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Although it helps in many ways , it can have side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Do not start with full spoon. Just get 1/3.</li>
    <li> Great. Been taking for a year. I feel better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to use when you feel a sickness coming on.  Helps your body fight it naturally with the aid of Monolaurin.  Whats more it is Paleo Keto friendly.  Derived from coconut.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC product.  Also recommended by my holistic doc</li>
    <li> Had to wean on this per instructions otherwise got a tummy ache.  Working fine now..hope it works for Candida</li>
    <li> So far, great product. In the beginning, I did feel as if it caused some mood swings/ irritability. That part was strange. I believe i did read somewhere that it may cause irritability. Since taking it, I don&#x27;t feel like wonder woman, but I haven&#x27;t had any HSV outbreaks, which is great. They became monthly after having children. It seems 1-2 scoops daily, helps. It&#x27;s easy I swallow &amp; doesn&#x27;t really have much taste except a bit waxy, as is the texture.</li>
    <li> Great anti-viral.  Kids take it too.  Has helped them learn to swallow pills.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this for infection/virus.  Works</li>
    <li> Great product I won&#x27;t be without.  This is great for any digestive yeast issues and it works. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: When I opened the cellophane on the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; package, underneath the barcoded label on the outside of the cellophane, the original product label had been whited out with some sort of covering material. This was not a new product. I contacted the Seller via email and got no response. I contacted Amazon and they quickly refunded my purchase price and sent me a no cost return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Product Review: I had been on many antibiotics for an extended period of time and when I came off of them, I was concerned that my immune system, which had compromised with all of the antibiotics, might need a little boost to get back up and doing its thing. One of my docs told me to start using this to encourage my immune system. I&#x27;m not a doctor but I&#x27;m feeling good and I&#x27;ll keep using it. It also help to &amp;#34;rid your body&amp;#34; of things that don&#x27;t belong and this usually happens in the morning. Nothing painful or urgent, just noticeable. That hasn&#x27;t stopped me at all though. Great product and helps to keep the track clean and moving.</li>
    <li> Gave me and my wife a terrible headache. I gave it to a friend to try it, and he dumped it. I still don&#x27;t know if it has any therapeutic value, I would rather die from the illness, than deal with the unbearable migraine it causes. The cure is more harmful than the disease.</li>
    <li> using it to cut wanting sugar after my meal</li>
    <li> Tried this as a recommended lyme therapy and got absolutely NO results aside from the white chips that went right through my digestive tract. I don&#x27;t know why anyone says this stuff works. Moreover, why this company charges so much for it!</li>
    <li> One of the supplements we used to rid ourselves of candida--definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product ......my daughter has not had another bout of tonsillitis since taking this suppplement,</li>
