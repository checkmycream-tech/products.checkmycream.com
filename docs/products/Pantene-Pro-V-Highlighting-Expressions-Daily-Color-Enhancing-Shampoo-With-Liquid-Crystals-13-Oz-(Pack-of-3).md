      <li>I enjoyed being a natural born blonde.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find old favorite locally.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly and very frizzy hair</li>
      <li>guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven&#x27;t tried this shampoo yet, but you&#x27;ll most likely want to before long!</li>
      <li>It does not dry out hair, it does thoroughly clean with a single application!</li>
      <li>It works so well for natural blonde hair!  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and like the way it keeps my blonde hair looking natural.</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast, however, the lid of one of the shampoo bottles was not screwed on tightly before shipping, and the shampoo had leaked during the shipping process.</li>

    <li> Love this stuff, but not sold at my local Wal-Mart anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I am not able to find it locally any longer.  Amazon was the first search and I am so happy to have this once again.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by Pantene&#x27;s Blonde Expressions Shampoo for Blonde Highlights. Previous a big John Frieda Blonde shampoo user, I was looking for something a little less expensive. I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes using Pantene, but I&#x27;ve been loving my hair since I started using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually do see a difference in my blonde highlights since using this Pantene shampoo. They&#x27;re brighter, more dimensional, and really do appear to sparkle. Also, my hair has felt super soft since I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that my hair looks a lot better if I use Pantene every day. I generally like to switch up the shampoo I use on a daily basis, but my highlights tend to look best when I use this day after day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven&#x27;t tried this shampoo yet, but you&#x27;ll most likely want to before long! I use the conditioner in addition to the shampoo and recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I have ever used.  I have tried there friz and  non breakage shampoos and found my hair dry, This is the only shampoo that keeps my hair with body and manageable,</li>

    <li> This isn&#x27;t the product I was looking for but that is no ones fault.  However I will not reorder</li>
    <li> Wonderful gentle shampoo for blonde hair at a fair price. Wish I could find it in local stores. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo on the market because it cleans my hair without stripping it.  I also use their conditioner and together they leave my hair silky and shiny!  I have naturally curly and very frizzy hair but I can straighten it to a silky shiny mane that blows in the wind.</li>
    <li> Works well hard to find in our area.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, however Amazon was the only place I could find it.  All the stores are out...  Is this being discontinued?  I hope not!</li>
    <li> This is a discontinued product that I love, but can&#x27;t get.  I&#x27;ll order again, and share when possible. The manufacture changed their line, and many favorite products were dropped for new line.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed being a natural born blonde. Now my hair is a mix of gray, blonde, brown &amp; blonde highlights. I find that this Pantene product really does keep my highlights brighter. I recommend it.</li>

    <li> I have blonde hair and then I began to use this shampoo my hair has more fresh colour. after washing hair during two days colour is more fresh, and the shampoo is good too, it matches to my hair.</li>
    <li> I heard pantene is the Healthest for your hair by a Doctor.this shampoo makes my hair feel so clean.plus makes it shine and it smells good.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years and like the way it keeps my blonde hair looking natural.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this shampoo. Immediately I noticed how much it lathered up and I love that. I am not a creme shampoo kind of girl, when I put my shampoo in my hair I want bubbles, lots of bubbles and thick foam. I got that with my Pantene Highlighting Expressions. This shampoo really gave me a great shine and smell also. The scent is very clean and really feels great. I am happy that this came in a 3 pack because I plan to use it for some time and a 3 pack should last awhile.</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast, however, the lid of one of the shampoo bottles was not screwed on tightly before shipping, and the shampoo had leaked during the shipping process. When I opened the package, about 1/3 of the bottle had leaked out.</li>
    <li> Love my pantene expressions. It keeps my blonde hair blonde without making it brassy.  I alternate between the blonde expression and the highlighting expression</li>
    <li> Keeps highlights looking good if you can use pantene. It made my hair fall of after half a bottle. But all pantene does it so if you normally use pantene and you have highlights this isnan awesome product. I can usually use pantene periodically without having issues but nott this time:( it smells great and leaves your hair aoft.</li>
    <li> Very good for blondes who want shiny hair</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo.  I used it in the past and then couldn&#x27;t find it,so I was happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, clean feeling, but makes my frizzy hair kind of dry.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair, and I shower and rinse my hair everyday. It shines from morning till the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo!  It works so well for natural blonde hair!  It does not dry out hair, it does thoroughly clean with a single application!</li>
    <li> Liked much better than Clairol Shimmer Lights. Brings out blonde highlights nicely. Cheaper too. Rich golden color and lathers well.</li>
    <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
