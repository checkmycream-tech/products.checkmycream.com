      <li>The mythic blends of Jasmine, Rose, Germanium and Lilly of the Valley form the heart and soul of this fragrance.</li>

      <li>It is cost effective and smells better that most fragrances that are around.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>One of our favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Fellas, do not over spay as it will be overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Love this men cologne</li>
      <li>Enjoy, gentlemen!</li>
      <li>but like most of my fragrances I buy them and soon part with them, so I forgot about this gem for many</li>
      <li>Love the smell and have already had compliments.</li>
      <li>I really love this scent&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Like fine wine this fragrance is best savored in small doses, one wrist, ear, collar bone at most.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle that strong and cheap type of odor</li>
      <li>A nice, crisp, slightly sweet scent that isn&#x27;t offensive to others.</li>
      <li>It has a soft and good smell, not too sweet or too strong.</li>
      <li>These notes of bergamot, lemon, mandarin and orange blossom are stunningly blended but what follows is the real treat.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s not to say this cologne won&#x27;t impress others, but it&#x27;s far from warm.</li>
      <li>Nice lite smell have received many complements on it especially from woman they seam to like it very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;is just lovely for ages 18 to 50 or older.</li>
      <li>I generally like warm colognes with sweet notes, but wanted an alternative to the warm/sweet scents.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of a cool breeze in the Appalachian Mountains, it&#x27;s crisp and light.</li>
      <li>I constantly keep this scent in my collection have been for 12 years now, it is a nice sweet scent.</li>
      <li>Great for late nights or a clean work scent.</li>
      <li>This is a good fragrance that can be worn the all the year round as it is fresh and sweet.</li>
      <li>So I ordered a bottle of it right,</li>
      <li>Unlike a lot of men, I again, have very little to gain when wearing a cologne except for enjoying smelling nice.</li>
      <li>Remember with most scents, less is more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Extremely sophisticated and unusual this very continental scent is a real find.</li>
      <li>I wear it in the Summer when the days are long and hot and the nights are still pretty warm...</li>
      <li>and I knew this was quality stuff the first time I ever sniffed it...</li>
      <li>Something exotic and different.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is the real thing!  </li>
      <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m married, have kids and spend most of my work time in the mountains with other men.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really have no one to try and impress or blow away with a cologne</li>
      <li>I first bought this cologne at a high-end perfume shop when I was just 21 years old.  </li>
      <li>&gt;  Wanting to find a doppelganger for the now IMPOSSIBLE-to-find Durrani Exense, I did a quick search online at my usual perfume and cologne resource pages on the Internet and someone suggested that this cologne was an almost exact copy of Exense, and when I thought about it he was RIGHT!  </li>
      <li>It is sweet, heady, and classy and every woman for miles around will want to hug and snuggle up next to you.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>It is pretty linear and last about 6 hours on my skin.</li>
      <li>Just a I expected, quality of product for an undisputed price and after sale services, quick delivery..</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is sharp on the opening notes like a salty spray of the Aegean Sea on hot skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to recommend a perfume since it depends on your personal preferences, but at least in terms of price-quality ratio t&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>White sails on white caps of the coast of Santorini, sun kissed bodies on the beach and high above the white villas hug the rim of the sleeping volcano.</li>
      <li>This dry down trails slowly away leaving a warm summer glow like Helios setting in the western sea.</li>

<li> Sculpture is a little dangerous and daring and so worth the try if you have the spirit to sail away with it.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
<li> just a little bit will do you alright.&lt;br /</li>
<li> I have bought a few bottles of it over the years</li>
<li> if you get headache from heavy colognes .. stay away..</li>
<li> The seller did not advise that this could not be shipped to australia as it is appartently considered a dangerous goods, so in using a bngo forwarding address it has been a total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> My husband recently purchased it at a mall kiosk only to discover that it was a fake and smelled horrible!  </li>
<li> I hate to say this</li>

    <li> awesome scent for the price.</li>
    <li> Great cologne for the price. Something exotic and different.</li>
    <li> I hate to say this but i trashed it... if you get headache from heavy colognes .. stay away.. it will give you headache</li>

    <li> i had no problem about delivering,its good product and original without a doubt.. i can advise but if you dont like it would be depend on personal stuffs.</li>
    <li> Love this men cologne</li>
    <li> I bought it trusting on the reviews that I read...I totally lost my money... don&#x27;t believe me, just take the risk!! I couldn&#x27;t handle that strong and cheap type of odor (wasn&#x27;t a fragrance ever)</li>
    <li> This cologne was recommended to me as a day/fall/winter cologne. I generally like warm colognes with sweet notes, but wanted an alternative to the warm/sweet scents. The bottle and price caught my eye here on Amazon. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m married, have kids and spend most of my work time in the mountains with other men. I really have no one to try and impress or blow away with a cologne so that&#x27;s why things like price and bottle design catch my eye and why I&#x27;m not looking for that fragrance that will cause women to follow me around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not to say this cologne won&#x27;t impress others, but it&#x27;s far from warm. It reminds me of a cool breeze in the Appalachian Mountains, it&#x27;s crisp and light. I&#x27;m surprised by one of the reviews calling this a heavy cologne. Unlike a lot of men, I again, have very little to gain when wearing a cologne except for enjoying smelling nice. That means I just use one spray of any cologne I use. This one does very good with one spray. I can smell it for several hours, but outside of my wife and daughter noticing it, I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints or compliments from others about it. Which is what I wanted. A nice, crisp, slightly sweet scent that isn&#x27;t offensive to others. I had been using Azzaro Chrome for daytime use, but will be switching to this at least for the next year.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> I really love this scent&lt;br /&gt;I buy this perfume all the time when the other one is finished&lt;br /&gt;good dellivery</li>
    <li> This is a good fragrance that can be worn the all the year round as it is fresh and sweet. It is cost effective and smells better that most fragrances that are around. It is pretty linear and last about 6 hours on my skin. Bottle is very nice as well. I would recommend it for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to recommend a perfume since it depends on your personal preferences, but at least in terms of price-quality ratio t&#x27;s great. I like this eau de toilette and I buy it every time. It has a soft and good smell, not too sweet or too strong. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> One of our favorite perfumes. It&#x27;is just lovely for ages 18 to 50 or older. One of the best. My husband wears it for last 10 years with the same enthusiasm.</li>
    <li> I constantly keep this scent in my collection have been for 12 years now, it is a nice sweet scent. Great for late nights or a clean work scent.</li>
    <li> Just a I expected, quality of product for an undisputed price and after sale services, quick delivery..</li>
    <li> AMAZING SCENT... I first bought this cologne at a high-end perfume shop when I was just 21 years old.  I already had the &amp;#34; nose &amp;#34; for perfumes and colognes and I knew this was quality stuff the first time I ever sniffed it... I have bought a few bottles of it over the years but like most of my fragrances I buy them and soon part with them, so I forgot about this gem for many years.&lt;br /&gt;  Wanting to find a doppelganger for the now IMPOSSIBLE-to-find Durrani Exense, I did a quick search online at my usual perfume and cologne resource pages on the Internet and someone suggested that this cologne was an almost exact copy of Exense, and when I thought about it he was RIGHT!  So I ordered a bottle of it right, a tester and I have it on my dresser at this moment.  I wear it in the Summer when the days are long and hot and the nights are still pretty warm... it projects well in small doses and the sillage is strong so it doesn&#x27;t warrant a lot of reapplication or heavy sprays... just a little bit will do you alright.&lt;br /&gt;  It is sweet, heady, and classy and every woman for miles around will want to hug and snuggle up next to you.  Enjoy, gentlemen!</li>
    <li> Very nice, cool bottle and good scent, my wife likes it too so all good.</li>
    <li> Received today and very pleased. Love the smell and have already had compliments. 9 hours later can still smell.on my skin. Great price for product, when I run out I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for years and not changing anytime soon!!!! I would recommend trying it and see what you think!!!!</li>
    <li> very similar to Diesel Zeo Plus Plus... love it! Ideal for day wearing.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is the real thing!  My husband recently purchased it at a mall kiosk only to discover that it was a fake and smelled horrible!  The package arrived when it was promised and the cologne arrived in one piece.  I will definitely be reordering from here when he runs out again.</li>
    <li> Nice lite smell have received many complements on it especially from woman they seam to like it very much. Great to use any time</li>
    <li> Everything perfect. Thanks</li>
    <li> The seller did not advise that this could not be shipped to australia as it is appartently considered a dangerous goods, so in using a bngo forwarding address it has been a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> my favorite scent!!! shipped to me on time and right to my frontdoor superfast and the price was cheaper than anywhere else!!!</li>
    <li> using it since 1997 , great perfume</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Love the smell.</li>
