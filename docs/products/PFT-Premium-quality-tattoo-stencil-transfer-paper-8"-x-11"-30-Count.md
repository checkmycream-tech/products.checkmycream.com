<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As described!  I looove this product!  Very much needed for my line of work</li>
    <li> Great Transfer Paper! Exactly what the artist wanted.</li>
    <li> they worked really good</li>
    <li> Great quality delivery was right on time. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wipes right off, horrible stencil paper</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed and it&#x27;s done the job very well. Shipping was quick and the paper wasn&#x27;t bent or creased.</li>
    <li> Very odd paper felt wax like ,,, shocked how hard I had to press to sketch my stencil, ended up tearing off wax like crap paper use a good brand stencil/tracing paper and it worked better but transferring ink to paper, if ur doing detail ink work then this is NOT the transfer paper you want #30sheetsofcrud👎</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, exactly as expected. Too many in one package. Seems to be constant? Some are wrinkled but not too bad.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works in Stencil copier or by hand, will be ordering more soon. Thankyou.</li>
    <li> good stuff it seems this paper is costly everywhere</li>
    <li> Stencil paper was all wrinkled, not good what so ever.</li>
    <li> This paper is alright if you&#x27;re tracing on it, but no good at all for a thermal printer. I had to use three pieces to get one good stencil because the ink is on extremely cheap thin plastic and it wrinkles up in the printer.</li>
    <li> Its great, it worked very well! On top of it all its so cheap compared to the rest!  I will be buying this from now on!</li>
    <li> I gave these stencils to my grandson and he is using them.</li>
    <li> This tracing paper kind of sucks because you are required to trace it twice. The previous tracing paper I have been using only requires you to trace once. It gets to be time consuming to trace it twice prior to doing the tattoo. However, it is good for a little extra practice on the tattoo.</li>
    <li> son loves it makes it so much easier to tattoo with it will be ordering again thank you keep up great job</li>
    <li> most of them are unusable. it looks like they got wet.</li>
    <li> It works for the price. A couple sheets were wrinkled not a biggie but you do have to put a little to much pressure to make transfer, kinda a pain on some artwork</li>
    <li> I will use this product for a long time. As a matter of fact I am using it now.</li>
    <li> These stencils are amazing. Once applied the can withstand lots of wiping. It could be used as a temporary tattoo for someone they stay on so well. You get lots stencil space for the price and is easy to get your outline on. I approve this product and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> No instruction of any sort. Very unappy</li>
    <li> Transfer is extremely light after application, and becomes almost completely invisible after a few light swipes from a dry paper towel. Would not recommend using on anything but the smallest and least detailed of tattoos. Not even a cheap alternative compared to actual tattoo supply sites, and severely less quality</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using this product until a month or so after I purchased it, and I was immediately disappointed. I could not, no matter how I tried, get it to work properly. I never achieved a complete transfer, and it was sketchy even before attempting to put it on skin. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Rolls and rips easily when trying tovdo stencils. Paper is a bit thin. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Product is as described and a great price. Great product top of the line.  I would reccomend this item to others. Great product.</li>
    <li> excellent! fast shipped</li>
    <li> Early, all here and easy to use. Would order again. A+</li>
    <li> The transfers show up on the skin clearly. I will be getting more of this product. very happy with this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s carbon paper... nothing more nothing less. But it isn&#x27;t cleap and it does transfer well. Even able to use it more than once with smaller tattoos.</li>
    <li> Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)</li>
    <li> It is ok stencil paper, the stencil will not stay on your client long, so just don&#x27;t wipe it much, or it will wipe right off, pretty quick. I have seen other brands stay longer.</li>
    <li> All my paper was crinkled or ripped. :(</li>
    <li> this came packaged very carefully and the transfer paper is a high quality if you are tracing by hand and not using a thermal it is great nice dark lines when transferring.</li>
    <li> The product was packaged wonderfully all the paper is in good condition. I have not used the paper itself yet but I will update my review when I do. thank you tattoo world</li>
    <li> Great paper quality, does exactly what I need it for. It was packaged nicely, but it did take a few days to get here. This was probably due to the holidays. None the less I am satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what my son wanted and needed.</li>
    <li> Does not work will not even transfer onto the sheet after tracing?!?!? Very bad</li>
    <li> Not good for tattoing, it does not show up very well and does not last. The artist were very dissapointed</li>
    <li> I choose this because of the good pricing for a lot of paper. My boyfriend likes these too. He&#x27;s told a few friends about getting these</li>
    <li> Overpriced But Needed</li>
    <li> everything was as pictured love the product very great price would never shop anywhere else except for Amazonthank you very much</li>
    <li> Great quality paper. Fast shipping. Great Price!</li>
    <li> I get these from you guys all the time and it never fail to be just the best ever on the net</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transfers a design to skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone gets these, the transfer ink wipes away from the skin with one single wipe... Dissatisfied....</li>
    <li> Just as good as any other paper</li>
    <li> does just what i needed it for</li>
    <li> great quality! Arrived in mail very quickly!</li>
    <li> these things literally saved me from giving up on the tattoos I was doing. But no they held my drawings so i could tattoo them.</li>
    <li> fast delivery some of the papers were crinkled in the envelope making some of them unuasable</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with the product wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I wrongly assumed that this was the sort of paper that you could print color pictures from the computer on, but it&#x27;s to make a purple outline of a tattoo to make sure you like the shape of it.  The purple lines also smudge really easily.  Keep in mind when you do use this paper that those purple lines will last for about three days.</li>
    <li> On time! Fast service!</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived ahead of time and works great for all of my stencil transfers.</li>
    <li> Just got my order in. im giving it 4 starts cuz it was packaged REALLY well. No bends, folds, creases... nothing. I havnt actually used the paper yet but the other reviews iv seen on some of the transfer paper seems like no care was used during shipment so that was a big thing for me. So far im impressed</li>
    <li> perfect. just what we were looking for! thank you!</li>
    <li> fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just Stencil paper.</li>
    <li> What more is there really to say about transfer paper?  I use these for cutting work rather than tattoo work and they do their job as well as any I&#x27;ve owned over the years. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Paper is easy to use works well, happy with my order.</li>
    <li> The paper is great makes great stencils that stick. For bet resuls only use the top white sheet if you are going to free hand or draw directly on the white sheet to make your stencil  otherwise place your design /flash face up directly onthe transfer sheet unless you press really hard and go ocver it 2 or so times it wont really trasfer strongly also use a broad tip pen or pencil to get the stongest thickest linese fine tips dont work very well for this.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely perfect!  I purchased these for Henna, not for tattooing but they work like a charm.  Very pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> a stencil is a stencil there is not much you can say about them they came flat and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Love these. Great deal for as many as were in the pack. They transfer well and come in a nice sealed pack. I will definitely reorder more when needed.</li>
    <li> it would have been five stars if my paper wasnt matted together when i got it it was bent and mashed up&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it was fine thanks</li>
    <li> Great Product. Good Price</li>
    <li> This stuff looks and feels like tattoo paper because it is. Works like tattoo paper and that&#x27;s because that is what it is. Stencil your brains out.</li>
    <li> This is actual Spirit brand stencil paper. Stencils come out very clear and stay on the skin for the duration of the tattoo so no need to worry about wiping away the stencil early (unless you don&#x27;t let it dry!!!)</li>
    <li> I just got these in. And they are all wrinkled to high heck</li>
    <li> very good, could of been packaged better, however they work fine.</li>
    <li> it is good paper for the intended purposes. but it came BENT due to the type of shipping containment was flimsy cardboard.</li>
    <li> ordered this and it came 2 days later. paper was in perfect condition. haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet but from the reviews have no worries. will definately be ordering from here for all my paper. high recommendations for my friends.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars since it came early. It would have been nice if it was all perfect but a few sheets had bent corners. I will order more from here when I use these ones up. Overall I Love It..</li>
    <li> Came quick and easy. Works great.</li>
    <li> it was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it</li>
    <li> Great price and works great</li>
    <li> The product meets all expectations. However the sheets of paper weren&#x27;t packaged well. Two sheets were taped to the envelope they were in and are not usable</li>
    <li> Great Item, just as advertised</li>
    <li> It is in awesome shape thanks sooo much</li>
    <li> quick delivery...great product</li>
    <li> Its a good price. wish it was better quality</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved the envelope my stencil paper came in....</li>
    <li> The paper arrived on time and worked amazingly</li>
    <li> crazy about fast shipment and love this stuff !</li>
    <li> Great price , will order again</li>
    <li> What a joke...  I opened the box and half of the sheets were wrinkled so badly they were unusable.  Then, I finally found a good sheet and proceeded with the design.  Not only does it leave a faint weak transfer, but it wipes right off.  We have had much much better luck with other brands.  Will never order this again.</li>
    <li> Stencils work great show up very good on the skin , only complaint is that it literally looked like it was just all thrown in a box so when I received it they were all bent a some torn. Personally I know it&#x27;s just a stencil but it makes it a lot easier when your not having to struggle with you stencil bc it&#x27;s all wrinkles and torn up .</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great product that came quickly.  A couple pages were stuck to the package sticky tape but other than that, excellent.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much, my son is trying to learn how to tattoo so this should help him a lot. Will order from you in the future.</li>
    <li> the tattoo stensil has made the job easier for tattooing.will be purchasing more in the future and other tattooing products</li>
    <li> I did not like this stencil paper. The stencil would be so light, most of the time I would have to redo the stencil. I would no recommend this prduct.</li>
    <li> It is great stuff works like it should an will help me to perfect my skills an get better at my Tattooing !!!!!</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast than I expected. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more!</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is. I use it and it serves it purpose. I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Nice paper works good with greensoap</li>
    <li> great product, arrived a day early. the only problem i have is it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> The stencil transfer paper works just as it should, hopefully this pack will last a bit. No issues with product or wait time</li>
    <li> i havent tried using the product yet but they were safetly packaged in a cardboard box so that they didnt get damaged and the product even included a piece of tissue paper between the stencil paper and carbon so that the stencil paper wasnt ruined before use. its deffinatly a great product and i cannot wait to use it on my next tattoo</li>
    <li> It does do what its supposed to do, but the paper is a little thicker than what I&#x27;m used to so the stencils don&#x27;t come out quite as dark. But it does still make a workable stencil. Worth the price, at least</li>
    <li> These work ok but not really what I was expecting, it rubs off easy and doesn&#x27;t transfer well. Pay the extra cash and get the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Awesome nice price and its big sheets also I got it really fast five stars</li>
    <li> This paper works great</li>
    <li> The paper itself is great. The way it was packaged for me was not so great. It was put into a hard envelope so some of the pages have marks on them already. Just kind of a pain when you have to tape the paper down in order for it to hold still but that can&#x27;t be helped. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> package was open when it arrived with one crinkled sheet, but great product over all.</li>
    <li> I received my stencil paper today. Nice packaging but as soon as I opened it, several of the sheets were so wrinkled they will never be usable. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> A couple of the pages were wrinkled a bit and the &amp;#34;folder&amp;#34;  was not sealed which makes me think they just have them laying around and just put them in when an order is placed.  but they do work so I guess it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> was very pleased with the shipping speed and product the only negative thing was that some of the sheets were crumbled up and bent</li>
    <li> Works great does what it&#x27;s needed. Easy to use I&#x27;ll order this again and again. Glad this store is out there.</li>
    <li> very difficult to transfer not only to another piece of paper, but also, trying to get it not to smudge on skin as well. another thing...every one of them has two sheets of transparent paper..however onb almost all of them at least one of the transparent papr has purple transfer all over it....</li>
    <li> There are no issues with this transfer paper. I like them and the amount of sheets for the price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> as described nothing was damaged, excellent condition.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. I was shocked to find the stencil worked so great and stayed on through the tattoos as well as they did. If you let them dry, they will stay on.  Lol!  Great product!</li>
    <li> When got here creased . Unable to use .</li>
    <li> with shipping these cost $15 for me. if you can find them cheaper then get em. this is one part of the tattoo process where the quality of your supplies does not matter. As long as your not using toilette paper to transfer a stencil you should be good. The only reason i bought online is because the store i normally buy my supplies sells these $1 per sheet which is highway robbery.</li>
    <li> I was really nervous about buying transfer paper from a new company other then what I originally use. I first bought from this company a few weeks ago and already re ordered even more with the 30 pack. Great quality. Bold lasting stencil I dont see myself wanting buy anything else</li>
    <li> It looked a little different than the transfer paper I have used before, but it applied to the skin just right. I will definitely be looking these guys up again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and a great price</li>
    <li> perfect, just as described</li>
    <li> Great stencil paper!! better then most I&#x27;ve used. U can get three to four sticks with one pattern. Great carbon</li>
    <li> A good solid product, takes a little work to get it just right but for the cash a great deal. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It came very fast and I was surprised when I used it because the designs didn&#x27;t smear even when you wipe off the excess ink. I will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> I actually received my transfer paper a couple of days before the actual delivery date. Perfect timing if u ask me! I was skeptical at first because some of the items on here falsely advertise. But it&#x27;s just as the picture shows, 30 in the pack, packaged nicely, none ripped torn or bent. I am very pleased. This particular company I would recommend to all of my other friends who tattoo as well</li>
    <li> Great transfer paper, I will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> can never touch much of this.. great stuff.. always getting to pass it around to other artists around for their use also</li>
    <li> Half the paper inside was damaged all bunched together</li>
    <li> Very nice worked well. Packaging could be a little neater, but it also went through the mail....no comment. However, product works great!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Shipped fast. Worked great.</li>
    <li> Several of the sheets were wrinkled so bad they couldnt be used. The ink didn&#x27;t transfer to the paper as easily and smoothly as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Nice trace paper. None of the sheets were ripped when I got them so bonus.</li>
    <li> Quality, Quanity &amp; price... great!</li>
    <li> great value perfect product</li>
    <li> i was worried these wouldnt be so great but i waa completely wrong. just make sure you get some stencil magic to help with the transfer. for small tattooa you can cut the stencil paper down and get more then one use out of it.</li>
    <li> Hard to transfer ink from stencil to skin in the intense humidity of southern NC, transferred images come out very faint if qt all</li>
    <li> These came pretty quick and they work just fine. However I do wish they had been packaged with a bit more care. When taking them out no matter how careful you are something is always curling. Aside from that they aren&#x27;t a bad quality</li>
    <li> Works great easy to use, took awhile to get here</li>
    <li> very fast shipping and they are great</li>
    <li> i Think he paper needs to come with the stensil cream/liquid cause the purple ink is not sticking to the skin some fast timers won&#x27;t know what to do and mess up on a tattoo ...</li>
    <li> This stencil paper worked just fine for me. I reccomend it</li>
    <li> Works the way it is supposed to, great product.</li>
    <li> Great buy especially for the price. I am over all satisfied with my purchase and will deffinitly be ordering more in the near future!</li>
    <li> I am a very satisfied customer of amazon, I have bought quit a bit of things and I have not had any problems with what I buy or getting it. I will continue to use amazon in the future.</li>
