      <li>I love this stuff &amp; the name makes me laugh every time I use it.</li>
      <li>What I have noticed so far, is not a lightening of my skin, but a &amp;#34;reddening&amp;#34; of my skin (like a bright pinkish tinge).  </li>
      <li>but with this AMAZING product I have no trouble.</li>
      <li>This cream is gentle and smooth &amp; actually works great on age spots as well.</li>
      <li>Maybe you have to be as fair as snow white for this to work??</li>
      <li>It did its job fairly quickly, but you have to keep buying it for it to take permanent effect.&lt;br</li>

      <li>The mirror right in front of you will suffice.</li>
      <li>As a true NOB, I am  pleased to be white from head to toe, including all areas in between.</li>
      <li>&quot; the skin bleaching cream especially formulated for those of us with less than perfect</li>
      <li>I really did not expect such amazing results but after two weeks the color has lightened drastically.</li>
      <li>I  didn&#x27;t see any results the first week</li>
      <li>This is the most necessary product on the planet for our culture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for exactly 2 weeks now.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the cream on Oct 6, got it within 3 days pretty fast.</li>
      <li>First off, there isn&#x27;t much product for the price you pay.</li>
      <li>It has lasted me about 3 weeks and the product is already pretty much gone.</li>
      <li>It works pretty decent and you don&#x27;t even feel a thing.</li>
      <li>All those private areas are important as well, and this cream does lighten the intimate areas.  </li>
      <li>This cream really does work</li>
      <li>It really works if you put your heart and dedication to it.</li>
      <li>and I in fact,  it&#x27;s very well lit.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I gave it  one star because it was gentle and caused no allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>It keeps very well.</li>
      <li>It is working very well for me.</li>
      <li>If you want really fast results this might not be for you.</li>
      <li>so much maybe I can keep him this way, the pig...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much lighter now</li>
      <li>I therefore cannot give it only one star, nor can I give it a full 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>but i would like it a little bit more lighter</li>
      <li>The product worked great and ill continue to use it.</li>
      <li>I can now walk the streets confidently, knowing that in the event of hospitalisation following an unexpected collision with any means of road transport the medical profession would have no reason to doubt my Aryan credentials.</li>
      <li>The tub is really small and wish there was more for $35.</li>
      <li>so im thinking of buying more cream because this jar is small.</li>
      <li>*, and we&#x27;ve so totally objectified ourselves as mere boy toys, the only way we can attract a man to give us a good rogering (\\&quot;ouch!!!</li>
      <li>A huge waste of time and money.</li>
      <li>we who have it all are clearly headed for heaven, and it all starts with anal bleaching to show that we are *saved*for*all*eternity*by*predestination</li>
      <li>I have Scottish/Canadian/German genetics, my skin is sensitive and</li>
      <li>Now, the brown color has disappeared and looks natural again.  </li>
      <li>and I was mad lol .</li>
      <li>I started using it on my inner thighs and 3 weeks later no change, it was very costly for the amount you get.</li>
      <li>yes, if you need \\&quot;myPinkWink\\&quot; you need never awkwardly position a mirror to look at your imperfect slightly discolored sphincter again.</li>
      <li>I could tell a slightly difference in the first week.</li>
      <li>Had irritation at first so had to stop for a few days.</li>
      <li>You can use it anywhere even though it says certain areas,that&#x27;s not true.</li>
      <li>Thanks to this product my anus now actually glows in the dark.  </li>

<li> In about 2 weeks with everyday use it made a marked difference in color.  </li>
<li> DON&#x27;T BE LEFT IN THE DARK ANY LONGER.</li>
<li> I use this cream for my elbows and inner thighs and have only seen very little change.</li>
<li> I have naturally tanned skin (being of mixed race, i.e., Asian and Black), and for the past few years, my skin-tone in these areas have increasingly darkened (due to age?</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using every night for almost 2 weeks and see minimal lightening if any.....</li>
<li> Elbows and knees after time tend discolor, the pink wink changes that.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical to purchase this product at first being that it only had two reviews, one of which was from the creator of the product herself.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, due to the rather large area of coverage, I will not have enough cream to last through the 3rd week, so I have to purchase another jar. :(  </li>
<li> I choose My Pink Wink because of the reviews, but I tried an entire bottle, which was a small amount considering the price.</li>
<li> The other comments say it like it is.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small container, and the part that holds the product is even smaller.  </li>
<li> At first I was skeptical</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first</li>
<li> I hope to see a dramatic difference between the photos taken pre-usage, and those that I will take at the end of the 4th-week mark (whether it be my natural skin tone or pink).  </li>
<li> The ONLY pros to this product is that it does not burn when applied to your delicate parts</li>
<li> It has not faded any of my dark pigmentation at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My girl friend told me it works.</li>
    <li> Works great!!! Used it for 1 week and already seeing results!!! Loving this cream!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to purchase this product at first being that it only had two reviews, one of which was from the creator of the product herself. But I thought I would give it a shot. I have to say I am very disappointed with this product. First off, there isn&#x27;t much product for the price you pay. It has lasted me about 3 weeks and the product is already pretty much gone. I have seen no change in my skin appearance. It has not faded any of my dark pigmentation at all. Maybe you have to be as fair as snow white for this to work?? The ONLY pros to this product is that it does not burn when applied to your delicate parts and it does not smell at all. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the cream.  In about 2 weeks with everyday use it made a marked difference in color.  The tub is really small and wish there was more for $35.</li>
    <li> It is working very well for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and I&#x27;ve already noticed a dramatic difference on my bunghole, my labia and even the stretch marks on my thighs. It does look pinker! I have to use very little product to cover the area, maybe dabbing my finger in 5-6 times per application. So, I think that this bottle will last me a while. The results probably depend on what skin type you have. I have Scottish/Canadian/German genetics, my skin is sensitive and I scar/stretch mark easily. I&#x27;m glad that I finally broke down and bought something as silly as anal bleach.</li>
    <li> It works pretty decent and you don&#x27;t even feel a thing. I was skeptical at first but this cream can lighten the skin periodically. I could tell a slightly difference in the first week. I usually use it in other areas of the body as well, including face due to stain cause by pimples. But be patient because it might take longer to lighten in some body parts. If you want really fast results this might not be for you. Also have in mind that to get to a desire shade you might have to buy a second jar.</li>
    <li> I have bad sun damage on my face and was looking for something to lighten the spots without breaking me out like hydroquinone does, and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost at a month&#x27;s mark using this and I&#x27;ve seen drastic improvement, I love it!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical but I bought this product for my husband.  He loved when I visited his backdoor but I didn&#x27;t.  I used to have a hard time finding my way around (if you know what I mean) but with this AMAZING product I have no trouble. I can see the end of the tunnel and I in fact,  it&#x27;s very well lit. Almost glow in the dark action. Get this product people....DON&#x27;T BE LEFT IN THE DARK ANY LONGER. #NUMNUM</li>
    <li> I bought this to lighten my underarm area and my inner thigh area.  My underarm area had a light brown color to it (probably from shaving). Now, the brown color has disappeared and looks natural again.  My inner thighs had a very dark brown look to the skin.  Now, the color has changed to a very light brown appearance. I&#x27;m happy I found this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this product my anus now actually glows in the dark.  It helped me find my way during a black-out, though I had to walk backwards and bent over.</li>
    <li> I love a beautiful scar free body, and that&#x27;s from my head to my toe.  All those private areas are important as well, and this cream does lighten the intimate areas.  It would be wonderful to afford the finer spas that provide those type services, but using the products I know about still works for me.  Who ever said those places couldnt be just as beautiful as the rest of your body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for exactly 2 weeks now.  I therefore cannot give it only one star, nor can I give it a full 5 stars.  I did take &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; pics and I am taking pics at each week-end mark.  I needed this product for both my vaginal and anal areas, as well as to lighten my inner thighs.  I have naturally tanned skin (being of mixed race, i.e., Asian and Black), and for the past few years, my skin-tone in these areas have increasingly darkened (due to age? hormones? post-hysterectomy? ... not sure...).  I have been applying this product faithfully, everyday, in the morning and at night.  What I have noticed so far, is not a lightening of my skin, but a &amp;#34;reddening&amp;#34; of my skin (like a bright pinkish tinge).  So I&#x27;m wondering if this product is supposed to &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; my skin, or if it is supposed to &amp;#34;pinken&amp;#34; my skin (thus its name).  I will continue to use it faithfully for another 2 weeks to see how the lightening/pinkening process progresses.  I hope to see a dramatic difference between the photos taken pre-usage, and those that I will take at the end of the 4th-week mark (whether it be my natural skin tone or pink).  Unfortunately, due to the rather large area of coverage, I will not have enough cream to last through the 3rd week, so I have to purchase another jar. :(  I am determined to give this product a fair chance, and will provide another update in 2 weeks. :)</li>
    <li> I did not use everyday, so I could not say it worked or not. From the smell and touch, it is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using every night for almost 2 weeks and see minimal lightening if any.....don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works very well. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor or texture. It keeps very well. It is in a small and convenient jar. Makes it an easy access.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff &amp; the name makes me laugh every time I use it. This cream is gentle and smooth &amp; actually works great on age spots as well. I did not do a before and after photo of... dare I say, my brown eye turned into my pink wink, but I did notice a dramatic difference in color after a few weeks. As I mentioned before, it works on age spots as well &amp; isn&#x27;t as harsh as some of the other self bleaching products out there. I would highly recommend myPinkWink to anyone; I even introduced this stuff to my plastic surgeon who seemed to be impressed as well.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product it&#x27;s lightning up my private parts and I saw results in just a couple of weeks. I am in my second jar and the difference is amazing. I will keep using it till I get where I want. Its a slow process so if you are looking for an overnight miracle product this is not for you, but if you give the time you will see how it works.</li>
    <li> This cream is like buying regular cream not whiting and its like a weeks use barley has anything you probably need to buy like 20 of these to see even a bit on lightning. Save your money.</li>
    <li> The other comments say it like it is. It did its job fairly quickly, but you have to keep buying it for it to take permanent effect.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant consistency, it doesn&#x27;t have any unpleasant smell or feel on your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and it did work a little , I applied it to my skin once a day and its been about 3 weeks already  I saw a little change so im thinking of buying more cream because this jar is small. It works better than south beach cream  which did not work at all and I was mad lol .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two weeks. I  didn&#x27;t see any results the first week so I lost hope but I paid good money for it, so I kept using it. I really did not expect such amazing results but after two weeks the color has lightened drastically. The cream is gentle and has a very faint smell. I feel so much more self confident. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product. I choose My Pink Wink because of the reviews, but I tried an entire bottle, which was a small amount considering the price. After using the all of the product I still didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Not even a little skin lighting. I gave it  one star because it was gentle and caused no allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> This cream really does work i applied it on twice a day and my husband and I started to see Results in just a week and a Half it&#x27;s much lighter now but i would like it a little bit more lighter so I&#x27;m on my second bottle and it&#x27;s looking pretty awesome</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week....and I can see results already.....no stinging no burning!!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the cream on Oct 6, got it within 3 days pretty fast. I started using it on my inner thighs and 3 weeks later no change, it was very costly for the amount you get. I will continue to use it once a day till is gone and will post my end result.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most pressing concern in our corporatist-capitalistic society is the shame we all feel that our ham flower isn&#x27;t as pearly white a a model&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I see that girl&#x27;s teeth on television, and then position a mirror to look at my sphincter, I just feel such shame and desperation about how futile and horrible my life is I just want to kill myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God (and I&#x27;m talking the God of strict Calvinism here....we who have it all are clearly headed for heaven, and it all starts with anal bleaching to show that we are *saved*for*all*eternity*by*predestination*! because of our beautiful milk-white anus!) for \\&quot;myPinkWink\\&quot; the skin bleaching cream especially formulated for those of us with less than perfect anuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, in Dr. Suuses&#x27;s \\&quot;The Snetches\\&quot; we have learned that Snetches with stars upon thars are the best Sneteches on the beaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that we have dental floss instead of bathing suits, and nothing is left to the imagination, and men have become such pigs that the only thing they watch is *a*n*a*l* *p*o*r*n*, and we&#x27;ve so totally objectified ourselves as mere boy toys, the only way we can attract a man to give us a good rogering (\\&quot;ouch!!! it hurts!!!! but I *l*ove* him so much maybe I can keep him this way, the pig...ouch!!!\\&quot;) is if we have a bumflower the color of an Icelandic girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep. anal bleaching. This is the most necessary product on the planet for our culture. Yes. \\&quot;myPinkWink\\&quot; says it all about what it is we&#x27;ve become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great at sperating you from your money and giving you the anus you deserve. yes, if you need \\&quot;myPinkWink\\&quot; you need never awkwardly position a mirror to look at your imperfect slightly discolored sphincter again. The mirror right in front of you will suffice.</li>
    <li> I had not come across this product before, anal bleaching not being a popular pastime in the United Kingdom. As a member of the Nordic Order of Brothers, however, I felt obliged to try it. As a true NOB, I am  pleased to be white from head to toe, including all areas in between. I can now walk the streets confidently, knowing that in the event of hospitalisation following an unexpected collision with any means of road transport the medical profession would have no reason to doubt my Aryan credentials.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. You can use it anywhere even though it says certain areas,that&#x27;s not true. Elbows and knees after time tend discolor, the pink wink changes that. Every day I apply a small amount to the area, it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, it&#x27;s a gradual change. After 2 weeks you see the difference. It&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
    <li> I have use it for a while by now and didn&#x27;t do anything. Not even a slight discoloration! Very sad and the jar is soooo tiny!</li>
    <li> This cream was sooooo expensive and I used it religiously until I ran out.... which didn&#x27;t take long. It came in a tiny tiny container, like the size of chapstick container. I took pictures before and after and there was literally NO difference. A huge waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The product worked great and ill continue to use it. I didn&#x27;t get any side effects just the results I wanted</li>
    <li> This product yielded no results whatsoever. For the price, I would have expected at least something. I am very disappointed. The amount you get is very small and perhaps it would work if it wasn&#x27;t such a small amount. I don&#x27;t know and I won&#x27;t find out because I will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Still in the process of using this product.  After two weeks I haven&#x27;t noticed a change.  Read the reviews prior to ordering and am still hopeful it will work.  It&#x27;s a small container, and the part that holds the product is even smaller.  My husband ordered two luckily, but for the price it is selling for I excepted more cream.</li>
    <li> Being using it for 2 weeks. Had irritation at first so had to stop for a few days. So far no results, but it says to wait one month so hopefully :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a month NO RESULTS AT ALL, not even a shade lighter. Maybe it works on other parts of the body but surely not on genitals.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rally works, I like it .&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of product and they didn&#x27;t work but this amazing.</li>
    <li> It really works if you put your heart and dedication to it. Everyone should try it, if your trying to get rid of darkness.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for my elbows and inner thighs and have only seen very little change. I&#x27;ve been using it 3 weeks, twice a day. I would say it&#x27;s probably not worth the money since SOO little comes in the jar and there&#x27;s been hardly any improvement.</li>
