### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s light-weight and just... looks good!!</li>
      <li>It just gives you a great look and feel without weighing your hair</li>
      <li>Great product with a truly matte finish</li>
      <li>Great product though.</li>
      <li>light and matte - perfect.</li>
      <li>To make it work as good, you have to use a lot of it to get the spikey effect effect, and there&#x27;s not a lot in the 1.5oz bottle.</li>
      <li>I loved this hair product, very unique and great smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>(I do a short-on-the-sides, longer-on-top kind of thing).</li>
      <li>product does have a nice smell though.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold but good for texture</li>
      <li>Good for static type hair but more of a styling cream than a clay.</li>
      <li>this Stephen Knoll Clay has been the best product I have used on my hair so far.</li>
      <li>the best so far.</li>
      <li>I am a guy with very fine hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying more just in case</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried so many combinations of &#x27;Crew&#x27;,&#x27;Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;, etc..</li>
      <li>I get more compliments on my hair than ever before.</li>
      <li>&quot;, as they call it, gives me both those things, and it&#x27;s my favorite product out of the many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
      <li>It is pliable until I wash it out, and it really feels great when you run your fingers through it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It looks clean and gives my hair a nice finish without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>However, given that it is so matte, it does not allow you to separate into chunks or spikes that easily if you are spiking it up or doing a faux hawk.</li>
      <li>I want a strong hold, so</li>
      <li>This clay has a great firm hold and a really nice smell.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic for creating volume and texture without making my hair feel/look greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have had run the shelves like so many other reviewers in search of a great product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a pretty good replacement--thickens and holds hair very well</li>
      <li>I think if I were rich and didn&#x27;t mind shelling out $20 every 2-3 weeks for hair wax, this would be my product of choice.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent!</li>
      <li>I was happy with the combination of holding strength and non-greasiness of Rough Clay until Redken discontinued it, for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The final look is styled up and has a really nice matte finish.  </li>
      <li>Not quite as good as what it replaced (Redken Rough Clay 20), but close.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While this requires a bit MORE styling clay to do the job than I&#x27;m used to, it does so more covertly than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It kind of just makes your hair dry and adds a lot of volume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only thing keeping this review from being five stars is that the they don&#x27;t really give you very much (1.5 oz goes pretty quickly when I do my hair every day).</li>
      <li>I would say, almost completely, which was a little surprising.</li>
      <li>does not grease my hair but works very well.</li>
      <li>It was even better than rough clay.</li>
      <li>just what I wanted to rough up the top of my hair when i have it in a pony.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair that can get weighed down pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>Works great, not sticky at all, no shine, I use just a small amount and hold last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>This stuff works pretty well on my fine hair for adding texture, but it often leaves white residue in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
      <li>I only spike my hair up on weekends so it will last me a good month or maybe two, but if I used it every day, it would likely be gone in 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>light blow dry</li>
      <li>Based on previous reviews, I thought this was going to have more hold.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of cash searching for the right hair product for my short, somewhat fine hair.</li>
      <li>I normally style in a pseudo faux hawk, so it is up normally</li>
      <li>lighter but feels very natural and mineral like.  </li>
      <li>Bought this as a replacement for Redken rough clay, and I gotta say works just as good, if not better.</li>
      <li>Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumo Wax was nice, but just a little too greasy and \\&quot;soft\\&quot; compared to Rough Clay.</li>
      <li>It is, but it kinda smells like old lady.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t start drooping as the day wears on, and a matte, natural look, so my head&#x27;s not all shiny and/or crusty looking.  </li>
      <li>Its defitnley worth checking out, if you are curious about it being &amp;#34;hair clay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I sometimes combine a little bit of Sumo Wax for a little bit of extra \\&quot;shine\\&quot; (plus, Sumo Wax smells pretty amazing).</li>
      <li>I tried nearly every American Crew hair product with no luck.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First a little about my hair: THICK, straight, strong.</li>
      <li>In the past, Sebastian Crude Clay was the magic formula to do exactly what I needed, but there was always a risk of using too much.  </li>

<li> Too small of a product for Too much money.</li>

<li> After wasting tons of money on both cheap and expensive products, I finally found Redken Rough Clay 20 last year.</li>
<li> I have very short, straight, fine hair, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to add texture and control without weighing it down or making it oily.  </li>
<li> so I would say my hair was about 4 inches long.</li>

<li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
<li> so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall down.</li>
<li> Plenty of strength and even less greasiness than what I&#x27;d been used to.</li>
<li> At 1.5 oz, this is probably half of what you are used to from a styling</li>
<li> I like to do a sort of messy</li>
<li> They were either too waxy, too greasy, or too stiff.</li>
<li> I really wanted the crude clay that Sebastian used to make, and this looked comparable.</li>
<li> This is a really small puck of wax.</li>
<li> It was just too hard with this product alone.</li>
<li> Given how small the can is, and how expensive it is, it just isn&#x27;t feasible for me or the average guy.</li>
<li> I need to have it thinned out at every hair cut, and it&#x27;s still thick.</li>
<li> Like many others I was disappointed to find that Crude Clay had been discontinued.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I have to mix this with another gel that has a stronger hold</li>
<li> I bought this in attempt to replace a discontinued product called Matrix Dirty Trix.   </li>
<li> They stopped making the Crude Clay.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Based on previous reviews, I thought this was going to have more hold. Unfortunately I have to mix this with another gel that has a stronger hold so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall down. I guess it&#x27;s for ppl who want medium hold. It doesn&#x27;t flake though.</li>
    <li> This clay has a great firm hold and a really nice smell. The hold will last all day. I have tried quite a few different pomades and waxes and I like this one the best so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this in attempt to replace a discontinued product called Matrix Dirty Trix.   To make it work as good, you have to use a lot of it to get the spikey effect effect, and there&#x27;s not a lot in the 1.5oz bottle. I only spike my hair up on weekends so it will last me a good month or maybe two, but if I used it every day, it would likely be gone in 2 to 3 weeks. Great product though. I just wish they sold it in bigger containers for the same price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of cash searching for the right hair product for my short, somewhat fine hair. I like to do a sort of messy but _almost_ symmetrical, natural-looking style. After wasting tons of money on both cheap and expensive products, I finally found Redken Rough Clay 20 last year. I was happy with the combination of holding strength and non-greasiness of Rough Clay until Redken discontinued it, for whatever reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search was on again. I tried nearly every American Crew hair product with no luck. They were either too waxy, too greasy, or too stiff. Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumo Wax was nice, but just a little too greasy and \\&quot;soft\\&quot; compared to Rough Clay. So I came across this Stephen Knoll Clay Wax and gave it a shot. Wow. It was even better than rough clay. Plenty of strength and even less greasiness than what I&#x27;d been used to. I sometimes combine a little bit of Sumo Wax for a little bit of extra \\&quot;shine\\&quot; (plus, Sumo Wax smells pretty amazing). I get more compliments on my hair than ever before. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty well on my fine hair for adding texture, but it often leaves white residue in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
    <li> I am so picky about what I use on my hair.. I have had run the shelves like so many other reviewers in search of a great product. I have used Paul Mitchell products for years, specifically &#x27;Dry Wax&#x27; and I have tried so many combinations of &#x27;Crew&#x27;,&#x27;Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;, etc.. this Stephen Knoll Clay has been the best product I have used on my hair so far. It looks clean and gives my hair a nice finish without feeling greasy. It is pliable until I wash it out, and it really feels great when you run your fingers through it. It just gives you a great look and feel without weighing your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair, towel dry, light blow dry, them run this through my hair and let it air dry. The final look is styled up and has a really nice matte finish.  It&#x27;s light-weight and just... looks good!! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for Redken rough clay, and I gotta say works just as good, if not better.</li>
    <li> Great product with a truly matte finish</li>
    <li> Works great, not sticky at all, no shine, I use just a small amount and hold last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> Like many others I was disappointed to find that Crude Clay had been discontinued. This stuff is a pretty good replacement--thickens and holds hair very well (I do a short-on-the-sides, longer-on-top kind of thing). Only thing keeping this review from being five stars is that the they don&#x27;t really give you very much (1.5 oz goes pretty quickly when I do my hair every day). If they made a larger version of this, I&#x27;d stock up on it.</li>
    <li> I am a guy with very fine hair. It is the product that I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It does not grease my hair but works very well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair product, very unique and great smell. My only complaint is the price. C&#x27;mon, 18 bucks for 1.5 oz?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would last a while, I used the entire product within a month or 2, and I have short spikey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing. Fresh scent! Its defitnley worth checking out, if you are curious about it being &amp;#34;hair clay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Probably not. Too small of a product for Too much money.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not quite as good as what it replaced (Redken Rough Clay 20), but close.  It works for me!</li>
    <li> Good for static type hair but more of a styling cream than a clay. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold but good for texture</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair styling products over the years, including hair sprays, gels, waxes, and clays.  I have medium/short, thick, straight hair that I like to put up in the front in various styles.  I want a strong hold, so my hair doesn&#x27;t start drooping as the day wears on, and a matte, natural look, so my head&#x27;s not all shiny and/or crusty looking.  This \\&quot;clay wax\\&quot;, as they call it, gives me both those things, and it&#x27;s my favorite product out of the many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  If you&#x27;re looking for similar attributes in a product, I&#x27;d say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and use mouse to style. After, I use this wax selectively to lift and make the style &amp;#34;piece(i.e.)&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb!  I have short, fine hair that can get weighed down pretty easily.  This stuff is fantastic for creating volume and texture without making my hair feel/look greasy.  Lasts all day and then some.  I&#x27;m buying more just in case I can&#x27;t find it anymore!</li>
    <li> I have very short, straight, fine hair, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to add texture and control without weighing it down or making it oily.  In the past, Sebastian Crude Clay was the magic formula to do exactly what I needed, but there was always a risk of using too much.  They stopped making the Crude Clay.  So, I switched to this after numerous faild attempts to replace it elsewhere and after seeing in someone&#x27;s comments that this is a comparable solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this requires a bit MORE styling clay to do the job than I&#x27;m used to, it does so more covertly than any other I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> light and matte - perfect. just what I wanted to rough up the top of my hair when i have it in a pony.</li>
    <li> This is a really small puck of wax. At 1.5 oz, this is probably half of what you are used to from a styling product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First a little about my hair: THICK, straight, strong. I need to have it thinned out at every hair cut, and it&#x27;s still thick. When applied, I was in need for a haircut so I would say my hair was about 4 inches long. I normally style in a pseudo faux hawk, so it is up normally and I need a product that will hold it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does leave your hair matte. I would say, almost completely, which was a little surprising. However, given that it is so matte, it does not allow you to separate into chunks or spikes that easily if you are spiking it up or doing a faux hawk. It kind of just makes your hair dry and adds a lot of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is medium imo. It gets the hair up, but if you want some piecey strands, you are going to need something else. This wax won&#x27;t give you those chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to use another product (Gatsby) to get it to chunk/piece. It was just too hard with this product alone. I think this product could do the job, but you&#x27;d need to use a lot of it. Given how small the can is, and how expensive it is, it just isn&#x27;t feasible for me or the average guy. I think if I were rich and didn&#x27;t mind shelling out $20 every 2-3 weeks for hair wax, this would be my product of choice. At this price for 1.5 oz, it&#x27;s not worth it imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a nice smell though.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I really wanted the crude clay that Sebastian used to make, and this looked comparable. It is, but it kinda smells like old lady. The smell goes away throughout the day though (I think).</li>
    <li> lighter but feels very natural and mineral like.  I would highly recommend.</li>
