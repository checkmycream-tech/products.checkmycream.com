      <li>/&gt;I am really excited about using this product on a continuous basis.</li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>With 100% money back guarantee Leven Rose oils is a sure</li>
      <li>’s really great for dry hands, or</li>
      <li>Love soft, healthy</li>
      <li>The quick absorption brings a nice healthy feel and look to the skin instantly, feeling softer and looking brighter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
      <li>This bottle will last us a good while.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it in my hair, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking or feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed that it absorbs quickly into skin without leaving a greasy or oily feeling, and has cleared up the dryness in my hands and cuticles.</li>
      <li>I was also very happy to see this is a 100% natural product with only one ingredient, which is the pure pomegranate oil.  </li>
      <li>The seller is courteous and very prompt getting back to you; very friendly.</li>
      <li>It gives my face a healthy glow when I put it on and makes it very soft.  </li>
      <li>The oil arrived in a dark glass bottle which is great to keep the oil fresh, pure and toxin free.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I tried this because my blackheads have almost completely gone away.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and smooth, too!  </li>
      <li>I also started using essential oils and making a lot of my own products and just recently decided I would try making my own shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have only used the Leven Rose Pomegranate oil for two days.  </li>
      <li>I truly love anything natural and organic.</li>
      <li>This seller was great- contacted me to make sure I&#x27;d received the product, and then again a few days later to see how I like it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to wait a few weeks of using it to be unconditionally in love since I want to be sure it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out over time.</li>
      <li>The glass dropper bottle is great, because since you only need a couple of drops, you can get the precise amount you need using the dropper, and you don&#x27;t waste any of this.  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a carrier oil to make a face serum with my essential oils, but I love it so much by itself that I rarely add anything to it.</li>
      <li>My favorite way to use it is in Anti-aging Facial serum!</li>
      <li>but even just at night it seems to be working really well!</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t mind waiting to put my makeup on because I know exactly what&#x27;s in it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, only a small dropper at a time works great, who would of known pomegrante oil would work so well on skin</li>
      <li>I really don’t like plastic droppers, they seem to fail more often than not, Leven Rose uses glass droppers with their oils and it’s a huge different.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one fluid ounce and has the Doppler already installed making it easy to store in my medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>Therapeutic grade ( no fillers, no nonsense, just pure Pomegranate Oil)</li>
      <li>Healthier skin and hair is just a drop away with 100% Pure Pomegranate Oil.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although the product is very concentrated, I wish there was a little bit more of it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was offered this product for a discounted price of $1 for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really excited about using this product on a continuous basis. I truly love anything natural and organic. Leven Rose Pomegranate Oil is perfect for my acne as it helps with cell renewal. I suffer from adult acne and I am definitely always on the lookout for products that help with it. When trying this product it did not leave an nasty smell like other products with harsh chemicals do. I also noticed that it left my face feeling silky smooth in the morning. Quick absorption! Which I appreciate :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly love the convenience of the bottle. It&#x27;s one fluid ounce and has the Doppler already installed making it easy to store in my medicine cabinet. I tried it on my hair and it made my very soft and not oily. Tonight I will use it to massage my scalp with in order to promote hair growth as it is known to unclog scalp pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a seemingly great product so far :)</li>
    <li> My main reason for purchasing this was for hair care, but I also plan on trying this for skin as well. I really love that Leven Rose has all natural and organic products with nothing added or taken away.  I have been experimenting with making my own shampoo and detangler sprays as an alternative to expensive pre made non toxic personal care products. A little over a year ago I started researching the ingredients in all my personal care products and discovered just how toxic they are.  I starting buying all natural and non toxic products but they were not budget friendly.  I also started using essential oils and making a lot of my own products and just recently decided I would try making my own shampoo.  I have tried another product from Leven Rose their rosehip oil, and was very happy with it, so I was excited to try the Pomegranate oil from them.  This oil comes in a dark amber glass bottle with a glass stopper to extend shelf life, as oils are light sensitive and should be stored in dark amber bottles to protect them from oxidation. The oil itself is light almost clear in color, and it has a faint but pleasant smell. There seem to be a lot of uses for this oil and I plan on using it for skin care as well, my daughter is just starting to have occasional acne so we will be using it to help clear up her skin. I have also noticed that it absorbs quickly into skin without leaving a greasy or oily feeling, and has cleared up the dryness in my hands and cuticles. It leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have been using it in my hair, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking or feeling greasy. However it doesn&#x27;t take a lot, a little goes a long way.  This bottle will last us a good while.  Hair feels softer, and looks shiny, and also helps with frizz.  I have also been using in my kids hair as well to help keep the frizz down, and makes it soft. We have tried applying right after showers when hair is damp as well as using on the ends when hair is dry. I am reallyimpressed with the results, and will continue to use it. I am also hoping to see improved hair growth for my husband, as he has thinning hair.  I have added it to a homemade spray detangler that also has distilled water, essential oils, and vinegar in it, and plan on adding it to homemade shampoo that also contains Castile liquid soap, distilled water, essential oils, argan oil, jojoba oil, rosehip oil, and aloe in it.  I hadn&#x27;t ever tried this oil before but I am very happy we did. There are many ways this oil can help your skin as well, it regenerates and heals skin by promoting cell renewal, improving your skin&#x27;s elasticity, which diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The high Omega 5 Fatty Acid in this oil has strong anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties by helping to fend off free radicals. It also helps unclog pores on the face to help in relieve the symptoms of acne. It also assists with unclogging scalp pores to promote hair growth. So far we really like the results we are seeing and will continue use.  I have been so impressed with their products that I hope to purchase some others.  **We received discounted product in exchange for providing an honest &amp; unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I use it on my skin for added moisture and softness. I infuse this oil with my body lotion. Just a few drops does wonders. My skin is softer and is less dry. I have only been using the product for a few days and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is really good. I use it on my skin every night and use it on my hair. It really leaves your skin feeling soft. I use it at night and when I wake up my skin is really soft. I suffer from adult acne and when I use this at night it cleared up all of my acne. I also use it on my hair. It can use it on your splits end. It leaves your hair feeling nice and soft. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Thanks</li>
    <li> Fast service. This oil as well as Leven rosehip oil both are excellent as facial oils. The pomegranate oil is rapidly absorbed; essential fats and other nutrients to help provide antioxidants for healthy skin. Rosehip oil use has increased because of its properties. I believe pomegranate oil should be added for those reasons as well. Love soft, healthy sk8n!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different essential oils, but Pomegranate Oil wasn&#x27;t one of them.  When I saw how beneficial it was for clearing your skin of blackheads, I had to try this.  I have always had trouble with blackheads, no matter how much effort I put into my daily skin care routine.  I was also very happy to see this is a 100% natural product with only one ingredient, which is the pure pomegranate oil.  It is grown without using GMOs too.  The oil has no smell and it only takes a few drops to treat my whole face and neck.  I am so glad I tried this because my blackheads have almost completely gone away.  My pores have never looked so clear!  The glass dropper bottle is great, because since you only need a couple of drops, you can get the precise amount you need using the dropper, and you don&#x27;t waste any of this.  It comes in a 1 ounce bottle, so it will last a long time.  My skin is so soft and smooth, too!  I am grateful I was able to purchase this at a discounted price, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.</li>
    <li> This 100% organic pomegranate oil is so good for my face. I put a few drops in to my hand and I pat it into my face. It is very moisturizing and won&#x27;t clog my pores. I feel that it is an awesome primer to use before I apply my makeup. It makes my skin feel smooth. I really like that it comes in a glass bottle with a dropper, so I can only put into my hand what I need for my face &amp; not waste any. It also comes in a pretty pink glass bottle.</li>
    <li> love that this comes in a glass bottle. Can tell it is good quality oil. Use on my face as a moisturizer and can really notice a difference in my skin. No more acne and smoother skin. thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my hair for about a week now and my hair has been less frizzy and looks more tame. Only a few drops is needed. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet, just got it. But it smells wonderful. In gonna make a soap with this. Or maybe shampoo bars. Yummy, doesn&#x27;t that sound wonderful?</li>
    <li> This seller was great- contacted me to make sure I&#x27;d received the product, and then again a few days later to see how I like it/how it was working.  I used it the first night on a skin blemish and it was almost gone the next morning.  I was a little concerned about the fact that it&#x27;s an oil- I have pretty oily skin, especially evident in the morning- but my skin was actually LESS oily after using it.  My skin looks and feels better, and I don&#x27;t have to use very much- I recommend the &amp;#34;blotting&amp;#34; on your skin instead of rubbing it in (or try that method first).&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely order again when my supply gets low.  GREAT product- highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I only use it at night- I don&#x27;t really have an opportunity to apply multiple times a day for maximum effect, as the label suggests- but even just at night it seems to be working really well!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair. I read a few articles on the benefits of pomegranate oil for the hair and was very intrigued and had to buy one. I decided to buy the Leven Rose Pomegranate oil because of it is 100% organic and pure. The oil arrived in a dark glass bottle which is great to keep the oil fresh, pure and toxin free. The included dropper is made out of glass with a rubber handle makes it very easy to dispense the right amount of oil. The adorable pink label on the bottle lists several uses, application and shelf life information. I purchased this item during a one time promotional period, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a very mild nut scent and is a pale yellow color. The oil is not very thick which makes it perfect when applying it to the hair and skin. I have now been applying this oil after I shower for about two weeks and my hair is shinier and softer. The oil helps to de tangle and remove frizz, while providing natural antioxidants and vitamins to rejuvenate the hair. My hair is easier to comb and the amount of split ends in my hair has minimized. My hair also seems longer and fuller ever since I began using this oil. The oil has helped to stimulate hair growth, which makes me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the size of the bottle because I can take it with me when I travel in my carry on bag. The bottle is leak free and very compact, perfect for those on the go! I love that the oil is also pure and pesticide free and my hair and scalp feel great after each application. I would recommend this all natural elixir to my friends and family looking for an all natural and organic hair remedy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil everyday and I love it. My skin has a nice glow after. I would definitely recommend this product and the seller!</li>
    <li> this oil is nice but i probably will not reorder.only because I like&lt;br /&gt;coconut oil BETTER....</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil. I&#x27;m so happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> Leven Rose is a 100% Organic, undiluted, GMO-free Pomegranate Oil. This really does not have a big smell and leaves your skin soft and smooth. It is easy to use, only a small dropper at a time works great, who would of known pomegrante oil would work so well on skin but it does was excited to be given the chance to review this I love it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I mix this with jojoba oil, rose oil and argon and keep it in a small blue glass jar with a dropper.  It&#x27;s become my new moisturizer.  It take a few minutes to absorb into my skin but I don&#x27;t mind waiting to put my makeup on because I know exactly what&#x27;s in it.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of the oil and the company&#x27;s excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> The product is of superb quality. My favorite way to use it is in Anti-aging Facial serum! The seller is courteous and very prompt getting back to you; very friendly. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for pomegranate seed oil at a decent price.</li>
    <li> super nice moisture for face.</li>
    <li> Love this product...favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a carrier oil to make a face serum with my essential oils, but I love it so much by itself that I rarely add anything to it. My skin drinks it like it&#x27;s thirsty, and it makes my face so hydrated and soft. My skin is glowing, and it doesn&#x27;t look oily. This is my favorite face moisturizer. I came back to buy another for me and one for my grandma.</li>
    <li> Healthier skin and hair is just a drop away with 100% Pure Pomegranate Oil. Therapeutic grade ( no fillers, no nonsense, just pure Pomegranate Oil) The oil is great at promoting cell renewal, which helps improve your  overall skin health. It’s cell renewal properties can even help your battle against wrinkles. A little goes a long way, the oil absorbs really nicely into your skin and doesn’t leave any greasy feeling . The quick absorption brings a nice healthy feel and look to the skin instantly, feeling softer and looking brighter.&lt;br /&gt;It’s really great for dry hands, or rough patches to elbows. Over time it can help smooth those areas out if you use it daily. It does not clog the pores, so it’s amazing on the face. My son uses this on his face at night, it helps his inflamed skin. It has really helped him and his skin has been looking healthier with daily night use of it.&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate oil is also great for hair, putting the bounce back into dull damaged hair, massaging into your scalp it can help unclog pores and even promote some hair growth. You can add a few drops into your shampoo bottle and within time you will notice a healthier shine and healthier hair! Keep the oil out of direct sunlight, the amber bottle helps extent the life of the oil but oils should never be in direct sun. With a  glass dropper, it makes application extremely easy. I really don’t like plastic droppers, they seem to fail more often than not, Leven Rose uses glass droppers with their oils and it’s a huge different.&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate oil is really a great addition to my medicine cabinet, I love using it instead of any lotion and as I said before a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts a long time! With 100% money back guarantee Leven Rose oils is a sure bet!&lt;br /&gt;*I received the following product(s) to review at a discounted price. I was not required to write a positive review no other monetary compensation was given . Any and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this.  I was a bit worried about using oil as a moisturizer, but it doesn&#x27;t stay oily and it seems like my skin likes it.  I&#x27;ve got mature skin that sees way too much sun so any help I can get!  It doesn&#x27;t take much, so I think the 2 oz will last a while.  There&#x27;s virtually no smell either.  I&#x27;m going to wait a few weeks of using it to be unconditionally in love since I want to be sure it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out over time.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in suncreen that I made.  Also used a little on my hair as the oil is thick.  Will add to other diy products that I make.</li>
    <li> This oil is working for me! I can see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ll be reordering!</li>
    <li> This is an oil that I had never thought about trying on my skin,  but I wish I had known about it sooner.  It regenerates and heals your skin through cell renewal  and I can use all of the cell renewal health I can get.  lol.  This Pom oil by Leven Rose is Therapeutic grade and non-GMO,  with no additives or fillers.  It doesn&#x27;t sit on your face like some oils,  but absorbs very quickly.  I always feel like my skin is drinking it and that makes me think that my skin must really love it to drink it up so quickly.  It gives my face a healthy glow when I put it on and makes it very soft.  It naturally contains Omega -3 fatty acids that have strong anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties.  I have only been using it for a couple weeks,  but I am loving the way my skin is looking and I have to attribute that to the Pom oil.  I also added some to the ends of my hair ,  which tend to be dry,  and my hair also drank it up.  It felt softer and hydrated.  I am excited to see what effect a couple of months of use do.  I highly recommend it for ppl who like to use natural products on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discount for my unbiased review and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used this oil in combination with the Jojoba oil and I love it!  My skin is very sensitive and breakout prone and my acne is almost gone and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.  If you have problems with your skin absorbing it, use a hydrosol.</li>
    <li> I have only used the Leven Rose Pomegranate oil for two days.  So far, I am very pleased with it.  It is not oily on my face as I had anticipated.  In fact, my face is beginning to look very radiant.  No perfume or alcohol smell.  It is actually odorless.  I would recommend this oil; it is reasonably priced considering it is 100 % organic.  A Good Find....</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I am 20 years old and suffering from hormonal acne but the pomegranate oil really helps to reduce the redness and inflammation while keeping my skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it on my hair but I am sure it would be great for that use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product is very concentrated, I wish there was a little bit more of it! My skin is drinking this stuff up!</li>
    <li> Love! Makes my hair smooth and soft without the greasy feeling as long as you don&#x27;t use too much. Great for skin too!</li>
    <li> Dropper didn&#x27;t work properly, kept pouring out the oil. Nice oil though</li>
