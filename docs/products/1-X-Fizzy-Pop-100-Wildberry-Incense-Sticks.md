<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the companies Incense. Nice and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Best incense I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been buying these for years. These are the high quality sticks you find in the good head shops.</li>
    <li> A house that burns incense *(Good incense!) Is noticed more by others that us! .... It slowly &amp;#34;per stick&amp;#34; paints our homes with pleasant smell! Who does not like being complimented on a nice smelling home!&lt;br /&gt;Of course Wildberry are top-grade incense!... And the Fizzy Pop has a unique scent... Trying to explain is hard, but like it sounds, is about how it smells. These sticks even have glitter on the ends to pick them out if you use a Vase or antique to hold your sticks!.... Great price, as they are much more expensive in stores! Buy 200 if you can (Along with many other sticks that make you home have a signature scent!).....</li>
    <li> These shipped so fast &amp; the smell is amazing</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy the \\&quot;Fizzy Pop\\&quot; scented sticks of incense. Light and fun, this unique product truly conveys the idea of a carbonated incense with a sweet flavor punch. Fizzy Pop will stay on my Wishlist for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Fizzy Pop is by far my favorite Wildberry Incense Stick. It truly does have a fizzy smell to it and one stick goes a very long way!</li>
    <li> Fizzy Pop is one of my top 3 from Wild Berry &amp; Wild Berry is the best.  No ash smell.</li>
    <li> Great, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT BUY! Arrived before it was scheduled to. No broken sticks. No mess. Perfectly sealed up tight. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite smell, but it&#x27;s fresh!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Wildberry is the way to go when purchasing incense!</li>
    <li> Fizzzzzy pop.... Best incent. Fresh. Good price</li>
    <li> This incense does have a fizzy scent, almost like soda. They light easily and last for a long time. Would highly recommand this product. This is a good quality incense that I reorder often.</li>
    <li> The best incense on the market cost efficient  ... very true to the scents we love them , long lasting , slow burn .</li>
    <li> I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;Almost every brand of incense I buy it smells like burning wood.&lt;br /&gt;These smell sweet like blue berries.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on the 27th and it arrived within one week. They smell great, I have no trouble getting them to burn, and will defiantly purchase this again in the future!</li>
    <li> my favorite! smells so sweet and fresh</li>
    <li> I ordered these and i cant believe how great it smells. I believe any incense burner would love this stuff! Try some! you wont regret. Promis</li>
    <li> I Love the Fast Shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item in local stores....yet, its so much better and economical to buy in bulk,,,,Great  Quality Product!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, and fizzy pop is my favorite 😊😊</li>
    <li> Constantly need to be relit, even months after being stored in a open jar. First I thought it was because they were still moist, but there was no improvement. I am super bummed because these are usually great, and from my childhood my favorite scent. Living abroad I wanted some scent of home, but these didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> When i first received the package, i opened it up and WHAM! i was bombarded with a truly fruity and fizzy smell, exactly what the title sounds like. The scent was actually overwhelming (and even though i have a sweet tooth, it was just REALLY sweet) and almost TOO sweet, and i never really say anything is too sweet. Just having the sticks sitting in my room gave off the smell without me even having to burn it. After a few days the smell began to fade, and i decided to burn a few. When burned, i could &#x27;faintly&#x27; smell it, and after the incense was done, the smell would stay about 10 minutes max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit disappointed but i&#x27;m assuming that i just got a pack that was mediocre. All of the other reviews seem to say otherwise about the smell when the incense is burned. To be honest, compared to when i burn \\&quot;peace of mind\\&quot; and \\&quot;nirvana\\&quot; which both give off a warm and peaceful smell, this incense seems to be very VERY modest when it comes to leaving an impact on my nose.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Fizzy Pop. We buy this from a shop near by and glad to see it here and cheaper. Though I ordered Fizzy Pop and got ocean wind. Don&#x27;t like the smell of the ocean wind at all. Hope the wild honey gets shipped correctly.</li>
    <li> Love Wildberry and this scent in particular is one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> I love this incense so much I don&#x27;t even know what to say.. it smells like fizzy soda! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?</li>
    <li> These are my favorite.  I get them all the time.  The smell great they are the best smelling. Try it</li>
    <li> It smells like a sweet soda pop rock!  It hides the secret smoking a cig or other smoke products.  (Wink)  in the kitchen really nice.  If your daughter is away in college and decides to come over over unannounced she&#x27;ll never know.  I&#x27;m cooking chicken fajitas in the kitchen and I don&#x27;t smell that, I smell sweet fizzy pop. Lol.  Just as nice as Dragon Blood.</li>
    <li> These sticks were very damp, and the majority burn out repeatedly and must be re-lit. I don&#x27;t have this problem with the exact same item purchased locally, even when they freshly restock. Not sure what the problem is, maybe just an off batch. I love the scent though, and these are definitely Fizzy Pop. That alone gets the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> They have a great fizzy pop smell when you pull them out, but burn more like the smell of wood than anything else.</li>
    <li> This picky customer gives this particular product a very deserved 5 stars. Fizzy pop is my favorite incense to burn, but all stores are sold out. These were delivered four days later smelling better than any I had ever bought and even appearing longer and thicker. I will be a regular customer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item on several occasions and it never dissapoints.  Easy to light, and fills the room adequately with that awesome Fizzy Pop smell!</li>
    <li> It is definitely different as far as scent goes. It seems a bit chemically treated. It actually makes me a bit nauseous now. I wanted something a bit different and this was That! Personally I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> They got to me in a timely fashion. I love the scent and I was excited to find such a deal here. And I am complimented on the aroma that leaks from my house because I am fully stocked and use Fizzy Pop whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and the Wildberry incense are the best smelling incense I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample of 15 sticks from the Wildberry site, and I really like the scent, (albeit I&#x27;ve been told it smells too sweet, but I do&#x27;nt think so) as it smells like 7UP to me; still, it&#x27;s got a habit of going out, and having to be re-lit. Yet, the last incense I ordered through Amazon.com didn&#x27;t have this quirk, so next time (very soon) I&#x27;ll order this scent through them.&lt;br /&gt;(Update 1-21-14)&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve finally re-ordered this scent, I can say that it reminds me more of \\&quot;Sprite\\&quot;, than \\&quot;7UP\\&quot; seeing as how \\&quot;Sprite\\&quot; seems sweeter. This is a VERY sweet-smelling incense, and I REALLY enjoy it, hence the reason I added a star. If you don&#x27;t like sweet smelling incense, then steer clear of this one: however, if you DO like sweet scents, you really must try this, as you&#x27;ll VERY likely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> OMG this scent is sooo light, refreshing and fizzy lol.  However, I have to keep re-lighting the sticks as they go out before burning to the end.</li>
    <li> I love this scent so much! It has that &amp;#34;fizzy&amp;#34; scent like when you smell a soda. It&#x27;s fruity kind of like sprite or mountain dew. I love it so much!</li>
    <li> The incense smell amazing as always. I order them frequently because I can not find these scents in Alaska like I could in Indiana. So it is very appreciated that they are on here.</li>
    <li> I loved the price.  Shipping was fast.  But the item came slightly damp like they weren&#x27;t stored in a dry place.  Some sticks had problems staying lit.  I stuck them in a paper bag for a few days.  This helped a little but was still having problems with the larger sticks.  I am going to reorder soon so I will post again when i find out if I just had a bad batch or if all of there incense is damp.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came the very next day! The scent is very strong and when lit actually makes the room smell like soda. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells like you&#x27;re sniffing champagne or fizzy soda.&lt;br /&gt;I smelled this in a record store in Chicago and have been burning it for years.&lt;br /&gt;BEST INCENSE EVER!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE SMELL. .TOXIC. no stars if I could have warned everyone off buying it.</li>
    <li> My whole household loves this scent. They burn great and strong.</li>
    <li> The sodapop smell almost knocks you over when opening the package. The smell is great but while it sorta smells like deranged lemon-lime, that&#x27;s not really all that accurate.  The smell is almost effervescent and truly sorta fizzy.  The burn smell is not much like the fresh dipped smell.  The only downside is they used thin punks for their sticks and they don&#x27;t burn well - no doubt due to the thinness of the sticks - also leaves burned fiber stands like stringy cobwebs.. most unusual.  Most sticks die around half burned.  Relighting a couple of times works but it&#x27;s not user friendly in that regard.  Smoke-wise - it puts out thick dense CLOUDS of milky smoke.. so heavy the smoke falls toward the floor instead of rising in air currents.  This is a stoner incense and is strong.  The finish smell is nice and sorta resembles the unburned smell.  This is not normal incense, either in the burn (sorta poor) to the smell (very haunting and nice).  This will be a continuing purchase item.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! My sister told me about this incense. I&#x27;m so glad I listened to her! I really love that they are sparkly too:)</li>
    <li> My favorite kind of insence makes a room smell wonderful</li>
    <li> Use to buy this incense (the entire collection of fragrances)long ago constantly, just as much as my body oils.  Unfortunately the seller shut down.  The energy &amp; scent of this pack has a beautiful, refreshing somewhat tropical, light fruity scent to it.  Glad I can return to my old buying habits with getting them here :)</li>
    <li> Fizzy pop is my favorite. The 100 pack has worked out very well for me. They smell amazing and they don&#x27;t die halfway through burning them.</li>
    <li> The first batch we had was great, smelled great and burned without issue. The second bunch has very little incense material on the stick.They burn very dirty and do not smell much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again but will wait awhile-maybe the incense will get back to how it was before</li>
    <li> I love Fizzy Pop... reminds me of lemony fruit loops... it&#x27;s changed a little bit over the years.. sometimes they&#x27;re stale... sometimes they&#x27;re not depends on where you buy them etc and the batch, but in GENERAL i love fizzy pop... very lemon/fruit smell without it being like candy sweet. Perhaps maybe even like fruity PEBBLES cereal. Fruit Loop/Fruity Pebble/Lemon smell. MMMmmm lol</li>
    <li> they smell great will be buying more of these</li>
    <li> Just ordered these cant wait to receive!  My boyfriens and I bought some of these from Ambiance Store for Lovers and absolutely loved them atrong sweet scent that makes me never want to buy anything else! All time favorite now not you average cheapy! They were 2 for $1.00and we only got 10 , for double the price of what I paid for 10 I&#x27;ll be getting 100 !</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and the only scent that doesn&#x27;t bother visitors with allergies!</li>
    <li> I found a replacement for my beloved Gold Canyon Fizzy Pop Candle!  Although incense can be too smoky this is a great alternative for me to get that fizzy pop smell that I miss.  Gold Canyon Fizzy Pop candles only come out seasonally and some years they don&#x27;t come out at all.  I try to buy enough of the candles to last becase I never know when they may not have them.  Well it appears that this year fizzy pop is not here yet and maybe will not be.  So I found these incense and I will use this as a replacement until I can get my candles again!  The smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite scent for incense.  The stick itself smells smells just like a pepsi.  I burn one almost every day.  ;-)</li>
    <li> This scent smells just like 7-up, very sweet and lemony! As other reviewers mention it doesn&#x27;t really linger very long. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me... There were also a couple times that it would stop burning and it had to be lighted again which was a little annoying. A nice smell though but wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but so far I&#x27;ve had to re-light them  halfway</li>
    <li> It smells like candy and soda at the same time. I love it.  Make apartment smells delicious. They last a long time too. It&#x27;s a pity they don&#x27;t come in those jars though.  Maybe Wildberry ought to sell jars individually too? That would be neat.</li>
    <li> High Quality product.  Fast shipping and hold there smell.  Really enjoyed them. Bought some for a friend as well and she liked them</li>
    <li> The quality is always top notch.  Packaged nicely with a bow.  Only disappointment was the glass jar isn&#x27;t included.  Alot of people are fooled into thinking the jar comes with the purchase.  Other then that, the product is great and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fizzy pop is honestly my favorite incense scent ever, Wildberry incense are the BEST in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;None of the incense are messed up or anything. Even when I buy them in stores; half of them are falling apart, so I REALLY can&#x27;t complain at all.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I bought them, now I shouldn&#x27;t run out for a lonnnng time, haha.</li>
    <li> Love the Wildberry scent!</li>
    <li> The scent is awesome, but that&#x27;s just about the only good thing about them. As other reviewers have pointed out, I very often have to re-light them, sometimes repeatedly, and many of them are split and falling apart.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this incense in a little head shop when I was around 16 or 17... I remember the owner telling me it was the best incense he&#x27;d ever found, and now I&#x27;d have to agree! After trying many many many varieties and nearly every brand of incense, I always gravitate back to Wildberry and this particular scent (Goloka Nag Champa &amp; Gonesh No. 8 get an honorable mention). One whiff brings so many memories of good times to mind and puts a huge smile on my face. The oils are super high quality and you can smell the unlit stick across the room. Once you do light it, there is barely any &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; smell, just the strong fizzy pop scent that lingers for a good few hours afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, that little head shop shut down (I&#x27;m 23 now) and I&#x27;ve had to buy it from many various other sources. I decided to take a chance and buy the 100 pack here on Amazon; it was a great price, shipped quick, and came fresh sealed in plastic wrapping. Regardless to say, I think I&#x27;ve found my new source for my hands down favorite incense.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son for Christmas and he really liked them.  They burn nice and have a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite. People are always commenting on the smell......it&#x27;s wild and exciting. Love it!</li>
    <li> I always bought this one at a used book store which has since been closed. I looked on Amazon on a whim and couldn&#x27;t believe it was here! And cheap! You will not be disappointed with this. Out of the 90 other scents, this is my very favorite. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but jeez, what a great smoke. You will always have this in your life once you start.</li>
    <li> Smell GREAT! Been buying them for my woman for years</li>
    <li> I first found this wonderful incense at a store called Inti when I was about 10, I loved it from then! Always made my mom buy it, and then the store closed down. Found it many years later at an, ermmm....adult store, and was so thrilled to find it, it was my only purchase that night. I am definitely buying this, I can smell it now... :D</li>
    <li> Always get high quality products, in a timely manner.  Another great scent, top 3 Forsure.  Although, the cones burn out 3x faster than sticks they still smell great.</li>
    <li> These came on times, they are my favorite smelling wild berry Incense. I hada prob with my batch though and they would stop  burning half way through.</li>
    <li> Smells like Lemon soda. Unique scent . You can smell Wildberry better than any other incense I have used. Love Love the product</li>
    <li> Excited for this one, but just not my cup of tea. It has a tickle your noes scent thus the fizzy part I suppose but the pop is very tart or sour smelling if you ask me. This is just my 2cents I do understand everyone has different tastes. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> We love this smell! Not a single one was wasted</li>
    <li> I can never say enough good about Wild Berry incense.  The stuff is top-notch, by far blowing anything you&#x27;d pick up in a paper pack at the grocery store away by miles.  You don&#x27;t really know what incense really can be until you try this good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of more earthy scents like Dragon&#x27;s Blood and India Moon, but I can&#x27;t knock it based on personal preference.  I&#x27;m not a fan of sweeter scents so I only bought a few sticks of Fizzy Pop locally, and I&#x27;m glad I did because after burning Dragon&#x27;s Blood every night for over a month, FizzyPop just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me (the sweet syrupy scent was doing a number on my sinuses).  Just know that it is potent, and it is very sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incense can put off quite a bit of soot when lighting it (while it has the active flame going), probably made worse by the richness of the oils Wild Berry uses.  If you&#x27;re a WildBerry addict like me who lights several sticks a day in the house, you might end up with tiny black soot particles everywhere over time, especially problematic on white blinds where that&#x27;s next to impossible to clean without staining the cords.  Just light it outside or under an exhaust fan, bringing it inside only after the flame is blown out, and voila, no more soot problem.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of Fizzy Pop incense. I prefer putting them around my home kind of like potpourri, as they leave my home smelling just like them! Burning them is also nice, but I do prefer their original scent. Be sure to keep these in a sealed bag when you aren&#x27;t using them, though, as they will dry up if they&#x27;re left out for too long.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t have that overly strong herbal old man hippie smell that many incenses have. Smells like sprite and deliciousness.</li>
    <li> I love Wildberry Incense, and after moving from Dayton, OH (close to Yellow Springs) to Austin, TX, I found my supply of Fizzy Pop severely lacking. I was pleased to find such a great deal on Amazon, and quickly ordered 100 sticks. The shipping was fast, and everything was packaged neatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my dismay, it seems these sticks aren&#x27;t of as high quality as I would expect from Wildberry. The scent is fine, but I find that many of the sticks (at least 1/3 of the ones I light) are &amp;#34;duds&amp;#34; so-to-say. I find myself lighting a stick only to look over minutes later and find it burned out, despite the fact that it was glowing red, and smoking just before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good deal on some of the best smelling incense out there, but I imagine that these bulk packages must be full of these &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; sticks</li>
    <li> its smells like im drinking fizzy soda.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I&#x27;m not sure if I really like it or just somewhat like it. We will have to give it some more time.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast!!! Love love this scent, will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
    <li> Wildberry Incense is definitely the best brand I have found. Fizzy Pop is my favorite, it&#x27;s like a just popped open bottle of 7up in your nose. lol ...  whereas my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite is the strawberry, It may cost more than the standard store stick incense, but, you get what you pay for and it does burn a long time.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite scen!t.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
    <li> This is the most unique scent that I&#x27;ve found in incense. I can&#x27;t even describe the scent but it&#x27;s wonderful.  My fiancee and I love it!  Try it out! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this after moving from my hometown, therefore, was excited to find it at a great price and in a huge quantity as I prefer to buy in bulk. However, I am growing increasingly frustrated with how often I have to re-light these sticks. What is with that? Is this old stock? I don&#x27;t know, but I guess I&#x27;m saving money though because I&#x27;ve hardly been able to burn three sticks because I end up getting tired of re-lighting, in turn using fewer of them than I would normally...</li>
    <li> I loved this item! I used to buy it in UT, and no place in Rock Springs sells it. ^.^ Thanks!</li>
    <li> After my candle shop closed down, I was a bit saddened that I would never be able to get my fizz popping in my home with this WONDERFUL incense. I looked on amazon and BAM there it was...I LOVE this scent, it is my absolute favorite out of all of the scents. The packaging did throw me off a bit, however, I&#x27;m satisfied...see :D</li>
    <li> Such a great citrusy smell!  Burns for a good while and smells great the whole time.  The scent will even last a good while after it has finished burning.  I think this is one of my favorites!</li>
