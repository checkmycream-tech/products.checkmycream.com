    <li> It was excelant, as promised and on time.</li>
    <li> ... it was precisely what the recipient of the gift wanted. So that makes it perfect, right? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints whatsoever, except for the price -- which certainly isn&#x27;t Amazon.com&#x27;s fault!</li>

    <li> Jessica Mcclintock is one of my favorite scents. I try to never run out of it; I get so many complements when I wear it! This gift set was like getting two for the price of one. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase!</li>

    <li> bottom label is different manufacture name than Jessica McClintock bottle I currently have , that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars . The scent appears to be the same.</li>
    <li> I have wore Jessica probably half my life,  I feel it is one of the best fragrances ever.  The stores have stopped selling it and I now  go online to buy it. The last body lotion I bought was old and very runny, I was truly disappointed in my purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife alternates between this and Design; Jessica for Spring and Summer, Design for Fall and Winter.  This was the best price on the Internet and smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells great. My wife loves it - and so do I when she wears it.</li>
    <li> The fragrance didn&#x27;t smell quite as I had remembered it, not sure is the set is old&lt;br /&gt;or my remembrance  of the scent is the problem.</li>
