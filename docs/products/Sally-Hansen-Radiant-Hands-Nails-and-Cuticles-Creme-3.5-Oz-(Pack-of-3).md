### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is the best one to condition my nails before applying polish.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s wonderful, but of course anytime I find a drugstore product I like, they stop carrying it.</li>
      <li>This is the best non-greasy hand cream I have found.  </li>
      <li>This hand and nail cream is excellent.</li>
      <li>The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>A wonderful product, and a 3.5 oz.</li>
      <li>somewhat greasy and did not smell very good.  </li>
      <li>It truly is a miracle creme that keeps your cuticles and nails looking great.  </li>
      <li>So happy to have found this one at Amazon.</li>
      <li>The three containers are handy too!  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, moisturizes hands, arms, elbows beautifully.</li>
      <li>This lotion is amazing for your cuticles and hands and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>This product helps keep them nice.</li>
      <li>However, I still love this lotion since it is so good on my hands.  </li>
      <li>The more you use it, the better your hands look!</li>
      <li>Love it and strongly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I like the vaseline better...</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what Sally Hansen products are famous for, and I believe my nails are getting stronger.</li>
      <li>So do most soaps.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I love the orange scent.</li>
      <li>I keep a tube in my car and in many rooms of my house.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
      <li>Like so many beauty products, my mother introduced me to this one.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel silky, and (maybe I&#x27;m imagining this) has a bit of a glow.</li>
      <li>and so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Should be easy considering how often I have to reapply</li>
      <li>I have strong nails to begin with, so we will see if it prevents breaking and peeling.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a great believer in Sally Hansen products and have had excellent results with their other cremes and polishes, so I expect this to help my nails and hands in the same noticeable way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky, smells lightly of orange, and it does everything it promises.</li>
      <li>It is a bit oily going on, but it does soak in and leaves a light fresh scent which is fine for men or women.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, great for my cuticles and dry hands.</li>
      <li>The scent is a clean citrus-y scent, which is not my fav.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this locally anymore and was thrilled to find it here.</li>
      <li>A great solution for an extreme moisturizing hand, nail and cuticle solution</li>
      <li>When I do get an occasional hangnail (a long day in the kitchen or garden with a lot of water exposure), it softens the skin very quickly to that it can be safely and easily clipped (very smooth results).</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not watery, it rubs right in, and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>It is a bit on the greasy side for a few minutes but then seems to be absorbed fairly well.</li>
      <li>The scent is like oranges (not orange blossoms) but not too intense.</li>
      <li>non greasy and absorbs readily.</li>
      <li>Pack of 3 really helps because if I have to go looking for it, I won&#x27;t, but w/ 3</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hand lotions and this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that has actually helped  soften and improve my skin and nails.  </li>
      <li>It keeps them very soft.</li>
      <li>We now live in Alaska and this isn&#x27;t sold in the stores here, but I finally ordered it online because I missed it so much.</li>
      <li>I have always had very dry skin on my hands due to an allergic reaction many years ago.  </li>
      <li>This lotion really does make my dry hands soft, snagged cuticles repaired, and brittle nails stronger.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this only about a week, since it came, and I like the way it feels, but it&#x27;s too early to see any major effects,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a great lotion to keep my heels from cracking and my fingers and hands from cracking in the winter cold and dry air.</li>
      <li>I live in Minnesota and winters cause my hands and cuticles to dry out and crack.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to everything and it hits first as dry or extremely itchy hands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product. I will definitely be reordering when I run out. Not greasy, great for my cuticles and dry hands.</li>
    <li> I have used SH Radiant Hands, Nails &amp; Cuticles for years now.  It truly is a miracle creme that keeps your cuticles and nails looking great.  It is difficult to find in the local stores and so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  The three containers are handy too!  One for home, one for work, and one for the purse.  The more you use it, the better your hands look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a great lotion to keep my heels from cracking and my fingers and hands from cracking in the winter cold and dry air. This is it. I&#x27;ve found it and I hope they never stop making it. The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not watery, it rubs right in, and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only about a week, since it came, and I like the way it feels, but it&#x27;s too early to see any major effects, if any. I&#x27;m a great believer in Sally Hansen products and have had excellent results with their other cremes and polishes, so I expect this to help my nails and hands in the same noticeable way.</li>
    <li> The skin around my nails is now soft and no more hang nails. And that&#x27;s just from using it a few days. I love the way it makes my skin feel silky, and (maybe I&#x27;m imagining this) has a bit of a glow. Pack of 3 really helps because if I have to go looking for it, I won&#x27;t, but w/ 3 there&#x27;s always one nearby.</li>
    <li> This cream has saved my hands and cuticles in the winter.  Leaves them moisturized and not greasy.  A great solution for an extreme moisturizing hand, nail and cuticle solution</li>
    <li> I have problems with dry cuticles and nails starting in the fall.  This product helps keep them nice. I use it in the morning and again at night</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything and it hits first as dry or extremely itchy hands.  Even so-called &amp;#34;hypo-allergenic&amp;#34; products can bring on a rash.  So do most soaps.  Scented products are especially risky, but for some reason, Sally Hansen hand creme works.  It soothes my skin and prevents dry sore skin and cracking and I love the orange scent.</li>
    <li> non greasy and absorbs readily.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I started ordering it through Amazon because Walgreens stopped carrying it. This lotion is amazing for your cuticles and hands and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I live in Minnesota and winters cause my hands and cuticles to dry out and crack.  This is the best non-greasy hand cream I have found.  I can put it on and still go about my daily business without slippery and greasy hands.</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry skin on my hands due to an allergic reaction many years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried many hand lotions and this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that has actually helped  soften and improve my skin and nails.  Love it and strongly recommend it!</li>

    <li> Like so many beauty products, my mother introduced me to this one. I think it&#x27;s wonderful, but of course anytime I find a drugstore product I like, they stop carrying it. So happy to have found this one at Amazon. It&#x27;s silky, smells lightly of orange, and it does everything it promises. Moisturized hands always look younger, and softer cuticles are less likely to develop hangnails. Ugh. So painful for such a small thing. I&#x27;ve begun to believe this cream also strengthens nails, too. That&#x27;s what Sally Hansen products are famous for, and I believe my nails are getting stronger. I have no problem growing them out, but they often peel and split. A wonderful product, and a 3.5 oz. tube goes a long way. My hands cannot make it through the winter without this.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. It is the best one to condition my nails before applying polish. Nothing else protects my nails as well. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this locally anymore and was thrilled to find it here.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t pay too close attention to the picture and thought I was purchasing another Sally Hansen product with the same name. I guess the one I was looking for doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;Radiant Hands\\&quot; in the title and has \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; on the label...    The stuff I did get (this product) doesn&#x27;t have long lasting moisture. I actually have to apply it several times when my hands are dry. It&#x27;s better than nothing and I have 3 tubes to use up. Should be easy considering how often I have to reapply</li>
    <li> I started using this about 10 years ago. At that time, I could buy it locally. For the past 3 years, it has been disappeared from shelves but found it at Amazon (where else?). I have a lot of trouble with dry nails that split and chip. The cuticles are even worse. This creme helps both, but I especially use it for my cuticles. It keeps them very soft. When I do get an occasional hangnail (a long day in the kitchen or garden with a lot of water exposure), it softens the skin very quickly to that it can be safely and easily clipped (very smooth results). I even use it on my feet when needed. I keep a tube in my car and in many rooms of my house. I love this stuff. The scent is like oranges (not orange blossoms) but not too intense. It is a bit on the greasy side for a few minutes but then seems to be absorbed fairly well.</li>
    <li> The smell is too stong....for me.....and it doesn&#x27;t rub in that well.....I like the vaseline better...I have used it for years....</li>
    <li> somewhat greasy and did not smell very good.  wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This hand and nail cream is excellent. Goes on smooth, moisturizes hands, arms, elbows beautifully. It is a bit oily going on, but it does soak in and leaves a light fresh scent which is fine for men or women.  The cream also moisturizes nails and cuticles and supposedly helps strengthen nails. I have strong nails to begin with, so we will see if it prevents breaking and peeling. I have tried more expensive French nail creams for $22.00 per tube. This one is totally comparable and the price is much less, so I am switching over to this brand permanently.</li>
