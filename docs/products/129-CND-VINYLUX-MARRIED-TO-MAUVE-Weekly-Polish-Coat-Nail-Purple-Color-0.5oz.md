### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Beautiful color!</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>The system, though, is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Best polish....</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a great color, just not what I was expecting (more pink/mauve)...</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Best nail polish I have ever used really stays on for about a week and doesn&#x27;t harm your nails.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I can keep my own manicure almost 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>I have since bought more colors and love this polish!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color and lasts me 10-14 days without needing special acetone removal apparatus and UV light.  </li>
      <li>the next time around they looked great till the beginning of day 7!</li>
      <li>I wear three coats with a top coat.</li>
      <li>The color is more brownish than Mauve.</li>
      <li>The top coat just nails it.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s on Love It</li>
      <li>This lead me to believe maybe I missed the top coats on those spots or something.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed, but I was kind of hoping I could have found something that worked.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and keeps its shinge</li>
      <li>Comes off easily with fingernail polish remover.  </li>
      <li>Removes easily with acetone.</li>
      <li>I love this product and the CND Vinylux product line but be aware this color was much more purple then it appeared on amazon.  </li>
      <li>Good polish lasts much longer than most other leading brands.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Update: Well I left it on after those two chips and nothing more chipped away the rest of the week.</li>
      <li>The color is great but it wears just like any other nail polish - it does not last.  </li>
      <li>Used 2 coats and the weekly top coat, let them dry for 10 min. between coats.</li>
      <li>It is easy to remove with regular nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>Color was more purple than rosy (as in picture), but dried quickly.</li>
      <li>No different then a cheap polish.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This polish really lasts a week as it claims it does.  </li>
      <li>has a shine the whole time</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have my hopes set too high</li>
      <li>the sand in the clay takes off normal polish immediately....</li>
      <li>It does go on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump like other polishes.  </li>
      <li>Dries quickly and lasts very long time!</li>
      <li>Am too old to wear glitter &amp; glitz on my hands</li>
      <li>I prefer flat colors and this one very versatile  </li>
      <li>The polish wears very well, but not the color I expected.</li>
      <li>Most colors are pretty true to form from the website but this one was awful.</li>
      <li>I does not chip or peel - as long as the nails are clear of any oils before you apply it.  </li>

<li> This color is actually quite a dark purple-y brown on the nail.</li>

<li> Have eliminated expensive manicures.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I did my nails on Monday night and by Tuesday afternoon, they were already chipped...</li>

    <li> This polish really lasts a week as it claims it does.  I does not chip or peel - as long as the nails are clear of any oils before you apply it.  The top coat just nails it.</li>
    <li> The polish wears very well, but not the color I expected. The color is more brownish than Mauve.</li>
    <li> Best polish....EVER! I redid my nails after 2 weeks only because there was a gap between the cuticle and the polish. Otherwise, the polish lasted the entire time. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I used to wear acrylic just to strengthen my nails. In an effort to save money I tried this product. It works great! I wear three coats with a top coat. Dries quickly and lasts very long time! Removes easily with acetone.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish I have ever used really stays on for about a week and doesn&#x27;t harm your nails.&lt;br /&gt;It has a shine the whole time it&#x27;s on Love It</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and lasts me 10-14 days without needing special acetone removal apparatus and UV light.  I can keep my own manicure almost 2 weeks.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this color. This brand strengthens my nails so they don&#x27;t chip &amp;amp; break like other brands</li>
    <li> Online this looked ok but in real life it is awful. Most colors are pretty true to form from the website but this one was awful.</li>
    <li> Gel will ruin your nails this will help you move forward and will last 6-7 days and simply remove with regular remover is seconds and start again- Waiting for the salons in my area to start using!</li>
    <li> The color is great but it wears just like any other nail polish - it does not last.  It does go on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump like other polishes.  I was hoping my manicure would last at least 5 days but it only lasted for about 2 days.</li>
    <li> This color is really dull.  I&#x27;ve worn it when I was working but have stopped now that I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t need to worry about being conservative.  If you want conservative then this color is for you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and I am a potter....the sand in the clay takes off normal polish immediately....I can use Vinylux and the manicure and color stays put!  Yay!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails, and this polish lasted for at least a week with no chipping.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I prefer flat colors and this one very versatile  It blends well with numerous clothing choices but is still subtle  Am too old to wear glitter &amp; glitz on my hands</li>
    <li> Good polish lasts much longer than most other leading brands.  Color bland not the Mauve color expected.  Easy to apply and keeps its shinge</li>
    <li> I love this product and the CND Vinylux product line but be aware this color was much more purple then it appeared on amazon.  It&#x27;s still a great color, just not what I was expecting (more pink/mauve)...</li>
    <li> My daughters had this brand used when they had manicures done, so I was hopeful it would last for me. Unfortunately, I did my nails on Monday night and by Tuesday afternoon, they were already chipped... I also have 5 kids, 2 of which are toddlers, so I wash my hands a millions times a day. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes set too high so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed, but I was kind of hoping I could have found something that worked. Oh well! Guess it works for some people, just not for me. Color was more purple than rosy (as in picture), but dried quickly.</li>
    <li> Had it on for 2 hours and was being very careful then I took a shower and when I got out two nails are already chipped away at the tips. Used 2 coats and the weekly top coat, let them dry for 10 min. between coats. Very disappointed I would have given 5 stars if they only lasted 3 days, but 2 hours! No different then a cheap polish.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well I left it on after those two chips and nothing more chipped away the rest of the week. This lead me to believe maybe I missed the top coats on those spots or something. I gave it another try and the next time around they looked great till the beginning of day 7! I have since bought more colors and love this polish!</li>
    <li> Long lasting fingernail polish.  Have eliminated expensive manicures. Comes off easily with fingernail polish remover.  Will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> This color is actually quite a dark purple-y brown on the nail. It is not a pink-y mauve, is it appears in the pictures. The system, though, is wonderful. It is fully dry in under 1 hour and rally does wear for a week. It is easy to remove with regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Proof enough.</li>
