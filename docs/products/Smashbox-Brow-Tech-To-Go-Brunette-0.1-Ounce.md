<li> Can do natural to extreme brow.</li>

    <li> Makes my eyebrows look very natural and lasts all day.  I had tried it previously and I also liked at how long the tube lasted.</li>
    <li> I love the brow tech to go! It works amazing compared to many other makeup items I have tried in the past.  This is my must have makeup product that I can&#x27;t leave the house without. Best part is that it doesn&#x27;t look like you have colored them in and I have black hair. This dark brown is perfect!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyebrow pencil, I constantly get compliments on how good they look. You can make them lighter, darker, however looks good by the amount of pressure you use as you&#x27;re drawing them on. The shipping was super fast and preduct was exactly as described. This is is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this pencil thorugh them and I&#x27;ll continue!</li>
    <li> I would not recommend anyone to buy this product as it was a complete disappointment. The product was dry and the color looked ashy as a result of that. I never got the chance to try it out properly because it was that bad. The pencil side was too dry to apply and the brush didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Thank you Smashbox for a fab find.  I have very sparse eyebrows from over tweezing. Used every other brow product out there from inexpensive to expensive, however, no other product comes close to this one. Very easy to apply~stays on until you remove it and the sealer keeps your brows defined.  Have ordered 2 more~a must have ladies~you will not be disappointed.</li>

    <li> vey nice.  I have given away a few as gifts.  Its good and gives eyebrows shape and seals it in.</li>
    <li> Best brow product, wish they sold refills.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow product in the market and the easiest to use. I have tried everything! And if you think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it might be, but, it is well worth the investment and it lasts a long time. You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the tip breaks all the time and I am very blonde, it is a bit dark even in taupe.  I switched to the Anastasia pencil with better results.</li>
    <li> Such a great product! My favorite eyebrow tool!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m asking too much but this stick only lasted about a month.  I was really surprised to go to use it one morning and it was gone! you can&#x27;t tell when its getting low either. I liked the pencil itself and the way it was angled. The color was perfect. I never used the gel brush. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy again at this cost.</li>
    <li> This is the only brow pencil I ever use. This is my 4th purchase and&lt;br /&gt;it does not disappoint. The applicator end is the perfect design for&lt;br /&gt;applying the brow color, and the opposite end offers a light gel to&lt;br /&gt;keep your brows perfect all day. Love it!!</li>
    <li> The best eyebrow filler ever.  I have reordered several times and just love it !!!!  Could be less expensive !</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s result. but product always having problem with the roller. it breaks all the time..&lt;br /&gt;adds up very expansive. I have been use that almost one year., the breakages was so often that makes me&lt;br /&gt; think need look for a new different product.</li>
    <li> I love this product works great without giving you a dramatic look, but it came with the gel side cracked which basically made it useless….buy but maybe not from this vender!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Easy to use.  I have tried lots of eyebrow pencils &amp; powders but I got to say this is the best and the easiest to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is great for enhancing my eyebrows. It is excellent, I can go dramatic or subtle depending on how I apply it. I get compliments on my makeup every time I use this product.</li>
    <li> I loved the product but after having it less than a month the tip fell out and down my drain when I opened it to use it! What a waste. What I saw go down the drain wasn&#x27;t much, maybe a few more uses. Too expensive for so little product.</li>
    <li> Excellent precision application for brows!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothe and looks natural. A friend recommended this and I am glad I bought it. It was a little pricey but I hope it lastslong. Prefer it to a pencil.</li>
    <li> Great natural color. Super easy application. Slides very smoothly. Can do natural to extreme brow.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Super natural looking!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have bought it two times now...I wish it had a bit more product in it...or I could buy without the gel because I rarely use the gel, and end up with leftovers. I think it is a bit overpriced, but I also keep buying it because I like the way it looks and works...so thats that I guess.</li>
    <li> Purchased this in flight through duty-free Delta shopping.  I am very pleased with the results.  Tames my rather unruly brows and gives a dramatic, but not over the top appearance.  The angled end is perfect for brow definition.</li>
