    <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand (two of them, in fact) for more than a year.  They look and feel great, and have bases heavy enough to be stable on our busy countertop.  I see no signs of rust.  I flick the brushes until no more water comes out before hanging them, which may have something to do with the base not rusting.  Brushes with 24 cm knots are supported by their handles, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it would accommodate even a 28 cm knot.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the quality of this great looking brush stand. However, it started rusting within just a few weeks. I finally had to stop using it because it was staining the marble countertop on my sink. Very disappointed......</li>
    <li> Waste of your time purchase. After 2 weeks of use rust spotted started to appear. Would not recommend or purchase again</li>
    <li> Very well made, solid and sturdy. It holds my 5 inch long brush effortlessly.</li>
    <li> This holds my shaving brush well.  I have the WSP Badger brush, and this is a nice compliment.  The metal has good shine, and is a nice compliment to any bathroom that has chrome.  It does not have a place for a razor, though I tend to prop mine up on the side.</li>
    <li> Became rusted and corroded within a month of use! looked nice at first and fit shave brush well but did not last.</li>
    <li> Nicely weighted, holds the brush without it slipping off.  Great stand to properly hold your shaving brush.</li>
    <li> This is a nice stand, sturdy, with a heavy base.  The plating is clean.  It feels quality and has looks to match.  Holds an average brush with room to spare.</li>
    <li> Stand is perfectly balanced with the weighted bottom and I don&#x27;t see a rest problem developing. The opening is a tad too small to fit my brush which is the  same company but I can fit by pushing it in. I don&#x27;t want to scratch the handle though so I place it just below the handle. I have considered trying to widen the opening just a fraction but am having second thoughts with this option.</li>
    <li> The brush stand is too small for the Badger Bristle Shaving Brush that I bought to go with it.  The handle does not fit into the stand correctly and the brush has to be inserted right above where the bristles are connected to the handle.</li>
    <li> I really like this stand, but I just wished that it would hold the base of the handle without scratching in when I push it in.  The next step is to try bending the arms to give a little more clearance like WSP suggested.</li>
    <li> The dimensions for this product are misleading. The opening is much larger than the 25mm stated in the description. The opening for the brush measures about 27mm and the inside diameter of the holder is 33mm. My brush just fit without falling through. The height is 105mm from the top of the base to the bottom of the brush holder.    The bottom of the stand rusted quickly which stopped when I added a pad under it so it no longer sits directly on the wet counter.</li>
    <li> I paired this with the &amp;#34;The Prince&amp;#34; High Density 2-Band Finest Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush as a gift.  It looks nice and keeps the brush clean and dry.</li>
    <li> It does not fit my brush that I purchased form the same company.  It develops rust spots on top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Keeps the mess off his vanity &amp; also keeps the shape of the shaving brush</li>
    <li> Bought this WSP Compact Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to hold the Semogue 1800 brush I bought as a Christmas gift for my husband. Perfect stand for the brush, the right size, simple, and, above all, no moving pieces that could eventually loosen and wobble. The stand is firmly affixed to the bottom disc, which is of a solid weight that it won&#x27;t tip over. Nothing flimsy about this product and looks stylish standing on our bathroom counter. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Prompt service, great product and looks classy</li>
    <li> Excellent accessory. Works very well. Don&#x27;t know how I managed without one.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having the plastic brush holders break.  This stand looks good and fits my brush.  Seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00E5U3WHY WSP Compact Chrome Shaving Brush Stand]]  Looks attractive.  However, after about 1 yr of use, it is rusting in two spots, staining my bristle brush handle. I therefore cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The stand itself is very pretty when first received and has nice weight to it so it is stable.  But the logo engraved on the base begins to rust, quite quickly, after you start to use it.  I was disappointed in this product for the price.</li>
    <li> Good shaving brush stand.</li>
