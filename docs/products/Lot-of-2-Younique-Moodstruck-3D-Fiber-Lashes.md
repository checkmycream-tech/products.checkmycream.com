    <li> DON&#x27;T FALL FOR THIS! I&#x27;m a younique presenter and the 3d fiber lashes directly from my younique sight are only $29 plus shipping. https://www.youniqueproducts.com/lduffy</li>
    <li> This is the real thing and I love them. Would recommend to everyone and also getting another set as its such a great price. All the other reviews almost detoured me but so glad I went with my instinct! !!</li>
    <li> Its the real thing.  I  have tried this brand before and I love it.</li>
    <li> Younique&#x27;s 3D Fiber Mascara works wonderfully and increases your eyelashes by 300%. You can even get it cheaper through Younique&#x27;s website for $29 and it comes their Love It Guarantee. To learn more, see comment.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this mascara, when it os the real thing and not fake garbage. Pleasw do yourself a favor and order from a real presenter for $29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.youniqueproducts.com/JeanneJones1</li>
    <li> I have received COUNTERFEIT Younique by several sellers in the last month, so be careful.  If the price is too good to believe... there is a reason why.  You can tell the fakes pretty easily.  The real ones have a black sticker with a bar code on the back.  The fake ones have an instruction sheet on the back. The logo on top of the case looks pretty good though. The fake logo is just a little bit bigger, too be honest, looks better than the real logo. Here are a couple pictures comparing the front and the backs of each.</li>
    <li> Make my eye lashes look pretty and thick.</li>
    <li> It a while to get it but I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Amazing product, but way cheaper through a presenter.  I got mine from megan and she was very helpful. Sent me a thank you email and a video to help me apply correctly.. you should check out her site...&lt;br /&gt;Youniqueproducts.com/meglichtenberger</li>
    <li> It was what I expected</li>
    <li> How can you sell authentic Younique products if you are not an authorized Younique Presenter?? Not to mention its 19.00 more than what I pay through my Younique \\&quot;LashGirl\\&quot;...the fakes have been proven to be damaging to the eyes, even causing blindness in some from the FIBERGLASS that they contain!!! I get mine from [...] and it takes me directly to the Younique site to order!! Is your sight worth getting fakes which are more expensive then the real ones??</li>
    <li> This is a FAKE! Real 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara is only available for purchase through a Younique Presenter. Save your $ and your eyes and buy the real stuff!</li>
    <li> NOT REAL. THIS IS FAKE FROM CHINA. You must buy from younique representer for USA made products and guaranteed love it or return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.3dlashesbyjahira.com for the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Seriously?  The pictures show an open mascara case which is photographed on what appears to be bedsheets. Authentic younique products come in the case which is sealed in plastic. And younique presenters are not permitted to sell on external sites including this one so the product is not authentic. It is most likely used, damaged, expired,  or fake. Best to buy from a presenter. These fakes are going to give the real deal a bad wrap. Younique 3D mascara is incredible and truly a must try! But definitely shop from an authorized presenter and save yourself the hassle.  I get mine at lashalert.com</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product not worth the price</li>
    <li> I purchased from a Younique representative and LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I will never use just plain mascara again! Using this product correctly, I get much longer lashes that have much more volume, too. Used correctly, the fibers do not fall in my eyes. It took some practice and watching a number of different youtube videos to find out that the fibers should be &amp;#34;pressed&amp;#34; onto the transferring gel rather than stroked from bottom to top as we do mascara. They give me all the benefits of false lashes except that they look real! My natural lashes are short and thin...NOT with this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara! I highly recommend them. I also recommend watching a few YouTube videos to watch how to apply them as well as reading the enclosed instructions. WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Buy authentic Younique 3D Mascara by an authorized presenter only!</li>
