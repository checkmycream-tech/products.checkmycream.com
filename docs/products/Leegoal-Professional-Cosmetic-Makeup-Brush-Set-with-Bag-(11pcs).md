      <li>Decent brush set!</li>
      <li>they are of better quality than what I had expected.</li>

      <li>The brushes have no trouble picking up and distributing make up(Urban Decay, M.A.C., Sephora).</li>
      <li>there is the angled pencil brush which is too dense for my liking but works really well to apply blacks and darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;The flat brush</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Lovely set. My daughter loved it a lot.</li>
    <li> Very soft and great looking.  I wish they&#x27;d labeled the brushes because it is difficult to decide which is which.  The eye ones are a no brainer, but the others are kind  of confusing.  I use them to w\ do whatever tickles my fancy. If you don&#x27;t mind  guessing which to use, then go ahead and buy them.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend says these are the best.  Her makeup goes on much better no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  disappointed in  this  purchase. First  I didn&#x27;t  like  the draw string bag it came in and  second the bristles keep  falling  out. I have  to replace  the  whole  batch.</li>
    <li> Oh my god, these brushes are the softest things that I have put to my face. They just arrived today and I&#x27;m so happy that I bought them! They arrived earlier than expected, they came in this cute little satchel, and there was very little fall out! Now, I have not tried them out yet, but I read the other reviews and so far, so good! :) Greatest first make-up brush set ever!</li>
    <li> Took away a star because after doing a pre wash I noticed some bristles falling out.</li>
    <li> I love thess brushes :)</li>
    <li> I love all of the brush , they are very good for my make up !!!</li>
    <li> Great product for travel purposes :)</li>
    <li> I love these makeup brushes! They are so soft, yet dense at the same time!! Wonderful! ❤️</li>
    <li> Good brush. Haven&#x27;t noticed shedding since use. Received package before expected delivery date</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re cute and soft and blends great!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, they make your face look flawless. Love love love.</li>
    <li> Works well,  gets d job done soft n nice no shedding like it alot</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  The handles were smooth, but not slick.  The brushes themselves were also thick and ultra soft.  I use them for photographic work and coloring.&lt;br /&gt;  If I did makeup, I&#x27;d use these brushes.  Highly Recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I use these for my makeup classes. My students love them. They get the job done and look great. They are also super easy to clean. I clean them with 99% alcohol.</li>
    <li> So soft and beautiful! No fall out/shedding. Worth alot more then what I happily paid for them!</li>
    <li> Not Just A Great Price For Such Great Quality Brushes,But Also Softest As Can Be. Came Sooner Than Expected &amp;&#x27; Well Packed With Nothing Damaged. Really Recommend Buying This Product.</li>
    <li> I love this product... great product for this price... I would definitely recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> This set of Blushes are great.</li>
    <li> Not that good quality and they are much more smaller then they appear</li>
    <li> I really loved these brushes! They were soft and good quality. They have gone through a few washes and none of them have shed. I don&#x27;t really like any of the brushes for foundation so if that is the reason why you are purchasing then don&#x27;t, because they are not that dense. (I don&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;foundation brush&amp;#34; for foundation). Other than that they are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;From left to right:&lt;br /&gt;I use the &amp;#34;foundation brush&amp;#34; to set my under eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The kind of dome brush I use for blush.&lt;br /&gt;The next two brushes I really love for eyeshadow! The blending brush is really great.&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the angled pencil brush which is too dense for my liking but works really well to apply blacks and darker colors.&lt;br /&gt;The flat brush I don&#x27;t really use but  can be used to apply concealer to small areas.&lt;br /&gt;The thicker brush I use for highlighter, but can also be used for a more precise powder contour.&lt;br /&gt;The flat top brushes I use to set foundation around my face. I have tried these for foundation but found that they are not dense enough.&lt;br /&gt;The shorter dome brush I also use to apply blush or even bronzer.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. They are easy to both use and clean. I like that you don&#x27;t get a lot of fallout from the eyeshadow all over your face with these. They actually keep the eyeshadow on your brush and it transfers nicely to the skin. They work well with your foundation and concealer also. I haven&#x27;t noticed any little hairs falling from the brush either, which is a bonus. They arrived in a cute little sack too.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived yesterday. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, so that&#x27;s why no five star. They were clean and the bristles are very soft. They feel good to the touch.</li>
    <li> Really good brushes for the price. I love how soft they are.</li>
    <li> Love them! You cannot beat the price. Arrived in 2 days. These brushes are a great alternative to Real Techniques brushes. They&#x27;re a bit less dense than RT but can stand alone for a cheaper alternative</li>
    <li> Got my order really quick, ordered Friday and got it Monday!!!! Everything was packaged nicely. Just wished the makeup brushes had labels to show which brush is which, other than that I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I just recieved mine &amp; I must say WOW ❤️ they are of better quality than what I had expected. Just temember to give em a little wash before use &amp; they&#x27;ll work better. Thank you so much! Also, the shipping takes a while but its worth it (:</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. I like the wide variety. Love the wooden handles. I have not had any problems with shedding. They are super soft! A great purchase for the price! I am super happy with them!</li>
    <li> Just arrived 2 weeks early and they are great!</li>
    <li> These are great brushes.  They blend well and have most every blendable brush you need to create a flawless look.  I would recommned these.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes. The eye brushes are especially nice. They are very soft and the handles feel great in my hand. My favorite is the pointed crease brush, it is smaller than some others I have used which works well since I have a smaller lid space.They washed well and had little to no shedding. The only thing I will say is the Kabuki brushes were a bit to soft for foundation application (I used liquid). I think to apply foundation they need to be a little stiffer. I do think they work well for powder products - bronzer, blush, setting powder etc. **When I initially opened the package and ran my fingers over the brushes a white powder came off of them, so please wash these well before use** Overall a great set.  **Update 8/15/16 - Unfortunately the face brushes have started shedding pretty badly on me. I have taken away one star. What a shame.**</li>
    <li> Love the brushes, definitely a great price for and awesome product. Such a smart investment on my part!</li>
    <li> While Im in cosmetology school I need a nice cheap set of makeup brushes for myself. And I feel like I did very well on this set.&lt;br /&gt;Its low in price and feels good in my hands and on my face. The brushes have no trouble picking up and distributing make up(Urban Decay, M.A.C., Sephora). I couldnt be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I don&#x27;t regret purchasing and I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> much better than the set you can get off Groupon. go amazon!!</li>
    <li> The brushes were what I expected. I&#x27;ve been using them and loved them!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes - so soft and they don&#x27;t lose any fibers. I was shocked at the great quality of these considering how inexpensive they are. I intended to use these brushes as my backup/cheapie set for travelling, but now they&#x27;re my main every day brushes. Fantastic buy, and a great variety of shapes and sizes. I use almost all of them regularly.</li>
    <li> Great value and good brushes</li>
    <li> Any brush for any need.</li>
    <li> These brushes are exceptional quality especially for the price. They stand up to weekly deep cleanings and daily spot cleanings. (Except the kabuki brushes but my Sigma kabuki does the same when deep cleaned frequently. ) very impressed.</li>
    <li> I honestly never do reviews, but foreal these brushes are gooooood quality, like the bristles on the brush don&#x27;t fall out like my Mac brushes I highly recommend these I am one happy customer every time the brushes touch my face they are like so soft soothing feeling... Love love loveeeee them!!!</li>
    <li> Got what I expected. Decent brush set!</li>
