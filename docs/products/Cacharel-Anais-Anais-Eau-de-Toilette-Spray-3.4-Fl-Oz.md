<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was an excellent deal ! I have worn Anais Anais for 30 yrs and I still receive compliments daily on it . I have not been able to find it at a better price than Amazon anywhere . It&#x27;s the real deal !</li>
    <li> Anais Anais is a light, floral scent -- not at all overpowering. Very feminine and an all-occasion fragrance. I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent smell for a distinguished lady.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and my sister loves it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mother and she was absolutely thrilled to get her favorite fragrance back!</li>
    <li> A beautiful soft scent at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great service and a super price.</li>
    <li> Love that you have this available. Good price and available!</li>
    <li> I am sure my sister in law will love once she&#x27;s receives it.</li>
    <li> Thank you, my package arrived on time and I am totally enjoying the smell of it on my wife</li>
    <li> this is NOT the scent that i remember!  this bottle smells like bug spray!  it is horrible!  this MUST be a fake!</li>
    <li> Speedy shipping and a great price on a perfume I LOVE!! Thanks...</li>
    <li> So glad to find Anais Anais on line. Love it.</li>
    <li> An excellent price for this usually over-priced item!</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend</li>
    <li> A speedy delivery, this Anais Anais Cologne has been my favorite cent for years and have received many compliments of the light and floral scent.</li>
    <li> This has beem my  wife&#x27;s favorite for over 20 years.  I saw she had thrown her last one away as it was empty, so that gave me the perfect Valentines Day gift for her</li>
    <li> I have worn Anais Anais for decades and love it.  I thought the packaging on this item was unusual but assumed it was new design.  Not sure where this fragrance originated, but it&#x27;s not my Anais Anais.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t remotely like my cologne.  Perhaps a very old version which might explain the packaging?</li>
    <li> My signature perfume! Have Loved this beautiful scent forever. I am constantly complemented on it and ask what it is I&#x27;m wearing. It is a very Lady Like floral perfume great for all seasons especially for spring and summer because it is not a heavy scent.</li>
    <li> This is about the only perfume that I can wear that does not cause immediate sneezing.  I am allergic to most scents on the market today.</li>
    <li> Guys, if you don&#x27;t want to follow your girl around w/your nose stuck to her neck, don&#x27;t buy this! There has never been made a more delightful somewhat musky aroma on planet Earth. My husband bought me a &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; of this (I ALWAYS have it on hand since discovering 15-20 yrs. ago!) for Christmas. I can marinate in it and it never overpowers. ALWAYS get comments how good it smells from both sexes. You can have Chanel no. 5, this is my all-time hands-down fave!</li>
    <li> Price is right, a lot cheaper than retail price and smells so good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Anais for many years but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a beautiful scent and a good price!</li>
    <li> She loves this scent and I&#x27;m happy to get it for her for her birthday each year.  Amazon has better prices than even Fragrance.net</li>
    <li> So far so good. No issues at all. Thnx.</li>
    <li> This is her favorite.  She has been using this for years and simply loves it.  Personally, I never met a perfume I did not like.</li>
    <li> I have used Anais Anais for over 30 years.  It is a signature fragrance, classic, and not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s unique quality generates compliments from young and old.  Highly stable and does not spoil over time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This (L&#x27;Original) Anais Anais is not the perfume I have been using for over 25 yrs, smells different.. Seems like they changed the fragrance and added (L&#x27;Original) to the name. Trying to contact Co. To find out</li>
    <li> my lovely wife&#x27;s fav!</li>
    <li> Another oldy but goody! I just love it;)</li>
    <li> Anais Anais arrived safely and was a wonderful surprise for my daughter who has worn the fragrance for years. She now has her favorite perfume to use often.</li>
    <li> She has been using it for years, but unable to find it locally. That&#x27;s all I have to say, amen.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! It is timeless.</li>
    <li> Quickly delivered, and as expected.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This is an important part of my preparations to go to any function or outing.  I love the scent!</li>
    <li> It has been so long since I have seen this perfume that I cannot attest to it smelling the same as years ago, only to it&#x27;s name and the design of the packaging.  But it really is a very pleasant, rather delicate scent.  I like it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice, not quite what i remembered way back in school but a clean fragrance. i probably will not buy it again only because it is not what i am looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the smell had to have it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments and asked what I&#x27;m wearing!  I was so glad to be able to get it on Amazon, it&#x27;s hard to find in my area.</li>
    <li> I buy this Eau de toilette every Christmas because the fragrance is very pleasing, and it is one of the few smells that does not cause me to have breathing problems. It is a little pricey, but my wife wears it every day, and likes it better than any of her other colognes or perfumes.</li>
    <li> Happy to have found my signature fragrance again.  Was supposed to be available at other places, like Macy&#x27;s, but not.  So I was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> Need I say more?  However, I never grow tired of this fragrance.  The smell of it always puts me in a peaceful mood even after all day if I get a whiff of it on my clothing.  It seems to me a fragrance that mixes well with the body chemistry to create a fragrance that is memorable and pleasing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a perennial favorite of my wife and me for a long time. Normally I (we) have purchased it in stores, but it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find. This year I was pleased to find it on Amazon. Just as good as in the store!</li>
    <li> I saw this in Ireland my last visit in 2012, wanted buy but was told I could pay a better price in the USA. So I looked and looked for it couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. A lone behold I decided to search on Amazon and there it was staring right at me. I picked this product from this seller because the price was the best offer. Thank you so much for ending my search for my beautiful bouquet fragrance.</li>
    <li> A few people that I have come in contact with compliments me on this perfume. They say it smells like flowers. I agree that it is also a light, fresh, flower scent. This is my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> A nice mixture of baby powder and floral scents. Subtle. A lovely scent, one of my all time favorites. :</li>
    <li> Worn this for 20 years.  My husband&#x27;s absolute favorite!  What will I do now that it is no longer being made?  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed this scent and amazon made ordering easy</li>
    <li> Not the scent I expected it&#x27;s too strong..I used it years ago but it smells different ....I was disappointed I will check something else.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loves this fragrance. I always replenish as soon as the bottle has about a quarter left. It&#x27;s subtle to wear as it does not bother my sinus. yet as I enter a room or pass by someone the question always comes &amp;#34;what perfume are you wearing?...its lovely!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I discovered this fragrance in the 80s and have never switched.  Now my clothes smell like it and I get complements even when I&#x27;m not wearing the perfume!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eau de toilette for years. I love the fresh scent which is never overpowering. Great pricing.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and love it!!  A few years back, I purchased the anaiis anaiis scented candle--it is so amazing!! I want to buy more of these. Where can I get them? Please help!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite eau de toilettes, i do love Cacharel products, i also have the Noa by this designer not too strong, i definitely recommended it to anyone who prefers lighter smells.</li>
    <li> My mom recommended this perfume and I absolutely love it!  This perfume has such a fresh...feminine scent.  It&#x27;s a must have for women - you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfume for the last 40 yrs. Excellent floral!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife and she loves it. It is sometimes hard to find sdo I am glad that Amazon.com carries it for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent... Thank you...</li>
    <li> very  light and pleasant</li>
    <li> I was having flashbacks to the 80s, so I decided to try buying this scent again after all these years. The price was reasonable (especially with Amazon Prime), but as other reviewers have noted, the formula has changed a bit. The scent is still floral and refreshing, but it lacks a bit of the astringent bite the old formulation had, so this is a bit sweeter. Overall, happy with it.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I really enjoy this parfum.  Was thrilled to be able to get this in Amazon.  Thank you:)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing that same perfume for years and I love it.  It is just as wonderful as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Been a favorite of my wife for 30 years.  Classy and sophisticated. This scent is timeless, not like those celebrity ones that are cobbled together to make a quick buck.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my saint altar my saint loves this perfume ( a bit toooooooo flowery for me)</li>
    <li> Same beautiful fragrance as I have always bought in the department stores.</li>
    <li> The product is new, I like me very much, it came without problems and it works well, thank you for everything</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.. For the price you cant get any perfume smell that awesome..  I am a Happy customer indeed.</li>
    <li> I was very satisified with the product and the speediness of the delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this beautiful and subtle perfume for years and get frequent compliments on its scent. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found by far.  I buy 2 at a time.  Highly recommend this scent for any age woman.</li>
    <li> Nothing else I know goes so well with spring &amp; summer as Anais Anais. It&#x27;s a fragrance I&#x27;ve loved for the past 25 yrs &amp; still continue to wear it today (not every day, but it&#x27;s always in my perfume collection). Fresh, floral, bright, vibrant, feminine, clean, invigorating. It never fails to lift my mood when I want a pick me up. On fabrics it lingers for days, which I love. Dries down beautifully &amp; softly. Always a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the eau de parfum also but I much prefer the eau de toilette which I find is lighter &amp; fresher. The parfum is heavier in floral scent with more sillage. The price for the large 3.4oz EDT here on Amazon is amazing compared to the 1.7oz price.</li>
    <li> One of the most subtle, yet lovely, fragrances ever. Always sure to get you compliments. Things may change, but it&#x27;s nice to know this scent is as fragrant as ever.</li>
    <li> Bough it for wife and she likes this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Thought perfume was ordered - Instead received toilette spray.  Maybe I misunderstood advertisement, but was dissappointed when received toilette instead of perfume.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loved it.  I also loved it as Anais smells so good on her and is so romantic.  I will buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> I got what I ordered, highly recommend seller!!!</li>
    <li> My wife like it so much.</li>
    <li> I had used before  this product ,it was beautiful .But this  one smile very bad . please do not buy it</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it is as nice as ever.  I wish it was available as a roll-on purse sized .</li>
    <li> I love this fragrant perfume</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for 40 yrs. or so and won&#x27;t wear anything else.  It is mild and comforting.  I don&#x27;t even notice it on me anymore, but still get people who compliment me on how good it smells.  \\&quot;Not overpowering at all\\&quot;.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  It is harder and harder to find!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for my wife for years. It is subtle and sexy all at the same time. Great product.</li>
    <li> Scent is the same but liked the original bottle &amp; artwork much better though.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for myself as a graduation present over 20 yrs ago. I just reciently ran out and didn&#x27;t know that it was still around. It&#x27;s very true that a good product will stick around for decades which I&#x27;m grateful for.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! I wear it for ages and never could change it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very gentle,light.I love vanilla note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it fits my personality!</li>
    <li> This is an oldie but goodie.  So glad to find it again!  It is a delightful classic and made the best gift for a friend you used to wear this but could no longer find it.</li>
    <li> everybody love my smell, I lve it even more!</li>
    <li> I was just delighted to find my fav cologne!. Thank you.</li>
    <li> perfume was a good price and was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> exelente 100% original</li>
    <li> I have been using Anais Anais for about twenty years and I love its soft, gentle floral fragrance.  I have tried various other fragrances but Anais Anais is the only one for me. I receive complements all the time. I Love It.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite sprays.  It is not an overpowering scent.  I have often been asked what perfume is that, it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 40 years.  Since none of the local stores carry it anymore, I have  to order it online.</li>
    <li> I always buy this and have for years.  It arrived on time and was just what I wanted. Love it.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> This Anais Anais was purchased for my mother.  It is her favorite fragrance and this was, by far, the best price advertised on the web.</li>
    <li> I have loved this since I was a teen back in London.  Very hard to find in the stores over here.  Now I know where to look when I need my next bottle!</li>
    <li> I am so delighted with this purchase of Anais Anais! I have worn this lovely perfume for over 25 years! Unfortunately, it is getting harder to find, so when I ran across it on amazon I was on cloud nine! Yay!</li>
    <li> Ever since i first smell this perfume i loved it and i missed smelling it and someone at work had it or smell just like it and it reminded me of anais so i got for my wife and she loves it and i love it every time she wears it while im with her.</li>
    <li> Although it seems pricey (and what name brand smelly stuff isn&#x27;t?) my wife loves it, and that&#x27;s all that matters to me.  She may give it 5 stars; I think it&#x27;s OK (doesn&#x27;t choke me like many modern perfumes); it gets (3+5)/2 &#x3D; 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The box is not the same as I&#x27;ve bought for the last 20 years, it&#x27;s very , very thin. The entire sprayer comes off of the bottle when you remove the cap and the smell is different also. DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE. As always Amazon took care of it immediately.  I LOVE AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to my mom but the smell does not stay and not strong like the one she had before years , i dont know how can such product changes with years !!&lt;br /&gt;Wish to return it as she is very disappointed  but its ok anyway .</li>
    <li> I purchased this to my wife as a gift. I have bought Anais-Anais so many times over the past twenty years. It has, or used to have, a soft Jasmin-like smell. What I received was a 3.4oz bottle of Alcohol. Yes, nothing but ugly-smelling alcohol (like in a Hospital room).&lt;br /&gt;The box did not even look like the luxury-looking box I am used to. Instead, it looked as if was printed on very cheap recycled paper. Not what you expect when you buy an expensive perfume. I could live with the ugly box, but not the ugly smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately called Amazon, and here is where they deserve 5 stars. The customer service representative immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction with the product and processed a full refund. I love Amazon and will continue to buy from them with full confidence that&lt;br /&gt;I, either get a quality product, or pay nothing. Long Live Amazon.</li>
    <li> Whenever my wife runs out this perfume it is always handy if it&#x27;s near Christmas, as birthday, or anniversary. It is her and my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Most ladies I gave this perfume liked it and asked for it to be bought for them wheever I travelled</li>
    <li> could not find it any cheaper, the real deal. you could pay as much as twice the price any where else. md</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this product.  I buy it for her often.  I would highly recommend it if you love a perfume with a great smell that isnt over powering.  Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Warning!  The picture is a lie.  This is not L&#x27;original!</li>
    <li> I love this light perfume, have used it for years and can only find it here on Amazon now.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  It is wonderful for spring or summer as a change.  Of course, I love it year round.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order Anais Anais again from Amazon after receiving a shipment a couple years ago that was rancid. But when I found &amp;#34;L&#x27;Original&amp;#34; scent, I decided to give it a try. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. The cologne smelled exactly as it should. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This and always will be one of my wife&#x27;s favorite. Much cheaper to purchase on line than to go through the hassle of a department store.</li>
    <li> mY Wife is very pleased with the perfume.  She has used it for several years and I could not find it locally!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Very good price. We really liked it.</li>
    <li> i always get a ton of compliments on this perfume as i have worn others and never get any compliments on smell. fragrant flower smell but not over powering</li>
    <li> my mom wore this fragrance daily. she passed Feb of this year at the GE OF 53. I was given her perfume by my father. So I can wear it &amp; feel closer to her... every time i smell it I think of her!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice fragrance that has been around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Anais Anais...I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 30 years!  Shirley C. Hicks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been pleased with all my purchases....and with your service.....</li>
    <li> You will have to ask the misses.  It&#x27;s her favorite, I think she loves it.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great Product and used for years</li>
    <li> I love love this fragrance and wore it years ago.  I was recently reminded of it, ordered this and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  If you like a flowery aroma with a little sharpness, this is it.  The scent remains for a long while after being sprayed.  It&#x27;s excellent and just like I remembered!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find Anais Anais in the store but I found it on line.  My Aunt was thrilled and I was happy that the order went thru so quicly and arrived with no problems.</li>
    <li> Wife is super happy with this, her favorite perfume.  Lovely light floral scent that is perfect for daytime or night use.</li>
    <li> Received the&amp;#34; L&#x27;Original&amp;#34; Anais Anais eau de Toilette spray bottle as ordered. From reading the Cacharel web site I understand this was their 2014 re-launch of my favorite from the 1970s. The new bottle is featured on their web site. I compared the scent from my old bottle with the L&#x27;Original and found it was very similar, maybe the new scent a little stronger at first, a bit higher on the hyacinth but lovely and meets my needs. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the Eau De Toilette Spray she uses with our grandchildren because it does not cause them any problems.</li>
    <li> I first used Anais Anais from a friend as a gift.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now.  Some have said it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; ladies scent, I do not agree.  This is a scent for anyone who loves a light floral fragrance.  It lasts all day and only takes a squirt or two to keep you mysteriously scented all day long.  NOT overpowering unless, of course, you use a lot of it!  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> great price, brand new!</li>
    <li> I have used Anais Anais for years and love it. My son gave me this bottle as a Christmas gift several months ago. Since my old bottle was wasn&#x27;t empty yet, I put his gift in the bathroom cabinet. When I opened it a week ago I was shocked that the scent was very, very weak.  It would take about 8 to 10 sprays to give me anything near the usual Anais Anais fragrance I always got with just one spray.  This version is BAD.  Unfortunately it has been too long since the Amazon purchase for me to complain to them. But I am telling you, something is wrong with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated Feb 2016&lt;br /&gt;I have read some reviews saying that the perfume manufacturer has re-released the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; version of this perfume.  I would love to buy the original.  But how can I tell which is the original and which is the worthless phony by using Amazon?  It seems the only solution is to go directly to a retail outlet such as an expensive department store and check out the scent before I buy it.  Too bad, I cannot use Amazon for this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few sources for my wife&#x27;s fav perfume, so don&#x27;t stop supplying it. I am depending on you!</li>
    <li> I love this scent, reminds me of dating my husband in college. We all shared it in the dorm. The bottle is pretty too. I never pronounce the name correctly. Good price, good packaging, very pleased.</li>
    <li> It may be old fashioned.  My grown granddaughter said it smells like Nana.  I love it.  Buy it whenever it is needed.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ANAIS ANAIS. I LOOVE THE SMELL IT LEAVES YOU WITH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is one of the only ones I can use because of allergies.</li>
    <li> Item  was specifically requested for a holiday gift. Always try to give a present that you know someone really wants.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years,but the past several times I bought it the scent was not quite the same and was weaker,didn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;However,this bottle is more like the old Anais-Anais. It lasts longer without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift that hasn&#x27;t been opened yet.  This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume, so I&#x27;m sure she will like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years. Every time I look for something else nothing else quite works. The scent is not too strong and is wonderfully light and lovely.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the real deal. I was given a full refund.</li>
    <li> this has been my summer scent for years. it as such a gentle and fresh scent. and at this price i bought 3.</li>
    <li> The best price I have seen it for ,I have used Anaise for years its soft floral scent last all day......</li>
    <li> Great price, great perfume!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Lovely smell and is big for that price.</li>
    <li> It is expensive perfume but, it smells great on my wife and it is her regular brand.  It is very hard to find in the stores.  It is soooo sexy.</li>
    <li> Perfume excellent, very good fragrance and lingers in the body and clothes all day also is very economical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very goob</li>
    <li> Plasant, long lasting aroma at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. The price was very good for the size of the perfume. Love the idea that people don&#x27;t complain of any strong smell that some other perfume leaves. This one is so gentle. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love Anais anais, I have been using it doe perhaps 20 years.</li>
    <li> Exquisita  fragancia.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite of my wife....</li>
    <li> I really love Anais Anais. But this one it does not seem to be the same. I think its a modern version of it or it&#x27;s a fake. The smell is kind of the same; but flat. It does not last more than a few minutes on the skin. I should have chosen the one I already was familiar with. The one with the bigger white, and rounded/oval top.</li>
    <li> Giving for a gift.  Always a winner.  There aren&#x27;t enough words to discribe the soft fregrance of Anais Anais by Cacharel.!!!</li>
    <li> wife loved it. i liked the price.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume/toilette spray and very few places sell it anymore.  I&#x27;m always delighted when I can find it online.</li>
    <li> This order was delightful, just as light yet flowery as I had recalled.  It has a lovely summer scent.  I was pleased that this was a recent product.  I ordered some once from another site that was bitter and old.  A+ for Amazon!</li>
