      <li>The best I&#x27;ve found has been [[ASIN:</li>

      <li>This works perfectly!  </li>
      <li>I plan to keep using it to keep my hair at its best.</li>
      <li>Great for damaged hair!</li>
      <li>This stuff is incredible.</li>
      <li>I thought it would work wonderfully since I had loved it years ago</li>
      <li>This conditioner is really great.</li>
      <li>LOL.....</li>
      <li>This treatment is GREAT...</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>My wife swims once or twice a week for a good hour or so each time.  </li>
      <li>It looks and feels so good with one use</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>With this, you want to make sure that you are looking at how great it can be and what this product can do to help strengthen your hair.  </li>
      <li>so no need to use a ton of it to get the effects of perfect, beautiful hair that is shiny soft.</li>
      <li>Thank you TRESemmé, for yet another amazing product.</li>
      <li>Daverat&#x27;s Wife speaking (pls be kind RE:</li>
      <li>They will give you that wonderful smoothness, temporarily soften and also shine your hair if you don&#x27;t abuse your hair too much with heat and chemical colors and/or straighteners.  </li>
      <li>so I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>and I honestly was not overwhelmed by the results.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have that nice</li>
      <li>It says to leave it in 4 minutes but to be honest I don&#x27;t always have the time for that, so even just putting it in for 30 seconds</li>
      <li>This prodeuct is not as good as the loreal 3 minutes hair mask, which smell better and work better.  </li>
      <li>but it sure is a handy tool to have in your beauty kit when you find out the night before that your hubby has booked you to go to a film premiere or a dinner with one of his clients.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this conditioner - it keeps my hair soft, shiny, and looking great and after many uses, it does not seem to build up at all.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m really impressed and will keep on using this.  </li>
      <li>It smells good, is super creamy, rinses out nicely.</li>
      <li>The smell was great, I loved how it rinsed out almost completely.</li>
      <li>prefer the line more defined, but I also noticed that a lot of the reviews for this products come from men, so I am not going any deeper than what I already have.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it as well.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most succulent conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>Then I tried the TRESemme renewing treatment and my hair is healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, light floral scent.</li>
      <li>My hair has more bounce and shine.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product more than three days.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have it</li>
      <li>Anyway, for the price, I&#x27;d rather spend a bit more for Pantene.</li>
      <li>I love how this works and when I paired it with a great shampoo, it worked really well.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I dyed my hair and used the tube of ultra-moisturizer that came in the box.  </li>
      <li>We have tried so many products.</li>
      <li>Most don&#x27;t work, some work for awhile then become ineffective.</li>
      <li>All in all, this was just OK for me.</li>
      <li>I love Tresemme and this product is among their line that I dig.  </li>
      <li>Try it,you too may love it.</li>
      <li>Best of all it&#x27;s at a totally affordable price.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Though, I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Can they be sure this isn&#x27;t 22 months and 14 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She says the results with \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; is better and that they should expand this line.</li>
      <li>Best deep conditioner ever!</li>
      <li>I love using this periodically on my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels sooo much better than it did</li>
      <li>The longer you leave it on the better.</li>
      <li>also like the idea that their price is not too steep, and therefore makes it easy to like it even more.</li>
      <li>but my hair looked great and felt so soft!</li>
      <li>This is a very good conditioner that works even in very oily water that I have found can challenge certain conditioners.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great deep conditioner to keep my hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li>
      <li>(At first it&#x27;s kind of fly-away)</li>
      <li>So for MY hair I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that if I use it every three weeks it works fine.</li>
      <li>My hair type is fine and curly</li>
      <li>Also my hair styled with a precision cut (many layers) was super wavy.</li>
      <li>When my hair begins to get really rebellious, I make sure to use this in the shower, and viola!</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner, it is super smooth and if you can find it on sale it is a steal.</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference in my hair after repeated use.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s tangle free.</li>
      <li>This is a great deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
      <li>It is very thorough and makes brushing one&#x27;s hair a very easy task.</li>
      <li>it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a single tangle in my waist-length hair.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this to be antything special.</li>
      <li>WOW, what a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>The Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment does a good job for a product in its price range.&lt;br</li>
      <li>directions call for the use of the product once a week for or more often for very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but my hair is really looking much better.  </li>
      <li>This did not weigh my hair down at all, and when I style it now it looks beautiful and polished.</li>
      <li>I have naturally thin/straight hair that gets easily greasy and weighed-down by most products.</li>
      <li>Fine, but tell it straight, rather than implying that you just shampoo and use this.</li>
      <li>I find that Tresemme has a large line of products, and that they obviously are a good deal.</li>
      <li>It really helps and leaves my hair silky smooth, detangled and defrizzed.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it because it&#x27;s so soft,</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really is a nice deep conditioning treatment, even if the hair is not damaged.  </li>
      <li>Indeed, they just fall out of big rollers in nicely formed waves.  </li>
      <li>so I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>Indeed, they just fall out of big rollers in nicely formed waves.  </li>
      <li>I like to apply this after my shampoo and leave it on for a good five minutes while I do all my other shower business.</li>
      <li>When I have time to treat it right in advance, I don&#x27;t have to turn to an emergency repair item like this</li>
      <li>When I have time to treat it right in advance, I don&#x27;t have to turn to an emergency repair item like this</li>
      <li>My hair was full, soft and smooth after just one treatment.  </li>
      <li>It has a moderate floral perfume and rinses well for a deep conditioner, leaving the hair smooth and shiny and with good body.  </li>
      <li>Nice Deep conditioner, really smooths my hair out.</li>
      <li>, I think it may be like totally new or virgin hair after the fifth application!!!</li>
      <li>By definition I rarely use products that are mostly used by the opposite sex, not out of an antagonistic frame of mind, but more like yielding to products that are strictly geared for an specific demographic.</li>
      <li>so many other conditioning treatments is the convenient bottle with the cap at the bottom (the product is always ready to come out) and the squeeze tube bottle (this makes getting the right amount out easy).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used deep conditioners that offered better results than this did.</li>
      <li>Another thing I noticed is that a lot of women uses this to restore over dyed hair and who knows the many restoratives needs of the female hair that are needed.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone with fine/thin hair who is looking for that soft, smooth look for their hair.</li>
      <li>TRESemme Platinum Strength Renewing Deep Conditioning Treatment has helped restore my hair to silkier, stronger, more manageable hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This line works for aging/thin hair.  and inexpensive.  My hair has more bounce and shine.</li>
    <li> Great for damaged hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is always so soft after using this! I just do a treatment once a week, so it really lasts a long time. I highly recommend this in conjunction with regular Treseme shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a decent normal conditioner, but the consistency is surprisingly thin for a deep conditioning treatment, like it&#x27;s been watered down or something.  My daily conditioner has a creamer thicker consistency.  And after using it a couple times a week for a few weeks (my hair is bone straight asian black hair, with occasional straw texture/split end issues), it doesn&#x27;t really do anything more than my daily conditioner.  Definitely won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use it about once a week.  It does what it promises so I am thrilled with the results.  I wish it was a bit bigger of a bottle, but since my hair isn&#x27;t too long or too thick it has lasted quite a while.</li>
    <li> Looking for smoothing on drier parts of highlighted hair. Product is so so.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, This product is wonderful for my hear.</li>
    <li> This prodeuct is not as good as the loreal 3 minutes hair mask, which smell better and work better.  This just feel like a normal conditioner but much more expensive</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really thick, and like many deep conditioning products, when you first put it on your hair it feels like it won&#x27;t be enough, and that it won&#x27;t cover all the hair. After a few minutes it \\&quot;softens\\&quot; some, though still never felt fully distributed, even after I rubbed it through again. After the first few uses I concentrated on the ends only, which worked well. My hair was soft and I liked this better than some other brands I had also tried, but there were still some fly-aways and not much frizz control if it was humid that day. The smell was great, I loved how it rinsed out almost completely. I have really thick hair with about 35% grey, and I think someone with less grey or hair that isn&#x27;t so thick would get better use out of this brand.</li>
    <li> The Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment does a good job for a product in its price range.&lt;br /&gt;The directions call for the use of the product once a week for or more often for very damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: If you have done a lot of hair coloring/hairing drying, teasing, etc. to your hair, as some of my teens have done, then using this product two-three times a week shows a noticeable difference after about two weeks of usage. If you have a older, dryer head of hair, the product is also helpful at making your hair softer and restoring its feel so that it is not dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: For large families, a bigger bottle of 12 ounces would be more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: If you haven&#x27;t treated your hair a lot and/or don&#x27;t do much hair drying then you may not need the deep conditioning but it might be helpful to have on hand in the summer when you are spending a lot of time in the sun and/or chlorine pools.</li>
    <li> My husband has dry, kinky, curly hair that is thinning. It takes a lot if abuse from industrial chemical environment exposure. We have tried so many products. Most don&#x27;t work, some work for awhile then become ineffective. This product however continues to improve his hair with each use. He has almost finished the tube. His hair is much more \\&quot;tame\\&quot; and is less fragile, with fewer broken pieces in the sink. It has a soft luster to it and is soft to the touch instead of so coarse. I&#x27;m really amazed at the results. We have a few more products to try but I&#x27;m thinking this may be the answer.</li>
    <li> I have long hair that&#x27;s relatively healthy.  I don&#x27;t have two years of damage to repair and I want to keep it that way.  The first time I used Tresemme Deep Conditioning Treatment, I thought my hair felt heavy as I was washing it out.  It didn&#x27;t have that nice, detangling feel as the water ran through it, although it did detangle.  I first noticed the difference as I was blow drying it.  My hair was full, soft and smooth after just one treatment.  I was literally running my fingers through my hair all day just to feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a nice deep conditioning treatment, even if the hair is not damaged.  I plan to keep using it to keep my hair at its best.</li>
    <li> First of all, Wow, this conditioning treatment does just what it says.  I have used it a few times now and I always leave conditioning treatments on for a minute or two longer so I don&#x27;t know how much that may have to do with it but my hair is really looking much better.  I dye my hair at home as I can&#x27;t always afford Salon colorings and I know the home dye does dry out your hair much more.  This seems to be working so well that I think I will only need to use it once a week very soon or at most twice.  The fragrance is almost a fruity smell and it does remind me of strawberries.  So far I&#x27;m really impressed and will keep on using this.  On a bit goes a long way so no need to use a ton of it to get the effects of perfect, beautiful hair that is shiny soft.</li>
    <li> I usually deep condition overnight and since this is branded as a deep conditioning treatment, I did the same. I have curly hair and I used a conditioning cap after I used this product. The next morning I washed it out and I honestly was not overwhelmed by the results. The main factor that I look for in deep conditioners is the way my hair feels after using it and how easy it is to manage my curls. I&#x27;ve used deep conditioners that offered better results than this did.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product now. I&#x27;m not sure what happened to my hair recently but it has become DRY.  I was using the regular TRESemme Platinum Strength Conditioner and thought I needed a little more moisture since I use a blow dryer and flat iron after every wash (which is approx. every five days) and this past winter was very cold and dry as well.  I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was going to be much different than the regular conditioner when I first got it because it was not thick like a cream like I thought it would be.  But it works wonders!  My hair feels sooo much better than it did and I noticed the difference after the first use. My hair type is fine and curly but I do use heat to straighten it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about its claims to repair damage or protect against future damage, but it does seem to work well in terms of conditioning. I used the recommended 5-day \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; and my hair does seems a little bit softer (a tiny bit more so than with my regular conditioner). Your mileage may vary, but for me it&#x27;s a decent product. Recommended.</li>
    <li> TRESemm&amp;eacute; Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment is a good choice for occasional treatment of damaged, dry hair.  It has a moderate floral perfume and rinses well for a deep conditioner, leaving the hair smooth and shiny and with good body.  It is not necessary to use a lot but it needs to be worked through the hair carefully with the fingers or a comb, making sure to coat the tips.</li>
    <li> My lady tells me that after she washes her hair and she puts the Tresemme in and leaves for about 30 minutes before rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she then uses the Motion Foaming Wrap Lotion to style her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that she did point out is that she prefers the Tresemme \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; line to this.  She says the results with \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; is better and that they should expand this line.</li>
    <li> Nothing turns me off to a product faster than extravagant claims like this \\&quot;repairs up to two years damage\\&quot;. Can they be sure this isn&#x27;t 22 months and 14 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me almost a month to review this product. People have such diverse types of hair one product just can&#x27;t fit all. Everyone is going to have a different result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair, not much damage but with the winter dry frizzies. The first time I used this it left my hair very soft and shiny. I thought \\&quot;Wow! this is the one for me\\&quot;. I tried it again four days later. It left my hair weighed down and STRAIGHT! I tried it again and the same results. So for MY hair I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that if I use it every three weeks it works fine. Obviously my type of hair doesn&#x27;t need  \\&quot;deep conditioning\\&quot; very often. It&#x27;s not that expensive so I guess it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Daverat&#x27;s Wife speaking (pls be kind RE: typos; I have arthritis) I&#x27;m ambivalent about Conditioning Treatments that rely heavily on the so-called &#x27;Cone laundry list of ingredients such as Dimethicone, Amodimethicone and other similar, chemically related components.  However, I have very thick, fragile hair that tends towards damage and split ends.  I have been wearing it very long the past few years in order to acheive the glamorous looks in style these days and to do that, I have to have emergency fixes such as deep conditioners that will help my hair take the application of heat styling and smooth the hair cuticle down, minimizing frizzies and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;laundry list\\&quot; of &#x27;Cones have their advantages and disadvantages.  They will give you that wonderful smoothness, temporarily soften and also shine your hair if you don&#x27;t abuse your hair too much with heat and chemical colors and/or straighteners.  The product coats the strands and seals them against swelling from atmospheric humidity after styling even if you have only used a deep conditioner.  I used to add a second layer of &#x27;Cones in a smoothing gloss for added shine and anti-frizz control.  Now I get that from either Argan oil smoothing treatment or from my new fave healing treatement, [[ASIN:B001T8MN16 Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce]] and their heat version of the product: [[ASIN:B003F1W5Q8 Motions Marula Natural Therapy Strengthening Thermal Oil Treatment 4.5oz]].  However, it&#x27;s hard to give up the gloss and silky ffeeling you get from a quick fix product such as Tresemme&#x27;s reasonably priced Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in place of a conditioner the morning I know I have somehwere to be that evening or even the night before.  The effect lasts for up to two days if you use a little argan oil on the palms of your hands to touch up the shine, smooth your part and tamp down any fly-aways before applying a light, flexible hairspray to whatever style you choose.  These days it&#x27;s all about very big open curls, giant S-waves and/or highly structured half-up half-down hairstyles.  The added smoothness that I get from the ingredients in this conditioner are a big help when I am  separating my large curls as I pull them out of the rollers.  Indeed, they just fall out of big rollers in nicely formed waves.  The shine is also pretty stellar, saving me from having to add that second layer of heavy &#x27;Cones which would weigh down the very curls I just spent so many hours setting up under rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product will not premanently repair or rejuvenate middle-aged or over-processed ahir the way some of the newer healing haircare lines can but it sure is a handy tool to have in your beauty kit when you find out the night before that your hubby has booked you to go to a film premiere or a dinner with one of his clients.  We live in Los Angeles and nowadays, every woman my age is wearing either lash extensions or winged false lashes to accompany their big BIG 1960s hair and sky high heels.  Since I don&#x27;t use a lot of make up on my face, my hair is my crowning glory.  When I have time to treat it right in advance, I don&#x27;t have to turn to an emergency repair item like this but let&#x27;s face it, who ever does?  I need something like this to rescue my hair several times a month on short notice and I&#x27;m glad to have it when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme&#x27;s price certainly beats out the $50 Kerastase Hair Mask from Europe my stylist uses and the Tresemme accomplishes much of the same things for a fraction of the price.  The other nice thing is that the Tresemme Conditioner can be used pretty much on any hair type whereas the Kerastase products are individually forumulated for fine hair, \\&quot;Ethnic hair\\&quot; as I call mine, regular hair, curly hair, straight hair and then some.  As long as you have reasonable expectations for this as a short term fix, you&#x27;ll simply LOVE IT!xible hairspray to whatever style you choose.

    <li> This conditioner works really well.  I noticed a huge difference in my hair after repeated use.  It is nice and thick and cover your hair well.  It has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most succulent conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll \\&quot;repair 2 years of damage in 5 uses\\&quot; as it so-claims, but it will make your hair MUCH softer after just one use. The bottle is fairly small, but has lasted me a long time. As long as you only use it a couple times a week, as suggested, the size shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. You can also use it every day, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Salon-quality indeed. I&#x27;ve actually paid the big bucks for \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners before, but seriously, nothing has given my hair such luxuriously silkiness as this stuff from Tresemme. The bottle is small, but the price is also quite reasonable. If you want to give your hair and treat without paying outrageous prices, definitely give this conditioner a try.</li>
    <li> I really like this TRESemme Renewing Complex for my highlighted hair. It&#x27;s a great deep conditioner to keep my hair looking healthy and prevent split ends. It is quite thick of a cream, but smooths into my damp hair well. After soaking for a few minutes, it rinses out cleanly. Both damp and dry, my hair easy to brush and it&#x27;s tangle free. It&#x27;s got a nice, light floral scent. I&#x27;m really happy with this conditioner - it keeps my hair soft, shiny, and looking great and after many uses, it does not seem to build up at all.</li>
    <li> I Have been using this treatment for 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;and nothing changed&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel any difference between this treatment and any conditioner&lt;br /&gt;( think conditioner is better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my boyfriend said that my hair looked worse after using this ;(</li>
    <li> I have very fine very thin hair.  This is a great deep conditioning treatment.  The smell is a little stronger than I would like it to be however fades quickly.  Leaves my fine hair feeling soft but does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it is super smooth and if you can find it on sale it is a steal. I will continue to use this product, even though I originally bought it only because it was on sale. This product keeps my long hair smooth and sleek.</li>
    <li> TRESemme Platinum Strength Renewing Deep Conditioning Treatment has helped restore my hair to silkier, stronger, more manageable hair.  I really like that it moisturizes for super soft hair while not making it frizzy. The treatment smells good and your hair keeps this scent very subtly for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I love about this treatment compared to so many other conditioning treatments is the convenient bottle with the cap at the bottom (the product is always ready to come out) and the squeeze tube bottle (this makes getting the right amount out easy). Compare this to several of the Tub like containers with the large lids that become super slippery while wet from the shower and then you reach your fingers in to get the product only to leave water in the tub and finally after getting slippery conditioner on your fingers you have to then recluse the already slippery lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair permed a little less than a year ago and was told to use Biolage. I thought it would work wonderfully since I had loved it years ago so I splurged. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t seem to cut it, for even the hotel shampoos did a better job with my hair while I was on vacation. Finally, when my shampoo ran out I tried Dove shampoo and it quickly restored some of my hair but it was still lacking using the Biolage conditioner. Then I tried the TRESemme renewing treatment and my hair is healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner ever! Wish they kept it in drugstore shelves!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a conditioner that would moisturize my hair without weighing it down with oils.  I have very fine hair, so heavy conditioners tend to weigh it down and make it lifeless.  I have tried a few different kinds, and I haven&#x27;t found the right one.  This works perfectly!  I use it once a week, and my hair feels soft and moisturized without being frizzy.  It&#x27;s a thick white paste, that goes a long way and has a light, citrus smell, that is far from overpowering.  I recommend this to anyone with fine/thin hair who is looking for that soft, smooth look for their hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this to be antything special. Pricewise, it&#x27;s not really \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; like other Tresemme products. Product-wise, it works almost as good as other drugstore brands of deep conditioning treatments I&#x27;ve used like Aussie, Fructis, and Pantene. It is more conditioning and much thicker than regular conditioner. The longer you leave it on the better. I found the fragrance to be a bit too fruity. And there was a little of a waxy feeling as I was rinsing. So definitley make sure to rinse your hair very thoroughly in order to get all the product out or it will likely weigh your hair down. Hair felt soft but didn&#x27;t look extra shiny. Could be the effects of the waxiness... Anyway, for the price, I&#x27;d rather spend a bit more for Pantene. Or spend a little less for Aussie. I&#x27;d say this is on par with Fructis/Dove/Herbal Essences... If your hair really needs serious conditioning and smoothing, I&#x27;d recommend spending even more on Redken-Smooth Down Treatment but that typically costs 3 times more. All in all, this was just OK for me. I&#x27;m not sure if I will finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really great. It is nice and thick. It left my hair feeling nice and soft and well conditioned. This conditioner contains Dimethicone (a silicone) as one of its main ingredients. That&#x27;s probably why it worked so well. The fragrance is nice and pleasant and not overpowering. Overall a good deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and dry from years of coloring (at home) and from using heat styling with a blow dryer and hot rollers. I need a super moisturizing conditioner and this product definitely fits that tall order. It takes only a small amount massaged into the hair with a little more attention to the ends and instantly my hair feels softer and smoother -- also less tangles! It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any type of coating or greasy feel behind. I love the smell of it as well. I definitely will keep this item on my list and will buy it again rather than more expensive salon formulas I&#x27;ve purchased for years.</li>
    <li> I received an order from Amazon for the Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioner along with the matching shampoo and daily conditioner. My hair is extra fine with slight waves and it is dry from being colored at home. I followed the directions for application on the bottles (except left it on a couple of minutes longer)......WOW, what a nice surprise. I know it says it takes 5 different uses of the Platinum Trio to heal 2 years of hair damage......but my hair looked great and felt so soft! Also my hair styled with a precision cut (many layers) was super wavy. It looks and feels so good with one use, I think it may be like totally new or virgin hair after the fifth application!!! LOL.....Try it,you too may love it.</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try this product out, so I got it for my wife to use. Typically she uses \\&quot;Clear\\&quot; brand shampoo and conditioners and she gave this a try. Apparently she didn&#x27;t care for it compared to Clear as I went into the bathroom and saw the bottle in the trash. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible product, but she didn&#x27;t care for the smell of it.  She is sticking with Clear</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I&#x27;ve done a lot of bleaching to my hair, and I blow dry and smooth it with a flat iron everyday. I have naturally thin/straight hair that gets easily greasy and weighed-down by most products. I thought my hair was just too fried and I&#x27;d have to live with it or wait for the damage to grow out. My roommate had this in the shower and I gave it a shot. On the first use my hair was smooth, manageable, silky and pretty much how it would feel if I would just leave my poor hair alone. I can&#x27;t stop touching it because it&#x27;s so soft, haha. This did not weigh my hair down at all, and when I style it now it looks beautiful and polished. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good conditioner that works even in very oily water that I have found can challenge certain conditioners. It is very thorough and makes brushing one&#x27;s hair a very easy task. It borders on leaving some greasy residue, but it doesn&#x27;t quite. My hair is still very bouncy with this conditioner, which I like. So I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use this product more than three days. It is extremely heavy, even for a conditioner, and caused my scalp to break out in a mild rash. I have very sensitive skin, so this is likely not a widespread problem. It didn&#x27;t make my hair look any better or worse, due to the limited time I was able to use it. It did detangle very well, but that benefit wasn&#x27;t enough to overcome the skin problem. If you have sensitive or dry scalp, you may want to give this one a pass. Otherwise, it seems to be a decent conditioner.</li>
    <li> For such an affordable product, the promise that it can condition and strengthen hair is a plus. I find that Tresemme has a large line of products, and that they obviously are a good deal. Like most products of this class they are required to be used constantly, for there is no easy cure when it comes to bringing hair back to its fullest shine and strength. I used it diligently until it ran out and have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the obvious life bestowed to my tired hair strands. Of course I realized that a decision will have to be made as to continuos use of this product, but in the short term I was satisfied that it could deliver in its basic promise.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the idea that their price is not too steep, and therefore makes it easy to like it even more. Another thing I noticed is that a lot of women uses this to restore over dyed hair and who knows the many restoratives needs of the female hair that are needed. By definition I rarely use products that are mostly used by the opposite sex, not out of an antagonistic frame of mind, but more like yielding to products that are strictly geared for an specific demographic. Not that it can be done, for I seen over the years that colognes, for one example, are termed unisex, meaning that a couple could wear the same bottle and go to the same party, and for each sex it would work in its own particular way.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the line more defined, but I also noticed that a lot of the reviews for this products come from men, so I am not going any deeper than what I already have. I did like the Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioning Treatment, 6 Ounce, and was very thankful for amazon, like always they are a class act, for letting me try this product and enjoy some of its benefits. Maybe this product is intended for all that like to style their hair and use different products that in time might need to be countered with something like this treatment. 4 Stars.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I dyed my hair and used the tube of ultra-moisturizer that came in the box.  My hair came out SO silky and smooth and it wasn&#x27;t long before I realized it wasn&#x27;t the color, but the CONDITIONER!  So I am now addicted to nice, thick hair conditioning treatments.  I will NOT use regular conditioner because it feels like putting water on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This treatment is GREAT... it&#x27;s thick, and the longer you leave it in the smoother and silkier your hair comes out. It says to leave it in 4 minutes but to be honest I don&#x27;t always have the time for that, so even just putting it in for 30 seconds it does wonders with your hair and especially your dry ends.  I&#x27;m always rotating between different products, but this one will definitely be added to the mix of other nice conditioners... it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave a single tangle in my waist-length hair.  If you&#x27;ve had it with your hair being dried out after it dries from the shower, then try something OTHER than normal conditioner... your hair should not be fluffy and dry, but silky and smooth, even if you&#x27;ve just washed it!</li>
    <li> I really expected a deep conditioning treatment with this product.  What I found was that it was a decent conditioner, but certainly not what I would consider a deep conditioning treatment.  I followed the directions exactly and got about the same level of conditioning as I would with any other standard conditioner.  It could easily be used daily (and I have been) without over conditioning the hair or causing any build up.  Unfortunately, it is too expensive to be used as a daily conditioner when there are others out there that work just as well for much less money.</li>
    <li> This initially could be written up as a decent deep conditioner with a great price.  But I hate it when a manufacturer acts like I&#x27;m stupid and this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how:  it tells you in the description \\&quot; Repair up to 2 years of damage in just 5 uses (in 5 uses when using shampoo and conditioner as a system vs. non-conditioning shampoo)\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years of damage? Really? That&#x27;s a bit unreal. But then the catch is their parenthetical remark (you have to have 5 uses using shampoo and conditioner first, rather than this product after shampoo).  So it&#x27;s adding a third step. Shampoo, condition, deep condition.  Fine, but tell it straight, rather than implying that you just shampoo and use this. And what is a non-conditioning shampoo? Palmolive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the product...let it sit while I did other chores. But there was no huge difference (not two years worth) once rinsed out.</li>
    <li> My wife swims once or twice a week for a good hour or so each time.  She has thin hair and the chlorine often leaves your hair dry and brittle, especially in the winter.  After a few uses she noticed that it helped keep her hair more manageable and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I am quite a fan of deep conditioning, back when I bleached/dyed/i.e. tortured my hair a lot in college, I found deep conditioners really did the trick in keeping my hair pretty healthy thru those days.  The best I&#x27;ve found has been [[ASIN:B000CPIMNA L Oreal Natures Therapy Mega Moisture Nurturing Creme 16 oz]], which is a STELLAR deep conditioning  treatment.  You really don&#x27;t need to use it often, and it is very affordable!  While the Tresemme Platinum Strength Deep Conditioner here is half the price, it&#x27;s also about a third of the amount (6 ounces vs 16 ounces): don&#x27;t get me wrong, this &#x27;deep&#x27; conditioner did a good job with providing some deeper-than-normal conditioning: I&#x27;m a fan, I liked it, it worked well and my hair responded very well to it, however, I&#x27;d say this Tresemme Plantinum Strength is probably a MEDIUM deep conditioner, while the Natures Therapy listed above, is really a true DEEP conditioner.  I hope you found this helfpul!</li>
    <li> Usually, I don&#x27;t care for Tresemme hair care products, I&#x27;ve never had much luck with them. Though, I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have baby fine, long, naturally wavy hair with high and low lights. After I shampoo and rinse, I slather this conditioner treatment on, finger comb it through all of my hair, (especially on the ends) and let it stay on for 3 minutes, then rinse. What I&#x27;m left with is smooth hair that is manageable without being limp and lifeless. I will definitely purchase this treatment again. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and I really like it. It leaves my hair soft, but even softer later on. (At first it&#x27;s kind of fly-away) It smells good, is super creamy, rinses out nicely. Best of all it&#x27;s at a totally affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love Tresemme and this product is among their line that I dig.  With this, you want to make sure that you are looking at how great it can be and what this product can do to help strengthen your hair.  I love how this works and when I paired it with a great shampoo, it worked really well.</li>
    <li> When you have this many different products on the market that call claim to do the same thing the only question that is relevant is whether or not it works like it says. And this one does. A small portion left hair feeling soft, silky and smooth and noticeably cut down on frizz when styling. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love using this periodically on my hair. I straighten and/or curl it, or damage it in some way everyday. When my hair begins to get really rebellious, I make sure to use this in the shower, and viola! Only semi-rebellious hair again! I have thick, wavy hair, perfect for afros by the way, and this helps to tame it down, and restore it from the punishments I inflict upon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it leaves a smell in my hair at all-I usually smell my conditioner, although the smell of this conditioning treatment is pretty pleasant. Not strong, very light, and fresh. It feels good just rubbing it into my hair, and isn&#x27;t messy to use. The only thing I can&#x27;t testify to is wether or not it will remove 2yrs of damage. I&#x27;ve been punishing my hair much longer than that, and while it certainly looks and feels amazing after use, I&#x27;m not totally sure if it&#x27;s been all healed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t need to use this often, just when your hair is look a bit out of sorts. It&#x27;s actually a decent price for the quality you receive, and o yes, I will be buying this again. Thank you TRESemmé, for yet another amazing product.</li>
    <li> Nice Deep conditioner, really smooths my hair out. I like to apply this after my shampoo and leave it on for a good five minutes while I do all my other shower business. It really helps and leaves my hair silky smooth, detangled and defrizzed. I don&#x27;t use it every wash, just once or twice a week, but it makes all the difference. Highly recommended.</li>
