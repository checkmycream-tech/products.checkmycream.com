      <li>Love that this product gives your skin a glow without appearing shiny.</li>
      <li>The scent is also lovely.</li>
      <li>I wish they came out with more stuff.</li>

      <li>It goes on more like a cream.  </li>
      <li>I haven;t been able to find a product that works as well as this one.</li>
      <li>I was a massage practitioner for many years</li>

      <li>and I can tell my skin has more of the glow that I wanted.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran Argan Oil and love it</li>
      <li>but my skin does feel more moisturized</li>
      <li>and I think this product is better.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I gave this oil a chance...</li>

      <li>Giving it 4 stars as it hasn&#x27;t made much difference in wrinkles but great skin nurishment and offsets ROC drying qualities.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that it has made my skin look and feel smooth and lustrous.  </li>
      <li>I love it, and will purchase it again.  </li>

      <li>After two days of use, skin appears more supple.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> use as daily moisturizer as i found this to be the best for my skin.  not really looking for results but im sure they are there...just love the way it works on my skin in CHICAGO</li>
    <li> I was looking for a retinol product and read reviews that recommended using Bel Essence along with some retinols that had a drying effect. I decided to try Bel Essence to see how it worked on its own. I use the product as part of my facial treatment after-swimming,  especially around the eye area which tends to dry out easily. Although the product is oily it absorbs quickly in the skin and leaves a nice smooth texture. Since the product is oily I would not wear it regularly during the daytime in summer months, but I would likely extend its use during the colder months when my skin is particularly dry.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product every day for the last 6 months and has noticed a considerable reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. She has very sensitive skin and has to be careful what products she uses. It is very easy to apply with the applicator. I would recommend this product. We live in the UK and it was a very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Amazon</li>
    <li> This product has made great changes in my skin.  I&#x27;m at that &amp;#34;change&amp;#34; age where my skin doesn&#x27;t know how to act.  Blemishes or dry and wrinkles? UGH!  This is helping with the wrinkles without causing acne!  And fixed my dry skin too!  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 days and already notice a reduction of lines and wrinkles. It leaves my face soft and I feel good knowing that what is being absorbed  into my skin is organic and natural .  Love this oil !</li>
    <li> I have been using it and my face looks nice. Not harsh on my skin and no residue left behind. Looking forward to lasting down the road.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I can notice the difference. I have used it along with the cream and can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I tried this oil in combination with ROC night cream based on another review here on Amazon.  I am 42 and must say the combo of the Bel Essence Oil and ROC is making my skin look great.  The Bel Essence feels a bit oily going on but absorbs well and hasn&#x27;t caused any acne or oily skin problems.  I have been using the ROC night cream and the Bel Essence nightly for couple months now and ma very pleased. If I forget to use the oil one night I feel dry&amp; dull the next day, so think its really helping my skin. Recommend giving it a try. Giving it 4 stars as it hasn&#x27;t made much difference in wrinkles but great skin nurishment and offsets ROC drying qualities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some all natural products to help take care of my dry skin during the colder weather months and found Bel-Essence on Amazon. I decided to give this product a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It has all natural ingredients and applies very easily on my face. It takes care of any dry skin areas and leaves my face feeling nourished. A few drops go a long way, and the product has lasted me for months. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any decrease in wrinkles (I&#x27;m only in my 30&#x27;s), but I like the way if makes my face feel. I will continue to buy this Bel-Essence Oil Treatment for my personal needs.</li>
    <li> I really liked this and what it did for my skin at night BUT I opened my cabinet door one morning a couple of weeks ago and it fell out and bounced off the counter on to the floor and half the bottom fell out of the bottle even though it was plastic and I lost three quarters of a bottle of oil, got a mess on the floor and later found a couple of plastic shards that were as vicious as glass.  It&#x27;s too expensive to buy if it&#x27;s that easy to break so I won&#x27;t be replacing it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough yet!  The bottle says you have to use it for a minimum of 90 days, have only had it a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> BEL ESSENCE ORGANIC OIL: Works really well to soothe your skin. Very good oil helped my skin to look smoother and healthier.</li>
    <li> A wonderful and natural replacement for any creams or serums for anti- wrinkle. After two days of use, skin appears more supple. Looking forward to three months of use to diminish wrinkles. Also, this product is well priced for quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and I was looking for a skin care product that actually measured up to it&#x27;s advertising, it seemed to be \\&quot;Mission Impossible\\&quot;. I had never heard of this product before, but took a \\&quot;leap of faith\\&quot; and ordered it anyway. I became a believer after three weeks of using it regularly, morning and evening. \\&quot;Crows feet\\&quot; type lines around my eyes, and a frown line faded slightly, the dry wrinkles that were starting on the side of my mouth decreased also. My skin softened and was being moisturized, and a healing process started to take place. I had been in Texas only a few months and my skin was dried out from 120 degree temperatures and had sustained damage, but the oils in this treatment were repairing some of it. This is a product that surprisingly performed beyond my expectations. I will continue to be a consumer and supporter of it.</li>
    <li> I have to use a large amount to have it go on smoothly. I feel like it pulls my skin if I use the few drops it suggests. I&#x27;m not pleased at all. Probably will return. I&#x27;ve used plain argon oil and it goes on much nicer.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve applied oil to my face. I broke out in acne. I&#x27;m going to stick w/ oil-free lotion instead. I like the feel and the application of lotion than I do oil. That&#x27;s just me, though.</li>
    <li> My bottle has the odor of rancid oil. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal or a bad bottle. I haven&#x27;t been able to find who I need to direct this question to. I&#x27;ve used it anyway, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll continue because of the strong smell. Has anyone else had this problem?</li>
    <li> I use this serum with Bel Essence&#x27;s lotion, and it&#x27;s fantastic for winter months for extra moisture. It might be too much for a 20 something to use every day, but for 30s and up it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Feels nice on skin. Absorbs very quickly with out feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on this natural living mission for the past 2 yrs and to help facilitate all things natural i though this would be a great addition to my regimen.  It&#x27;s not bad, but i don&#x27;t love it.  I could technically but all the different oils and mix them together myself so i&#x27;m not quite sure it&#x27;s worth it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but i did like it.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this. I must admit I am already noticing the difference! It is a wonder why this product has not been advertised like the supposed good ones!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  After cleansing at night I apply Bel-Essence.  It feels heavenly.  Time I go to bed my dry aged skin has soaked it up.  Skin feels like a baby&#x27;s butt.  Soft, fresh, and healthy looking.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy feeling.  I will never use anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Provides great moisture without being oily even though it is. Just melts into skin. I use on face, neck and chest and its help reduce lines and sun damage!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this only at night because it does stay oily on my skin.  I feel like my skin is more supple and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of this (first lasted several months).  I am extremely prone to acne breakouts, whiteheads and blackheads even at my advanced age of 65+.  I use it every morning after applying a saclicylic acid and then apply an oil free moisturizer on top of the Bel Essence.  The Bel Essence is absorbed quickly so I just wait a couple of minutes before applying moisturizer.  On some days I just apply SA and then Bel Essence and nothing else except maybe a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I notice a definite diminution difference in my nose/chin lines and my skin feels wonderful and soft.  Other products I have used that were much more expensive, often clogged my pores or felt greasy; not this one!&lt;br /&gt;With the advent of summer and gardening and sweating, I frequently have whiteheads on chin no matter how often during the day I wash my face; so am not applying  Bel Essence there just as a precaution.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like the combo of oils in this product, but the dispenser vile is really messy...could be the user, but I waste a lot of this oil because of the leaks.</li>
    <li> I like this it keeps my skin hydrated and its organic, would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this to be as good as it is. It does not absorb immediately so give it a little time before applying any thing else. But it makes such a difference that it is more than worth the wait. If I go a day without using this I can feel a difference! I apply after cleansing and before night cream, day cream and makeup. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Thumbs up endorsement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with Bel Essence Oil Treatment for both my face and my hair!  Remembering last winter&#x27;s dry skin issues on my mature skin, I opted to try Bel Essence as an Anti Wrinkle Oil Treatment and even though it is just now getting cooler, I am happy with the results.  I remember to apply Bel Essence Anti Wrinkle Oil Treatment to my neck area as well.  Along with a healthy diet, exercise and drinking plenty of water, I feel I am well prepared to face Old Man Winter without looking it!  Update:  I included a dropper of Bel Essence Oil to my freshly washed hair in place of my usual conditioner and my hair feels soft, full and definitely NOT greasy!  Two treatments:  one product!  Hooray!</li>
    <li> I use this product in the evening and feel that it smooths out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal to oily skin and choose to use this product in the evening because it is oil based. It is a bit heavy for me to feel comfortable wearing in the morning under my makeup and normal moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being an oil based, I was worried that it would cause my skin to break out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month or so and no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for those looking for an alternative or supplement to their skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this in conjunction with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair but do not see any changes nor improvements thus far.&lt;br /&gt;My use has been a little less than a month, so I will continue to use both products twice daily until they are gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a little more than 2 weeks. I purchased this because I was looking for a natural product to help my dry skin yet also soften  my lines around my eyes. I have already noticed a difference... but also my sporadic acne cleared up!  (Never had acne until my 50&#x27;s.) Another huge difference... no more puffy eyes every morning! I am so glad I gave this oil a chance... my skin is calmer and is no longer dry. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it a week and really like it so far. I&#x27;ll upgrade to 5 stars after I see how it is for a month. I was using a more expensive product which was also all natural, but it made my skin dry and under my eyes even more lined. This is oily by it is leaving my face soft without being greasy. I&#x27;m not sure how it does with wrinkles but time will tell.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am using it in addition to the anti-wrinkle treatment-intensive anti-aging, facial lift skin care formula.  This is oily when you put it on, but it does absorb.  My skin feels amazing.  This has not made my skin breakout, which always scares me when I try new products.  I have used it for about 2 weeks and I Love it!</li>
    <li> I like this. I think I like this oil better than the Bel Essence cream. It goes on smoothly and is absorbed by the skin pretty quickly. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling or looking oily. A little goes a long way, and my skin looks and feels great. I will definitely buy this product again ...</li>
    <li> This oil is great.  I&#x27;ve always had skin that breaks out easily, so I was afraid to try anything with oil in it, but went ahead because of the good reviews, and because my skin gets really dry even though I also break out.  It feels great on my skin, and it never makes me break out at all.  I love it, and will purchase it again.  I also like the Bel Essence cream that has the same oils in it.  I&#x27;m 50, and I love the way it makes my skin feel.    UPDATE 12/4/14: I wrote the above in June, and I wanted to add that I had some areas of concern on my face that have completely cleared up, solely from using the oil, because I didn&#x27;t do anything else differently.  I had a few areas that were kind of like an ingrown pimple, or a bump under the skin, or dry and patchy, that never completely healed and would flare up; they cleared up after using the oil for a month or 2.  And I had them for at least a few years if not longer.  I am amazed at how nourishing and healing this oil is.  I thought I was going to have to go in and have someone cut on my face to remove some things, and I am so happy I didn&#x27;t have to do that!</li>
    <li> I read another review and use it with ROC products switching initally ROC one night, and Bel Essence the other, and now ROC for two nights, and Bel Essence the 3rd night.  My skin looks softer and feels less dry.  I&#x27;m not about wrinkle benefit at this point, but it has really helped with the flaky dryness issues I was having just using ROC</li>
    <li> I figured that applying organic oil on my already oily skin is not the best idea. But thankfully I was wrong. I only use a few drops both in the evening and in the morning so that my skin is properly hydrated. It&#x27;s not too heavy for my skin type and it gets absorbed quickly, allowing me to carry out my make-up routine. And unlike creams, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sheen. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks but I&#x27;ve already noticed the difference: it has reduced the darkness of my sunspots and I can tell my skin has more of the glow that I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a  month now and so far I like the result!  My face is not dry anymore unlike before. :-)</li>
    <li> I haven;t been able to find a product that works as well as this one. I love it and I would recommend it, it&#x27;s just a little pricy is all.</li>
    <li> This is my first order and I am loving how this feels on my skin!  It&#x27;s better than the Loreal facial oil I tried last month.  Best thing about it is that it&#x27;s organic, free of chemicals, and thicker (but not greasy).  I love using it over my retinoid product on my neck/chest  area (wait an hour or so) at night to prevent further sleep wrinkles and right after a shower to keep it moisturized during the day.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product. The reviews were all very positive and I thought this was too good to be true (cheap AND effective). Well, I must admit that I&#x27;m very impressed so far. It is too soon to comment on results but I enjoy applying it as it leaves my skin soft and glowing.  The smell is very nice too as it is &amp;#34;subtil&amp;#34;. I usually spend a fortune on beauty products and I&#x27;m often disappointed...not this time! I intend to keep using this wonderful and affordable oil. Overall,  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Upon beginning the use of the oil a few months ago, I found the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; to be slightly rancid, which was a bit off-putting.  However, I used the oil on my face anyway and had no ill effects from it.  As time went on, either the odor went away, or, more likely, I became accustomed to the smell.  Since autumn set in, I have generally been using the oil 2x/day on my face, morning and night, underneath an all natural and organic moisture cream.  Although a bit dry more recently (likely due to very cold temps outside -Minnesota- and very dry conditions inside) I find that my skin&#x27;s moisture content is holding up fairly well.  I bought this oil because it is supposedly all natural and organic.  I enjoy the eye-dropper dispenser.  However, I found that despite the cap being on tight, the bottle leaked oil while in a non-upright position during transport from my point A to point B.  A bit messy result.  Update - my second bottle did not have a slightly rancid odor.  However, having recently opened my third bottle, which has been stored upright in my refrigerator since I received it, I find that it has that slightly rancid odor.</li>
    <li> wow, I really love this stuff!! I use a glycolic acid cleanser and prescription strength vitamin a once a day, and hyaluronic acid twice a day. the combo has been amazingly effective for my skin, but has left it unbelievably dry and flakey. I have been on a very long search for the perfect face oil. I have tried a few different brands of argan oil, coconut oil, ayurvedic oil blends, high end oil blends from Sephora, and didn&#x27;t feel like any of them moisturized at all. I think that this particular oil blend is exactly right for my skin -- extremely rich and moisturizing but not greasy or heavy. every morning I apply three drops on bare skin, moisturizer with spf and then three more drops on top of the moisturizer to help seal everything in, and I apply it to my driest areas in the evening. my skin is absolutely glowing and no longer flakey or red. I love this product and will continue to reorder. I cannot wait to try the moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil!  I use it at night and the cream during the day.  When I wake up, my skin feels baby soft and looks radiant!  I use this on my neck as well.  I love that this is 100% natural and they use organic ingredients so I can feel good about what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.  I will be buying this again for sure!  I think I will also start using it on my hands.</li>
    <li> When Your in your forties are skin goes through a lot of changes especially are Face.Dry,acne,wrinkles all sorts of things and I know speaking for us women its not happy times. And there is so much product out there saying buy me. This Anti-Aging caught my attention because it is for one 100% All Natural and Organic, no chemicals. And I Know all the ingredients are Good For Me. Using this product has made my skin feel so smooth and very hydrated I love it. After putting it on, my face does not feel greasy but very fresh .I believe it is for all age groups .I started my daughter using it she is 24.I wish I would of known about this product years ago. I purchased my second bottle and will continue to buy it. Very Happy Women over here!!!</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday in conjunction with my facial lotion. I really believe my skin looks better now that I&#x27;ve been using this on the regular. I feel like this works better as a night conditioner than in the day. When i put it on at night, when I wake up my skin feels and looks amazing! Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This anti- wrinkle oil is great and a great price. I am using it a lot as my skin is quite dry right now. It is all natural and has little scent and I love that I don&#x27;t have to worried about my sensitive skin reacting to some hidden ingredient. It plumps my lines and wrinkles. Great all natural product great price compared to many of the new oils out there.</li>
    <li> Love the way it looks on my skin!</li>
    <li> I love this product, the oil absorbs fast, smells good, and feels good on my skin.....</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite oil. I use it morning and night. It doesn&#x27;t irritate, makes my face very smooth and nice. I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 10 days now.  I am not noticing a major difference but my skin does feel more moisturized (of course that could be the change of weather).  No, wrinkles and years have not disappeared yet but I was not expecting a miracle.  I have to give the product a fair chance to do its magic but so far I am happy with just having rid myself of dry and tight feeling skin. Hopefully after more use, my skin will get brighter and I will notice a subtle difference. I would not expect dramatic results within 10 days though.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this helps. I am going to finish the bottle since I bought it, but I like the Bel Essence cream a lot better. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> All natural, absorbs well (after spritzing skin with hydrosol). Keep in mind that because it does not have a natural preservative and the product lasts a long time (if you use a few drops each application as I do), it can go rancid. So, refrigerate it (also can place part of the product into another bottle to reduce the amount exposed to daily temperatures). The only negative is that the company sent a coupon stating that if I wanted a free bottle to email them (their stipulation was that, after receiving a return email from them, I would review their product). Well, I waited and there was no response from them, so I emailed again and they did not have the courtesy to respond that this offer was no longer available (or whatever their reason was). Because of this experience, I would not order from this company again. Product is good though.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for mature skin, I am 51 &amp; use renova a few days a week, this product is great for my days off. It hydrates without being greasy or overpowering scent. This seller shows an unusual interest in its customers, by that I mean they seem to genuinely want their customers to be satisfied &amp; appreciated.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is great.....will order again. Arrived well packaged</li>
    <li> Used it on scars. Works great to renew skin.</li>
    <li> I used this oil at night. When I wake my skin feels very soft. I moisturizes without causing breakouts. It is a great product and is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have purchased from this company, and it is just as incredible as the cream. Together, these products are the perfect anti aging products to use both day and night!! Not only is this a great product, I don&#x27;t have to keep looking for the fountain of youth, I think I found it!!!</li>
    <li> I have used allot of different products and this was by far the worst. I noticed nothing other than really greasy,oily skin. It really is a bad product. Never using Bel Essence products again.</li>
    <li> Wow, did this make my skin break out.  Clearly, my skin is sensitive to any kind of oils no matter if they&#x27;re organic or not.  I tried it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product soaks into my skin at night. The scent is also lovely.</li>
    <li> Thank you for making a product that is 100% all-natural as I have sensitive skin. Love that this product gives your skin a glow without appearing shiny. Also diminishes fine lines.Great product!</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly. My new favorite facial treatment. I like the fact that it&#x27;s organic...much better than synthetic ingredients found in most treatments.</li>
    <li> So I decided to test this product out because I have noticed that I was starting to get a great deal of fine lines on my forehead, in between my eyebrows, &amp; around my eyes. I am only 26 years old, so I wanted something to help ward off my early signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product since 02.2013 &amp; it is now 03.2013 and I have noticed a difference in my fine lines on my forehead &amp; in between my eye brows. The product goes on nicely &amp; a little goes a long way! It only takes a couple of drop to cover my entire face! I am honestly looking forward to seeing more improvements in my skin as time passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh &amp; it does not seem to conflict with my makeup. However, I do give it a minute or two to sink in before I apply my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> crazy fast delivery.....excellent product....it is precisely how it was described and is everything they promised.  I would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;and tell my friends, that this product is all it is promoted to be</li>
    <li> I purchased this with the anti-wrinkle creme.  Have used thew oil for about a week now and have gotten positive comments from my spouse that my has a nice glow.  As, most oil will be…it&#x27;s oily…BUT it has not caused my face to break out like most other oils will do and it is absorbed well in a short amount of time.  I do recommend this product.  A huge plus is that it is &amp;#34;All-Natural&amp;#34;  Some of the oil ingredients are also included in the creme.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin due to aging (49).  It is oily when first applied, however is absorbed quickly.  I usually only use at night.  My skin is very smooth and soft upon waking. I would recommend to others with dry skin. Since you would only need a few drops of this product at each application it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 11/27/2014: Everything still very true.  When I do not use the oil for a day or two my skin looks dried and flat.  With the oil my skin feels moist and is lustrous.  I am very happy.  we are near finishing the second bottle and plan to order another now.  It has never gone rancid.  The second bottle lasted about 4-5 months with two people using it daily.    UPDATE 08/18/2014: Everything I said below still holds true. I have just finished the first bottle and have cracked open the second one.  Thus, one 2oz bottle of Bel Essence \\&quot;Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment\\&quot; lasted 8 months with two people using 2-4 drops each per day.    I waited until I had used more than half the 2oz bottle of Bel Essence \\&quot;Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment\\&quot; made with avocado oil, argan oil, grapeseed oil, sesame oil, and almond oil.  I can honestly say that it has made my skin look and feel smooth and lustrous.  Prior to this my skin was starting to look a little dry and flaky, which is why I looked for this oil.    I have used it primarily on my face (and places I have dried cracking scars such as my elbows where years of military service and cycling accidents have shredded the skin layers).  I am over 45 with pale skin and light colored eyes.  My skin does not see extensive sun but I live in LA, so there is exposure to a great deal of environmental oxidative damage.  (I am also a graduate research scientist at a major university specializing in molecular and cellular biology and physiology as they relate to mechanisms of disease.)  Recently, I have been getting more sun than usual and this prompted me to look for more ways to protect and nourish my skin.    I started using only 2 drops a day from the supplied dropper.  That is \\&quot;droplet\\&quot; not \\&quot;dropper-full.&#x27;  After showering, I put two drops in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and rub it in to the skin on my face.  I was a massage practitioner for many years and I have a feel for oils.  This oil warms quickly when rubbingthe hands together.  It spreads nicely without being thin and runny.  It goes on more like a cream.  Once on my face, unlike many of the new lotions that have alcohol to evaporate them off, it appears to reasonably quickly seep into the skin, but leave a slight luster.  My skin does not feel oily at all at this point.    I abhor oils that go rancid. I simply can not stand the smell. I suppose I am sensitive to it because I used so many and so much oil doing massage, and it was in my equipment and all the bedding.  This oil does not go rancid (not in the time frame of the months I have been using it).  This is because many of the oils used in this treatment resist oxidation and rancidity, especially argan and grapeseed. They also seem to impart this feature to the skin.    My skin feels and looks different.  Others have noticed as well.    One other thing only you will note is the smell of the argan and other oils.  The combined smell is earthy and a tiny bit of goat.  This is a testament to the good handling practices of the oils; if the oils are too purified they can be damaged and denatured.  I find the smell interesting, but that it goes away quickly.  When I was doing massage, I always noted the various smells of the pure organic oils I used.    Recently I also started using 100% argan oil in my hair (wow, I love the effect in my salt and pepper and slightly drying hair) and the goat smell is certainly from the argan oil, but again, the smell disappears quickly. Don&#x27;t be put off.  Start with a single drop and warm it between your hands before applying, you will smell the earthy tones of the oils.  Then the smell will go away, probably dispersed by our own chemistry.    I recommend giving it a try.    My wife is now also using the Bel Essence \\&quot;Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment.\\&quot; My wife is a face and figure model and relies on her lovely skin.  She knows cosmetic, skin nourishment quite well, having more organic treatments than I have ever seen.  She now uses this every day.  I can tell you that she was starting to get a little sun aging on the driver side of her face from all the hours driving to/from modelling gigs.  That has all but disappeared.  I would show you photos if I had taken any.    My wife and I use this one bottle both using 3-4 drops each application.  The bottle is 1/2 empty now.  I guess we have 1-2 more months.  Though I think we will both end up using it 2x a day at some point because we are both impressed with the way it leaves our skin.  That tells me that for one person using 3 drops once a day, the bottle will last close to 7-8 months, about 3-4 months if you apply 2x a day.    While I knew about the benefits of the other oils in this treatment, I was not aware of the whole story of argan oil.  As with many of the products I consume or use on my body, I researched first.  (I am sensitive to artificial colors, flavors, scents, preservatives, chemical residues and even residual pesticides in oils.)  I was very impressed with what I read about the argan oil.  Both socially as well as the health imparting benefits of the oil.  My conscientious hair dresser had always used some form of natural, fragrance-free Moroccan oil on my hair (which has argan oil in it) and the effect was always very smooth silky hair for days.    If you are not sure about the ingredients or sources, do a little research for yourself.  You learn something new, like I did.    I was a little anxious to try the oil on my skin at first, but after application of a tiny single dab to a scar on my arm, twice a day, it was evident that I had no reactions to the oil and that it had moisturizing and nourishing benefits.  I had my wife comment on treated and untreated scars without knowing which was treated.  She clearly noticed the change.    I am very happy with the quality of the product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 years old and needed something in my skin care routine to help out with my aging skin. I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran Argan Oil and love it but it&#x27;s so expensive that I can&#x27;t justify buying it any more. While doing a search through Amazon, I came across Bel Essence, which is 100% all natural, organic and an anti wrinkle treatment as well. It not only contains argan oil, but grapeseed oil and advocado oil! When I received this product, I was impressed by the amount that you get for the price and that you only need a few drops. Not only do I use it on my face, but on  my hair. This product far exceeded my expectations. It makes my skin and hair feel like silk. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an addition to their skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I really like the fact that it is made with all natural oils.  My client use once day and they love it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product, and am glad I did. I have been applying it under my neck and have seen a marked improvement in my skin.  It has also softened a surgical scar on my neck and made it less noticeable.  I am a believer in this product.</li>
    <li> I am 31 &amp; started seeing dramatic changes in my skin over the past 7 yrs. I have tried everything and was convinced I was doomed to have extremely dry, red skin forever. It was actually painful. I was told a few yrs back that i have rosacea and I wasn&#x27;t convinced. I was pretty sure it was just extremely dry, sensitive skin. I started trying all natural products and was still having no success. My skin was not absorbing the products. It got to the point where I was slathering Vitamin E oil that I purchased at the health food store all over my face 2x a day, just trying to relieve the pain of the dryness. After reading hundreds of reviews for numerous products I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot and I am so very glad I did. I noticed a difference immediately! My skin soaked this product right up. For the first time in 7 yrs, my skin has made a dramatic transformation. Within a week, I was actually getting comments at work telling me how beautiful my skin is. My pores have shrunk and the redness of my skin is now a glow rather than irritation. I have never reviewed a product but I just can&#x27;t say enough about this brand. I wish they came out with more stuff. I use the oil and lotion at least once a day, usually twice. If you have very dry skin, I HIGHLY recommend this line. Definitely my forever products.</li>
    <li> I received Bel Essence for Christmas last year and have used it twice a day for the past four months.  It is wonderful.  You only need a few drops to cover your whole face and I massage it in which makes my skin glow and I love how it feels. It is not oily or greasy and absorbs quite easily.  It was great throughout this cold winter in NY.  My skin glows, is beautifully hydrated, the wrinkles are definitely minimized AND most importantly, to me, my eyelashes have grown in fuller.  They were very scant but now they are rich and thick and I love having eyelashes that I can see again!  Thank you so much for such a wonderful product. I highly recommend this product and will definitely be a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use the product because it did not list sesame oil as one of the ingredients. Need to fully disclose all ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month now and it has been great. I use it on my face and on random dry patches on my body. Within 24 hours the skin is soft again. Smells nice and is absorbed within a few minutes. I&#x27;m happy to be rid of the dry flakes I get on my face during the winter. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause breakouts so it&#x27;s part of my regular routine.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle worker! I didn&#x27;t see the change in my skin and although it felt good putting it on my face, my face actually looked more wrinkled and easier to crease. I am 72 and have very few wrinkles just trying to keep it that way as long as I can</li>
    <li> Loving this. Purchased 4 months ago to use against pregnancy stretch marks, but it ended up becoming my daily moisturizer. I initially had reservations about using it on my face since I have pretty oily skin, but the combination of oils dries quickly and works fine underneath the bb cream I put on top. Also, I haven&#x27;t found the smell others have commented on offensive, at all. It has a faint, almost barnyard-like aroma, but doesn&#x27;t smell rancid or off. Using about 4 drops everyday for my face, I&#x27;m about halfway though the bottle and plan to reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing, that lasts all day without being greasy or causing breakouts. All without any chemicals with names you can&#x27;t pronounce :)</li>
    <li> I was using another product that was more expensive and I think this product is better.  My skin is softer and I see a glow to my skin.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and oils for my face,  but this one is by far the best.  I have mostly dry skin but some oily spots, but this product works great on both types of skins. This is my second bottle and i notice the difference after about 2 weeks. My skin is softer, shinier and the lines around my eyes seem less visible.  It also works great under makeup!</li>
    <li> no much difference notice while using this product...I could wait more time to write this review, but it has been more 2 months of using it...looking for alternative</li>
    <li> My skin was dry so I added this into Shea Butter and it works great. The dark circles under my eyes have lightened up making my make up application smooth and flawless! I also see smile lines beginning to decrease.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be really really oily but for night, that&#x27;s fine.  I use this right after my shower when my skin is still a bit moist and it goes in very nicely.  It&#x27;s oily upon application then absorbs very quckly and my skin feels so soft.  A little goes a long way when your skin has that fresh out of the shower moistness to it - I only use 4-5 drops to cover my face, neck and chest.  I use the cream during the day and have noticed my pores are much smaller and my skin looks much finer.  That&#x27;s nice on a 58 year old face!  :)</li>
    <li> Oily, takes forever to soak in. Not seeing much improvement and using it everyday.</li>
</ol>
