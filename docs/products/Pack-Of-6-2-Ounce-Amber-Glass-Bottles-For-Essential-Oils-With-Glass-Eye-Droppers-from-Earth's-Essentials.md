      <li>Great bottles for essential oils.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really need 6 bottles, but I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy in the future!</li>
      <li>Fast ship!!</li>
      <li>This is a good buy, well worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>The one bottle I have filled with essential oil and tested had a dropper that worked well and threading that kept the lid secure.</li>
      <li>These bottles are exactly as they appear to be from the product picture and description.</li>
      <li>Local shops were asking more for one bottle verses these six.</li>
      <li>They are great but much bigger than I expected !</li>
      <li>Bottles are the right size...came quickly, and are working well for my essential oil tooth brushing solution!</li>
      <li>It was a bit easier than I expected to unscrew it, but I&#x27;m sure some residue from the oil was the cause of that.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for a variety of uses including medicinal and herbal.</li>
      <li>The tops are high quality as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were also much bigger than what I really needed...that is all on me.</li>
      <li>I paid extra for these bottles over another set that was only $7 because of the stainless steel funnel which was pictured and STATED as being included.</li>
      <li>I returned a similar order of bottles because they were not as advertised and the droppers were cheap and at least 1/2&amp;#34; from the bottom of the bottle.</li>

<li> But minus a star because I&#x27;m actually rather upset about the funnel.</li>
<li> So be careful because they can break</li>
<li> One of the glass tube droppers was broken upon arrival and Two of the stoppers dissolved into my oils.&lt;br</li>

    <li> Did not receive funnel as listed in description.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality at a great price!</li>
    <li> Medicinal quality containers with glass droppers.</li>
    <li> They are great but much bigger than I expected ! Use thd to share essential oils!</li>
    <li> Great product, they are good quality, arrived in time and properly packed for protection.</li>
    <li> I was most pleased with the product, the delivery and all.</li>
    <li> Great bottles for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I paid extra for these bottles over another set that was only $7 because of the stainless steel funnel which was pictured and STATED as being included. The funnel is NOT metal. It is plastic. I threw it away. Next time I will buy the cheaper ones. Otherwise I would give them 4 stars. But minus a star because I&#x27;m actually rather upset about the funnel.</li>
    <li> Great bottles and arrived with  great packaging. I highly recommend them for a variety of uses including medicinal and herbal.</li>
    <li> Very nice bottles and I like that the glass droppers go to the bottom. I returned a similar order of bottles because they were not as advertised and the droppers were cheap and at least 1/2&amp;#34; from the bottom of the bottle. These were more expensive but remember, a bargain is only a bargain if you need it and you can use it!</li>
    <li> Bottles are the right size...came quickly, and are working well for my essential oil tooth brushing solution! They are great.</li>
    <li> These very well serve the purpose I bought them for, however,  the dropper itself if not very good hence the 3 star.</li>
    <li> I thought these to be smaller but I can use these anyway, they are very nice, also they were packaged very well. This is a good buy, well worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Great set, best value out there. Local shops were asking more for one bottle verses these six.</li>
    <li> These bottles are exactly as they appear to be from the product picture and description. I have no complaints with their size or quality. The one bottle I have filled with essential oil and tested had a dropper that worked well and threading that kept the lid secure. It was a bit easier than I expected to unscrew it, but I&#x27;m sure some residue from the oil was the cause of that.</li>
    <li> I needed glass eye droppers to used with my essential oils and these bottles/droppers work perfect.  I can just use the dropper or mix oils in the bottles, etc.  Being 6 in the pack, I was able to share with friends.</li>
    <li> Great bottles for tinctures. Droppers worked well and arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> Fast ship!! Item as described!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I had various issues with these.  One of the glass tube droppers was broken upon arrival and Two of the stoppers dissolved into my oils.&lt;br /&gt;They were also much bigger than what I really needed...that is all on me.</li>
    <li> No leaking. Easy to administer. Color keeps oils potent.</li>
    <li> shipped as described.</li>
    <li> Everything was great Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles for my essential oils and they work great.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these all the time.  I myself would rather use glass over plastic. So knowing that the eyedropper itself is glass as well is good to. So be careful because they can break but I have not had any problems myself.</li>
    <li> I needed bottles with dropper tops and these were perfect. Droppers work great. I use them to give as gifts or mix EOs with their carrier oil while taking them to the gym or on vacation. The glass is good quality. The tops are high quality as well.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered these. Sometimes I get essential oils and the lids don&#x27;t work so I needed something to put the oil in so I could dispense it drop by drop.  I didn&#x27;t really need 6 bottles, but I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy in the future!</li>
