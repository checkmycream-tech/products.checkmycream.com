      <li>Okay not too effective.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for blemishes and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I tried the gel cleanser first, and was really happy with how well it cleaned.</li>
      <li>Seems to work very quickly on some zits, and kind of okay on others.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been buying too many things on Amazon to make this a priority.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>and I am okay with that because of how well it works.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love everything about it....</li>

      <li>I want to absolutely love this product..</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and the message that they send across.</li>
      <li>To start I love all things Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>However, I just didn&#x27;t LOVE this one.</li>
      <li>but once you try to get just a drop out, out comes alot more than you wanted.</li>
      <li>Also, when using this product make sure to stay away from your eyes.</li>
      <li>in all, I love this product.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this product my face has never been better</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, been using it for years and its cheaper here on amazon</li>
      <li>The good thing however was that it does calm the itching.</li>
      <li>and I think it works ok.</li>
      <li>and I am okay with that because of how well it works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the magical solution for everyone, as products like these may work for one but not another.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost glad it did</li>
      <li>I have to order more</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I suffer from hormonal cystic acne, and am trying to cope with breakouts now</li>
      <li>in all, I love this product.</li>
      <li>is better than this</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
      <li>Since I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I picked this up at the store.</li>
      <li>I used it most often.</li>
      <li>Rarely do you find that!!</li>
      <li>It is mild but effective.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and effectively.</li>
      <li>Very true to it&#x27;s usage.</li>
      <li>and I must say, my face has almost completely cleared up and I am so happy.</li>
      <li>thing that I would suggest when using this product is to make sure that your hands are clean before applying to your face.</li>
      <li>That willow Bark is STRONG.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a strong licorice smell which can take you my surprise.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good at reducing mild acne flairs, but you have to spread it all around.  </li>
      <li>I am African-american with acne prone skin when I eat too many sweet treats which leads to inflammation and thus acne.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if your acne is sporadic and not bad it would work.</li>
      <li>and I could feel a bit of a sting as I used it which was fine for me.</li>
      <li>Ok for mild acne.</li>
      <li>I had a huge zit</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s all-natural which is a huge bonus.</li>
      <li>This worked great whenever I felt like there was some acne incoming on my face; I&#x27;d just apply it during the night and by the next morning the pimple won&#x27;t have surfaced.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells awful and stings, but does do some good for my acne.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I&#x27;ll use what I got.</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil not in burts bees brand and it had a very strong smell, this one has a smell but its nothing compared to the other one i have used. It has really made a difference in my acne. I love it!</li>
    <li> Thank you for this product my face has never been better</li>
    <li> Good product. Have to use sparingly as it is very drying.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from mild facial and back acne for many years, with my skin type, I also have hyperpigmentation as well even with a small blemish! Over the years, I&#x27;ve learned prevention is key.      I added this Burts Bees Acne Spot Treatment Product in my twice daily routine about 6 months ago.  While I still get breakouts occasionally, the frequency, severity, quantity has decreased dramatically.  I went from getting 4-5 consistent spots every 2 weeks to maybe 2-3 every month or two.     This solution smells like licorice to me, which I don&#x27;t mind, and it does sting if you have an open wound.  That being said, it does help your existing spots heal faster and stop new spots from getting bigger; note that I still apply this product on my skin twice daily on areas where I&#x27;m prone to getting spots (even if there&#x27;s no breakout) - prevention!      Contrary to common practice of using a cotton swab, which I found wastes a lot of the product, I actually fill-up the Burts Bee&#x27;s Blemish Stick roller with this product and roll it on my skin.  One bottle of this spot treatment lasts me about 2 weeks.    I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the magical solution for everyone, as products like these may work for one but not another. If you&#x27;re interested in my skin routine, I use a mild oatmeal soap, then apply toner, then Burts Bee&#x27;s solution, the moisturizer twice daily.</li>
    <li> I had been successfully using a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment for ~15 years but had typical problems like it discoloring pillow cases and clothing, and drying out my skin.  In search for a more natural but effective solution I came to Burt&#x27;s Bees line of acne products.  It seemed to take my skin some time to adjust to the product change, but once it did it&#x27;s been equally if not more effective.  This spot treatment really takes away the redness and reduces the swelling.  It attacks the acne in a more gentle fashion.  A pimple with this treatment might have a slightly longer lifespan lurking under the skin, but never look nearly as bad when I&#x27;d attempt to nuke it with benzoyl peroxide.  Now if it was just a little cheaper :-)</li>
    <li> Received product as a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied using a Q-tip to a couple of small blemishes I had. Next day, I woke up to see it was practically gone! There&#x27;s no harsh smell and it isn&#x27;t overly drying on your skin.</li>
    <li> The targeted Spot Treatment product by Burt&#x27;s Bees acted like a unasked-for chemical peel on my skin. When I used a cotton swab and dabbed the liquid on my skin, there was this fierce burning sensation. The next morning, that area of my skin was crusted over and when cleaned, looked red and worse than before. As the day progressed, the skin killed by the treatment began peeling off, while the actual acne was still there. That combined with the redness and dead skin just created a cesspool of pain and ugliness. I don&#x27;t want something this harsh damaging my skin. I went back to ordering my mom&#x27;s [[ASIN:B003949V36 Jafra Malibu Miracle Mask]] today. It takes a bit longer, but clears up acne without hurting my poor skin or making me look like a burn victim.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic.  My daughter swears it makes her acne disappear almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really quick to clear up any breakouts or dark spots.  It works better than the Proactiv mask!!!</li>
    <li> I applied this product to a cystic pimple on my chin.  It took several days for it to go down, but using this product got rid of it much quicker than using other products.  I have fairly sensitive skin as well.  I love Burt Bee&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! At the first sign of a pimple...I put some on with a qtip and the next morning it is almost all gone!</li>
    <li> I get the cystic every month and this helps prevent it from surfacing. I use it in the morning after swiping a witch hazel all over, then using this to spot treat the acne prone areas. It has a funky smell that I didn&#x27;t like at first, but I got used to it.</li>
    <li> This feels like alcohol it did nothing for me I&#x27;m really serious like alcohol in my opinion is better than this and this DRIES out ur face like it dries it out so much my face has never been so dry and I have a really oily face so disappointed bc this is burts bees and this brand is just so hyped up but I feel like they really shouldn&#x27;t be hyped up cuz this was just a no no worst $5 I ever spent</li>
    <li> I want to absolutely love this product..I really do, but I just can&#x27;t yet. To start I love all things Burt&#x27;s Bees. However, I just didn&#x27;t LOVE this one. The first thing you will notice is the smell. That willow Bark is STRONG. It&#x27;s not so much a turn off to me though as i prefer the smell of nature to the chemical fragrances normally accompanying beauty products. To apply you need to soak a q-tip in it then apply to the spots. My spots took a long time to improve. The only thing I will say that happened quickly was the drying effect the treatment had, it made the spot less shiny, but redness remained as did size. The good thing however was that it does calm the itching. Otherwise I mean I guess it depends on how bad the spot is, but I guess because I love just about every other BB product out there, i was expecting miracles from this product. I&#x27;m going to purchase another bottle and keep trying.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my skin since puberty, and I am now in my 30&#x27;s. I have tried everything on the market...murad, proactiv, Rx products...been there, done that.     I had some friends who swore by all natural products and was told that the Burts Bees line was amazing for acne, so I thought I would give it a try. I tried the gel cleanser first, and was really happy with how well it cleaned. So I moved onto the moisturizer, and that worked really well too.     However, when it came to this product (and the scrub), my face went from mild breakouts to cystic, painful breakouts, within a week. It was really upsetting to be in my thirties and have the skin of a 13 year old, literally, overnight.     If you have oily skin, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with great service. Buy oil dont buy the cream version</li>
    <li> Packaged well, same stuff I used to buy at the drugstore</li>
    <li> This stuff tingles and smells super minty, but it&#x27;s something I grew to not mind. This worked great whenever I felt like there was some acne incoming on my face; I&#x27;d just apply it during the night and by the next morning the pimple won&#x27;t have surfaced. With acne that has already appeared, I feel like it speeds up the process of healing, but it&#x27;s definitely not a one day miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt; The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it&#x27;s difficult for me to apply because it&#x27;s in a liquid form. The way the bottle top is designed, I have to give it a few taps on my finger to get something out and it&#x27;s usually a game of chance whether I&#x27;ll get the amount I want, nothing at all, or liquid all over my hand. I feel like with an eye dropper or brush or something, this would have been a 5 star product for me.</li>
    <li> Use this with care, it really does smart if you use it right after the acne cleanser. While it works very well I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it before going to work. Your face will be a festive shade of red, which may or may not work for you. If you want to use a spot treatment that works just as well but don&#x27;t want to deal with the smarting sensation, I&#x27;d say use the new spotting treatment (it&#x27;s a lotion form which goes on smooth and is a lotion as opposed of a liquid)</li>
    <li> The product seems nice, just got it ,but they should have put in a little glass stick or something because it just drips all,over the place.</li>
    <li> This is the first time using this product and I was leery at first since other products have failed me. I am prone to oily skin and breakouts even though I am in my 50&#x27;s. This product does sting when first applied but you do get use to it. Also, it has a strong licorice smell which can take you my surprise. The smell does go away quickly. I found that my acne seemed to worsen at first (first 1-2 wks of use). I almost gave up on it but kept using it and now I have seen an improvement. For me, my results took alittle longer than others who have reviewed this product. Those who wish to try it, be patient if you don&#x27;t see results immediately. I would recommend and will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> small amount , but  effective</li>
    <li> I bought this because there are SO many awesome reviews on here for it. I did notice that it seemed to shrink and heal a couple of my bigger pimples faster than normal, but about two weeks into using it I noticed that the areas around the spots I was using it were breaking out in a bunch of teeny tiny red bumps, which a month later have yet to go away. I&#x27;m not sure if this was some kind of reaction to the fragrance of the product, or if my face was too sensitive... it&#x27;s hard to tell with my skin, especially when my hormones are fluctuating. I might try it again at some point, since I&#x27;m keeping it around, and if I notice any changes I will update my review.</li>
    <li> spendy for amount but effective</li>
    <li> Okay not too effective. Too watery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting really awful breakouts for the past year or so, and decided to try one last product before I went to my doctor about it. Since I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I picked this up at the store. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my breakouts. I was hoping this would dry up some of the smaller ones quickly, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve not noticed any change. Honestly I think it caused a massive breakout in the area I used it most often. Secondly, this is the most inconvenient packaging!! You&#x27;re supposed to tip it over onto your finger, but when I did either nothing came out or too much shot out and dripped off the side of my finger. Plus, the liquid dries super fast. So I&#x27;ve resorted to dumping it out in the palm of my hand and trying to swipe it on all my problem areas before it dries, which wastes a lot of product. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works well and isn&#x27;t too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would have to deal with acne after 30.  I&#x27;m 45 now, and the only difference now from when I was 16 is that when I get a zit, it&#x27;s that much more noticeable now because it&#x27;s the only one.  It happens a lot less often, but when it does, it&#x27;s usually huge, painful and in the middle of my face.  I was recently visiting family and had such an occurrence.  I&#x27;m almost glad it did because otherwise, I might never have tried BB Targeted Spot Treatment, which is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  BTW, the term &#x27;All Natural&#x27; has never been much of a selling point after taking Chemistry &amp; Microbiology in college.  To those that attempt to use it, I reply, &#x27;So is marijuana and cocaine, but it doesn&#x27;t make them good for you.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, been using it for years and its cheaper here on amazon</li>
    <li> I been trying the product for about two-three weeks, I&#x27;m not much of a fan. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin, I do have acne and cystic pimples and does not seem to reduce them. I also, don&#x27;t like the little bottle how you have to take the liquid out. I think there should be a better bottle to get it out, too much liquid comes out.</li>
    <li> The effectiveness is a little weak.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I am shocked it actually works. Three months ago out of nowhere I got acne. I used to have acne in my teenage years but I haven&#x27;t had any for a few years now. To make matters worst it was cystic acne which I have never had in the past. I tried lots of store bought soap and creams and scrubs I also tried lots of natural remedies like apple cider vinegar but nothing at all worked. I saw a video on YouTube with a girl saying how well this product worked and she included pictures. I was very skeptical when I got this product I used it three times he first day j got it and two times the next day and just like that all my bumps where gone. Acne that I had been struggling with for months cleared up in two days I am soooooo happy to have found this product. If you have acne please give this a try. There is nothing better then finally having clear skin after having acne for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I suffer from hormonal cystic acne, and am trying to cope with breakouts now that I&#x27;ve decided to stop taking my antibiotic. When I have clusters of breakouts, I put this on a cotton ball and apply to affected areas. If there are just a few, I apply to a q-tip and dab on. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but I&#x27;m familiar with the smell of some of the ingredients (such as tea tree oil) that may be off putting at first. Also, the bottle is consistent with that of essential oils, so I&#x27;m also used to the way you have to carefully drop out the treatment. This spot treatment stops the growth and inflammation of my breakouts dead in its tracks, it really works for me. I put it on morning and night right before my moisturizer, and have seen drastic improvements in my skin!</li>
    <li> Works for me. I have extremely oily skin, so I am prone to clogged pores and small pimples. To control my skin, I use this product morning and evening after washing my face. I also use pore strips and a clay mask once a week. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I have noticed a decrease in clogged pores. :) while this product dries on the skin almost instantly due to the alcohol carrier, it also leaves my skin softer and seems to add a bit of a moist layer - must be the plant oils. This definitely does have a strong smell (which I personally like) of tea tree, juniper, and fennel. The combination of smells reminds me of black licorice, actually. The ONLY downside to this stuff is the bottle design. The product is contained in a glass dropper bottle that would normally contain essential oils, only the dropper top doesn&#x27;t drip; it pours the product out because it is watery. Use a q-tip or cotton pad to apply this. You could use your fingertip if you are VERY careful!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for blemishes and this is by far the best. Dries it up quickly and without irritating the surrounding skin.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff really works. I use it morning and night and my skin is improving in a matter of a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good at reducing mild acne flairs, but you have to spread it all around.  Unfortunately the cap is terrible at dispensing the product. The dropper is hard to use. I ended up opening it and using a q-tip, but then a lot of product gets absorbed into the q-tip and ultimately goes unused.  That makes this product end up being very expensive for the number of uses.  I&#x27;m going to try to replicate this by buying my own essential oils and mixing them, because if it works that will be a much cheaper solution.</li>
    <li> cuts acne time in half</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this spot treatment a few times and I think it works ok. This was not an overnight miracle worker for me like some other reviewers claim, but the size and redness of my pimples did go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is very medicinal. To me, it smells like anise extract or black licorice. It eventually goes away, but at first, it&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is a little tricky. I have to very carefully drip some of the treatment onto a q-tip and then dab it on. The only thing I hate about that it that the cotton tip tends to absorb more than I&#x27;m able to put on my face, so I feel like I&#x27;m wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the price isn&#x27;t great for what it claims to do. I will probably stick with my other treatment, just not super impressed with this product, considering I use everything else in Burt&#x27;s Bees acne control line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with severe acne my whole pre-teen and adult life. Not one OTC topical treatment or prescription medication has helped me. After using this product for a week, I&#x27;m already seeing a decrease in blemishes and it&#x27;s reducing scarring and marks on my face. This product is magic and this is coming from someone who has been frustrated with skin care her whole life! I know it&#x27;s specifically for &amp;#34;spot treatment,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve been using it all over my face twice a day and it&#x27;s working amazingly. THANK YOU BURT&#x27;S BEES for making me feel beautiful!</li>
    <li> I use a cotton swab with this solution on my face.  It can feel like burning at first and it does dry out my zits quickly.  After I re-apply it (2-3 times a day) the second day I see a significant relief in the breakouts.  It smells alcoholey, but bearable. What I do like about this is that the ingredients and it does calm down the redness and size of the zits as well as dry them out.  I have occasional breakouts and after I used this, it cleared them up in a few days.</li>
    <li> This has really cleared my face and works well as a spot treatment. My boyfriend isn&#x27;t fond of the smell, though.</li>
    <li> It does the job alright. The very small amount doesn&#x27;t last long but it works so I may purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this acne treatment and put it on a pimple that was large and painful.  The next day it was completely cleared up. I was surprised at how quickly it worked. I am going to purchase the full size product as soon as my sample runs out.    I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and the message that they send across.</li>
    <li> Hello! My name is Desire&#x27;, I have struggled and dispaired over my horibble acne problems! I&#x27;m 27 years old and cystic acne is hereditary in my family. I have been on the antibiotic bactrim for almost 10 yrs! I periodicly stop taking them to try something new to see if it will work but NOTHING would work, prescription or otherwise. I get cystic acne all over my body ( very depressing for a woman) I have to go to my dermatologist to get them cut out, I don&#x27;t wear shorts because of my scars I feel self conscious and have to go out in public with huge purple bruised cysts on my face because if I get them cut out my face would be noting but scars. Off chance a trend gave me some Burt&#x27;s bees spot treatment, I cried when I woke up and noticed what an effect it had. I can&#x27;t believe it! Iv gotten so desperate that I injected my cyst with peroxide and alcohol (believe me, that is exctreamly screamingly painful)but this stuff... Its a freaking MIRACLE! I got rid of all my other stuff and will never use anything again, I&#x27;m also emailing my dermatologist to get him to spread the word, even he didn&#x27;t think anything but antibiotics could help. Thank you guys so much!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and its a great thing to keep in my purse.  I use a lot of facial products so I&#x27;m not 100% sure if its only this that I can attribute the clearing of my face but its easy to dab on as a spot treatment and doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my skin</li>
    <li> I would like to preface this by saying that I don&#x27;t have frequent problems with acne, rather the occasional pms-induced pimples, however, that being said, this clears my acne right up. I use this whenever I feel a pimple coming in, or on the pesky buggers that come in overnight, and after a couple of days the pimple is gone/never comes up. And it&#x27;s all-natural which is a huge bonus. If you have bad acne, first make sure you are using a good moisturizer and are using a gentle facewash. If you&#x27;re still having issues, I would definitely give this a try. Just remember that clearing up a pimple won&#x27;t clear up potential problems that cause the acne. Also, when using this product make sure to stay away from your eyes. It&#x27;s very minty.</li>
    <li> This works great! It only takes a dab of product each time you wash your face and clears up acne in a matter of a day or two verses a week or more. Don&#x27;t let the tiny bottle size scare you away ~ I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a month now and have 3/4 of the bottle left. It doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest but that&#x27;s par for the course with natural products. I have very sensitive skin and have not had any skin reactions to Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and can&#x27;t go without it.  It takes down acne and irritation almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this. The only issue is that the bottle NEEDS a dropper. You have to tip the product out and that way a lot of it is wasted. It is mild but effective. slight sting on application but nothing terrible. It dries out spots without drying the WHOLE area on your face. You can put this on before make up and it will work on your problem area while you are up and about during the day. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> Sorry, I would not recommend this. I use a few other Burt&#x27;s Bees products and like them. I was looking for a more affordable alternative to Origins Super Spot Remover because the Origins is so expensive. But this is definitely not a product I can use, because: 1.) It smells horrible, like great-grandpa&#x27;s rheumatism elixir from the 1800s. Ugh! There is no way I would put even a drop of this on my face and leave the house. 2.) It&#x27;s a runny, watery liquid so doesn&#x27;t really stay where you put it but runs down your face. 3.) It&#x27;s only .75% salicylic acid so I doubt it would be very effective anyway. 4.) The bottle is poorly designed making it difficult to dispense a precise amount. Just wasted ten bucks. The Origins was only five bucks more and is a FAR superior product. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference. It burns slightly but doesn&#x27;t do much. I recommend Lush Grease Lightning product over this for overnight zit care.</li>
    <li> Very true to it&#x27;s usage. Smells very medicinal but vanishes quickly. Bought this at Walmart a couple of days ago. I first came on here to read the reviews before purchasing the product. I made up my mind I shall try it. Why not? To be honest, I am glad I did. I had a huge zit and I tapped a little drop of this onto the zit, and it has disappeared. All of my other incoming acne have also gone. I use it 2x\day. Morning and night after applying moisturizer. I have oily and combination skin. (:</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really reduce blemish size.  The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Honestly, once you go &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne&amp;#34; spot treatment, you will never go back. It&#x27;s great and really effective. I have really sensitive skin and also have rosacea and this is PERFECT for spot treatment. I will never use another product now that I have found this.</li>
    <li> i love this product very much ill used every day&lt;br /&gt; its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull&lt;br /&gt;its the best one ill try</li>
    <li> Tried all kinds of things. Just used this for 1-2 weeks, and the marks on my face reduced significantly, and I haven&#x27;t had much acne since. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again. (And I haven&#x27;t even used the whole bottle, and ended up not needing to!)</li>
    <li> Amazing, My chin was broken out, I put this on and its amazing, I will be using this every night every time i get acne Thanks</li>
    <li> I used this whole bottle up in less than a month, I must really like it or have lots of zits ha ha!  Actually I used it a lot at work if I felt a possible flare up coming and it calmed my skin right down.  It smells medicinal but I like that and  it goes on clear and the scent eventually fades or dissipates.  I have to order more but I&#x27;ve been buying too many things on Amazon to make this a priority.  Summer is coming which often means some break outs for me so I&#x27;m ordering this again. ;-)</li>
    <li> Purchased in November 2014, expiration date is May 2014.</li>
    <li> Ok for mild acne. I apply using a cotton bud. My children found it a bit stingy though. The bottle is quite small and finishes up pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Been using for 6+ months and works like a charm! Check out their acne toner as well! It&#x27;s legit!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It treats just the pimple without drying out my face. This product helps stop breakouts and reduces the size and redness of existing breakouts. This is a must have in my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> I just got this product i put it on my large pimple on my jaw line stay tune to see how it works!!!</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using drug-store bought Clearasil and the like for all of my years, and that stuff just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this.  Plus, Burt&#x27;s Bees is natural and awesome.  It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, but what acne treatment does?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but I have chronic acne.  I&#x27;m sure if your acne is sporadic and not bad it would work. Also I don&#x27;t like the way if comes out of the bottle, I feel it is a waste.</li>
    <li> I am African-american with acne prone skin when I eat too many sweet treats which leads to inflammation and thus acne.  Any time I have a blemish it leaves a dark mark commonly known as hyperpigmentation, so I suffer with the blemish and for months after with a dark spot.  I had been using Burt Bee&#x27;s herbal blemish stick and that it was ok but not the best.  I do like that the blemish stick is in a roller ball.  My local store was out of the blemish stick and I came across this and decided to give it a try &amp; I am glad I did.  I did not use this as a spot treatment. I used it on my entire face just as I did with the blemish stick.  After about 2 weeks I noticed no new blemishes, all old blemishes had reduced in size and disappeared and a LOT of my dark spots were getting lighter.  I noticed a slight peeling effect on the dark spots as the days went by and low and behold the spots would get lighter and lighter. Overall my skin feels smoother could it be due to the salicylic acid? I&#x27;m thinking that is the only difference in this product and the herbal blemish stick, this product has a higher concentration of willow bark (natural form of salicylic acid).  Only thing I dont like about this product is the bottle.  Using a cotton ball is a waste of the product so I just pour it in my had and rather quickly rub it on my face after cleansing.  I will continue to use this product.  I just did some research on willow bark and it is excellent for the skin.</li>
    <li> Great product for acne. I tend to be a picker :( when it comes to acne. After picking and squeezing, a drop of this works wonders. Reduces redness and puffiness.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very quickly on some zits, and kind of okay on others. But I think it works overall and I&#x27;m liking it. Smells a little bit like mosquito repellent though, which can get a little bleh on occasion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I&#x27;ve tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; spot treatments that I&#x27;d pretty much given up on them working but got desperate the other day so decided to pick this up.  I did not buy from this seller and so this is not a customer service review...only product.  I had started to develop 3 pretty good cysts on my neck and in 2 days the pain was gone and now in four they&#x27;re almost completely healed.  They never opened or anything.  this really stopped them in their tracks!  It has a licorice smell to it and I think that the fact that their salicylic acid comes from a natural source really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Love it! Works quickly and effectively.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great.</li>
    <li> They are not kidding though! It dries the skin like crazy! They have a warning on the box though so nothing unexpected!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, be careful. This product does work, but it left a big dark spot whenever I used it.</li>
    <li> At the beginning of 2013, I decided that I was going to try and go natural and clean up the beauty products I was using. In December, I was using LUSH products, which I thought were natural (turns out, most of them aren&#x27;t at all), and they worked for awhile but ended up making me break out after using them for a few weeks. During Christmas Break, I didn&#x27;t want to see anyone or take any pictures because I was that ashamed of my face. I have NEVER broken out so bad and it seemed like no matter what I did, nothing worked. I desperately searched for natural products and after stumbling upon a website called GoodGuide.com, I found this spot treatment by Burt&#x27;s Bees. This was highly rated on the site and, because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, I thought it was a great idea to start using it. I checked it out on Amazon and it was also highly reviewed-I was sold. I went to my local Wal-Mart and picked this baby up for about $10. I thought the price was a little steep for a spot treatment, I was used to paying about $5-6, but it was so highly rated and it had natural ingredients so I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this spot treatment in my daily face regime for about a month and I must say, my face has almost completely cleared up and I am so happy. Even scars that I had are almost completely gone. Burt&#x27;s Bees, you are the miracle worker I have been searching for! I love that this product works but that it is also natural. My other face products are natural as well and are highly rated on GoodGuide.com and I think that also has to do with my face clearing up as well (if you are interested in what else I use, look up my reviews for The Body Shop Aloe line face wash and lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I would suggest when using this product is to make sure that your hands are clean before applying to your face. I use my fingers to apply because I feel like putting the liquid on a cotton ball or Q-tip wastes product because it soaks it up. I make sure my hands are clean before using and I use different fingers to apply on different areas so I do not spread bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product. The smell is a little strong but I can get over that one negative because the product works for me. I definitely think it is a little pricey but, they sell a pack of 3 on Amazon and it is only $20 so definitely buying it on here in bulk is a much better price than just buying one at the store like I did. I am still on my first bottle of this and, because I use it multiple times a day and almost all over my face, it is about halfway gone. I think this one bottle will last me about 2-3 months and I am okay with that because of how well it works. I would highly recommend this to anyone who would like a natural spot treatment for their acne.ore using and I use different fingers to apply on different areas so I do not spread bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product.

    <li> This spot treatment works really well. It dries up problem blemishes overnight and noticeably reduces the surrounding redness. The fragrance is medicinal but wears off quickly. I swear by it--this is bottle number three.</li>
    <li> Great product I am happy to have stumbled upon years ago. This is a very small bottle, but it lasts for a long time. The bottle is designed well because it only allows a few drops to be shaken out at once. The formula is a little potent, but works like a charm. Plus it&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees so the ingredients are more natural than what you&#x27;ll find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> First: I&#x27;m Asian, middle-aged and pre-menopausal so my skin is having its ups and downs. Acne medications normally over dry my skin and irritate it; I do consider myself to have sensitive skin with an oilier forehead and nose area and tight and dry skin elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;This acne treatment can sting on broken skin or if applied too often. It does work but I don&#x27;t think faster than other products. It has not over dried my skin. It does not make a painful starting pimple disappear overnight but seems to keep it from becoming larger and more painful.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like sweet licorice to me, which I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;A cotton swab applicator is necessary to prevent a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;This is a few weeks later of using this as directed. Applying twice a day seems too much on my skin now. The liquid spreads out farther than anticipated and has resulted in itchy patches of dry, flaking skin, despite my not having used it for about a week now. I think application must be more precise and less frequent; I don&#x27;t think this is an allergic reaction but a reaction of my particular skin. I probably will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second update: I believe the initial problem was I was using a weak tea tree oil/water as a toner beforehand. I stopped using everything until my skin returned to normal, have started again with a weak apple cider vinegar toner and this product but maybe only once a day. This seems to work for now.</li>
    <li> My brother and sister used to have samples of this when i was a teen and it&#x27;d be the only thing that worked for me.! And it still is today.! I absolutely love everything about it....besides the smell. The other review about the smell being overwhelming at work and places (and everywhere but especially places you don&#x27;t want it to be) was correct. But because it works so well for me, I can deal with smelling like pinewood for a few mins to an hr. My only issue besides the smell is that it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; treatment but once you try to get just a drop out, out comes alot more than you wanted. So if you&#x27;re not careful this $9 little jar can be gone in about a week. What I do is turn it upside down very quickly to get just a drop for a spot.</li>
    <li> Nice, although a little strong smelling!  I would say that a little goes a long way, because the smell of tea tree oil can be overwhelming!</li>
    <li> The application is not that difficult. It is like tea tree oil.. Just pour the bottle upside down with a clean finger over the top and dab some on your face. It helps to decrease the inflammation of acne. I tried some on a pimple and it is drying it out. It smells like tea tree oil and licorice and stings a bit. I feel like it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
    <li> Problem is i forget to use it.  my problem.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products and very easy to use, is a natural</li>
    <li> Works well. Stings a bit/dries out my skin sometimes.</li>
    <li> The only thing that takes away those random pesky pimples. Plus it&#x27;s all natural and works overnight!</li>
    <li> Best stuff out there for acne spot treatment. It makes my blemishes go away in half the time, if not the next day. Also good to prevent acne. If you feel a blemish coming in, use it at night and in the morning you will see that nothing broke out. This is a must in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is a product you will want to put on auto-ship.  This did exactly what I wanted it to do.  It wasn&#x27;t too strong or painful and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes great products and this is one of my favorites in their line of face care.  It zaps pimples and gets rid of them before they get out of control.  Who wants pimples... not me!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that seems to work for me. Takes the redness away from blemishes &amp; sometimes even clears them by the next day. Love this stuff! My only complaint is I wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this liquid form  .  Just wish it came as 2% instead of .75%  Overall fabulous</li>
    <li> This stuff works great as a spot treatment for breakouts.  Just a little on the end of a q-tip goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This works so well. I had a MASSIVE red, swollen, painful zit on my forehead and it was gone in less than 24 hours. Works so much better than those harsh chemical products. And it smells good!</li>
    <li> I love this brand and their products!</li>
    <li> I keep forgetting that I don&#x27;t like this product, but I never remember until after I have bought it.  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dispenses weird, so I usually get too much or not enough product.  I sometimes like to mix a little acne cream in with the lotion I put on at night, and this product does not work well that way.  I think it generally doesn&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use it, and apply it anywhere near your nose, I hope you like the smell of anise.</li>
    <li> This is the best acne med I have found. Within hours the zit is noticeably smaller or gone. The liquid spot treatment is the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> Adolescence, it is really nice, my son began to have Acne on the face, in the evening I give he spent Burt &#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Targeted Spot Treatment. 0.26 Fluid Ounces, Acne began to disappear the next day, very useful.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter swears by this! She uses it when needed and puts it nightly on her nose as it helps prevent blackheads too...</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job, but different packaging would be helpful.  I have to use q-tips to keep this from going everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great product, it dried up my pimples in just 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> Great for removing dead skin and revealing deeper layers. Will take a month or so to give best results but acne has cleared. Use for maintenance once a week now with non alcohol toner.</li>
    <li> Great at zapping isolated spots. If I applied at night and woke up spot-free in the morning, then that would deserve 5 stars! I do see a difference using it than without.</li>
    <li> Great product and even better price! The Burt&#x27;s Bees line of acne care is wonderful. The only down side was the smell, it took a little bit to get used to it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the immediate results I saw after just one use of this product. Rarely do you find that!! It works just as stated and I could feel a bit of a sting as I used it which was fine for me. I&#x27;ve used many acne products and this is the only one that gave immediate and consistent results! The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for this product was the price---it seemed very pricey for the size and hence the four stars.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, just a waste of time.</li>
    <li> This is an un-refundable item, so think twice before you purchase. Overall, this product does not work.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective spot treatment and is mild enough to use on sensitive skin.  My skin is very sensitive and I am able to use this spot treatment morning and night without any ill effects.  Within one day it helps to reduce the inflammation and redness of acne.  I let my sister use it and she was so impressed she bought some of her own.  I really appreciate that the salicylic acid in this product comes from willow bark. However I am an even bigger fan of some of the &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredients, especially calendula oil.  Calendula flowers have natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.  This herb also stimulates the production of collagen which minimizes scarring and helps to brighten skin.  Basically its perfect for acne. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments and I will do my best to answer them based on my experience.</li>
    <li> Good product. I did notice a slight improvement with acne scars slowly dissapearing. Stopped using it for awhile but I do think it helps in the long run.</li>
