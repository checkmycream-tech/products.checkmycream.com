    <li> Great product for strengthening hair</li>
    <li> excellen, have used for years!</li>
    <li> This product arrived with a piece of tape over the spray nozzle to protect the bottle from leaking. Great purchase!</li>

    <li> This stuff is really amazing, smells wonderful and you simply can&#x27;t use too much of it!

    <li> I use it as a detangler and it works for that nicely.</li>
    <li> must have for hair. use after showering as a detangler and before blowdrying to minimize breakage damage and heat damage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aveda junkie and have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> I hope the product works as described.  I bought it primarily for UV protection.  So far so good but the scent is not to my liking.  I can&#x27;t describe it but to me it&#x27;s a mix between men&#x27;s BO and a musky cologne to cover it up.</li>
    <li> I love alot of Aveda products and this is one of them. It lightly conditions my hair on the days when I only need light coverage. It also smells great! I spray it on right after I towel dry my hair and then blow dry. This is my 4th bottle.</li>

    <li> Really helps prevent lots of damage to my hair&lt;br /&gt;since I blow it dry every day.  I love the Aveda&lt;br /&gt;products.  i think they are pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Good job speeding a very good product to me.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Before I write my review, I just want to point at that, as of this writing, this product can be purchased at an Aveda store or salon for $18.95.  I have no idea where they came up with the pricing on this, but the current pricing of $25.99 is ridiculous, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t retail for $83.99.&lt;br /&gt;That being said; I color my hair every 6 weeks and have quite a few gray hairs.  I try not to over wash my hair, but there are still the effects of the sun, and blow drying to contend with. The damage control spray does a great job of protecting my hair from color fade, and helps to maintain the color between coloring times.</li>
    <li> Works really well for blow-drying on 4c natural hair.</li>
