    <li> Clean scent with a hint of citrus undertone.  Not overpowering and lasts throughout the day.  I like it best during Spring and Summer.  I like using it when I&#x27;m feeling blue in the winter months and need a little cheering up and reminder that warmer months are just around the corner.</li>
    <li> Ok this perfume is heaven!  I love the scent and have ordered it twice.  The second time I was lucky enough that not only did the price go down but instead of just the perfume bottle they send a whole gift package with the lotion, bath oil and spray.  Wow, nice!!  Guess it&#x27;s the luck of the draw what you get.</li>
    <li> While I thought I was purchasing two, single 3.4-ounce bottles of perfume, what arrived was two, 4-piece gift sets.  These included,  in additon  to the 3.4-ounce spray, a travel sized spray bottle, a purse-size bottle and a tube of shimmering body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no mention of all these \\&quot;extras\\&quot; in the item description, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with what arrived.</li>
    <li> Love it, great fast service!</li>
    <li> I love the perfume. It was exactly what I expected and what I have bought in a department store for a much higher price. However this perfume is not available in stores now.</li>

    <li> Smells perfect for summer. I love it. I bought it blindly without ever having smelled it before and thankfully, I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Very beachy, slight citrus, a little masculine scent; yet still appropriate for a woman to wear :]&lt;br /&gt;very happy with it!</li>

    <li> this product is such a sexy bottle and smells lovely for your woman kuddo&#x27;s to you Tommy Bahama for women....</li>
    <li> I received my Tommy in the mail in the time expected and was absolutely delighted. I discovered Tommy Bahama about three years ago at an after Christmas clearance and bought it on a whim and fell in love. Once I ran out I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store and decided to just try and find it on Amazon. MMMMM YUM... Love that scent.</li>
    <li> The sprayer won&#x27;t spray. Took off old one no biggie</li>

    <li> This has become one of my favorite fragnances and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Well...it was not the product I ordered!  It was actually just Tommy Bahama St. Bart&#x27;s, which is a different fragrance.  I liked it, so I kept it, but only because I knew it would have been a pain to try and return it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance of perfume. I was looking everywhere for it in stores but I eventually found out that it was discontinued. I was able to find it on here and I was so happy!!!</li>

    <li> I fell in love with this fragrance while working at a department store and was so disappointed when they discontinued it. I was happy to find it here at half the cost. It&#x27;s a great summer fragrance. Very light and citrusy</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites! I&#x27;m just so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give this perfume away! Beautiful scent, fresh and light. The designer bottle is pretty and would have looked great on my dresser. I hope my friend appreciates it. She thought I spent a lot of money for this. It is NOT a knockoff either.</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s not overpowering and settles with a lemon undertone... It makes me think of beaches and fun in the sun!</li>
    <li> i loooove this cologne. it smells great, its strong, it lasts. such a different scent. really appreciate being able to purchase it here for such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> This scent is wonderful!!! Don&#x27;t want to tell you to buy it because I don&#x27;t want a whole lot of women smelling the same kind of wonderful like me. Hehehe:)</li>
    <li> I had bought a bottle of Tommy Bahama in the stores a few years ago. I ran out of it and tried to get another bottle. I could no longer find it. Then I saw it at Amazon.com. It is great. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a very light feminine fragrance. It can be worn for any occasion. A little lasts all day. I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular perfume for 6 years now. I absolutely love it. However this last time I ordered it I believe I was sent a fake. The cap is not the same style in years past  nor does the bottle have the name written on it. In fact no where on the bottle or the sticker on the bottom makes any reference to Tommy Bahama brand or the name of the fragrance. The sent is not bad but definitely not the original. Shipping was fast. Just REALLY disappointed it&#x27;s not what it was suppose to be.</li>
    <li> The product was not correct. It was supposed to be Set Sail St. Bart&#x27;s. It was just St. Bart&#x27;s. I was very disappointed. This was the second time that I tried to purchase this product. I had to keep the first one because I didn&#x27;t have the box anymore to return it</li>
    <li> Given as a gift and my daughter loved it.</li>
