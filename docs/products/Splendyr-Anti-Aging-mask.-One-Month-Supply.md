      <li>Ok -- here goes.  </li>
      <li>Splendyr mask is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used to look younger</li>
      <li>Glad I found this</li>
      <li>I paid $4 for shipping and I was never directed to click on a terms and conditions box or agree to replenishments, so i felt okay ordering.</li>
      <li>I love how my face feels and looks...</li>
      <li>First off I am not at all impressed with this product and secondly they will charge your account $89.00 if you send for the free trial!!</li>
      <li>The mask is easy to use and you can feel the tightening and see the results when you wash it off.  </li>
      <li>Appears to work well , but way too expensive.i also don&#x27;t like to be forced into a bill every month by splendyr.was happy with amazon.not happy with splendyr.when</li>
      <li>have found this company to be dedicated to customer service, taking a sincere interest in their product, and more than willing to answer questions about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What a great facial maske.</li>
      <li>I ordered a free trial of this face cream because the company lied and said they were endorsed buy Dr. Oz.</li>
      <li>I ordered the free trial and paid for shipping.</li>
      <li>Did the free trial offer for Splendyr/Levela.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting a free trial size of each</li>
      <li>After writing a review, a gentleman from the company emailed me and kindly straightened it out and had my credit card reimbursed, for which I was very thankful.</li>
      <li>I had gotten the free trials of Splenryr and Levela, and was sent three bottles of Levela after that in which my credit card was charged each month for something I had not ordered.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>This is a credit card nightmare, someone getting rich on scam deals.</li>
      <li>It has faded significantly.</li>
      <li>It was NOT a trial, IT WAS THE FULL PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>This is an easy product to use, and I saw improvements after the first treatment.</li>
      <li>Not one strand of hair is in a different place 14 days later -- supposedly when they took another picture showing the GREAT results!  </li>
      <li>I recommend healthy food and relax live stile  </li>
      <li>It is a little pricey but the results are great..</li>
      <li>Not crazy about how they handle the Advertising</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, it left my face smooth and soft, and faded discolorations after the 2nd use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>again, if it is your goal to completely erase the life you&#x27;ve led from your face, perhaps seeing a Plastic surgeon would be better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what happens next.</li>
      <li>When I applied water, it came right off.  </li>
      <li>It looks like right after I use it</li>
      <li>These positive comments are made up stories!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s best as you age, with smaller pores, smoother texture, less noticeable wrinkles, and glowing complexion, you have found your product.</li>
      <li>I very much appreciate his concern and promised to alter my review.</li>
      <li>Well, they aren&#x27;t endorsed by Dr. Oz first of all.</li>
      <li>My face felt clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I promise you, all these positive comments on the product are also a scam, people are paid to write these reviews.</li>
      <li>Get smart people.</li>
      <li>I have very high hopes for these 2 products.</li>
      <li>After using the product for only two weeks, there was a huge difference in my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This shows me their are companys that really do care what the customer thinks.</li>
      <li>It really softens and brightens the skin.</li>
      <li>However, the directions for use are very misleading.</li>
      <li>a representative of the company contacted my email the day after I posted my review and was very helpful in getting me a refund citing a 100% customer satisfaction policy.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Splendyr for caring.</li>
      <li>I used every third day and have fabulous results...</li>
      <li>Too much fuss no results.</li>
      <li>When I first mixed the Splendry, it seemed \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, but when I applied it on my face, it was smooth and covered my entire face and neck.  </li>
      <li>After the first application a layer from a dark spot by&lt;br /&gt;my eye peeled right off!</li>
      <li>my skin is tighter, but then it goes right back to the way it was.  </li>
      <li>I will buy the next round from Amazon, as I&#x27;m sure the manufacturer would be much higher.</li>
      <li>However, when I contacted support, they were extremely helpful and told me I could get a refund for the free trial along with the auto shipment that I did not want.  </li>
      <li>but you&#x27;d get the same result after any &#x27;at home&#x27;  microdermabrasion or even light, over the counter facial scrub for $5.</li>
      <li>I have to say I was VERY surprised by the results.</li>
      <li>The product itself I had kow problems with, it made my skin feel very soft and plenty of product.</li>
      <li>I still think that buyers need to be aware of the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; in offers such as this and be suspicious of \\&quot;free\\&quot; offers - very few things are really free when you get down to</li>
      <li>It was not made clear that I would have to cancel my order after 15 days and the email they sent confirming my order did not say anything either.</li>
      <li>As far as price, You do have to call after you receive the product.</li>
      <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the reviews that I read prior, I think that their level of service must have really improved.  </li>
      <li>so much I am surprised</li>
      <li>thanks has been different</li>
      <li>My face is so soft.  </li>
      <li>Skin was extremely soft after treatment.</li>
      <li>It says use one light packet and one dark packet, but all the packets are white.</li>
      <li>company was very responsive once I got past the first level of customer service</li>
      <li>Plain and simple, it didn&#x27;t do a thing but clean my face.</li>
      <li>and I think they complement each other very well.  </li>
      <li>After one use, my skin is all reddish and sensitive and my skin in general is not sensitive type.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> /&gt;Having said that, I have been using this product for over a month, and have noticed significant improvements in my overall (40&#x27;s) skin tone, smoothness as well as a big improvement in balancing the oily areas (making them less so) and dry areas (making them also less so).</li>
<li> It dried quickly and was very tight.  </li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Not what I expected ..I have only used once ....did not realize product was a mask ...</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice any other changes, will purchase again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!  After using the product for only two weeks, there was a huge difference in my skin tone.  It continues to improve with each use.  It has also helped with the dark circles under my eyes.  I use both the Splendry and Levela together and I think they complement each other very well.  When I first mixed the Splendry, it seemed \\&quot;foamy\\&quot;, but when I applied it on my face, it was smooth and covered my entire face and neck.  There was plenty of product.  It dried quickly and was very tight.  Because it was so tight, I was worried it would be hard to wash off.  It wasn&#x27;t at all.  When I applied water, it came right off.  My face felt clean and soft.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what happens next.</li>
    <li> I just received mine the other day, along with Levela. I bought it from the online offer for a trial. I was very skeptical, but I try everything. I have to say I was VERY surprised by the results. I have had a brown spot on my cheek for many years. I have tried photo facials, regular facials and skin products from plastic surgeons offices and none changed it. I used this once and most of it is gone. It has faded significantly. I have very high hopes for these 2 products. I will buy the next round from Amazon, as I&#x27;m sure the manufacturer would be much higher. Give it a shot! I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review on how I was treated trying to cancell this product. I have since received a phone call from the company&#x27;s head rep., he more than apolized for the way I was treated,I want to thank him and his company. This shows me their are companys that really do care what the customer thinks. The product itself I had kow problems with, it made my skin feel very soft and plenty of product. Thanks again Splendyr for caring.</li>
    <li> It said a month supplies but it was not.</li>
    <li> I did not see any change in my skin at all, I would not recommend to buy it at all...</li>
    <li> Love it. It is a little pricey but the results are great..my skin feels softer. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice any other changes, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!! These positive comments are made up stories! Read every detail before you pay. First off I am not at all impressed with this product and secondly they will charge your account $89.00 if you send for the free trial!!</li>
    <li> its very good! I used every third day and have fabulous results... thanks has been different so much I am surprised</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. \\&quot;that&#x27; kind of money. Sure, skin feels great right after application but you&#x27;d get the same result after any &#x27;at home&#x27;  microdermabrasion or even light, over the counter facial scrub for $5. Too much fuss no results.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUT IT I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANY BODY HAPPENED THE SAMETHING TO ME I8NH MY BANK ACCOUNT AND THE PRODUCT NOT GOOD.</li>
    <li> I ordered a free trial of this face cream because the company lied and said they were endorsed buy Dr. Oz. Well, they aren&#x27;t endorsed by Dr. Oz first of all. I paid $4 for shipping and I was never directed to click on a terms and conditions box or agree to replenishments, so i felt okay ordering. well, as soon as i found out this product wasn&#x27;t affiliated with Dr. Oz, I returned the unopened package priority. Later to see not one but two charges for $89 on my account.  I promise you, all these positive comments on the product are also a scam, people are paid to write these reviews. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The mask is easy to use and you can feel the tightening and see the results when you wash it off.  Glad I found this</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a product on the market that can make any of us look like we&#x27;re in our 20&#x27;s again (without plastic surgery...), so before you think that you can turn back your poor diet choices, sun exposure, smoking, drinking and toxic environmental exposure, please check those expectations at the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I have been using this product for over a month, and have noticed significant improvements in my overall (40&#x27;s) skin tone, smoothness as well as a big improvement in balancing the oily areas (making them less so) and dry areas (making them also less so). I have ordered directly from Amazon, because I&#x27;m wary of &amp;#34;free trials,&amp;#34; which usually mean anything but.  This is an easy product to use, and I saw improvements after the first treatment. It does have a bit of an odor, but is earthy and not at all off-putting (and I&#x27;m admittedly picky about how things smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this company to be dedicated to customer service, taking a sincere interest in their product, and more than willing to answer questions about anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, if it is your goal to completely erase the life you&#x27;ve led from your face, perhaps seeing a Plastic surgeon would be better. However, if you would like to keep your face looking it&#x27;s best as you age, with smaller pores, smoother texture, less noticeable wrinkles, and glowing complexion, you have found your product.</li>
    <li> Update: a representative of the company contacted my email the day after I posted my review and was very helpful in getting me a refund citing a 100% customer satisfaction policy. I very much appreciate his concern and promised to alter my review. I still think that buyers need to be aware of the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; in offers such as this and be suspicious of \\&quot;free\\&quot; offers - very few things are really free when you get down to it.&lt;br /&gt;The company was very responsive once I got past the first level of customer service so if you have a problem ask to speak to a supervisor and don&#x27;t take no for an answer.&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;Shame on me for falling for this scam. Did the free trial offer for Splendyr/Levela. It was not made clear that I would have to cancel my order after 15 days and the email they sent confirming my order did not say anything either. Also no contact info was provided with the shipment state this. I thought I was getting a free trial size of each and then could decide to reorder or not. Turns out that there is a nother page you need to click called terms and conditions that you are not directed to but have to find on your own. So I got the product, used it with no obvious results and didn&#x27;t think another thing about it until I got a charge for $69.00 for EACH product on my credit card. NOw they refuse to give me my money back and I can&#x27;t even get a supervisor to talk to me when I called the company. Still waiting to hear back but don&#x27;t expect to get anything back  or even hear back based on my conversation with the sales rep.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it made my skin feel, and even  gave  my daughter-in-law a box for her to try.&lt;br /&gt;Was delighted I could order it through you. I love the bargains I get through your site.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected ..I have only used once ....did not realize product was a mask ...we looking more of a washing soap for face</li>
    <li> I like it, I have used it 3x now and my skin feels softer and clearer. As far as price, You do have to call after you receive the product. If not it says they will charge you. On the other hand when I called they offered me $33.97 a month for each product.(Levela) If you use the product 2 times a week your 10 pack is a months supply. Not crazy about how they handle the Advertising but I am going to try another months sample before I decide to cancel because I can see a difference in my skin after 3 applications. I am not a person who was paid for this review!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Each dose is plentiful, so I use it for my neck and forearms.  After the first application a layer from a dark spot by&lt;br /&gt;my eye peeled right off!</li>
    <li> Actually able to get two applications out of one pouch of product. Skin was extremely soft after treatment. Good product!</li>
    <li> Did tighten skin, somwhat. The odor is not pleasant, also smell lingers on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;Used in smaller application to reduce waste!!</li>
    <li> I just received this product - have not tried it yet. However, the directions for use are very misleading. It says use one light packet and one dark packet, but all the packets are white. It took me a while to figure out the packages are marked 1 and 2 - no light and dark pakets. Also, it is advertised as a 30 day supply, yet I only received ten packets of each. This not a 30 day supply.</li>
    <li> No difference at all!</li>
    <li> It looks like right after I use it my skin is tighter, but then it goes right back to the way it was.  It does make my skin feel softer after I use it though.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting any miracles, but this is really amazing stuff.  My face is so soft.  I will purchase this again.  I love how my face feels and looks...I have even recommended it to relatives.</li>
    <li> messy, waste of money, i feel stupid for falling for this, did nothing</li>
    <li> I have used this product &amp; love the way it makes my skin look &amp; feel!!!</li>
    <li> There is a sucker born every minute</li>
    <li> I ordered the free trial and paid for shipping. I got the product and tried it. Then I notice on my credit card a charge for 89.95 WHAT? There were never any Terms and Conditions to agree to. It was NOT a trial, IT WAS THE FULL PRODUCT. Then they sent me another one, and a charge.&lt;br /&gt;According to them, there are &amp;#34;terms and conditions&amp;#34; you agree to, but there were NOT.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any results from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion - DON&#x27;T order this product. It is credit card charge hell.</li>
    <li> This mask is very liquid, I had great difficulties to put it on my face. Also, the odor is just very, very unpleasant. After one use, my skin is all reddish and sensitive and my skin in general is not sensitive type.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return this tomorrow and I hope I can get my money back. I try not to be harsh to sellers, but I just think that this mask is really no good at all.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT AND I LOVE IT . I LET MY FRIEND USE IT TO I SHARED A PACKET WITH HER BECAUSE SHE HAS REALLY DEEP WRINKLES AND IT MADE HER LOOK 10 YEARS YOUNGER, EVERYONE NOTICED HER FACE..IT ALWAYS MAKES MY FACE LOOK AND FEEL GREAT,HELPS MY WRINKLES TOO. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.. CANT SAY IT ENOUGHT..I WOULD BUY IT BY THE GALLON IF I COULD AFFORD IT..</li>
    <li> I cannot speak about the product because I have not had a chance to try it.  However, when I contacted support, they were extremely helpful and told me I could get a refund for the free trial along with the auto shipment that I did not want.  As a follow-up, Mr. Gary Livingston called me and also told me I could get a care-free refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the reviews that I read prior, I think that their level of service must have really improved.  I think it&#x27;s great that a company can listen to customers and make the necesssary changes to provide superior service.  I would happily buy from them again as long as they are this great with customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo,&lt;br /&gt;Jessica</li>
    <li> What a great facial maske. It really softens and brightens the skin. I will continue to purchase this product..I would like to order another supply.</li>
    <li> Just to warn people not to fall for this scam. I have had 3 charges of $89.95 on my bank card with nothing to show I bought. I returned the 2 packages I received as I didn&#x27;t order them. This is a credit card nightmare, someone getting rich on scam deals.</li>
    <li> Si not what they say , I don&#x27;t see result&lt;br /&gt; I recommend healthy food and relax live stile  , don&#x27;t spend money on this</li>
    <li> Ok -- here goes.  Have you looked closely at the pics of the blonde who supposed used this product?  It has to be photoshopped.  Not one strand of hair is in a different place 14 days later -- supposedly when they took another picture showing the GREAT results!  Get smart people.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to state that the company reimbursed me for three $89 bottles of Levela. I had gotten the free trials of Splenryr and Levela, and was sent three bottles of Levela after that in which my credit card was charged each month for something I had not ordered. After writing a review, a gentleman from the company emailed me and kindly straightened it out and had my credit card reimbursed, for which I was very thankful.</li>
    <li> Splendyr mask is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used to look younger&lt;br /&gt;and more refreshed. Deep wrinkles dissapear for a couple of days and&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I look a few years younger for a while...I have seen great results.&lt;br /&gt;Only ten minutes in the moring and you look great. I have found nothing&lt;br /&gt;else that works as well...</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it didn&#x27;t do a thing but clean my face. No improvement at all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, it left my face smooth and soft, and faded discolorations after the 2nd use.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Appears to work well , but way too expensive.i also don&#x27;t like to be forced into a bill every month by splendyr.was happy with amazon.not happy with splendyr.when you can buy with no strings attached I might use again , otherwise no way.</li>
