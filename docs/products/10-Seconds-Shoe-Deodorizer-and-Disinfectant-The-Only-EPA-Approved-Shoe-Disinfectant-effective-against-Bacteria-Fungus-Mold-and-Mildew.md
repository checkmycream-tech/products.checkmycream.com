      <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to have sweet smelling feet!</li>

      <li>It really keeps your shoes fresh and kills any bacteria… Also I love the smell, it smells exactly like baby aspirin or orange push-ups love it!.</li>
      <li>i know right!</li>
      <li>Does a very good job of deodorizing footwear without a harsh smell.</li>
      <li>A quick shot of spray in each shoe before I slide my shoes into the bag, keeps them smelling citrus fresh!</li>
      <li>You should know before buying that this stuff seems pretty toxic (the health warnings are intense) AND Amazon won&#x27;t let you return the product (the site says it is because the product is a hazardous material).</li>
      <li>Better to get an odor absorbing insole, and some foot powder.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a shoe disinfectant in the store and amazon luckily carried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve considered to be worthy of reviewing -- it is really great.  </li>
      <li>The orange scent isn&#x27;t the most masculine, but after drying overnight (as recommended in the instructions) there is just a hint of a fresh scent in the morning.</li>
      <li>Harmful if absorbed through skin.</li>
      <li>but so far it&#x27;s been doing ok for my rock climbing shoes.</li>

      <li>Spray Right Guard Antiperspirant Spray, Which I spray my feet each morning, before I put on my socks&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;1.Gets rid of ALL my shoe stench, which is something NO other brand has been able to do.&lt;br /&gt;2.No</li>
      <li>stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>I will likely buy more when this can runs out.</li>

      <li>it cleans the shoe and carpet pretty well, I don&#x27;t have to use it too often either</li>
      <li>This actually works, I​ even bought two more bottles for the gym shoes</li>
      <li>My two issues were the size and how much it reminded me of another product I love by Sof Sole, the Fresh Fogger.  </li>
      <li>- I&#x27;m definitely getting more of this spray.</li>
      <li>They had started to get pretty funky, which is why I bought the spray.</li>
      <li>I only apply to shoes outside in good ventilation.</li>
      <li>I had athlete&#x27;s foot and its pretty much gone now.</li>
      <li>I use to throw away my shoes easily within a year, but by using 10-Seconds, I wear the shoes until the sole falls off!  </li>
      <li>It seems to irritate some people and I used in bathroom once and decided to use outside to avoid pets and children from being exposed as this does contain some strong chemicals.</li>
      <li>I was looking for the exact kind used by bowling alleys/skate rental places, and this appears to be the same stuff, just in a slightly smaller, non-industrial can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
      <li>I really dislike this product.  </li>
      <li>I T REALLY GET RID OF ALL ODERS FROM ANY SHOE</li>
      <li>I have had a real issue with smelly shoes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You can do sterilize 2 possibly 3 pairs of adult size 12 shoes with one can when using it according to the instructions.  Not the best value I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> hard to tell exactly how well it works but so far it&#x27;s been doing ok for my rock climbing shoes.</li>
    <li> This spray i use on my elbow brace sleeves and my shoes.. keeps them disinfected and smells very refreshing.I will be ordering this alot.</li>
    <li> It works but only for a few days then you have to spray it again. Butbit smells good</li>
    <li> Works very well, completely eliminates foot odor. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to have sweet smelling feet! I never spray for 10 seconds, and it still eliminates odor. There&#x27;s no reason to, plus it uses it up faster. I spray each shoe for maybe like 3 or 4 seconds. Well, maybe 10 seconds would keep odor away longer, but with 3 or 4 seconds, it works for a week or so.</li>
    <li> it cleans the shoe and carpet pretty well, I don&#x27;t have to use it too often either</li>
    <li> Keeps my shoes dry and pleasant-smelling</li>
    <li> This is truely the best product out there &#x3D;) It has a very light hint of orange-citrus smell when sprayed. It deodorizes my gym shoes and lasts for a couple of days.  My gym shoes are always stored in my gym bag and can really start to smell.  I needed a powerful spray deodorizer that works to eliminate the gym bag smell. I tried several different shoe odor products.  I find, that if I spray my shoes once a week with this product, there is little or no odor at all. I saw this product being used at the local bowling alley and ordered a can here on Amazon.  I am very happy and satisfied with the results.  A quick shot of spray in each shoe before I slide my shoes into the bag, keeps them smelling citrus fresh!</li>
    <li> only lasts for a couple of days or less if you actually wear the shoes</li>
    <li> This stuff not only works but IT SMELLS LIKE JELLY BEANS! I love this!</li>
    <li> the only brand I use for deodorizing shoes and costumes</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there. I am deployed to Afghanistan and hygiene is a constant concern. There are other shoe sprays that deoderize, but this spray actually cleans and disinfects, too. It&#x27;s the best stuff I have ever used for keeping my shoes clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mostly ethanol, but this works pretty well to deodorize!  It must be the other components in the bottle that make it work well as it does.</li>
    <li> It truly works! Sprayed this product on/in the shoe that had the odor and it&#x27;s gone just like that!</li>
    <li> I was looking for the exact kind used by bowling alleys/skate rental places, and this appears to be the same stuff, just in a slightly smaller, non-industrial can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1.Gets rid of ALL my shoe stench, which is something NO other brand has been able to do.&lt;br /&gt;2.No lingering smell, which is another big problem with every other brand I&#x27;ve tried. This smell is almost entirely gone after airing shoes for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.Probably very toxic, so I make sure and use it outside, allowing the shoes to dry off safely.&lt;br /&gt;2.Expensive. Really wish the can was BIG, but again, this stuff works where nothing else will, so I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This actually works, I​ even bought two more bottles for the gym shoes</li>
    <li> Makes me want to go bowling.  What can I say?  Seems to work, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, plenty of sprays per can . . . I like it.</li>
    <li> Being from Florida, I normally wear Deck Shoes with no socks. After a month of wear the shoes begin to stink so bad that I could barely stand to wear them and when I take them off my wife makes me put them out on our lanai. Deck shoes aren&#x27;t cheap and it&#x27;d be a shame to pitch them because of odor. Well, I tried several different shoe odor remedies and discovered that if I treated my shoes once a week, with this product, there was little or no odor at all. Now I can keep my boat shoes in the closet instead of outdoors.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Does a very good job of deodorizing footwear without a harsh smell. Just wished it came in a larger size as it gets used daily.</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the time frame specified.  This product exceeded my expectations... It really works very well on any of my shoes.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better and smells as good!</li>
    <li> Shoes got really smelly after getting soaked in a rainstorm.  I had to use the spray three separate times to get the smell off, but look like the spray did the trick.  Should probably use this product outdoors to prevent inhaling.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I used to be able to smell my way to the closet. Not anymore :-). It maintains the shoe inside out as it gets rid of bacteria that contributes to shoe disintegration. No powdery residue, no irritating scent, no discoloration. I used it with every shoe in my closet. Perfect element of everyday shoe hygiene.</li>
    <li> Best product to kill MSRP. Keeps your shoes from getting that nasty sneaker smell. Nothing else seems to work as well as 10 Seconds.</li>
    <li> works very well and has a nice scent.  use it on tennis sneakers  and am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Nice product with refreshing scent. Not quite the bang for buck for what it does. This would get expensive with regular use. I get why people like it, just less expensive and effective options out there ... To me that is.</li>
    <li> I sprayed it on the insides of all my leather and running shoes to hopefully disinfect them. I cannot speak for it&#x27;s effectiveness but I do feel good in using the product for it&#x27;s intended use. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I still smell a Odor afterwords and that is why I gave it a two star.  I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> You know how you go to a bowling alley and when ever you hand the guy at the counter back your bowling shes the sprays the shoes with that can of what ever, well here&#x27;s the can!  I mean you could have been handed the wrong size and you tell the guy and he still sprays the hell out of it like you have some disease!  This is the spray! LOL i know right!</li>
    <li> Much smaller can than I had thought.  For me it doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job but my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really keeps your shoes fresh and kills any bacteria… Also I love the smell, it smells exactly like baby aspirin or orange push-ups love it!. My only issue is that the price seems to fluctuate very widely and I can&#x27;t seem to find it on Amazon only other sellers</li>
    <li> Got here on time or early. Nice scent and keeps shoes fresh.</li>
    <li> This spray worked brilliantly to deodorize my combat boots as they were getting pretty disgusting and it was hard to put them on they smelled so bad and I knew I needed to make a purchase of something like this.  One spray and they&#x27;re like new again, with a citrus-y smell as well and I feel okay wearing my boots again.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of dealing treating even the most smelliest sneakers/sports shoes after use.  It neutralizes the odor as stated and leaves a more pleasant smell.  The only reservation I have is the price: it is very pricy but I have not found any other product that does the job as efficiently....</li>
    <li> This shoe spray is the best!  I use to throw away my shoes easily within a year, but by using 10-Seconds, I wear the shoes until the sole falls off!  Great product!  I only wish they made it in a bigger can.</li>
    <li> Potent and seems to help with deodorizing shoes. I didn&#x27;t have a fungus problem but shoes that I wear a custom orthotic or not for an old injury seems to have developed an odor while the other foot and shoes has not. I&#x27;m guessing something to do with the breakdown of materials in some of the ortho products leading to perhaps a bacterial or some kind of organic problem. Either way this did help. I only apply to shoes outside in good ventilation. It seems to irritate some people and I used in bathroom once and decided to use outside to avoid pets and children from being exposed as this does contain some strong chemicals. Since some volital gases are bound to float around the room and settle down to floor level I don&#x27;t want to worry about our pets either.</li>
    <li> I use this in my cycling shoes after each ride. They had started to get pretty funky, which is why I bought the spray. I have no idea if they are actually disinfecting, but after about three uses I started noticing my shoes aren&#x27;t nearly as gross as they used to be. I will likely buy more when this can runs out.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- great smell&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;- does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Bought this to prevent my running shoes from getting all funkafied from my workouts. Two sprays and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve considered to be worthy of reviewing -- it is really great.  A bit expensive, but with spraying my shoes and sandals after every 3-4 wearings it keeps my footwear much less funky.  The orange scent isn&#x27;t the most masculine, but after drying overnight (as recommended in the instructions) there is just a hint of a fresh scent in the morning. I get about 3 months out of each can.</li>
    <li> Kepps my shoes fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Here are some of the \\&quot;additional precautionary and first aid statements on the side panel\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the heading of \\&quot;First aid\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;IF ON SKIN OR CLOTHING: Take off contaminated clothing, Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes.

I simply can&#x27;t use this on my or my children&#x27;s shoes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite strong, be sure to spray in a well ventilated area as it gives off a strong orange smell.</li>
    <li> The product does eliminate the odor in my shoes.  It does have a nice citrus-like scent.  It does not prevent further funkification of the footwear.    Basically, I take my shoes off, I spray them, they are defunkified.    I wear them once, and they are re-funkified.    I bought this product because of reviews stating that it kept their shoes odor free for days at a time.  Not so for I of nas-TAY foot funkification...  Blech...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  I spray before I put shoes on and after and still my feet stink even with socks after wearing for only a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Overall great product just wish they would lower the price a bit!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything from the local stores with no luck.  This product worked great the first time I used it.  I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a couple time after I bought it, and it seemed to make my shoes smell worse than before.</li>
    <li> I have this condition called hyperhidrosis which means I sweat excessively. I have that both on hands and feet. I bought this product after some research to cure my foot order. As others have said, it works like a charm. Unlike many other people, I don&#x27;t have to stay outside for a long time in order to start sweating. In fact a half an hour walk on any weather will make my feet sweat. After I get home, I spray this thing in my shoes and I am good to go. Even the smell of this thing is nice.However, I still sweat a lot but the odor from my shoes is almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for everyone, especially those people who are on their feet for most of the day doing physical labor under hot weather.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AGEAT PRODUCT I T REALLY GET RID OF ALL ODERS FROM ANY SHOE AND ITS AFECTS ARE LONG LASTING.</li>
    <li> The product did not perform as well as I had expected it to. Better to get an odor absorbing insole, and some foot powder. That will do the trick.</li>
    <li> I now spray this in all my shoes - takes care of the odor and now you can actually walk by my tennis shoes and NOT fall over.  My children thank you :)</li>
    <li> I come from a family of smelly feet - apparently it&#x27;s a genetic thing.  Anyway, it&#x27;s always been a struggle to keep the shoes from smelling really foul after a few weeks of wearing them. We&#x27;ve tried powders, other sprays (including body deodorants), washing them with household cleaners designed to elimiate odors, and on and on.  Nothing really works.  Until now.  I like this stuff.  A little squirt at the end of the day, leave the shoes to dry for a few minutes, then store them away, and next time you take out the shoes to wear them - no stink!  We can finally take off our shoes in the family room to watch a movie and not have to leave the room because of the smell.  Oh, yeah - I&#x27;m definitely getting more of this spray.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with how well this removed the odor from my shoes.  I work 10-11 hours a day, constantly walking and moving. I also jog and workout 3-4 times a week. I try my best to practice good foot hygiene, but odor in work/athletic shoes is unavoidable.  When I finally get home and pull of my shoes it makes me wish I had a separate shed for shoe storage.  I worked in a shoe store and I&#x27;ve tried a number of remedies throughout the years, but honestly this is one of my favorites.  I tested it on several pairs of shoes, of different ages and types - from work to jogging to casual.  Even the toughest odors subsided or (to my nose at least) were completely eradicated at the source.  It didn&#x27;t just mask the odor, it attacked the bacteria which was the source as the label states.  My two issues were the size and how much it reminded me of another product I love by Sof Sole, the Fresh Fogger.  They are very similar in scent and power in my opinion and about the same quantity at or around 5 oz.    If you want take a look:[[ASIN:B0055QB724 Sof Sole Deodorizing Fresh Fogger]]  [...]    The 10 second spray does however come up to be the cheaper of the two (not including shipping) at the time of this review.</li>
    <li> Useless product. Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on Goretex hiking sneakers and converse sneakers. This product smells great. I&#x27;ve used other shoe deodorants that truly smell awful. I will be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does the job as disinfectant well.  It simply doesn&#x27;t mask odors, but actually kills the bacteria that break down the sweat that causes the bad feet smell.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like some kind of grape candy but seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> I have had a real issue with smelly shoes. It wasn&#x27;t just bad when I took them off but I was announcing myself with them on.  I have tried everything with no luck. (Oder-Eaters, Dr&#x27; Scholls Oder Eaters, Lysol, baking powder). The only option I had was buying sneakers every two months.  I saw this last month and was willing to try anything.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works!  Shoes that really were smelling bad, I took out the insoles and sprayed the shoes and insoles and let them sit 24 hours.  WOW what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has it really bad as I do, here are a few other thing I have started which seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) buy two pairs of sneakers and each night take soles out and let sit 24 hours while the next day I wear the other pair.&lt;br /&gt;2) bought SweatBlock Antiperspirant towelettes - One once a week before bed&lt;br /&gt;3) Soapy Soles Foot Scrubber - for shower&lt;br /&gt;4) PediFix Fungasoap Liquid, use with Foot Scrubber&lt;br /&gt;5) Spray Right Guard Antiperspirant Spray, Which I spray my feet each morning, before I put on my socks&lt;br /&gt;6) remove shoes once I get home to allow them to air as much as possible</li>
    <li> Most of the products like this are just good smelling sprays that mask the odor of your shoes. That never turns out well in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few pairs of nice boots I want to have around for a long time, and I think this is the product to do it. It actually kills bacteria, not just masks the smell. I couldn&#x27;t find a shoe disinfectant in the store and amazon luckily carried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never sprayed this for a continuous 10 seconds, 3 or 4 seems to be enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and I will probable keep buying it.</li>
    <li> The product, service, speed of shipping, was all good. No negatives here. Would do business again.</li>
    <li> You should know before buying that this stuff seems pretty toxic (the health warnings are intense) AND Amazon won&#x27;t let you return the product (the site says it is because the product is a hazardous material). Definitely seems like something to note in the product description.</li>
    <li> Very good. little expensive but it works. I had athlete&#x27;s foot and its pretty much gone now. In long term, it&#x27;ll save you money</li>
    <li> Works and smells amazing</li>
    <li> Unique Product.  Works perfectly.  Even on Teenage Boys speakers....</li>
    <li> I really dislike this product.  First the directions are just confusing.  Second you have to soak the shoe in the product so no spray and go.  I think the spray only lasts for a couple hours and ten the shoe returns to its original condition.</li>
    <li> Love this!  It&#x27;s used to spray on visitors&#x27; metatarsal boots we use at our facility.&lt;br /&gt;Deodorizes &amp; disinfects all in one spray!  Dries quick!</li>
    <li> This spray works very well at eliminating foot odor and bacteria in shoes, especially work / duty boots. I know the wife appreciates it😊.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, I use it everyday, no more bad odour. Buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> Can is VERY SMALL will only do a few pairs of shoes rip off</li>
    <li> Love this shoe spray. Gets the foul smell out of your sneakers when they don&#x27;t need cleaned! Great to have!</li>
    <li> I got this to prolong the life of my shoes, instead of having to buy so many work shoes.  It works after heavily spraying your shoes and letting them air dry for a day or two.  I rotate my work shoes anyways so thats not a problem.  It doesnt exactly kill the odor and prevent it from coming back as others have mentioned.  It may give one or two problem free wears, but then its back.  Overall its nice and ill probably buy a pair for my brother, but its not a magic shoe spray as hoped for.</li>
    <li> This totally cleaned my second hand shoes. Works great!</li>
    <li> Saved multiple pairs of cowboy boots after the cat sprayed them. Product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Recommended by someone and my daughter has a little boy (10yrs.) whose tennis shoes always smells - said shes tried everything - so I thought - what the heck, bought it and gave it to her. She says its the best thing she&#x27;s found so far makes him spray every morning. She loves it - makes Dad use it now too</li>
    <li> i recommend this shoe spray for anyone who wants to get rid of foot odor and shoe odor as it works really well.</li>
