### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It fits perfect I am so pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Love the dress</li>
      <li>I would love a refund or exchange please</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>The dress looks really cheap which isn&#x27;t a huge deal because it IS cheap, but it&#x27;s not as advertised...</li>
      <li>but my boobs don&#x27;t fit in it</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I was taking my chances on receiving an ok product, which I was fine with considering it&#x27;s pretty cheap to begin with</li>
      <li>Although it looks similar to the picture, it didn&#x27;t look good in person.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but if you are looking for the sweetheart, then I wouldn&#x27;t get this unless you were willing to take the risk and maybe get lucky out of the draw?</li>
      <li>Just received this dress and overall i liked it.</li>
      <li>The top was a bit tight but fit by the time I needed it.</li>
      <li>the dress, unlike in the picture and title, has a straight across neckline and its really unflattering.</li>
      <li>Even if it feels a little like a halloween costume because of the material I am 100% pleased.</li>
      <li>When it arrived it was huge on the bottom and was WAY longer then expected.</li>
      <li>The dress appears to be cute, but the size S is way to small for a petite 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; person who normally wears 0/2.  </li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything past some cheap dress you&#x27;d get at Forever 21.</li>
      <li>The material&#x27;s a little thin on the dress, but the mesh and collar part are quite nice, BUT it didn&#x27;t have the sweetheart neck, but a straight one instead.</li>

    <li> It was too tight around the chest.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was taking my chances on receiving an ok product, which I was fine with considering it&#x27;s pretty cheap to begin with and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything past some cheap dress you&#x27;d get at Forever 21. The material&#x27;s a little thin on the dress, but the mesh and collar part are quite nice, BUT it didn&#x27;t have the sweetheart neck, but a straight one instead. It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but if you are looking for the sweetheart, then I wouldn&#x27;t get this unless you were willing to take the risk and maybe get lucky out of the draw? It seems I had the opposite problem and found the dress a little big. I bought a small knowing that I am generally an XS to a S, but it was quite loose, especially around the waist. I do have a slender frame and I&#x27;m generally thinner than average.</li>
    <li> Love the dress but my boobs don&#x27;t fit in it and it doesn&#x27;t stretch at all in that area.</li>
    <li> It looks NOTHING like the dress in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Only the sleeves are lacey NOT mesh and also it doesn&#x27;t have a collar.</li>
    <li> came ripped by sleeves no sweetheart</li>
    <li> Ripped when I put it on</li>
    <li> I bought this to wear as a &amp;#34;suit&amp;#34; like dress to prom with a fancy tie as the accent. When it arrived it was huge on the bottom and was WAY longer then expected. The top was a bit tight but fit by the time I needed it. However, it TORE on my shoulder blades halfway through the night.</li>
    <li> I was soooo disappointed when this dress came in because it looked so cute in the pictures but the dress they send you is different :( I wish I could give this dress zero stars!!! The dress looks really cheap which isn&#x27;t a huge deal because it IS cheap, but it&#x27;s not as advertised... the dress, unlike in the picture and title, has a straight across neckline and its really unflattering. Aside from that the company is being really uncooperative about a return despite the fact that the product is different from shown... Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Bad stitching, took forever to get here, too small, unflattering to most body types (especially broad shoulders)</li>
    <li> The dress came with a rip in it. I was not pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Totally not worth buying. I should have listened to the reviews the materia is so flimsy it ripped and I&#x27;m a petite girl!</li>
    <li> Stitching was sloppy and the size was running small. Although it looks similar to the picture, it didn&#x27;t look good in person.</li>
    <li> This is super cheaply made and was insanely too small for me. Too short, too tight, transparent, etc...</li>
    <li> too small, and rather poorly made. :(</li>
    <li> Just received this dress and overall i liked it. Just a disclaimer tho if you are short this dress will run a little long but i feel it added to the vintage feel.</li>
    <li> It is not the type of dress described and it fits like a night gown, on amazon it says it&#x27;s above ur knees this dress is way underrr my knee smh I would love a refund or exchange please</li>
    <li> The dress appears to be cute, but the size S is way to small for a petite 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; person who normally wears 0/2.  This is small all over, length, width, difference between bust and waist, etc.</li>
    <li> Bad quality!! Save your money. Not to forget it&#x27;s super small!! It&#x27;s made for a little girl not a women.</li>
    <li> Although i ordered the black one, I received the white one but it&#x27;s okay because at the last minute i was eyeballing the white one. It fits perfect I am so pleased with it. Even if it feels a little like a halloween costume because of the material I am 100% pleased.</li>
