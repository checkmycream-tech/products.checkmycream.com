      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve reordered as this is a good deal for the $$ and a good product for my face.  </li>
      <li>I have come to accept that the oily makeup removers are superior because the oil clings to every bit of makeup ever.</li>
      <li>This precleanse is fabulous and great price!</li>
      <li>It smells so good</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>Love the Dermalogica Precleanse!</li>
      <li>ENJOY IT!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for years - LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>And might I say I love it!</li>
      <li>is even better!</li>
      <li>Absolutely excellent as the first step in cleansing my skin.</li>
      <li>This product alone is amazing.</li>
      <li>Precleanse is the absolute BEST ever.</li>
      <li>It is my professional opinion, precleanse is one of the greatest products ever created.</li>
      <li>Received early - that was great!</li>
      <li>This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used by far.</li>
      <li>good and quick delivery</li>
      <li>I got some as a gift from my sister and as soon as it ran out, I immediately bought more.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and to be able to purchase it in a 16 Oz size</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews about this product though and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>and I love how well it feels when I massage it into my skin.</li>
      <li>It takes off eye make up so gently and feels great on skin.</li>
      <li>issue with the vendor is there was no seal over top when cap was removed.  </li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m sure it is no match for this oil.</li>
      <li>My skin used to be perfect; then I turned 18 and all hell broke loose.  </li>
      <li>Great product, exactly as described and postage was quick.</li>
      <li>SO easy.</li>
      <li>it will take it off easy as well.</li>
      <li>strongly dislike oily makeup removers, and even though this one starts out oily, it works.</li>
      <li>When my skin misbehaves around that time of the month and special occasions, I wear heavier makeup, and this stuff is able to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My oily skin fells smooth and oil free, after using their Precleanse, which is made from various oils, as incredible as that sounds.</li>
      <li>This is hands down one of the best investments I ever made.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a makeup remover from Clinique for years (which worked just fine).</li>
      <li>It just so happened that the head fit perfectly; I just had to cut the straw down to size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This precleansing product is great for getting deep into the pores to remove dirt, oils and debris.</li>
      <li>It really gets every bit of makeup and sunscreen, smells amazing, and never breaks me out</li>
      <li>But it is fabulous at removing make-up and even mascara.</li>
      <li>and it has been effective, but I really want something with a lot fewer chemical ingredients, so I use organic jojoba or argan oil to remove make-up.  </li>
      <li>Recommend if you use a pre cleansing product, loosens makeup and gives your skin a pre clean before cleansing.</li>
      <li>OMG what a wonderful clean, and I was surprised how all of the makeup and cleaners do not stain my white face wipes.</li>
      <li>This oil has a fresh lemon scent that i really enjoy.</li>
      <li>Followed with their Special Cleansing Gel, my face feels clean and fresh with every use.</li>
      <li>The first time i tried this i received a sample size and fell in love with the first use.</li>
      <li>Fantastic price and fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
      <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t - however, THIS DOES!!</li>
      <li>The whole corner of the box was saturated with the product that had spilled out and the bottle was sticky in the wrapping it was sent in!!</li>
      <li>You have to follow up with a cleaner after using this to get the oil off, but it is so worth it.  </li>
      <li>Worth every cent</li>
      <li>my skin care treatments, as well as my own personal skin care regime.</li>
      <li>For around $50, this is definitely worth it since it lasts through the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 2 1/2 years, I will continue to repurchase it.</li>
      <li>This large size is super cost effective for a daily user.</li>
      <li>My face is looking great and no more makeup residue on my pillow case.</li>
      <li>Will definitely go through this seller again, love the fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This product is the first step in Demalogicas \\&quot;two step\\&quot; Cleansing process.</li>
      <li>I love the Dermatalogica line of facial care products.</li>
      <li>so I was hesitant to use it at first.</li>
      <li>Good for removing heavy makeup</li>
      <li>Had to order the professional size, well worth it!</li>
      <li>but once I use my dermal clay cleanser, my skin is squeaky clean and soft.</li>
      <li>This product really does help other products work so much better!</li>
      <li>The large bottle also comes with a pump that isn&#x27;t shown in the photo, which really helps get the right amount every time</li>
      <li>I find it is just as effective, less drying, and far more natural than the pre-cleanse.  </li>
      <li>Even my favorite high end makeup brands do not offer me super makeup removal without some sort of other issue.</li>
      <li>It is real greasy almost like baby oil</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much makeup I was leaving by just washing.</li>
      <li>Still haven&#x27;t check how much product I have already lost</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I first tried the small size I purchased at ulta for ten dollars, once I saw how great it worked</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend this product  as first step in cleansing - will remove make up and eye makeup - quickly.</li>
      <li>it really helps all other products work better and really do their job.</li>
      <li>It is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who wears makeup, or just wants their face as clean as it can possibly be.</li>
      <li>I use it just prior to washing my face and it takes off my make off and makes my face feel really clean.</li>
      <li>You know what they say, you can only clean oil with oil not water.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But starting with this a following it up with my cleanser leaves my skin clean the first time around.</li>
      <li>Cant live without this product before my cleanser.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever found. It really gets every bit of makeup and sunscreen, smells amazing, and never breaks me out (cystic acne prone aging skin). This large size is super cost effective for a daily user. I did the math and it adds up to &amp;#62;$2 a month for the 16oz size. The large bottle also comes with a pump that isn&#x27;t shown in the photo, which really helps get the right amount every time so no product goes to waste.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. I use this in combination with the calming cleanser. OMG what a wonderful clean, and I was surprised how all of the makeup and cleaners do not stain my white face wipes. The majority of my makeup is going down the drain. My face is looking great and no more makeup residue on my pillow case. Will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> This is the only Dermalogica product I use. And might I say I love it! This product is the first step in Demalogicas \\&quot;two step\\&quot; Cleansing process. It helps remove all your make-up and excess dirt. It is real greasy almost like baby oil so I was hesitant to use it at first. But it is fabulous at removing make-up and even mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> I have to say if you splurge on one thing to benifit your skin it would be this stuff! It (along with regular exfoliation) it really helps all other products work better and really do their job. You dont want to just slap your moisturizers and products on top of dead skin and waste money do you? Of course not. Will definitely go through this seller again, love the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love the Dermatalogica line of facial care products. This precleansing product is great for getting deep into the pores to remove dirt, oils and debris. Followed with their Special Cleansing Gel, my face feels clean and fresh with every use. I follow my cleansing with their Skin Smoothing Cream.</li>
    <li> Not pictured here is the fact that it also comes with a pump! Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle will last me forever.</li>
    <li> The product is great, I know that my shine will be awesome and the dirt and grime from the day will melt away instantly! However when I got this package the bottle, that I spent decent money for, had the nozzle in the unlocked position and the box was wet from product that had leaked out during shipping! The whole corner of the box was saturated with the product that had spilled out and the bottle was sticky in the wrapping it was sent in!! Still haven&#x27;t check how much product I have already lost but I am certainly not thrilled that the product was not shipped with enough care to have the container closed!!!</li>
    <li> The first time i tried this i received a sample size and fell in love with the first use. This oil has a fresh lemon scent that i really enjoy. I love that it dissolves all my makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave ANY mascara residue behind. I do not wear waterproof mascara but i&#x27;m sure it is no match for this oil. I use this on my dry face to remove all my makeup, then after i rinse it off i follow with my regular cleanser. I have dry skin and using this oil has really made a difference in how my skin looks and feels. Had to order the professional size, well worth it!</li>
    <li> My skin used to be perfect; then I turned 18 and all hell broke loose.  For the past 9 years, I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne and extreme oiliness (especially in my T-zone) and haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to help calm my skin, until now.  I&#x27;ve been using PreCleanse twice a day for a few days now, and my skin has already improved dramatically.  No exaggeration, the pores around my nose and mouth used to be visibly filled with white crap...I used to wake up everyday with at least 2 new whiteheads.  Now, they appear to be clear and I haven&#x27;t seen a new pimple since.      This product really does help other products work so much better!</li>
    <li> Precleanse is the absolute BEST ever. No matter what brand you use this cleanser can be combined. You can literly watch your makeup melt away. I will never stop using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent as the first step in cleansing my skin. I have become a believer in Dermalogica products! My oily skin fells smooth and oil free, after using their Precleanse, which is made from various oils, as incredible as that sounds. I follow up with another Cleanser, and then exfoliate. My skin looks and feels, wonderful. Worth every cent and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> SO easy. I feel like my face is much cleaner when I use this on dry skin before using my cleanser. My cleanser says it will take off makeup and mascara....but it really doesn&#x27;t - however, THIS DOES!! Best stuff every. One of those &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The stuff is wonderful! Didn&#x27;t realize how much makeup I was leaving by just washing.</li>
    <li> Before using this, I was only using Dermalogica&#x27;s cleanser and moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using a makeup remover from Clinique for years (which worked just fine). I&#x27;ve read so many reviews about this product though and decided to try it. I must say I&#x27;m extremely impressed. I first tried the small size I purchased at ulta for ten dollars, once I saw how great it worked I purchased the larger size from Amazon. I have oily skin and was slightly nervous about this pre cleanser considering it&#x27;s an oil but once I use my dermal clay cleanser, my skin is squeaky clean and soft. Recommend it to others to try and don&#x27;t be hesitant because it&#x27;s an oil, you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for years now along with a wide variety of other dermalogica products. This product alone is amazing. Before I use anything I use the precleanse to remove all my make up..mascara and all it takes it all away. Water proof? it will take it off easy as well. It has a bit of a greasy consistency but it does the job. rinse off and then use your cleanser to remove any excess. this large bottle will last you months because you only need a small amount each time. I recommend this product to everyone. ENJOY IT!!</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician at a medical day spa. It is my professional opinion, precleanse is one of the greatest products ever created. I use it to start [almost all] my skin care treatments, as well as my own personal skin care regime. It is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who wears makeup, or just wants their face as clean as it can possibly be. Do yourself a favor.....add precleanse to your arsenal! You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a while and it has been effective, but I really want something with a lot fewer chemical ingredients, so I use organic jojoba or argan oil to remove make-up.  I find it is just as effective, less drying, and far more natural than the pre-cleanse.  Also it is A LOT cheaper.  I won&#x27;t be buying this anymore.</li>
    <li> For removing makeup you&#x27;ll never beat Dermalogica Precleanse.  I&#x27;ve tried other makeup removers and can&#x27;t find anything that comes close to this product.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause break out.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and this bottle will last.  Use about a quarter size, massage into your face then wet your hands and continue to massage into your skin and around eyes to remove all your mascara. Use your regular cleanser and you&#x27;ll have no oily residue or traces of makeup left behind.  I have wiped this off with a wet washcloth before and still have no oily residue, but I always like to follow it with a gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I rated the product because it is the best for taking off makeup.  I have sensitive skin and this product works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue with the vendor is there was no seal over top when cap was removed.  usually there is a hologram seal adhered to top of bottle..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use the precleanse before I get in the shower and then follow it with the Daily Microfoliant.  Great combo!</li>
    <li> I hate paying this much for a make up remover but it&#x27;s truly the best on the market and even takes off my waterproof YSL mascara! I&#x27;ve tried multiple cheaper brands but I always end up buying Dermologica PreCleanse after being unhappy with the other products.</li>
    <li> I understand that the oil-based product breaks down makeup and \\&quot;cleanses,\\&quot; but it leaves my face oily and with clogged pores.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to start the make up removing process. The oil in the product attaches it&#x27;s self to either make up your wearing or even just the oil on your skin and help remove a lot of the product before even using your usual cleanser. I have been using this product for about a year now and I can&#x27;t go back to just using cleanser alone. With just cleanser I was washing my face at least twice to make sure I got all the make up off my skin. But starting with this a following it up with my cleanser leaves my skin clean the first time around. I would highly encourage anyone to at least try it!</li>
    <li> good and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Love the Dermalogica Precleanse! This is awesome! I use it just prior to washing my face and it takes off my make off and makes my face feel really clean. I will continue using this product in my skin care regimen.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> just as advertised brand new. I loved this product. came sealed in a bag which was awesome. the only thing was that it took forever to ship. but that was the only issue.</li>
    <li> I was wasting my Dermalogica cleanser washing my face twice till I got a small sample pack of this in my last order of cleansers. It smells so good and I love how well it feels when I massage it into my skin. It is great. Cuts all the oil and grease from my face for ultimate cleansing with a lot less cleanser. GREAT PURCHASE and will continue to buy!!</li>
    <li> This precleanse is fabulous and great price! It takes off eye make up so gently and feels great on skin.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I got some as a gift from my sister and as soon as it ran out, I immediately bought more.  My boyfriend has sensitive skin and he loves this.  Living in Florida, the heat can dry out your skin. This will help.  You have to follow up with a cleaner after using this to get the oil off, but it is so worth it.  I keep both products in the shower and use daily.  I get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I can not imagine my nightly makeup removal without the Dermalogica Precleanse! I love this product and to be able to purchase it in a 16 Oz size is even better! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a pre-shaving wash - I can&#x27;t live without it now -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered as this is a good deal for the $$ and a good product for my face.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Thank you. Good well received.</li>
    <li> Good for removing heavy makeup</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly as described and postage was quick. Recommend if you use a pre cleansing product, loosens makeup and gives your skin a pre clean before cleansing. Cant live without this product before my cleanser.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover I have ever used. I also do facial massages with this. It feels very relaxing and takes off all of my facial makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used by far. Even my favorite high end makeup brands do not offer me super makeup removal without some sort of other issue.My everyday makeup consists of: Asian BB cream or concealer on at least 1/4 of my face, black eyeliner only along the top lashline, black waterproof mascara, and sometimes also eyeshadow, blush, bronzer, and/or lipstick, just enough to hide most imperfections and so I don&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; (you know that one day when you don&#x27;t wear makeup and everyone points out that you look tired and/or sick). When my skin misbehaves around that time of the month and special occasions, I wear heavier makeup, and this stuff is able to keep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly dislike oily makeup removers, and even though this one starts out oily, it works. I have come to accept that the oily makeup removers are superior because the oil clings to every bit of makeup ever. I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes, but I have yet to experience any issues when I carelessly rub this into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major issue I have with this product is just the packaging. I hate the cap that comes with this large size bottle, and I also hate the one that comes with the small size bottle. What I did to alleviate this situation for myself was to use a treatment pump dispenser head with a straw in place of the junk cap that I reused from my moisturizer&#x27;s bottle (Shiseido Skincare Night Moisture Recharge, which was unfortunately recently discontinued). It just so happened that the head fit perfectly; I just had to cut the straw down to size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need one pump, probably less than a dime size, for my everyday makeup on dry hands and face, taking care to rub more product on my eye area very very very gently. I prefer to use warm or hot water to rinse off the Precleanse; it rinses off quicker than with cold or tepid water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, using my brush shampoo or my foaming face wash doesn&#x27;t cut it when I&#x27;m washing my brushes, especially those I use for foundation and gel eyeliner, so I use a drop of Precleanse, and it cleans up what the shampoo and face wash don&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price of the product matches the quality. So far I have used up two of the smaller 5.1 oz bottles in the past two years (I pour the product from the larger bottle into the smaller one), and like I mentioned before I wear makeup pretty much every day. For around $50, this is definitely worth it since it lasts through the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 2 1/2 years, I will continue to repurchase it. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Once I tried this, I cannot stop using it! This is hands down one of the best investments I ever made. You know what they say, you can only clean oil with oil not water. It melts all my heavy duty makeup, dirt, and grime off my face like it never went on. It melts waterproof mascara and eyeliner, as well as waterproof lipstick, like they never existed. Sounds like a heavy duty cleanser, right? Wrong. I have extremely sensitive and acne-prone skin, and this product has not once irritated or broke out my skin. In fact, since using this product, my skin has become noticeably clearer and smoother. I have no idea how I ever completed my face cleansing regimen without this gem. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s a definite must have even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup. Imagine all the toxin you can&#x27;t wash off with water just sitting on your face. You won&#x27;t regret it, just try it once and you&#x27;ll never want to stop!</li>
    <li> Received early - that was great! Packaging was great - perfect item. Definitely recommend this product  as first step in cleansing - will remove make up and eye makeup - quickly. Next step would be to use one  of Dermalogica&#x27;s cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for years - LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Fantastic price and fast delivery!</li>
