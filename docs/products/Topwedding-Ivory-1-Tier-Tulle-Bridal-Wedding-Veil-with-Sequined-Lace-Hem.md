      <li>I dont think im gonna be able to use it because it doesnt look well that long</li>

      <li>good thing is that ill take it to the cleaners,</li>
      <li>SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING BORROWED, SOMETHING BLUE....  </li>
      <li>The veil was a little longer than expected, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>only problem is that it is stiff and the comb fell of right away....</li>

    <li> I like it. The veil was a little longer than expected, but that&#x27;s okay. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the comb can easily slide off of the veil.</li>
    <li> I ordered ivory and got white, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to work it out!</li>
    <li> It is worth every cent and actually it is nicer than I expected  for the small amount of money that I paid. It is honestly the same quality as those that I found  in many Bridal stores for more than 100$. It also arrived faster than it said.</li>
    <li> Loved the veil and it was so cheap! David&#x27;s Bridal was charging $200-300 for decorated veils. I sewed on some pearls to match my dress more but it held up well. Didn&#x27;t use the clip that came with it because it was cheap and flimsy so I just bobby pinned it into my hair with 2 or 3 and it stayed great! If you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a veil definitely buy this!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous and got here when she said it would. I was so nervous about it getting hete and what it would like and she stayed in touch with me the whole time!!! It&#x27;s absolutely perfect, thank you so much!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not ivory it is white and it arrived ripped. I am very disappointed by this.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Very beautiful, and the price was amazing. I will definitely recommend this to other people!!</li>
    <li> Really poor quality I will never recommender this veil to you all una muy pobre calidad no lo recomiendo  anadie</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter&#x27;s up coming Wedding in Oct of this year... She received it in very good condition, and fell in love with it immediatetly... She couldnt thank me enough for the gift... lets say as the old saying goes... &#x27;SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING BORROWED, SOMETHING BLUE....  her reaction is... SOMETHING NEW....again thank you for the fine quality of work, that went into making the Veil, and also the availability online...PLUS  the affordable price...... anywhere else i would have paid hundreds of dollars......... thank you again...
