<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing out of the world but it is a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> For the real men with real taste in women...you gots ta try this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough said.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my favorites and my wife&#x27;s FAVORITE!  It does the trick for me and for her.  Awesome and seductive.</li>
    <li> I honestly bought this based on the Amazon reviews. Some of the reviewers say it&#x27;s too sweet. I must admit it has a very cheap, cloying grandmother-y sweet scent when first applied. After about 30 minutes the sweetness goes away and it&#x27;s replaced with a musky warm scent that&#x27;s very pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed about women is that they seem more trusting and comfortable around me than usual. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a sexual response, but I&#x27;ve worn some colognes that seem to repel women, and others that they always ask what I&#x27;m wearing, but don&#x27;t treat me any different. The reactions I get to Realm are not as good as when there&#x27;s a full moon and I don&#x27;t wear any cologne. So don&#x27;t buy it for that!    The reactions I get from this are similar to those I get when wearing Givenchy Very Irresistible.  It also has a little more staying power than Givenchy. About the amount to use; apparently, a little goes a long ways on some. If you&#x27;re like me and you burn off cologne quickly, you might end up using a few squirts (CK Euphoria and Versace Pour Homme are undetectable on me after 2 hours, regardless of how much I put on - I ask female friends). If a little scent normally goes a long ways on you, put this on at least an hour before going out, to let the initial cheap/sweet smell dissipate. Your processing times for all stages of cologne are probably slower than mine (lucky dog).     It&#x27;s only a few bucks, give it a try. It&#x27;s so inexpensive that it&#x27;s become my daily wear cologne.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve worn it for years and still get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> i expected i was getting medium sized bottles like what i buy for the same prices at walgreens but no i get 2 huge bottles worth twice as much. i will be coming back to stock up on a lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> let me tell u this is a hard to get item in stores nothing like realm except maybe antonios bandanrous  sprit best two colones ever get this u wont regret it .......</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars, I would! This stuff smells like an old man cologne and it&#x27;s STRONG! Really gross stuff, I&#x27;d stay away from this and DONT BELIEVE THE DESCRIPTION! If your old and are around people that expect you to smell like the old insurance salesman in the back office then buy it, if not then dont.....you will not be picking up any hotties at the club with this stuff on!</li>
    <li> Okay... so, regardless of the pheromones, it&#x27;s an awesome cologne! It smells exotic, manly, and pleasant, but not too strong. As for the pheromones, Realm contains some undisclosed content of estratetraenol, which is a pheromone that women give off known to have a calming or mood elevating effect on men. That being said, Realm was not meant to attract women, but to effect the mood of the wearer. I definitely feel really good when I wear this stuff, but that could be because it smells super good. Personally, I have noticed some effects on women, but nothing more than calming/relaxing effects, but again that could just be because of the scent.     Whether you believe in the effectiveness of pheromones or not, Realm is just a great smelling cologne. I have been using it for about 1 month now and I will definitely be buying more. In fact, I have added it to my current scent combo, which is now Realm + Chikara + NPA (New Pheromone Additive).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a bottle of 3.4 ounce Realm for less than a year, and it&#x27;s flat. it was great for about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using Realm for years and never get tired of the scent. I also recommend Blue Jeans.[[ASIN:B000C1UEGC Realm By Erox For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 Ounces]][[ASIN:B000C1ZFBG Versus Blue Jeans By Gianni Versace For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5-Ounces]].  I have had people stop and ask what cologne am I wearing?  Try it, you cannot go wrong. Sometimes I mix the two together.    Carl</li>
    <li> Smells a great deal like Stetson, or to a lesser degree some of the muskier Dunhill colognes. Strong concentrated scent is definitely a single squirt application for most. Very deep aroma, not light or citric but a hearty smell.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a smaller bottle in store and have loved the scent of this cologne. When I could no longer find it in the store I checked Amazon and what do you know they had it and at a lower price.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money. I find it VERY hard to believe this smells good on anyone. Just smelling it out of the bottle was bad. Wearing it on my was even worse. This was the first time a lady actually said I have a bad scent on. This being the first time I didn&#x27;t wear my old faithful aqua di gio. I highly recommend Armani over this bull____</li>
    <li> This  blows  my mind.   Realm By Erox For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 Ounces  what an Incredible price!!!  But  be sure to purchase the lower priced on here at Amazon because there is a  second listed account here and the &#x27;other&#x27; listing is double the price [ although still less than retail ] .  I payed here at Amazon 1/3 yes one third what I payed at Macy&#x27;s 6 years ago, and twice the size-amount bottle here at Amazon...compared to what Macy&#x27;s wants now days!  Realm has a &#x27;soft&#x27; yet quality scent...Woman compliment me often...BUT the part I enjoy is when wearing Realm I usually receive good and positive results when Women are present and on occasion a woman just can&#x27;t help  getting within a 2 foot radius of my &#x27;scent&#x27;!  I am in a wheel chair and am a attractive Man...but the way I see it is, in our culture why not utilize a product such as Realm so &#x27;Females&#x27; can get past the  disability issue and realize the &#x27;Real&#x27; Man still within.    Great product, just use  2 - 3 squirts...DO NOT OVER DOSE yourself or you&#x27;ll receive reverse effect!  Dave   Monterey, Cal</li>
    <li> My wife noticed this odor from this cologne.  She said she liked it and that it smells like a cologne I used to wear years ago, but it was discontinued.  I have not noticed any reactions from others.  It has a light powdering smell and is gentle to the nose.  It is not over bearing as some colognes can be.  I like it.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product however after trying at least 3 bottles over a year or so Ive found some don&#x27;t smell the same as others at all. Must be a shelf life or something ? My real complaint is that the cologne comes out red. Either its red to begin with or the dye on the bottle is tainting it. Its pale red , but red nonetheless.  I wish they&#x27;d revise that and put a \\&quot;best used by\\&quot; date or something on it as well.</li>
    <li> I had no idea it would be such a big bottle of Realm.  Not disappointed at all by it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works for all men, but as a woman I can tell you I love this cologne on men. It is attracting and appealing to me. It really does linger too. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months. I love the scent. Right now, I wear it only to work. It makes me look forward to going to work.</li>
    <li> This is his second order of this item..</li>
    <li> It has been my favorite cologne for many years, and I wear it almost daily.</li>
    <li> It smells good and a little spicy too. As for the pheromones, my wife doesn&#x27;t react to it.</li>
    <li> I have some strange friends.  Some associates boasted about the effects of using Realm cologne.  When they claimed that using this stuff drives women wild, I told them I doubted that any cologne could possible have the affects they claimed.  I said they might smell nice, but that is the limit.  So they dared me to try it and I got a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends were \\&quot;close\\&quot; to the truth.  For several weeks, I wore a bit of Realm each time I was around people.  I noticed no reaction from anyone - female or male.  The scent is really nice and I like it and my wife likes it.  So it is a good cologne, but not irresistible to humans.  I was prepared to report my results and end the research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, however, I visited some friends who have a very large dog.  I have had great relationships with dogs my entire life.  I have made friends with dogs small and large, but not this one.  His owners even gave me treats to offer him.  He just growled.  Several times during the evening I was able to make friends temporarily with the dog.  Every time I moved, however, the dog again growled and became unfriendly.  I simply could not believe the reaction of this dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I realized that dogs react to scents.  My conclusion is that Realm irritates dogs.  Someday I will return to the house of those friends without Realm and test my relationship with the dog.  Until then I intend to stop using Realm around dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realm has a pleasant odor that people like.  It does not attract women, but it may anger dogs.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell that great to me but i do like the fact its not loaded with alcohol, or at least u cant smell it. this fragrance is a woody middle age man type. not for the young go getter such as myself. As far as the pheromones go.. No noticeable effect and I also have NPA and pheromone-x so I compare all of these as well as mixing to test Effects.  Overall its a lasting Manly smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trial...i was more impressed with Burberry...but this one works very good..i real bar charmer and it lasts long, makes you feel fresh all the time and the odor is woody, not strong to hold your nose, and sweet with a pinch of spice...i got more than a few compliments for this product....i will go for more n probably will make it a permanent!!...</li>
    <li> Always the favorite for my husband and for me!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and got here fast, love it</li>
    <li> Its a good price for the amount you get. And would be even better if it was the authentic realm. I have been using realm for 5 years and this is not realm.</li>
    <li> This scent and I do not get along. Too heavy, and caused me a wicked headache with use. The scent was not something I was looking for at all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. That&#x27;s just what I was looking for. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Realm exclusively for the past few years and get a number of comments from women about how nice the scent is. It is not too sweet or heavy, lasts a long time and I have noticed that some women seem to be very \\&quot;friendly\\&quot; when I have it on in social situations. It reportedly has pheremones in it so perhaps that is what is at work here. I strongly recommend guys buy this product if you want to smell good for the ladies and maybe get a little EXTRA attention!</li>
    <li> I must be an idiot.  This smells ok, but no effect at all....what was I thinking.....</li>
    <li> LOL, I was hoping for a different kind to attraction, but it is not a bad fragrance.</li>
    <li> I THINK THE WHOLE GROUP OF MARKETING AGREED TO WRITE GOOD COMMENTS ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND THE MITH ABOUT PHEROMONES, PEOPLE ! JUST DONT BUY THE PRODUCT, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. i AM NOT SAYING THAT SMELL BAD, IT IS JUST A SYMPLE CHEAP COLOGNE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUPID MONEY HUNTERS THAN MAKE SUCH STORY ABOUT PHEROMONES AND ATRACTION. IT DOES NOT WORK. TRUST ME OR WASTE TIME AND MONEY AND THEN WRITE A COMMENT LIKE ME. BUT DO IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Realm since 1995 and I continue to replace it whenever I use up my supply.  I never get tired of this fragrance and neither does the woman in my life.  Compared to the major designer products on the market, Realm is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but I beg to differ with the other reviews.......this is so sweet I thought my Gramma had come in the door. A perfect ladies fragrance.....Sorry</li>
    <li> I received this product three years ago as a Christmas gift. I like the smell of this cologne but it was hard to find at various department stores. It hit me I am a shopper with Amazon why not try there. This one cologne I keep in my car. I really like the smell and it&#x27;s lasting!</li>
    <li> By all means this isn&#x27;t some scent that&#x27;s going to get all kinds of women at your feet, but most women do find the scent pleasant, where as I don&#x27;t really like it all.  I don&#x27;t wear it very often.  I do however this it smells much better on me after it&#x27;s died down a little bit.  Not bad for $20.00, but it&#x27;s not some miracle cologne like some make it out to be.</li>
    <li> I am not sure whether the pheremones really make a difference, but I have been using this cologne since it first appeared on the market and I have to say, I have had so many compliments. This is a great fragrance and should be purchased regardless of whether the pheremones work or not. It is simply a quality fragrance, thats all we should care about.</li>
    <li> ok, I bought this cologne because of all these nice comments, I dont kno what to say.. I am not sure if all these are scam or what. because, I still have the cologne, I havent seen any attraction from female body while using it, the smell doesnt last long, and it is too sweet. almost girlish!, and i am not a bad looking guy either, so i dont kno, at first I felt like a rip off, but now i am like ya watteva, its just $20... so yea.. I was really disappointed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this stuff has pheromones or not, however I do love the smell and I do get complimented on it all the time. don&#x27;t use too much though, I get sneezy if I do more than one pump. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and I don&#x27;t get tired of it. I didn&#x27;t get swarms of girls falling at my feet like some guys seem to expect. It&#x27;s $20.00! come on! worth the price</li>
    <li> I have been using Realm for several years. I recieved it as a Christmas present and continued using it.  I had been using Polo but I like this better.  It has a nice scent and have recieved compliments on it.  The price from Amazon.com is less than Dillards.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very subtle and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I have an almost embarrassing amount of cologne and most are on the snobby side ($75+ average price per bottle).  I have to say I prefer this &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; cologne over most of the expensive bottles I have!  This is a long lasting scent that is very unique.  The pheromone things is probably a bunch of bull but aside from that, this is a great cologne and amazing at this price point.  This and Ceasers Man are the two best bangs for the buck you can get in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a must for lasting colone and the smell is very plesant! I is very unexpensive a must!!!!! I have had many compliments from women &amp; men on this product.</li>
    <li> the cologne has a heavy scent that dates itself. I smells more like colognes that were poplar in the 80&#x27;s. It definitely gets noticed but gets mixed comments.</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed using this cologne. It has become harder to find over the years since it first came out. The price was very reasonable here on Amazon, and it was easy to find and purchase. I smell like my old self again!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, lasts for few hours.</li>
    <li> Attracts women, period.  Been wearing it for at least 15 years.....it actually works.  It gives you that extra edge which no B.S. actually makes women more comfortable and relaxed around you, and makes them a lot more likely to hug you, kiss you, etc...A total ice breaker to say the least....notice I&#x27;m trying to be as politically correct and polite about it as possible but dudes just wear this, shave nice, stay on point, dress very nice, make sure your breath smells nice, your nice dress shoes are polished and your hands and feet are clean and nice, wear this, talk nicely, make the lady laugh and have fun, be respectful and gentlemanly, hold open the doors, always pick up the check for the ladies, be just slightly a little hard to get but also a little bit funny and a little bit indirectly and lightly flirtatious with the ladies and the realm will take over from there.  It works, it gets you where you need to be, do I really need to spell it out for you guys?  Erox company, great job.</li>
    <li> You should keep in mind that every fragrance depends on how well it will react to your skin:  some that smell awfully nice on that little piece of paper, will punk and funk on you, and leave you stuck with an expensive bottle of Eau de Calamity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in a store looking for Drakkar, and when I saw this, I laughed at the ad copy about \\&quot;hidden pheromones\\&quot; and \\&quot;secretly attract women!\\&quot;  I dashed some on a wrist, let it soak, and gave it a whiff.  Despite the fact that I&#x27;d been urged to try Armani Black Code, Ralph Lauren, and Acqua diGio, Realm was the one that really stuck.  This is a great fragrance:  strong and masculine, but not overpowering and reeky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and by the way--guys: it only takes a tap of the nozzle!  More than that and you might have the ladies running for a tissue or some eyedrops. ;)</li>
    <li> The cologne has a very nice smell and all the ladies I know love it.</li>
    <li> smells like a mens locker room, sweat nasty smell. Now when others wear this type of clone it gets me sick to my stomach</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it, so does my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t vouch for any of the other claims, but I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
    <li> very. good price and fast serviceRealm is a very good product for both men and women. Iwas very pleased.I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to buying and using this product. I have only used three colognes my whole life. Chikara (INCREDIBLE COLOGNE but TO PRICEY and SMALL BOTTLE), Mambo By Liz Claibourne (DECENT COLOGNE but NOTHING SPECIAL has a GOOD PRICE though), and this one(WENT STRAIGHT TO THE TRASH AFTER SECOND USE). When I first opened it I immediately thought it smelt horrible like a cheap cologne you can find in a thrift shop or flea market! Then I thought I would get some other opinions. Maybe I was wrong? Asked some girls I know and Not one person liked it and all said the same thing... It smells like an old man.</li>
    <li> I have used Realm for multiple years.  Unfortunately it became difficult to find as department stores, one after one, stopped carrying it.  Walmart was the last one to carry it, but they have ceased as well.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  This cologne is one of the coveted little secrets some of us know about, which is a great thing so you aren&#x27;t competing with your friends on who can use it on a night out!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years and love it, a little goes along way, one pray and you are good, any more and you&#x27;ll find yourself a lonely man or being asked to leave any public environment.  I literally have women clamoring for me every where I go when I wear this, just the other day I went into the bucher shop and was attacked by like 10 women and 1 very femmy man, they were hanging all over me like I was some sort of prime cut of meat, it was great, so I picked up some apple wood bacon and went home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now. It smells very good, the price is good and I have always received good compliments from others regarding how good it smells on me. I am sold for life on this one!</li>
    <li> Realm has been my cologne for years, and it help me a lot with the opposite sex</li>
    <li> wearing it every day, cause it smells so good that people just follow me around where ever I go!  good stuff</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE OF THIS COLOGNE,,, I GOT MORE COMPLEMENTS FROM THIS THAN I DID A LOT OF THE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TYPES</li>
    <li> Just to be honest I bought Realm because I was baited by the pheromones gimmick ad. LOL    However, once I smelled the fragrance. Man! It smells very good. It makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. Sometimes because of it I even wish I could sleep with myself. Cant wait to try it around the ladies. LOL</li>
    <li> I am not an expert on scents and usually don&#x27;t use this type product. After reading reviews I decided to get Realm..as the price seemed right.&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff..worth the price. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I would have given this five starts, but the shipping was really slow. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and found this priced nicely on Amazon. The fragrance is light, has a sweet scent of vanilla and is very long lasting. It was worth the wait as this product is not easily found elsewhere. I give the product 5 stars, but the shipping experience diminished my overall experience a little.</li>
    <li> Great Smell!  I receive compliments for women all of the time that I smell good!  All in just a compliment, nearly all of them know I am married, etc.  Mostly co-workers and just friends!  Most importantly my wife LOVES it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strong recommend buy!  I have no idea whey Erox took his off the market?  Their &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; is NOT near as good.  Just a couple of short sprays on both sides of my neck and maybe a little on my shirt or sport coat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance</li>
    <li> One of the only colognes that I have received unsolicited female remarks about (all good) .... hey, if it makes them happy then I don&#x27;t care how much it costs :)  I had heard this particular one was discontinued, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as I can.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne.  It&#x27;s strong enough to need only a few sprays and lasts a long time.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It gets me in trouble, but I still love it! Went through 3 girlfriends and 1 boyfriend before finishing the bottle! All well worth it! People just grab you! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Certainly not in the Hugo Boss, Armani, CK perfume class. I put perfumes in classes based on the scent smell not necessarily the name. This is in the B class. I am not impressed with it. I use light perfumes, its decently light but stays till the next day, so the staying power is good, but it just doesn&#x27;t have a classy smell. If you like the CKone, D&amp;G light Blue you may not like this.</li>
    <li> 2 day shipping, no tax, AND the product was larger than I thought I was purchasing as well as cheaper than my smaller bottle. Win, win!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but didn&#x27;t atttract women more than usual .</li>
    <li> This is among some of the best cologne to ever be marketed for men. The smell is truly great. If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting great smelling product at an affordable price, Inner Realm is the right choice. The synthesized human pheromone component in this fragrance is pleasing and will attract many women!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it,,,strong smell, I tried to returned but the amazon says that is a hazardous material (which I understand). There is no way to contact the company so good bye my money. Didn&#x27;t like the odor, strong and no pleasant I was dizzy and everything.&lt;br /&gt;Ill try one more time to see if some miracle happen if not, will go to the sink. pending update in case the company gives my money back or that miracle happened</li>
    <li> Great aroma, reasonable price, love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using realm since it first hit the market. I get many compliments on it. In the begining I remember paying as much as 45 dollars for it at Dillards. No at around $20.00 through Amazon.com I can still afford it even though times are hard.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, but Husbands favorite cologne.  Love it on him</li>
    <li> I suppose it is up to your personal taste - if you like more expensive colognes..or ones that actually smell good..stay away from this stuff..unless of course you want to smell like your grandfather..or grandmother.  It really does remind me of something you&#x27;d buy at Rite Aid for like 10 bucks for your dad, like \\&quot;Musk for Men\\&quot;..when you were like seven years old.  Just hit myself with a very light shot, and I couldn&#x27;t wait till it either wore or washed off.  It&#x27;s a weird smell..almost perfume-like...like a stinky aunt might wear if she didn&#x27;t know any better. My own fault for buying something without smelling first, I know...just checked, and sadly, because it is a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; (possibly meaning hazardous to your nose and the noses around you) it can&#x27;t be returned.  Glad it was only $20.  I&#x27;ll give it to a hobo.</li>
    <li> This bottle of Realm does not smell right! It is not the same Realm that we know and love! Is there a different manufacturer or formulation? Again, this fragrance, like the Tuscany Per Uomo, does not seem authentic.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I love the sent and so does my girl.  She likes it better than all the name brand colognes I tried.  Will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Lets get one thing straight...i &amp;#34;Hate&amp;#34; cologne.  Nine times out of ten its a douche bag cornucopia of this crap. But let me tell you one thing..this stuff is subtle. And if a woman hates this then they are not worth having. This stuff is great on the nose......i dunno how else to tell ya</li>
    <li> Great !! I&#x27;m very happy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ladies love the smell, and I do seem to get better quality action when I wear this!  It does smell good!  Does require a few repeat squirts throughout the night!</li>
    <li> Received fast and item just as listed had been paying the same for ½ the size</li>
    <li> This is  the best traditional perfume, very good essence, it smell good all day long or more. The bottle also has very good design, it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> About 12 years ago, I purchased Realm for my husband as a gift. Ever since then, it is my (and his) cologne of choice! When he wears this, it drives me CRAZY! He smells so manly and so very sexy, and I want to throw him down and have my way with him (but, I won&#x27;t...afterall, I am a lady).   With this said, we cannot find it locally...Walgreens used to carry it during the holidays...but, this year, no luck! I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries it! Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the cologne that claimed that it would arouse women. It doesn&#x27;t. Or maybe it&#x27;s just me. That said, I have never gotten so many comments. My dental hygienist: &amp;#34;before I start, I just have to ask what that after-shave is,&amp;#34; (she got some for her husband.) Other cases: guys seem to tolerate me more. (Go figger!) The universal reception is that people of all kinds like it. I like it. Get it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Only brand I will use. Great product and service.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cologne smells. I had it for a long time and didn&#x27;t use it much when I first got it. I was more of a deodorant person. I started using it more and more, and its great. About two sprays does the trick, but I like about 4, if I don&#x27;t mix it. I had a small bottle of Canoe by Dana for Men, which smells kind of like baby powder, and the two go well together, complement each other quiet well. Both on the cheaper side of colognes. If I had the money I&#x27;d go for Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male By Jean Paul Gaultier For Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne without smelling it first and it has been worth every penny. I&#x27;m getting a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell on my husband</li>
    <li> Forget all other colognes, this is the business. We could all do with a little extra help, and believe me fellas this is all the help you need.It must be the pheremones, because the ladies love it. When wearing this I get a lot of comments and friends. If you know what&#x60;s good for you buy it, wear it. If I could give it any more stars I would. It has an absolutely spellbinding fragrance. You&#x60;ll never use anything else. It certainly has a potentcy all of it&#x60;s own</li>
    <li> this smells great, and its 15 bucks cheaper here then any retail or department stor i could find</li>
    <li> Realm has been my signature scent for years. It&#x27;s the only cologne I&#x27;ve ever  used that people ask what kind it is that I&#x27;m wearing. Pheromones or not, the ladies seem to dig it.</li>
    <li> I know I know I know, it is old school. However it smells great and it lasts all day. 12 hours after I put it on I can still smell it.</li>
    <li> Way too strong, even 2 prays, and i feel like I&#x27;m choking on it, only used it twice and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;Now i use it as a deodorant for my restroom lol, hey, after number 2, you need a strong scent to cover the whole place lol, this seems to be good for that.</li>
    <li> Smells like a cleaner, and as for the pheremones, women I know have asked me why I changed my cologne, since they liked the other one better.</li>
    <li> This cologne sticks with you throughout the day. My husband&#x27;s body chemistry works well with it!</li>
    <li> The service was excellent, cost per ounce was the best available at the time and it was exactly what I ordered. I don&#x27;t see how you can get any better than that.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite brand, and he is very very happy</li>
    <li> not cool ... smells old .. not nice,,, I give away to my grandmother she has no smell ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it is original</li>
    <li> this is my favorite smell... i love it on my husband and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the super fast delivery as well as providing &amp;#34;AUTHENTIC REALM COLOGNE&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Realm since 1993!!  When it was introduced in the department stores!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as us Realm buyers know..the product has been getting a little scarce...seldom do i find it at the kiosks in the malls...and when I do, it is often (already opened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my fear of buying it online was that I thought i would get the (watered down version) or a different scent that I have been stuck with before, but took the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was (THRILLED) to open the shipping box to find a &amp;#34;FACTORY SEALED&amp;#34; box of Realm!! Trust me, there are fake ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope this seller will have more available when i order again. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading this review to confirm &amp;#34;authenticity&amp;#34;...Then I confirm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are reading it to find out if pheramones really work?  Then I (also) confirm.</li>
    <li> Smells like old lady perfume. Must be a fake.  I heard good reviews, but I must of got a fake one. This is grandma perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a very clean fragrance! I would recommend to anyone for going out to wearing at work.This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I brought this long ago for the first time and I liked it. This time the smell is too strong and I cant stand it. Some times It gives me a headache too. Didn&#x27;t get much compliments from my friends this time around. So I used only a few times and stopped using it now.</li>
    <li> Strong and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Realm for as long as it has been available. I continue to be satisfied with the fragrance that it provides. I also continue to get positive comments from women that I&#x27;m around.</li>
    <li> The title says it all --- Realm cologne is indeed a manly and sexy scent.  Not your ordinary cologne, not musky, not too overwhelming.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Cheap, Arrived well before it was said to and exactly as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Real product, very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Always a great buy, it has been Mr&#x27;s favorite for years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is as good as I remember form when it was first introduced.</li>
    <li> Old stink&lt;br /&gt;Smells like old and cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I would return it if I could.</li>
    <li> I like it, but wife says I smell like an old man.</li>
    <li> I bought this Cologne a few days ago without even smelling it first. I have another type of cologne with pheromones and took a chance on this one. All in all, I have to say that I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about scents. This one I like a lot. It is not overpowering. It is touted as mixing with each person&#x27;s body oils and produce a unique aroma.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for some time and find that this cologne is good without being overpowering.  One spray will do for what you need and it does seem to work for attracting the opposite sex.  Now whether or not the pheromones actually work or not is a matter of opinion but most women seem to like its subtle scent.  The cologne use to be pricy at 80 bucks a bottle but has since been discontinued.  At 20 bucks, this is a steal.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product in my college psychology class and decided to look it up. I read some of the negative reviews and wondered if I should get the cologne. After 1 week of use I was glad I got it. I am 22 y/o and have been getting many positive comments about the aroma. My girlfriend loves how I smell which is a plus. It is worth trying this product since it doesn&#x27;t cost that much. The best thing about it is that it lasts almost all day.</li>
    <li> The ladies like it and I don&#x27;t find it at all obnoxious. This fragrance has been my favorite since I first encountered it. I have had requests on Facebook from men who were looking for a scent that would attract women. They report back that it works.</li>
    <li> Was Larger Size, better value than one&#x27;s i had gotten at the Mall.</li>
    <li> This product is a magnet!  Everyone enjoys this scent.  I got hooked on it several years and continue to use it.  The scent is masculine and fresh.  I recommend this product  to others.</li>
    <li> used it before it s what i remember.good clean smelling after shave.would recommend to any one who wants something different</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m younger and this is a more mature smell. Which usually makes it a big hit .  Will recommend to friends once I finished the bottle .</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Realm for over 10 years.  It has wonderful earthy tones without being Fruity or Flowery.  Excellent Cologne</li>
    <li> This cologne is either not Realm, or has been so degraded by age and/or storage conditions that it does not smell anything like the Realm I&#x27;ve been using.  The label on the bottom of this cologne shows that it was manufactured and/or distributed by Five Star Fragrance Co. in Bellport NY, but listed no number.  The bottom label on Realm bottle I bought prior to this one (which was the Realm scent I expected) said it was distributed by Niche Marketing Group Inc. in Hicksville NY, listed Northern Brands Ltd. in London, and listed No. 20022.  Perhaps different manufacturers are involved, or different levels of care and stock rotation are being employed, I don&#x27;t know.  But I am positive that what was sent me is not the scent I expected.</li>
    <li> MY favorite scent for my husband. Great price for the quantity and this scent lasts on him all day.</li>
    <li> Took about a month to get to me, even though it was in stock the whole time. After smelling it, I def wish I would have canceled the order. Not my cup of tea but that&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great! Used it before and had many complements.</li>
    <li> I realize to some people its kind of silly to purchase cologne online. But honestly, I&#x27;ve purchased several different ones based on reviews and been very happy. This is one of this worst colognes I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I asked my wife what she thought and she laughed in my face and said I smell like a old lady. She ended up giving it to her mom, who must have some issues with her nose. be warned this stuff is strong and the smell does not come off even after washing with soap. I don&#x27;t understand all the favorable reviews... total waste of money, will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product...my female friends love it.</li>
    <li> Kind of ironic.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend wanted me to get this so I did.&lt;br /&gt;6 months later she&#x27;s gone, but this stuff is still around.&lt;br /&gt;Since then have used it more and gotten several compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if the pheremones work, but 1 quick spritz on the wrists&lt;br /&gt;and one on the neck gives a nice, not overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all my current girlfriend seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Excelente.... Bueno....</li>
    <li> fast delivery,excellent seller.A+++++</li>
    <li> This really interacts with your body chemistry, and it is a good value.  Good for everyday use, and a large size.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the pheromones but women definitely love it! I love it! I have been buying Realm cologne for many years now..</li>
    <li> the perfect product for my character......refreshing and sexually attractive.</li>
    <li> I was never much into using  cologne of any kind. I am an average looking guy, and carrying a few extra pounds, so not what one might call a &amp;#34;chick magnet&amp;#34;. I found this by chance about 15 years ago and tried it. I like the scent. It isn&#x27;t too heavy, nor does it smell like a woman&#x27;s perfume. It is light, and clean smelling, and something that I feel comfortable wearing, though in the beginning I was doubtful about the pheromone claims. However...&lt;br /&gt;As much as I hate to admit it, women did act differently around me. Women that never even noticed me before started noticing, and talking to me, initiating the conversations. My wife was one of them. More than a decade younger, and very attractive - well out of my league. But, here we are 14 years later.&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones? A change in my demeanor because subconsciously I though I had the power of pheromones? Who knows? It smells good, and women seem to like it too.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and the right price😃</li>
    <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
    <li> Does not smell good, smell is too overpowering</li>
    <li> A very heady, yet crisp spiced scent, with fruity undertones. I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.</li>
    <li> wanted to give this a try before I reviewed. I don&#x27;t like the smell. Not even for a bathroom spray as others have posted. I am throughing in the garbage or maybe I will give as a christmas gift. LOL</li>
    <li> I save over 50 percent over the mall prices,and this is&lt;br /&gt;the 3.3 ounce size the 1.7 ounce is over 20.00 plus taxes.I poid 20 for double size!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy a fragrance at the mall again.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service keeps on getting better and better,i got this with free shipping and 4 days after i clicked the send key!! i love it!</li>
