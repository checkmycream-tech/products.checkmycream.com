      <li>LOVE this scent, as does my husband!</li>
      <li>and I love the smell!</li>
      <li>Love this perfume!</li>
      <li>This fragrance mist is so nice</li>
      <li>After all, if I don&#x27;t smell nice an hour after I apply it, what is the point?</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m being perfectly honest.  </li>
      <li>I also think to me out of a lot of fragrances this is SO pleasant to take a warm bath with and moisturize and spray a bit on before bedtime because the lavender and vanilla notes really just seen to relax me.</li>
      <li>Maybe perfumes suit me better</li>
      <li>An item every woman would love.</li>
      <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase, I recommend the seller, and I&#x27;ll probably be buying this again when I need a refill.</li>
      <li>I have had so many compliments over the years when wearing Moonlight Path cologne.</li>
      <li>and it is my favorite scent, but buying from Amazon</li>
      <li>more than met it..loved it..</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>So I had to get the lotion &amp; the Fragrance mist to go with it :)</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this Moonlight lotion.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Nice light inexpensive scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite body spray.....</li>
      <li>I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Wife seems to love this.  </li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more before my bottle is done</li>
      <li>This scent was not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>And still smell new again, love it and love it!!</li>
      <li>When you bath with the gel, use the lotion and spritz this spray on your body and under garments, the scent stays with you lightly for most of the day.  </li>
      <li>I originally didn&#x27;t fall in love with it</li>
      <li>but once I tried it, it mixed beautifully on my body chemistry.</li>
      <li>This is not like the same beautiful fragrant it used to be.</li>
      <li>The Moonlight Path relieved me and felt comfortable.</li>
      <li>This is a very sexy and light scent that is romantic.</li>
      <li>Among all fragrances, this is absolutely their best-seller and most favorable from customers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also come across with another new fragrance &amp;#34;Japanese Cherry Blossom&amp;#34;, smelling much more comfortably as a bathing/shower cream.</li>
      <li>The price for this is about what B&amp;BW would charge, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth it, the seller shipped this to me really quickly and the way this body mist smells is just fabulous.</li>
      <li>Now it smells like super sweet cotton candy baby powder.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a floral with a very soft yet clean feel to it, it&#x27;s to me a fragrance for someone looking for an elegant floral.</li>
      <li>I will leave the details of THAT out of the review, but I highly recommend this scent, and it has become one of my top favorites from B &amp; BW.</li>
      <li>Most of the classics, especially the &amp;#34;Cherry Blossom&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Sweet Pea&amp;#34; were too strong for me.</li>
      <li>My dad made fun of the fact that my husband liked it and subsequently he also had it himself!</li>
      <li>Smells more like my old Moonlight Path.  </li>
      <li>I use it as shampoo and it smells really fresh.</li>
      <li>My wife opend it on Christmas and had the biggest smile on her face</li>
      <li>This spray product has that essence but its not as fresh a bit muted tone.</li>
      <li>and super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>When comparing an older bottle of the original scent with this newfangled concoction, the recipe change is evident.</li>
      <li>Actually prefer this aroma more than the Eau De Toilette.  </li>
      <li>However, the scent wears off pretty fast- within like an hour after spraying.</li>
      <li>It is such a clean fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Smells great but a little different than the body spray.</li>
      <li>I guess this shows that scents are very subjective.  </li>
      <li>has a seductive smell that just really takes you places when you close your eyes and let your imagination go.</li>
      <li>I spray myself before bed at night; very soothing to fall asleep to.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why I dislike it so much, but it has motivated me to run out and buy alternatives for my wife for Christmas.</li>
      <li>Still, I really like it.</li>
      <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
      <li>I remember falling in love with this scent in 2006, I was shopping with my mother and testing out other fragrances.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking to try a pretty floral that&#x27;s really soft</li>
      <li>The person I bought it from was extremely smart in taping the cap to the bottle so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t accidentally leak or break open and I very much appreciated that!</li>
      <li>the price was right too, I will be back for more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Given these drawbacks, I am going to have to find a new product.</li>
      <li>and she told me she received a new body spray as a gift at work:</li>
      <li>For some reason doesn&#x27;t last long at all and aroma goes away very quickly.</li>
      <li>smell is soft , not over powering&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>While driving my wife&#x27;s car, I noticed a repulsive odor - not unlike the smell of musty cologne of an old man combined with the smell of putrid underwear.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was more subtle</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t get this particular scent on the Bath &amp; Body Works website, the only place that you can get it is Amazon and maybe Ebay.</li>
      <li>I usually can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours but others have commented on how they love the fragrance and how it is not overpowering.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband loves this fragrance so I bought it for him. My dad made fun of the fact that my husband liked it and subsequently he also had it himself!</li>
    <li> While driving my wife&#x27;s car, I noticed a repulsive odor - not unlike the smell of musty cologne of an old man combined with the smell of putrid underwear.  Then I noticed the same horrific smell in our house the next morning.  I asked my wife from where it was coming and she told me she received a new body spray as a gift at work: Moonlight Path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you may think I&#x27;m exaggerating in my extreme repulsion for this stuff.  But I&#x27;m being perfectly honest.  It literally makes me fight the urge to throw up.  I usually like the same stuff as everyone else, when it comes to colognes and perfumes.  But in this case, I clearly am the odd man out.  I guess this shows that scents are very subjective.  I have no idea why I dislike it so much, but it has motivated me to run out and buy alternatives for my wife for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of this fragrance</li>
    <li> Love this no matter where i buy it!!!</li>
    <li> When you bath with the gel, use the lotion and spritz this spray on your body and under garments, the scent stays with you lightly for most of the day.  I usually can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours but others have commented on how they love the fragrance and how it is not overpowering.  I guess compliments always say it all.</li>
    <li> Like product, smells good and suits me.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. has a seductive smell that just really takes you places when you close your eyes and let your imagination go.</li>
    <li> What a shame that Bath &amp; Body Works have discontinued this fragrance, this body mist smells wonderful and is so refreshing. You can&#x27;t get this particular scent on the Bath &amp; Body Works website, the only place that you can get it is Amazon and maybe Ebay. The price for this is about what B&amp;BW would charge, and it&#x27;s absolutely worth it, the seller shipped this to me really quickly and the way this body mist smells is just fabulous.

    <li> This is one of my Favorites...!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is soft , not over powering&lt;br /&gt;And the price was right too, I will be back for more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;VLJ....NH</li>
    <li> I went to bed bath and beyond and i bought the same sent but body wash form. I use it as shampoo and it smells really fresh. This spray product has that essence but its not as fresh a bit muted tone. I cant complain because this seller has it in stock for affordable price and its spray form.</li>
    <li> This is a very sexy and light scent that is romantic. I love it and I think it would be an awesome scented candle. :)</li>
    <li> I love this scent!!! I spray myself before bed at night; very soothing to fall asleep to.</li>
    <li> Wife seems to love this.  And, I like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; as well.  So, appears that I made a wish choice with this.</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent, as does my husband! I will leave the details of THAT out of the review, but I highly recommend this scent, and it has become one of my top favorites from B &amp; BW.</li>
    <li> it smells great, im very happy with it. it smells good on me and i get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> This fragrance mist is so nice and I love the smell! However, the scent wears off pretty fast- within like an hour after spraying. Still, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Smells like hair spray...I buy this from Bath and Body Works and it is my favorite scent, but buying from Amazon I will never do again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did return it for a refund and would not suggest buying from here.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light fragrance in a generous size bottle.</li>
    <li> I had stocked up on several bottles of this several years ago, and when my supply dwindled, I purchased this.  Unfortunately, the fragrance wears off within half an hour and leaves me sad. The newer bottles function poorly too--after it stopped spraying several times, I dug into my recycle bin to find my old bottle/sprayer and have been refilling it since (this has happened with several other bottles too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given these drawbacks, I am going to have to find a new product. After all, if I don&#x27;t smell nice an hour after I apply it, what is the point?</li>
    <li> Smells great but a little different than the body spray. Not quite the same</li>
    <li> Scent only last for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It is great for when you get out of the shower. It is such a clean fresh smell. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It has a mysteriously wonderful scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like soap.  Great body spray.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like the smell...but I don&#x27;t. I wish it was more subtle</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! The scent is amazing! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this scent!! and super fast delivery. Will be buying more before my bottle is done</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body spray..... love it</li>
    <li> all what i can say is wooooooooooooow this is what i want to have on me a great pleasure scent stick with me along</li>
    <li> Truly is moonlight!! I spray when necessary  when I go out for long day of work. And still smell new again, love it and love it!!</li>
    <li> more than met it..loved it..almost gone.</li>
    <li> One of my very favorite</li>
    <li> One of my besties from bath and body works, I would recommend that you try this scent. I purchase at a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> An item every woman would love. My wife opend it on Christmas and had the biggest smile on her face</li>
    <li> I remember falling in love with this scent in 2006, I was shopping with my mother and testing out other fragrances. Most of the classics, especially the &amp;#34;Cherry Blossom&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Sweet Pea&amp;#34; were too strong for me. The Moonlight Path relieved me and felt comfortable. Since then I&#x27;ve strictly stuck with this scent. I&#x27;ve also come across with another new fragrance &amp;#34;Japanese Cherry Blossom&amp;#34;, smelling much more comfortably as a bathing/shower cream. But I buy the set--perfume, lotion, body spray and shower gel of Moonlight Path. Among all fragrances, this is absolutely their best-seller and most favorable from customers.</li>
    <li> My mom LOVES this perfume! It smells great and it makes a great gift :) The person I bought it from was extremely smart in taping the cap to the bottle so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t accidentally leak or break open and I very much appreciated that! Great product and seller :)</li>
    <li> They must have changed.  This is not like the same beautiful fragrant it used to be.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this Moonlight lotion. My bosses mom got me started on this. She just loves it &amp; this is all she uses. So I had to get the lotion &amp; the Fragrance mist to go with it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this forever,along with all the other moonlight path products. My daughter-in law started me on this wonderful smell !</li>
    <li> Moonlight Path is my very favorite of all the Bath &amp; Body scents.  I have had so many compliments over the years when wearing Moonlight Path cologne.</li>
    <li> Love it. Now I will say this one for me I originally didn&#x27;t fall in love with it but once I tried it, it mixed beautifully on my body chemistry. It&#x27;s a floral with a very soft yet clean feel to it, it&#x27;s to me a fragrance for someone looking for an elegant floral. It&#x27;s got Jasmine, violet, lavender, tuberose and Lily of the valley to name a few of the floral components to it but it has a subtle vanilla, bergamot and pachouli note to it which gives it a sort of floral musk to it. It&#x27;s one of my favorites to get in the Shower Gel, body cream and body mist or Eau de perfume to properly layer it and that way it will really last you all day til the evening time. I also think to me out of a lot of fragrances this is SO pleasant to take a warm bath with and moisturize and spray a bit on before bedtime because the lavender and vanilla notes really just seen to relax me. I recommend this for anyone who&#x27;s looking to try a pretty floral that&#x27;s really soft</li>
    <li> This scent was not my favorite.  I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong was not unpleasant I just thought it was an odd scent.</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift , she says she loves it</li>
    <li> BBW has changed the recipe for Moonlight Path. It used to smell wonderful. Now it smells like super sweet cotton candy baby powder. When comparing an older bottle of the original scent with this newfangled concoction, the recipe change is evident. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Maybe perfumes suit me better</li>
    <li> Actually prefer this aroma more than the Eau De Toilette.  Smells more like my old Moonlight Path.  For some reason doesn&#x27;t last long at all and aroma goes away very quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice light inexpensive scent. Love it. Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent from Bath and Body Works ever! And for not very much. (Sometimes the price gets as low as 8 dollars so be on the lookout). I will definitely buy it again when I run out.</li>
