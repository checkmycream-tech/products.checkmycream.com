I will continue to purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great...my fine thin hair has a lot more body and I only shampoo 3 times a week!</li>
    <li> It´s fantastic. It cleans my scalp and hair. I have oily scalp so I mix it with a bit of magnesia milk for the firs wash and it keeps down my oil for almost 4 days. It´s amazing. The only thing I don´t like much is the price, bottle is bigger than other shampoo´s though.</li>
    <li> The scent is not overpowering. Light and smells amazing. I love that its organic and has ingredients like sage in it. It is Vegan Friendly, Cruelty-Free, and Sulphate and Sulphate Derivative Free. I dye my hair all the time so great to see that it is safe on color treated hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received mine at a discounted price, however that in no way affects my review.</li>
    <li> Im amazed at the purity and smell! Love!</li>

    <li> This shampoo works just as good as the Nioxin that we were using before. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference. That being said, it&#x27;s not really fast at extra thickening but maybe over time it does. I do notice the difference if I don&#x27;t use a shampoo that adds thickness though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the lavendar scent that we don&#x27;t really like much but that is just personal preference. I didn&#x27;t think about this part when I purchased it because my man doesn&#x27;t really want to smell like Lavendar... LOL.. he&#x27;s dealing with it for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review, All opinions are my own and are in no way effected by their offer.</li>

    <li> It smells good but this shampoo, and it seems with all the natural shampoos, it feels a bit thin - it is hard to keep in the palm of your hand and wants to run all over.  Other than that I like it and does the job intended to do.</li>
    <li> Works great,love the scent,makes lots of suds and my hair looks great after three days of washing my hair with it.&#x27;</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo! It has a great scent and cleans very well! It also didn&#x27;t strip all the natural oils off my hair.......</li>
    <li> I liked this shampoo and it cleaned my wavy long hair nicely. It didn&#x27;t lather quite as much as my normal shampoo but I know this one was made with natural ingredients which is probably better for my hair. I did have to use conditioner afterwards but I have to do that always regardless of what shampoo I use as my hair is thick and tends to tangle easily. I love lavender scents and this one was very relaxing to smell. If you like lavender scented shampoos I would definitely recommend. I did receive this product at a huge discount in exchange for my honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have long thick natural curly hair and I do not have to use a conditioner with this. This shampoo makes my hair soft and manageable. Love the lavender smell and the gentleness on my sensitive skin.  I would recommend this shampoo for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! When I try a new lavender shampoo I&#x27;m always terrified about the smell. I know what lavender smells like, and this smells like I&#x27;m surrounded by hundreds of lavender plants. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m at home again, and that&#x27;s always a happy feeling! I&#x27;m thrilled with this shampoo and will definitely be ordering again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves hair smooth but not oily. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo! Smells like lavender... nice and relaxing scent. Shampoo suds up decent, and it lasts a while too... I wonder what it would be like to use the conditioner with this... Anyways... overall it&#x27;s a good product and added benefit is it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this shampoo makes shower time an absolute pleasure.  And my hair is so shiny and soft.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! My hair is thick again and healthy and soft! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! I am so excited to try the conditioner once it comes available!</li>
