      <li>This newer model is even better!  </li>
      <li>Love this straightener...</li>
      <li>Nothing more to say about this gfreat tool.  </li>
      <li>Love the rounded edges...easy to handle....</li>
      <li>Maybe the Bionic one pass is better.</li>
      <li>Though I&#x27;m still not terribly proficient with this iron, I like having it for smoothing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I just thought it would be a lot better than my chi.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since using this iron and would not hesitate to purchase another whenever mine goes out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this item.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a month and my hair still looks healthy.</li>
      <li>Ok iron, but i like the one with the speed strips better.</li>
      <li>I love this straightner.</li>
      <li>Would order again when more are needed for my salon.</li>
      <li>The price is great - especially compared to what the salon&#x27;s in Canada charge for it.</li>
      <li>By far the best flat iron i have ever used i even like it better than the chi</li>
      <li>definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>I mostly use it for my bangs and it really does make them look hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>Heats up very fast!</li>
      <li>I could not believe the price of this, and it works so well, smooth and fast!</li>
      <li>My old chi was better.</li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>nice long cord.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lock closed, which is nice for storage and travel.</li>
      <li>The price was unbeatable, the product was exactly what i was expecting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the straightener for about a year and a half, and it&#x27;s still as good as new!</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull  my hair when styling, and leaves it super soft and silky feeling.  </li>
      <li>but this really does work.</li>
      <li>, IT IS FAST THE SHIPPED</li>
      <li>Its not a bad flat iron</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and I get lots of compliments on how much volume my hair has.  </li>
      <li>thrilled to see this on amazon - i paid full price in a salon - over $140 - crazy me - but this flat iron is worth every penny !</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find a better product at this price point (I expected to pay double this price).</li>
      <li>It heats up extremely fast, and doesn&#x27;t cool down when styling like some models do.  </li>
      <li>I was given a more expensive model flat iron before purchasing this one, but it wasn&#x27;t half as good.  </li>
      <li>I went through at least 3 cheap flat irons from drugstores, but none lasted more than a few months.</li>
      <li>I have had an older version of this flat iron for 7 years and counting!</li>
      <li>I owned a older model freestyle which lasted me for a long time before the cord wore out.  </li>
      <li>For my long, thick hair, the Bio Ionic Freestyle gets hot enough, and stays hot enough.</li>
      <li>When I tell people I straightened it, they can see the wave is gone, but can&#x27;t believe my hair is not flat!</li>

    <li> I have had my iron for over 4 years and it is still as good as the day I took it out of the box! It hydrates my hair and straightens it, while keeping the volume! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since using this iron and would not hesitate to purchase another whenever mine goes out.</li>
    <li> Very nice shape, they arrived promptly, price fair for product. Would order again when more are needed for my salon.</li>

    <li> I could not believe the price of this, and it works so well, smooth and fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this item. It heats up fast and stays hot. I&#x27;ve had this item for almost 2 years now and it still is working fantastically. I definitely recommend this product to anyone needing a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner. I have been using it for a month and my hair still looks healthy. I don&#x27;t think you will find a better product at this price point (I expected to pay double this price).</li>
    <li> I have had an older version of this flat iron for 7 years and counting! buying one for my mom this christmas!</li>
    <li> Ok iron, but i like the one with the speed strips better.</li>

    <li> The price was unbeatable, the product was exactly what i was expecting. By far the best flat iron i have ever used i even like it better than the chi i had</li>
    <li> This iron is the best I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve only tried a couple but this really does work. I mostly use it for my bangs and it really does make them look hydrated and smooth. Worth the price. :D</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!, IT IS FAST THE SHIPPED AND ATTENTION, THIS MAKE ME A CURLY BEAUTIFUL, I AM GRATEFUL, IT IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast! Rounded edges for curling, not too heavy. Swivel cord so it doesn&#x27;t tangle. Two reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars: 1) There&#x27;s no &#x27;marker&#x27; to know what temperature you&#x27;re setting the iron at and 2) It doesn&#x27;t lock closed, which is nice for storage and travel. [my Revlon one has a lock/unlock feature]</li>
    <li> The best straightener I&#x27;ve owned. I went through at least 3 cheap flat irons from drugstores, but none lasted more than a few months. For my long, thick hair, the Bio Ionic Freestyle gets hot enough, and stays hot enough. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, and the style lasts. I&#x27;ve had the straightener for about a year and a half, and it&#x27;s still as good as new! I&#x27;ve also learned to curl my hair using the flat iron, though it took a lot of practice. Love this straightener... definitely worth the price!</li>
