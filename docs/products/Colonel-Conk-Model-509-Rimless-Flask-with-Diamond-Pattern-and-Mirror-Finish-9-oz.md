    <li> Works well and the texture is a nice touch</li>
    <li> I purchased this Colonel Conk Sunstar Model 509 Rimless Flask with Diamond Pattern and I am thoroughly pleased!  I did some research prior to purchase and some flask are of poor quality (leak, taint the flavor of your libation) but this flask is great, no tainting of flavor, no leaks, and is aesthetically pleasing to look at.  Would make this purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works, Does what it&#x27;s supposed to....</li>
    <li> Love it. Bought this flask a month ago and have had no problems with it - no leaks, no metallic taste. It&#x27;s sturdy and attractive with a nice subtle pattern.</li>
    <li> Sold as 9 ounces, bottom says 8 oz, actually holds 7 oz if you measure it.  In comparison, the model 508 does actually hold 8 oz, and the model 1007 does hold 6 oz as advertised, so it&#x27;s just this one model that&#x27;s horribly mislabeled. For all these flasks, the build quality is excellent, as others have noted. That&#x27;s essential--cheaper flasks often leak or impart a bad flavor.</li>
    <li> this looks even better in person and the quality seems to be really good. worth getting engraved though, otherwise it looks like its missing something. some other flasks I&#x27;ve heard have plastic hinges and this one is all metal.</li>
    <li> I Love the way it looks! This was a gift for my boyfriend and loved it. I would recommended this flask to anyone.</li>
    <li> so far its great not cheaply made and leaking or anything of the sort. I bought it and it does its job though its not 9 oz its 8oz.</li>
    <li> Perfect pocket flask for a suit jacket with a discrete profile. I&#x27;ve since lost it, but while it was in my care it was the perfect shape and capacity, and it didn&#x27;t come with any foreign smells. Just washed it out with water and it was off to active duty.</li>
    <li> -I filled the flask yesterday and it has not leaked, So far, no weird metallic taste, but maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell (the instructions do say not to leave it full for more than 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;-This is an 8 oz flask, not 9 oz like the description says.&lt;br /&gt;-The hinge thing holding the cap is made of plastic rather than stainless steel, so I&#x27;m wondering if it will break easily.

I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because for the price it seems like a decent flask overall.&lt;br /&gt;-Fast shipping (not really related to the product itself, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.)</li>
    <li> No leaks; good flask for less than 10 bucks. I use it everyday for water; instead of carrying around a bulky plastic bottle</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I go over friends and family houses to bring along my scotch. This is a BIG flask. It holds about 9 ounces. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted to put together groupings of gifts - a nice wine &amp; wine glasses, coffee mugs with coffee, a nice bourbon with glasses or flask.  We have Riedel wine glasses and thought this would be the perfect addition to those we already have, and they were a hit.</li>
    <li> Really good product. This brand is very solid in construction. the cap is made of metal too, not some cheap plastic. The only plastic piece is the arm that holds the cap and hinged to the flask.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the origin is supposedly USA. There is nothing spectacular about this product over any of the other Chi-Com flasks out there. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow is this a nice flask. Really cool pattern on the surface, very smooth corners. Very high quality. May need to get another.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, no leaks, nice finish, no metallic taste imparted to libation. Would definitely recommend as a gift or for personal collection.</li>
    <li> I bought this flask as a birthday present for my friend and instantly loved it. It&#x27;s beautiful, classy and well-made and she loved it too. I love the diamond pattern. I ended up buying two more - another one of the diamond pattern for myself and Colonel Conk&#x27;s checkered pattern one for another friend. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a nice flask.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I bought for myself.</li>
    <li> Nice well made flask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good sturdy flask, however it does not hold 9 oz. In fact, stamped on the bottom of the flask it says \\&quot;8 oz\\&quot;. Not a huge deal but inaccurate nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I brought this 4 my husband he like it but its a little to big 4 him because he not a heavy drinker but he does like it &amp; he do use it...</li>
