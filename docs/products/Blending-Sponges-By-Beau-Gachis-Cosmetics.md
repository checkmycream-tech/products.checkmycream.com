      <li>Thank you again for such a beautifully made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
      <li>The quality is substantial and the blenders are very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean, Just follow the cleaning steps on the box.</li>
      <li>These are silky smooth and soft and surprisingly, they do not &amp;#34;soak up&amp;#34; all of your make up!</li>
      <li>The contour makes it easy to get into corners and make sure make up is easily distributed..</li>
      <li>So soft and a great price.</li>
      <li>Even application, and easy to clean!</li>
      <li>Also, they do not soak up mass amounts of foundation like other sponges that I have used and the application gives a flawless look!</li>
      <li>My first time using this kind of applicator</li>
      <li>but I find that using Baby Shampoo or Body wash does the trick- nice and gentle!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the others and these are hands down the best.</li>
      <li>so it is just damp and that makes a huge difference on how smooth the application is.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I received a &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; from Brichbox that I understood how amazing these really were.</li>
      <li>Makes makeup looks so smooth.</li>
      <li>I love these beauty blenders so much!</li>
      <li>on par with the original beauty sponge.</li>
      <li>Love love so soft 😍</li>
      <li>Used these right away and found that my make up went on effortlessly!</li>
      <li>I love them so much that they have been added to my wish list</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t run into any missed areas and gave full coverage of my foundation.</li>
      <li>These sponges are very soft yet strong!</li>
      <li>Its also very squishy so it makes it fun and easy to apply the foundation or concealer since it just glides smoothly on my face.</li>
      <li>I have several sites I use to get free or discounted products at in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews.  </li>
      <li>I can really say is that these are fantastic sponges</li>
      <li>Worth it</li>
      <li>Boy were they right.</li>
      <li>They are fabulous, cleanup nicely, and will cut down on the amount of product used.</li>
      <li>This is worth the extra coins if your looking for a better beauty blender....</li>
      <li>So soft and bland out my makeup beautifully.</li>
      <li>I also very much like</li>
      <li>Felt, looked, smelled, and worked far better than I expected, and I will be ordering more and would recommend to others.</li>
      <li>They wash and dry really well and give the same great results all over again.</li>
      <li>but the sponge will absorb more product when it&#x27;s dry which means i will be wasting foundation or concealer.</li>
      <li>I actually prefer the double ended blending sponge more than the tear drop shaped one, who would have thought?!</li>
      <li>One thing I noticed is when you wet the sponge, you have to make sure to squeeze out all water or the excess water will mix on the foundation when you start spreading it all over your face.</li>
      <li>I had no idea what to expect, but I will say that these are the real deal</li>
      <li>She says this applicator feels like her face is being touched by gentle clouds...</li>
      <li>That is the absolute truth, regardless of me getting them at a discount.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these for my wife as part of their promotional &#x27;thank you&#x27; for buying their brushes. She absolutely loves both products. She says this applicator feels like her face is being touched by gentle clouds...</li>
    <li> I must say that these are by far the best makeup sponges I have ever used! My daughter loves makeup and used them first, so I will definitely have to buy a second set. I love the fact that they are black and the shape makes them so much easier to use. Also, they do not soak up mass amounts of foundation like other sponges that I have used and the application gives a flawless look! They wash and dry really well and give the same great results all over again. Excellent product....definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Sooooo soft. Very good at blending and applying makeup. I&#x27;ve had one before and it was very harsh and would scrub my face. This is soft and durable. It also has a nice tips that makes it easier to get into crevices close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw sponge , which looks exactly the same as the beauty blender, and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;While it looks the same as the beauty blender, it is very different.&lt;br /&gt;This is a much more dense sponge. It is heavier, and takes in more water when you wet it/squeeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;Another difference I found was the &amp;#34;bouncing&amp;#34; off the skin. The sponge bounces off the skin and gives you a great finish.It&#x27;s really dense. It still gives a nice finish though.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of differences between this and the beauty blender. I&#x27;m sure with a little getting used to it will work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a discounted rate for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. always remember to wash your beauty blender/makeup brushes, especially if you have acne prone skin!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about these sponges bc other ones i recieved from other sellers are small and when you wet them do not swell up at all and when you go to apply your makeup it feels like your punching yourself in the face....well with these omg i cannot be happier they look little when they are completely dry but when you run them until water they blow up in size and they are soooo soft and it blends my makeup so well im so happy i purchased these and will deff be buying more for my kit</li>
    <li> Love their products! Best sponge ever!</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this make up sponge because I want to know the difference between using the sponge applicator versus the make up brush. I haven&#x27;t tried any make up sponge applicator but I can say that this is a high quality sponge applicator because it is durable enough to withstand the washes i have done with it after every application. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, Just follow the cleaning steps on the box. Its also very squishy so it makes it fun and easy to apply the foundation or concealer since it just glides smoothly on my face. I usually use the narrow tip because i like to control how much foundation or concealer i put into my face and just even it out. One thing I noticed is when you wet the sponge, you have to make sure to squeeze out all water or the excess water will mix on the foundation when you start spreading it all over your face. I like the smooth finish after using the sponge applicator compared to the noticeable streaks you see when using make up brushes so that is definitely a plus for me. I guess the only thing I didnt like is wetting it whenever I use it. I know I don&#x27;t have to wet it but the sponge will absorb more product when it&#x27;s dry which means i will be wasting foundation or concealer. It&#x27;s a tag of war between smooth finish but wetting the sponge or dry brush application but with streaks. Either way its about which method you&#x27;re more convenient at and make it perfect. after all our face is our canvass. In my case, make up brushes is more convenient for me and I&#x27;m just working on a technique to avoid streaks. Overall, This is defintely a keeper and Im still using this whenever I feel like it.</li>
    <li> Love love this product.</li>
    <li> These beauty blenders are very nice. The contour makes it easy to get into corners and make sure make up is easily distributed.. The quality is substantial and the blenders are very easy to clean.  This was a product I was more then happy to review!</li>
    <li> These sponges are very soft yet strong! They apply my foundation perfectly! I always wet the sponge with water than wring out everthing I can so it is just damp and that makes a huge difference on how smooth the application is. They don&#x27;t aborb all of your foundation like some of the sponges that I have used in the past, and work just as well if not better than my $20 makeup sponge!! I also very much like that you have 2 different shaped sponges to work with!! *I recieved this product to give an honost review*</li>
    <li> When I was first washing them before use I thought they we never going to get soft but after a few minutes of cleaning they started to feel like the original beauty blender. I actually prefer the double ended blending sponge more than the tear drop shaped one, who would have thought?! All around a good product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Gets dirty too easily.</li>
    <li> Love these.  Attractively priced and they are NOT the &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; sized version that others tend to &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; to mention in their descriptions.  No awful smell when opening.  Washed well prior to first use and have maintained their shape and effectiveness following subsequent washes.  Soft and pliable (not too stiff as with some other brands) and worked well both wet and dry.  Felt, looked, smelled, and worked far better than I expected, and I will be ordering more and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous beauty blenders! Used these right away and found that my make up went on effortlessly! I didn&#x27;t run into any missed areas and gave full coverage of my foundation. I did receive this product at discount in exchange for my honest review. I would highly recommend this product to my friends, family and the general public. Well made.</li>
    <li> These are the absolute best makeup sponges ever! They are amazing! So much nicer than the bigger pink one.  They are soft, small and smooth.  They made my foundation look like velvet going on!  Well, maybe not velvet - I have no idea how to describe it, but it really made my foundation blend perfectly into my skin and you couldn&#x27;t even tell I was wearing any -- except that my face was smooth and seemingly flawless!  The instructions say to lightly wet it before use so prevent it from absorbing your foundation into the sponge -- I thought that was a great tip -- I used it to put on my foundation and I just couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!!!  I read some other reviews about people getting generic or knock off items on here, including the hot pink facial sponge -- and then I was given the opportunity to purchase these at a discount for my review and I was SO happy !  I had no idea what to expect, but I will say that these are the real deal and they are very  high quality!!!!  That is the absolute truth, regardless of me getting them at a discount.  I have several sites I use to get free or discounted products at in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews.  Here are a few to try:  productelf.com ,  ilovetoreview.com , and elitedealclub.com/?invcode&#x3D;V8XVoPT3</li>
    <li> makes no smears when applying make up</li>
    <li> These are really nice applicator sponges. I have just started in the world of contouring and shading with my make up and read on a blog that sponges like these were the only way to go when you were blending in the different types of foundation. Boy were they right. The sponges were very soft, and though they looked rough, they were not at all. They really pushed the makeup into my skin and helped blend it seamlessly and in less time then my foundation brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can really say is that these are fantastic sponges and I will not be going back to brushes or my fingertips for blending every again. I will be including a pic of the end result and if I can find one a before shot. Thank you again for such a beautifully made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> The blender you have been looking for!! I always see makeup artists raving about these blenders and wanted to try one out myself. I tried buying so many different brands only to be let down and not see what the hype was about- all from $2 ones to the Younique brand. It wasn&#x27;t until I received a &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; from Brichbox that I understood how amazing these really were. They were soft and blended every nook and cranny evenly. The only downfall was the price point. I can&#x27;t tell you how impressed I am with the blenders from Beau Gâchis® PARIS. They are BETTER than the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; at HALF the PRICE! These are silky smooth and soft and surprisingly, they do not &amp;#34;soak up&amp;#34; all of your make up! I love them so much that they have been added to my wish list and I will continue to keep these purchased. They stand behind their product and have every reason to! Believe me when I say that you won&#x27;t regret this purchase. These applicators do not come with a cleanser but I find that using Baby Shampoo or Body wash does the trick- nice and gentle! :) I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion. This has by far been my favorite Amazon purchase in a long time.</li>
    <li> Blends perfect !! Worth it</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase from Beau Gachis and I must say I am a total convert. Their brushes are simply the best, well constructed, nice feel on the hand, easy to clean, GREAT value. And these sponges are truly a must have. They are fabulous, cleanup nicely, and will cut down on the amount of product used. Do yourself a favor and get these sponges now.......and they are free if you purchase the amazing brush set.  Love, love, love these products, and am also a HUGE fan of their amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> Love these!!! Second time I&#x27;ve bought them and they work wonders</li>
    <li> Great sponges...on par with the original beauty sponge. Love them!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! Was needing a new blender &amp; these are awesome! &amp; they clean very nicely. So far all the Beau Gâchis Paris items I have have been wonderful!</li>
    <li> These sponges blend nicely.  My daughter was very excited to try this product also.</li>
    <li> So soft and bland out my makeup beautifully. I used then for my BB cream, my  concealer and my foundation. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love the feel and the design! My first time using this kind of applicator and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Amazing. I&#x27;ve tried the others and these are hands down the best. So soft and a great price. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I like the sponge....prefer the tear drop though...</li>
    <li> Works great ! Even application, and easy to clean! Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I dont have a beauty blender, so I cant compare. but I do like using this for applying concealer and foundation.  I have used it regularly since I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love these beauty blenders so much! They came individual wrapped in plastic inside a sealed box. I was surprised at the softness! They hold the perfect amount of makeup. I prefer them over my brushes for everything except my eyes! Also help make my contour look flawless! Can&#x27;t believe they were around 20 for the set!</li>
    <li> Makes makeup looks so smooth.</li>
    <li> Works better than beauty blender for me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing applicator!! Everything goes on so flawlessly! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is worth the extra coins if your looking for a better beauty blender....I will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> Love love so soft 😍 can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> Absolutely as good as the well known blender at a much higher price, plus you get two! Blends foundation beautifully. I would buy again without question.</li>
