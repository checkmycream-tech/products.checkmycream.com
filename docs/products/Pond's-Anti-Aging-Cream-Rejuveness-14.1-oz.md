<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! Perfect makeup remover, including eye makeup. Have used it for years. This cucumber formula is my favorite.</li>
    <li> light but still sufficiently moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser comes from the same company that brings you a cold cream that is a standard for removing makeup PONDS COLD CREAM.  I think it can compare to any of the high priced products you may find at the department stores. The cost is minimal.  It is hard to find in stores but easy to order from Amazon.  It is light and non-drying. Use either with water or without. It lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I like this product for removing full face of makeup and have used much more expensive creams and this is every bit as good. What was disappointing was the packing...not the packaging but the packing. I received it along with another subscribe and save item and of all things my other item was 24 cans of dog food for my sons little puppy dog. Sorry, but who packs a delicate pack of 3 cold creams without any other packing material and throws it into the box along with the dog food. It arrived split open and oozing all over the box and cans. What a MESS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.     I may have normal to oily skin, but find that soap or body wash products leave my skin feeling dry. It&#x27;s thinner and less greasy feeling than regular cold cream and cleans even my oily nose area well.    On top of the fact tht it works well, its inexpensive. Known for using gobs more of this type of thing than I need to use, a jar lasts about 5 to 6 weeks. With automatic delivery, it lands on my doorstep with no effort on my part!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how I discovered the Pond&#x27;s Cucumber Make-up Remover, but it ended my search for the best make-up remover and moisturizing cleanser.  To save my washcloths, I first use eye makeup remover with a cotton pad.  The Pond&#x27;s would take it as well as my lipstick off, but why sacrifice my good linens?  So, I end up without a trace of makeup at the end of the day using this frothy non-greasy creme.  I still use moisturizer and in the past have used toner after the Ponds.  It is a great product.  The price on Amazon is unbeatable, especially when purchased on the auto-ship program.  I even give it as gifts to be best friends.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> mild and effective.  More of a lotion texture than the original heavier cream Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream</li>
    <li> I am not sure what you mean &amp;#34;pack of 3&amp;#34;  I received one!!!</li>
    <li> A favorite product that is hard to find at retail stores.  Smooth and creamy and feels good at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using Ponds Cold Cream.  I experimented a little with the original Cold Cream, however, it&#x27;s a bit too oily for me to use every night.  I still use the original on my decolette, neck, feet, etc.  I tried the Ponds Deep Cleansing Cream, and it&#x27;s worlds better for my skin type.  I like to use it at night.  Usually I will leave it on for a minute, then rinse it off with warm water, and then use just a smidget more as a moisturizer.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll just rub it on my face and tissue it off if I&#x27;m feeling lazy, but I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my face after that.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as good at removing eye makeup as the original Ponds Cold Cream, and it can irritate my eyes sometimes which the original Cold Cream did not.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This cleanser did not remove my makeup at all - had to use an additional makeup remover to get it all off - and mostly just left me with an oily layer of film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it was no match next to waterproof/non-waterproof liquid eyeliner and even regular foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to makeup remover wipes and a separate cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to this cleanser.  It is mild and it doesn&#x27;t lather like you would think it might.  It has more of a lotion feel and reminds me of another cleanser I&#x27;ve had before, like Clearasil.  My face does feel clean afterwards and I don&#x27;t get that feeling that my skin is tight.  I usually take a wash rag and smear a bolt of it on my forehead, cheeks and my chin and buff the cleanser around my face.  When I don&#x27;t use the St. Ives apricot scrub, I will use this one as a milder cleanser.  It just doesn&#x27;t do that well with mascara.  I still find that sometimes in the morning I have some residual mascara lining the bottom of my lids.  The mascara I use is Bobby Brown and more often than not it is the regular kind (not waterproof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can&#x27;t stand, is the container that this product comes in!  It isn&#x27;t a great idea...  I don&#x27;t like the idea of sticking my hand in the unused product.  I would rather have it in a tube to squeeze a little bit out at a time, or in a plastic bottle that I can dispense the amount I would like.  I also don&#x27;t have much counter-space in my bathroom so I could easily see me dropping this tub and all the contents spilling out everywhere.  The kicker for me is having that opportunity to introduce containments while you go through your daily routine of sticking your finger(s)/hand into the tub.  I know its not a huge deal breaker, but I would rather be able to squeeze the product out into my hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy.  You can remove eye make up with this, and you can even wash it off with water.  What more can you ask for?  This is the best.</li>
    <li> I love, love this makeup remover.  It is a consistency cross between a cream and a lotion which makes it easy to apply. It deep cleans and removes all of my makeup and leaves my face feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Came packaged neatly and the consistency was thorough throughout.</li>
    <li> Works well for removing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Price tag is not high.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cleanser that would remove all my makeup without drying out my skin, this does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have used Ponds Cucumber Cleanser and Makeup Remover for years.  It is light, not heavy and greasy like many cleansers.  It does a very good job of removing makeup and leaves my skin soft and blemish free.  I have sensitive skin and most skin cleansers break me out.  This is the only product that works for me and it performs beautifully.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product for many years. it is good for my skin leaving it feeling soft. and this cream really does remove my waterproof eye products flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I really like this cucumber scent.  It is so fresh &amp;  clean smelling!</li>
    <li> This leaves your face very clean, not greasy.  It does not dry out my skin either. Removes waterproof makeup great!</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent and deep cleaning action with no drying.  I love this stuff.  It is lighter than regular cold cream, which I find greasy.  It&#x27;s hard to find but worth the hunt.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good value great smell and it makes my face feel clean and soft. Will only use this product from now on</li>
    <li> I really like this; it&#x27;s not as heavy as cold cream, but it cleanses my face and leaves less residue. Rinses off well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an actor and wear make-up a lot.  For years I used Ponds Makeup Remover and then I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to get it through Amazon.  I love it.  It does the job well and I like both the smell and the feel of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 jars and foud lot of leakage when I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After examining, I found those caps and jars are designed for good sealing mechanism if they were tightened properly on production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might be loosen enough to leak on the transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder why they didn&#x27;t use some liquid resistant paper sealant on the jar opening, like many others do.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!! I love this product!!! It takes of everything, even the mascara!! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes! I&#x27;m buying more of this for sure!!</li>
    <li> I use this as well as my daughter and 22 year old granddaughter.  I&#x27;m older then dirt but they are always getting complements on their complexion.  Very hard to find in stores though.  I don&#x27;t know why Pond&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t push this product more.  Anyone we ever told about it loved it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  So glad to find the cleanser with Cucumber extract.</li>
    <li> I tried this one on my hand while I got it today. This product could easily remove the makeup from your skin and very moisturize. The only thing make it not perfect is the way that delivery made some of the cream out of the bottle. I think they should change better the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is non greasy but if any gets in your eyes, it causes an uncomfortable film that lasts a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for years and i will never change to anything else.. My daughter uses it to, since borrowing when visiting, because she forgot her makeup remover. i cleanse my face again in the morning with it then proceed  with my makeup , my makeup goes on smooth and my skin never feels dry with it under my makeup. I know they do not tell you to use it as a moisturizer, but i do because i love the way it makes my skin feel. Compared to other products of its kind it is so reasonable, and i wouldn&#x27;t care if it wasn&#x27;t,  I simply love it and, its light and smells good to. Try it after all what do you have to loose?, I just think its wonderful and I have dry skin but this makes it feel supple.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this cold cream to remove her make-up. It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin or eyes and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I used to think anything made by Pond&#x27;s was reserved for those women of a very different era; not so with this product.  As a make-up remover, this Pond&#x27;s product works well and is very light.</li>
    <li> It is a  great cleanser. Very happy with my  purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for decades and the main reason is that it removes make-up without drying your skin. I have actually used products such as this for my entire life. When one product disappears from the market, I look for another one with the same basic ingredients. I constantly get compliments on my complexion and products such as these are one reason why (that and good genes!)</li>
    <li> I love Pond&#x27;s cold cream.  I take off my stubborn eye mascara, liner, shadows in no time and it all comes off on one tissue.  I use it before bed to moisturize my face. It&#x27;s the best product on the market and cheap.  Go watch YOU TUBE on it...you can do more with it too.</li>
    <li> The smell and consistency just don&#x27;t work for me. Sorry, Ponds. I&#x27;m going back to the regular formulation.</li>
    <li> I have used this Ponds for years to remove makeup. Will not use anything else. There is nothing better and very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for some time for a good makeup remover but was worried about the oil content and my oily skin type.  Now that I am older and the oil has dried some, I was confident on using Ponds cold creme.  I love this product.  Not only does t remove all the make-up, but it makes my skin radiant and supple.  And I don&#x27;t have that dry skin feel after cleansing with this product.  I recently received a notice that this product will no longer be available.  And after looking for a while for this cleanser, I am upset that I will have to look again.  Maybe I will try the regular Pond&#x27;s cold creme.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser and don&#x27;t understand why it is no longer available at my local drug store chains. It is very effective and non greasy, lighter than cold cream yet removes makeup in a snap.</li>
    <li> I think is not really pons cream because is too liquid</li>
    <li> love this product because it is light and non greasy. So happy I found it on amazon as all drug stores I know stopped selling this.</li>
    <li> After trying many different make-up removers, none work like this one.  Its gentle around the eyes and takes off the mascara gently.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing cream. Soft and really fresh on my skin. Working well to clean up all the dirt or makeup on my face. I also can use this cream for massaging my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> Good - the only cleanser I really like and I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> the best makeup remover ever!</li>
    <li> smells lovely- not overpowering- and really does a good job moisturizing my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this make-up remover for so long. The reason why I love it so much is because when your put it on your eyes you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting in, you can open your eyes with a huge glob on and it won&#x27;t feel like anything. It removes everything fast and easy. You don&#x27;t have to rub constantly to remove makeup.  One application and all the make up is gone. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell but that&#x27;s personal choice...you get used to it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 yrs now. I scoop out generous amounts and plop onto my forehead, cheeks and chin then massage around my face to remove foundation, blush, powder and anything else I have on using cosmetic rounds - I go through both sides of 2 rounds in this process. I am careful to kind of drop the plops onto my face while trying not to let my fingers come in contact with my skin (so there&#x27;s a layer of cleanser in between my fingers and my skin), otherwise the makeup will end up back in the jar. Ew. It happens on occasion. Not pretty, but not a big deal as long as you scoop that little bit of nasty and use it at that moment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, cool scent and much lighter in texture than cold cream, of which I used to use Pond&#x27;s prior to converting to this much preferred product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by taking off my eyeliner and mascara with an oil makeup remover (right now Shu Uemura) then follow by using Pond&#x27;s for everything else. I then wash my face with a facial cleanser and take off any residue left around my lashes with a Q tip soaked Bi-facil. I have found Pond&#x27;s to do this better than any other cream cleanser I&#x27;ve tried. I stock up on the rare occasion I see this BOGO. Steal at that price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent makeup removal cream, especially if you suffer with dry skin like I do.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only a deep cleanser, but it moisturizes my face and I go to bed feeling all squeaky clean and refreshed. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even do it a second time during the day just to get any excess makeup off. Then after applying this, I&#x27;ll use a moisturizer and gel to lock it in. A moisturized face is a happy young face. If you have oily skin, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, since it does have an oily residue texture (which feels like heaven on my dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, do NOT use this on your eyes if you have sensitive eyes like I do. It made both my eyes swell up in the morning and tear for the entire day. It did take off the eye makeup, but I suffered all day after waking up with red itching eyes. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, then I don&#x27;t really see a problem using it. My sister and mother use it for eye makeup removal and have no problems. I&#x27;m just special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sufficient amount to last you quite a while. I&#x27;ve already had mine for about a month now and there&#x27;s still more to go. A little bit goes a long way. Make sure you rinse and wipe it off after applying it to your face. :)</li>
    <li> This is very light and easy to use.  I coat my face then wipe it off with a hot washcloth.  It leaves my skin feeling dewy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original Pond&#x27;s Cold Cream since I was a teenager for removing my makeup every night so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  The cucumber part of this smells great and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s nice on my skin but when I use this on my eye makeup, it slightly burns my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up.  Since the original works PERFECT ....I&#x27;ll just stick to that.</li>
    <li> I love and adore this Pond&#x27;s cleansing cream.  My grandmother used Pond&#x27;s cream, and&lt;br /&gt;it is still wonderful and feels great and works great!</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years and this is the best place to buy that we have found. The price is good and the service great. We will continue to buy and recommend this product. As always Amazon service and price are the best.</li>
    <li> Very good cleanser, it removes makeup and has a good smell, which i like.&lt;br /&gt;You will not need to put cream after it, as it moisturizing enough.&lt;br /&gt;3 pack is a huge amount, a had to present one to a fiend.&lt;br /&gt;One i am using already for 3 + months</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say, what do men know of these things? The woman was happy and her skin looks soft and smells fresh. so I guess all is well.</li>
    <li> This was surprisingly effective. I use sunscreen, foundation and blush and this takes it all off at the end of the day without leaving my skin feeling tight or dry. After washing the Pond&#x27;s off, I do wash my face with a facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it doesn&#x27;t work on is eye make-up, for which I have to use a separate cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it makes my skin smooth and silky and removes makeup easily too.  Hihgly recommended and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cleanser. I like to use this with a warm washcloth. I exfoliate and them rinse and leave the warm towel on my face for a bit and rinse with cooler water. Makes my face glow also a nice treat before bed. I have used higher end but nothing beats this. The smell is divine and it&#x27;s not greasy so I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Your products are amazing ..again great price for the size..this is really a great product to clean off make up. It really does what it says...</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for...  Not everyone carries this product, so I was glad to get a good supply for my mom.</li>
    <li> If you look in a 10x mirror after using this, you will find clear, clean pores.  This is the kind of Ponds that doesn&#x27;t feel thick, and has a mild scent. I have great skin and have been using Pond&#x27;s products for decades.</li>
    <li> Takes make up off better than so many other expensive products I have used. I can wash my face with a cleanser, use scrub cream, wipe with toner then wipe my face off with Ponds, I still get a make up residue and dirt on the cotton pad.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Pond&#x27;s products and loved how quickly this took off her waterproof mascara! It also  did a great job of hydrating and conditioning her face to a soft smooth finish! There were a few problems with the details of this sale item&#x27;s description but all worked out for the best! Thanks for the refund to rectify the situation! Over all a very positive experience with a product that is highly recommended by my wife! She is very happy with the solution and the miracles of this product! When mama&#x27;s happy...everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and really believe that it is the only make up remover to gently and completely remove my makeup. I will be re-ordering this product!</li>
    <li> i like this product because of its ability to remove make up and it has a very nice feel on the skin. it also has a nice smell, this is very natural smell. it doesnt to me smell like cucumber, i think nicer.&lt;br /&gt;i would recomend this to people that are over 30 simply because under that age i know i had more of an oily skin.  i can imagine anyone under that could use it. it would help at night for a full face remover. and cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is extremely hard to find in drug stores, WalMart, grocery stores, etc.  The consistency is very light but the product works so well and a little goes a long way.  It has a very nice, light, cucumber fragrance. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> As a person who wears (usually waterproof) eye makeup every single day in fairly large quantities, I&#x27;m always on the hunt for good makeup removers. I switched to Ponds products about a year ago, and I was fairly content with the result, especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;However, I ended up switching from my normal Ponds (cold cream, I think?) to this, since it was more economical, and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. The containers are large, with plenty of product. And the product itself is very effective. It has successfully removed 95% of my eye makeup every time, which is by far the best result I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye makeup removers (Neutrogena, Sonia Kashuk, etc), but after trying this one, I&#x27;m not going back.</li>
