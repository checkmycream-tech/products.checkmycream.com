<li> but it loses all value if it needs to be moved to a different spot.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s plastic and provides a very sharp mirror image.</li>
<li> so I can see who is coming up behind me and to check my appearance.  </li>
<li> I had coworkers sneak up behind me and scare the $#!@</li>
<li> the bad part is the hook is glued on, no magnets involved.  </li>

    <li> Great mirror for locker! I have it at work and it gets plenty of use and abuse! LOL it has fallen on floor many times (no scratches!)is very light and holds up great. Oh, mirror is clear with no distortion and came with hook to hang up. Holds up to locker slamming shut without any issues. I have recommended to coworkers.</li>
    <li> I am actually using this mirror in my cubicle at work!  I have it set so I can see who is coming up behind me and to check my appearance.  It is just the right size to easily see myself and the entire area behind me!  I also appreciate that it is unbreakable, but shows a great image.</li>
    <li> This mirror is currently in my locker looking great ad stylish. I love it . It is clear and very unbreakable. I have managed to drop it many times when I was moving things around and its tough. It is really convenient to have the hook that helps it hang and stay in place. I don&#x27;t have no complaints and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Before I got this mirror I had coworkers sneak up behind me and scare the $#!@ out of me. Now I can see my Ninja quiet coworkers from a mile away and have time to counter their attacks. Thanks Unbreakable Locker Mirror!</li>
    <li> Exactly the product you expect.  Packed well, good mirror, light weight.  Good size.  I ordered it for traveling, as my long term glass mirror in the plastic frame finally bit the dust.  I haven&#x27;t used the hanging hook, but I enjoyed being able to hang in on a hook on the door of my cabin on a cruise.  At home, I have a 3 way mirror on one wall and a straight mirror opposite it to see the back of my hair.  On the cruise, I was able to angle the open door with this mirror hanging from it well enough to see the back of my in the over the sink mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Left it in the suitcase for the next trip, so I don&#x27;t forget to pack it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for my locker at work.  It is light  and hangs well from the included hanger.  It&#x27;s plastic and provides a very sharp mirror image.</li>
    <li> Mirror has a great reflection and image.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;I love that is removable.</li>

    <li> Perfect for setting up mirror at toddler height for brushing their teeth</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly as described. I haven&#x27;t used the stick-on hook it came with because I can&#x27;t decide where I want it. Anyway, it&#x27;s light-weight, so I was able to use thumbtacks to hang it up on the wall for a more temporary solution. The mirror is nice and clear, and I like how there is no warping as well.</li>
    <li> durable and wont break in my daughters locker.</li>
    <li> What a great little mirror.  I like the feel and looks of it and it is distortion free.</li>
    <li> This mirror is purchased for a locker for a middle school girl.  It has sticky adhesive on the back which I removed and hot glued rare earth magnets because the school will not allow anything adhesive attached to lockers.  I knew this before I purchased the mirror so I am not deducting stars.  Last year I bought my daughter a locker mirror and it broke the first time it was dropped.  Although this one has not been dropped, it feels like it would not break very easily.  She (and her friends) also like how it can be removed to look at themselves and then hung back up.  I think this one will last all year unlike others I&#x27;ve purchased.  Also it doesn&#x27;t distort your image like other locker mirrors do.  Very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone who wants to purchase a mirror for their locker.</li>
    <li> I carried it to the nursing home and wanted to make sure no one got hurt. I practiced dropping it and it didn&#x27;t break. The reflection is really crisp. Good for young people and nursing. I really like the fact is helps soecial needs as well.</li>
    <li> Great mirror!  Does the job.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Would buy again! Quality made. Its light, durable, sturdy, has rounded edges, for safe handling.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I imagined it, but it does the job</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror for my newborn since most newborn mirrors are totally warped like funhouse mirrors. I love it! It&#x27;s absolutely unbreakable so I feel safe leaving it with her alone and on her playmat on the floor. Reflection is perfect. Works great!</li>
    <li> Clear reflection image and after many drops, no damage!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an ultrasound tech and hung his inside one of the cabinet doors in my exam room.  You know, for those quick hair/face/teeth checks.  The hook hasn&#x27;t fallen off or come loose.  I love that it hangs on a hook, so I can remove it if I need to.</li>
