      <li>but i wish they were better quality.</li>
      <li>So glad I found the one part we needed.</li>

      <li>My peanut is good as new!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>As far as funtionality, they are just as effective as the orginals (which is extremely effective).  </li>
      <li>Worked out fine.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick!</li>
      <li>Fit my Wahl Peanut just fine.  </li>
      <li>I did not feel totally comfortable with.</li>
      <li>they had more lenght&#x27;s but the ones they have are good enough!</li>
      <li>and it was great to be able to replace it quickly instead of buying a whole new clipper.</li>
      <li>This set comes with the original combs that came with the peanut, there are 4.  </li>
      <li>About as close as you can get to the original parts.</li>
      <li>These replacements combs match the quality of the original.  </li>
      <li>Not quite the quality of the original attachments.</li>
      <li>Broke the edge on my original #3.</li>
      <li>My original was shattered when the clippers was accidently dropped.  </li>
      <li>then the original combs, but they still do the job.</li>
      <li>Glad I found these at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>These combs are the exact fit for my razor.  </li>
      <li>These were perfect replaced to my old guards, which broke due to overuse.</li>
      <li>and they are exactly what came with my peanut~!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed, gives me a close clean shave without making me bald because of the guard.</li>
      <li>The guides fit my 10 year old wahl peanut just fine.</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement for broken attachments.</li>
      <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t  have to buy a whole new clipper as well!</li>
      <li>This saved me from having to buy a whole new Peanut trimmer since the clip I use the most broke when I was removing it from the trimmer.</li>
      <li>Getting it on the internet was quick and we didn&#x27;t have to spend a large amount of money to replace it.</li>
      <li>Too bad the smallest guard does not come with the peanut, but I love it, very happy camper ;0)</li>
      <li>These actually clip onto my Peanut better than the older, original ones I have.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for my peanut razor.  </li>
      <li>so I was willing to spend the money for a replacement guide set.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen the replacement combs in a beauty supply store where I purchased this so discovering this assembly of attachments was a real coup!  </li>
      <li>These items are a fair price as many beuty supply stores, such as Sally&#x27;s, sell items much more expensive than amazon.  </li>
      <li>I still have the original 3 larger ones to compare, and the size, quality, and fit is just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved me from replacing my 3yr old peanut!</li>
      <li>These work great, but were black not white.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a handy little trimmer</li>
      <li>Received fast.</li>
      <li>The fit my trimmer and are the same as the ones it came with.</li>
      <li>The modified comb workd very well on the sides of my head.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>That said, the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>cheaper than having to buy a whole unit for a #2 guide</li>
      <li>I wish you could buy just one size instead of the whole set.</li>
      <li>I broke the original low guard</li>
      <li>quality is not the same as original that came with machine, but it works.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them because of their quality and fast shipment.</li>
      <li>If I did not like the shaver so much, I would not buy the new combs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fit my Wahl Peanut just fine.  I had lost my #2 attachment comb, so I had to buy the new set because it didn&#x27;t make sense to just try to buy the #2 itself.  These actually clip onto my Peanut better than the older, original ones I have.</li>
    <li> I buy this set because my orininals one were broken, but the small one in this set, is not the same side that I have in the original, I need a small one to leave my bear very short.</li>
    <li> These combs are the exact fit for my razor.  I am really happy with Goodman&#x27;s for providing exactly what I needed and very quickly I might add.</li>
    <li> Received fast. Product was as described.</li>
    <li> The work as a replacement but the plastic that they are made of tends to stick to your face while your trimming which can make for discomfort or pain if you happen to poke yourself with them. Better than nothing but i wish they were better quality. Be careful with them as they feel flimsy, like they will break any minute.</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived very fast in in perfect condition. I was more than happy with my purchase. I highly recommend.Use for all your Wahl needs!</li>
    <li> Fit the clipper perfectly. Not quite the quality of the original attachments.</li>
    <li> Attachments did not fit as well as the original.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Wahl Peanut trimmer for quite some time and it works great.  It is unfortunate that the smallest comb broke so I had to get it replace.  I&#x27;d give it the item 5 stars if the clips were sold individually.  Now I have extra clips which aren&#x27;t used that often.</li>
    <li> I only needed the shortest guide, having dropped my trimmer and broken the original. It&#x27;s a handy little trimmer so I was willing to spend the money for a replacement guide set.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like Wahl products, but in this case the combs simply did not arrive.  Two other satisfactory Wahl products from the same seller did arrive -- a clipper blade replacement and oil for it. So, I contacted the seller as instructed.  The phone responder was very pleasant, but insisted they were sent to my address, and &amp;#34;therefore&amp;#34; I should have received them.  Maybe I should wait a few more days.  I did but they never arrived.  I finally concluded that pursuing the matter further would be costlier than treating it as &amp;#34;no big deal.&amp;#34;  It was a decision I did not feel totally comfortable with.</li>
    <li> Replace old attachment</li>
    <li> this is an excellent product, and I could not have found any better for the price. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  This saved me from having to buy a whole new Peanut trimmer since the clip I use the most broke when I was removing it from the trimmer.</li>
    <li> These clips are a great replacement for my Wahl Peanut. I would highly recommend them because of their quality and fast shipment.</li>
    <li> They showed up in my mail box in a couple of days. The fit my trimmer and are the same as the ones it came with. I just wish I could order just the one I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love the clippers but the guides are a bit flimsy. I&#x27;ve bought two additional sets of guides for one set of clippers... The trick is keeping them tucked safely away from heavier things during travel...thinks like cans of shaving cream... Also wish I could only buy the guide(s) I need rather than the set.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> One of the combs was broken of course the one we use the most and we didn&#x27;t want to have to buy the whole thing new. Getting it on the internet was quick and we didn&#x27;t have to spend a large amount of money to replace it. It would have been nice if they offered just the one piece we needed but, it was ok anyway.</li>
    <li> Fits the Peanut to a tee and replaces my broken combs. About as close as you can get to the original parts.</li>
    <li> THE COMBS DO NOT WORK AS WELL AS THE SINGLE BLADE AS OF YET HOWEVER, I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM AND REPOST IF I GET BETTER RESULTS.</li>
    <li> About 3 weeks ago my smallest comb broke and thats what I use for a number of my grooming needs.  Therefore, I hopped on Amazon and found these replacements.  They seem to be made of the same plastic as the originals, which lasted me upwards of 5 or 6 years.  The color is a little bit lighter and not all the markings are exactly identical, but you will barely notice these aesthetic differences.  This set comes with the original combs that came with the peanut, there are 4.  As far as funtionality, they are just as effective as the orginals (which is extremely effective).  The Wahl Peanut is the best trimmer/shaver I have ever owned and has lasted over 6 years.  These replacements combs match the quality of the original.  These items are a fair price as many beuty supply stores, such as Sally&#x27;s, sell items much more expensive than amazon.  I highly recommend these for those in need of peanut replacement combs.</li>
    <li> Although I only use one of these, they come in a set.  That said, the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I broke a couple of attachments on my peanut razor and bought this as a replacement. The fit is a little loose but the razor functions and cuts properly. They are sturdy replacements and have lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> These were perfect replaced to my old guards, which broke due to overuse. I recommend these to fans of the Wahl Peanut.</li>
    <li> The picture showed the attachment combs in white and the ones that I received were black.  Otherwise, am satisified with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Needed small one that broke.  Worked out fine.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for my peanut razor.  I only needed one of the attachements but couldn&#x27;t find it alone, I had to buy in the group of 4.  Happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> It arrived few days after I ordered it. Fits perfectly. The only downside is that it was black and it did not mention that anywhere</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain. The guides fit my 10 year old wahl peanut just fine. Kudos to wahl, they have a great product.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have bought several of these combs. If I did not like the shaver so much, I would not buy the new combs. Unfortunately  the combs are not well made and break often.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for broken attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought all but for the smallest comb . This is the scam of the Wahl Corp.Only the smallest comb breaks.</li>
    <li> I order the set of peanut clip guards and it came with fast shipping but the only thing was it wasn&#x27;t not the same as the same color on the pictures that were white. I recieved set of the color black. But who cares they work just the same. OVER ALL I was satisfied</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and does the trick. I accidentally threw the attachments away when I got the Wahl Peanut. Glad I found these at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works perfect on the peanut and battery operated peanut!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace one of my attachments which had broken after 15 years of use...this replacement fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> We have a &amp;#34;Little Peanut&amp;#34; clipper set. I broke one of the attachments, got on Amazon.com and there it was. Thank you that I did not have to go out and purchase another clipper set. So glad I found the one part we needed.</li>
    <li> so happy to have gotten the replacement clipper attachments for the Peanut Hair Clipper, it was so much cheaper to replace the combs and not the clipper. Hubby is happy therefore I am happy.</li>
    <li> I love my peanut and one of my children used an attachment and liked it so much they kept it! So I needed to replace it. For some reason the replacement is black and not white which I would have preferred...it was white in the pic!!!!!</li>
    <li> These clips were a life saver! I broke the original low guard (that is the only one I use), and let me tell you I thought these weren&#x27;t going to work. But that was not the case! Clipped right on to my peanut, and we are back up and running! A must buy if you break any of your guards.</li>
    <li> The only guide i use with my wahl broke.  It came down to having a jacked up haircut, having no haircut, or saving the day.  I saved the day, for cheap, got em fast, cut my hair, look great, &amp;#34;saved the cheerleader and saved the world&amp;#34;. Why else do you think they canceled Heroes.  Because it was over, I cut my hair with these new guides, saved a ton doing it, looked great, and saved the cheerleader/world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and maybe you can prevent the next apocalypse.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, gives me a close clean shave without making me bald because of the guard. Too bad the smallest guard does not come with the peanut, but I love it, very happy camper ;0)</li>
    <li> Replace a broken comb and it was an exact match. I recomend this to anyone with a peanut or cordless personal groomer.</li>
    <li> Got these for my Mag clipper.&lt;br /&gt;They work great.  Easy to use and convenient!&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had more lenght&#x27;s but the ones they have are good enough!</li>
    <li> The attachments were not as pictured. They are generic attachments and not even white, they were black. I hate it when you buy something and get something totally different. When I called about it, I was basically blown off and told they would work the same. So if you are thinking that you&#x27;ll get what&#x27;s pictured you won&#x27;t which I think is false advertisement.</li>
    <li> Wish they came in black. When we moved I think I threw the originals glad to have them.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. It fits and works and was a good price.</li>
    <li> We had broken a couple of the teeth off our old one. This was exactly the same and allowed me to continue to cut my husbands hair, but he got an even haircut again!</li>
    <li> cheaper than having to buy a whole unit for a #2 guide</li>
    <li> I broke one of my combs and need to replace it. My son has the same clipper so I bought the set and share with him Great match.</li>
    <li> These replacement combs were a necessity for me. The 1 Clip broke and I desperately needed it. Very inexpensive for a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these combs to replace a broken comb for my wahl peanut clipper. I was able to sand down the second from the shortest so that I now have a comb between very short and short. The modified comb workd very well on the sides of my head.</li>
    <li> Replacements are perfect, It was a relief to find them and a great bargain</li>
    <li> Good purchase.  I wish you could buy just one size instead of the whole set.</li>
    <li> They show a white set but mine came all black. I needed them badly so I kept the black ones.</li>
    <li> Everything was great including the price. Would recommend this product to anyone that has a Wahl Peanut clipper. The attachments work great.</li>
    <li> quality is not the same as original that came with machine, but it works. afraid though that it will eventually break.</li>
    <li> All Good ... Recommended ...</li>
    <li> These work great, but were black not white.</li>
    <li> Not many options when replacing these. The outside &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are a little sharp</li>
    <li> Excellent its fit perfect with my wahl peanut device</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, fue par aun regalo y a la persona que se lo di le gusto igual que a mi, lo volveria a comprar!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They work great!!  I broke the one we use all of the time and it was great to be able to replace it quickly instead of buying a whole new clipper.</li>
    <li> I use these for trimming my beard when I am traveling. These are not barber shop quality combs but for the price of these and wahl peanut they make a nice beginner set for self grooming.</li>
    <li> It was great deal and great product.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell anyone that needs a good product to get this trimmer. It works great the part are easy to replaces.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and wanted. Delivery was quick! I&#x27;m very happy :)</li>
    <li> Broke the edge on my original #3. Ordered the replacement comb pack just for the #3. Noticed the replacement comb are not as sturdy (thinner plastic) then the original combs, but they still do the job.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> They work great! Nothing else to say about em&#x27; Plastic guards.</li>
    <li> These attachment pieces have worked great as replacements! They aren&#x27;t as thick as original attachments but it saved me from buying a whole new peanut clipper. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and great product!</li>
    <li> They fit my clipper perfectly</li>
    <li> They were the correct ones.  A little slow on delivery.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I lost the small &#x27;comb&#x27; (or one of my dogs stole it) - which I use for my beard weekly.  Just got these and they are exactly what came with my peanut~!  I still have the original 3 larger ones to compare, and the size, quality, and fit is just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved me from replacing my 3yr old peanut!</li>
    <li> They work great.....They are just like the attachments I got when I purchased this product 2 years ago.  It was money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have had my Peanut for 3 years, so glad the attachments are sold alone.&lt;br /&gt;Durable, (not easy to break but I managed ) clip on attachments</li>
    <li> My peanut keeps on chugging along year after year however I can&#x27;t say the same for the blades that it came with.  We&#x27;ve lost some teeth on the combs.  I&#x27;ve never seen the replacement combs in a beauty supply store where I purchased this so discovering this assembly of attachments was a real coup!  My peanut is good as new!</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely fashion, and all that I had hoped for.  My original was shattered when the clippers was accidently dropped.  Glad I didn&#x27;t  have to buy a whole new clipper as well!</li>
