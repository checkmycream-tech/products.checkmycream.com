      <li>The price was a mitigating factor, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it smells nice!</li>

      <li>Has super strong fragrance from all the parfum they put in it</li>
      <li>it leaves my skin supple and fresh, not oily at all!</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know which was a bigger factor in convincing me to buy this skin cream:</li>
      <li>it feels fresh, clean and smooth</li>
      <li>This product is packed full of chemicals they do not tell you about in the product details.  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s a plus overall good face and neck cream.</li>
      <li>It is chalked full of chemicals, parfum, and they say snail extract.</li>
      <li>and it is super greasy.  </li>
      <li>Ok, so I needed a new and this packing caught my attention.</li>
      <li>immediately, I was &amp;#34;grossed&amp;#34; out by snail cream, but the&lt;br /&gt;word &amp;#34;collagen&amp;#34;, I was interested again!</li>
      <li>Fresh scent, and can even use it before I apply Make Up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all, it absorbs just at the right time...</li>

      <li>So far only used on hands, it smells really good and really keeps my skin moistured.</li>
      <li>I put it everywhere with the hope my skin will stay young and sundamaged free,  </li>
      <li>, I first bought this product from another website for 3 times the price (they still sell it at an outrages price)</li>
      <li>paid $3.50, after just the first use I saw improvement on my skin</li>
      <li>that was cheap and I was lucky enough to get some type of results.</li>
      <li>Using it with my other products and loving it.</li>
      <li>so glad I stumble upon the product on AMAZON....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found something that is not outrageously overpriced that really gives noticeable results, especially fading the dark spots which I did not expect to improve very much.</li>
      <li>am not sure if this cream really contains snail slub, but actually as a moisturizing cream is very good</li>
      <li>SKIN CREAM - LARGE 200g (6.7 fl.</li>
      <li>It really helps to diminish lines from my face, neck area and soften feet.</li>
      <li>ver much.  </li>

      <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something strange that happens to products when you fall in love with them, they suddenly become unavailable or discontinued.</li>
      <li>My little dog tries to lick it off me, it is so good.  </li>
      <li>must say that I noticed a greater improvement when I followed the directions for massaging the cream in small circles.&lt;br</li>

    <li> am not sure if this cream really contains snail slub, but actually as a moisturizing cream is very good,i got it, because always wanted to try the ingredient, i found this cheap at the store and i had to get it, i dont expect miracles, i been buying more expensive face creams for dark spots and that kind of inperfections, and of course doesnt work, but this cream the first time i put it on my face completly got me to keep using it it feels fresh, clean and smooth, i highly recomend this cream as a regular face cream or for base of foundation, i use liquid make up, so this help me blend it on my skin better, a bit of make up and cream and u will get a nice complexion.</li>
    <li> Very good not oily,  came way before it&#x27;s expected time and my acne scars are almost gone!!</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know which was a bigger factor in convincing me to buy this skin cream: the word \\&quot;collagen,\\&quot; or the photo of a glossy snail slithering across what I imagine is someone&#x27;s skin. The price was a mitigating factor, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it smells nice! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks, so I can&#x27;t attest to its skin-firming properties, but so far I&#x27;m enjoying it as a nighttime cream.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and I ll continue using it bcos it&#x27;s so good on my body,plz I will make new orders again soon</li>
    <li> I love it... make my face smoothie...!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not oily at all so can slather on a lot or a little and you will not be a grease ball. It does not break out my sensitive skin too so that&#x27;s a plus overall good face and neck cream.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it through amozon cuz this is expensive on here, go to your local pharmacy...i.e. walgreens, riteaid, or cvs and it costs less than $4! anyway, after every shower i take, specially during winter..my skin is always very dry and tight. Some face creams would be too greasy, others absorbed way too fast, this one is very nice! it leaves my skin supple and fresh, not oily at all! i use it as a night cream, before applying make up...under my eyes..on my hands and neck. it&#x27;s just wonderful, and it&#x27;s so cheap..i used to use neutrogena but the bottle was very small and cost around $25! i also used olay with the same price, it was just too expensive. and i thought this one would smell bad but it doesnt! love it. :)</li>
    <li> This face cream is really nice. Leaves skin nice and smooth and no greasy feeling. Also no perfume odor that can be rather strong. Will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Love it I buy it over and over and over.  I put it everywhere with the hope my skin will stay young and sundamaged free,  I put it on my dogs elbows and ankles which have become thickened and getting infected, they are much better now</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizer.i have bought from this seller several times and you can be assured this product and the seller deliver.Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent face cream!!! My face looks fresh, healthier, great moisturizer I just love it!!! I founded at Walmart for 5.99!! Great price for a great product&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is not shiny or greasy and feels great on your face.  But today I found this product at my local drugstore for $5.25.</li>
    <li> Product well packaged, arrived quickly &amp; feels good on skin&lt;br /&gt;I like it as a body lotion cream.  Prefer another product for my face&lt;br /&gt;Because of perfumed smell.  Pleasant smelling, rubs into skin evenly&lt;br /&gt;A good product.</li>
    <li> This product makes my 53 year old skin soft, hydrated and soothed.  It a must for you if you use any kind of retinol or product that dries/irritates skin.  I often layer this silky soft  cream over the Baba de Caracol Snail gel for extra firming but this cream on it&#x27;s own is a MUST HAVE for me.</li>
    <li> Check the Andes Honeybee Cream comment....I have re-discovered the best stuff is made from your own hands, from your own cupboards..</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few weeks now! Not finding anything different with my face! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product. There were no benefits to using it, as it did nothing but made my face disgustingly slimy and sticky.  Won&#x27;t recommend or repurchase.</li>
    <li> So disappointing after everything Ive read on this &#x27;snail goo&#x27; phenomenon. The smell is awful and too fragranced, over powering to say the least. But most importantly,  I didnt see any noticeable results that are claimed.. Maybe if I purchased one that was 100% organic?</li>
    <li> Irritated the sides of my nose a bit, but no other reaction on my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; skin.  Absorbed nicely.  Also, it&#x27;s only four bucks at Family Dollar!</li>
    <li> As a woman of color, having combination(mostly oily) skin. immediately, I was &amp;#34;grossed&amp;#34; out by snail cream, but the&lt;br /&gt;word &amp;#34;collagen&amp;#34;, I was interested again! I found a little DEFINITELY goes a long way! I utilize it as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt; It also worked for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something strange that happens to products when you fall in love with them, they suddenly become unavailable or discontinued. What&#x27;s up with that? I can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore, it&#x27;s nice to find it here on Amazon however the high shipping cost takes away from the excitement. I like this product, it works for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff it makes your skin feel really good. I have recommend to my friends. I not getting paid to say this btw.</li>
    <li> HAVE PURCHASE this cream at wal mart. Honestly best cream ever. Its not oily, and dark spots disappear. Fresh scent, and can even use it before I apply Make Up.</li>
    <li> my skin is already sagging and wrinkled and I was looking for a cream and saw this at my H.E.B paid $3.50, after just the first use I saw improvement on my skin, I could not believe that something this cheap could work this good, my skin feels and looks good helped with sagging and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> 1rst time using it and I like it ver much.  I will continue using it. I like the price too.</li>
    <li> I really can not tell a difference after using this cream for the past month.  I will keep on using it but if I do not see any results, I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It says diminish expression lines, and I think it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;No, it does not remove deep wrinkles and it does not state it on the container so you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin soft and it makes me look less tired. That is the main reason why I bought it.. I am 22 years old&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get much sleep for my age because of college and full time job.. My face always look worn down and there is some wrinkles under my eyes. This is what something I found that was cheap and I was lucky enough to get some type of results. I wear this twice a day, Morning and Bedtime.</li>
    <li> I happened to see this out of the corner of my eye and noticed there was only one left in the display. There were other Andes creams but I figured this stuff must be good although the idea of snail slimy goo didn&#x27;t sound appealing to me. I did a quick google search on my phone, read some reviews here at Amazon, and I grabbed the last container.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I noticed right away how nice my skin absorbed it and how soft it felt.&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed fading of dark spots from blemishes and freckles. I bought my cream at Walmart for $3.58. It reminds me of the original Pond&#x27;s cream my grandma used, same scent and light creaminess without leaving any oily or tacky residue.  I also noticed I am using less foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I noticed a greater improvement when I followed the directions for massaging the cream in small circles.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels tighter and it looks firmer, especially my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;I am Hispanic, tan complexion, normal to dry skin and 49 yrs old. I&#x27;m so glad that I found something that is not outrageously overpriced that really gives noticeable results, especially fading the dark spots which I did not expect to improve very much.</li>
    <li> Just received the item today and can&#x27;t wait to try it! It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought, and very good price. Okay the most important is the product itself. My skin is dry, the cream is really moisturizing and absorbed instantly (tried on hand). For the face, I used it as a facial mask. So I put a lot, and waited about 10-15 minutes then rinse off before put serum and night cream. I think next time, I will apply a warm towel on the face to open more the pores, and then use it as a mask. I think it will help moisturizer to penetrate into the skin. I recommend it if you have dry skin and little budget.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of this product at Wal mart, and was so amazed at how much better my face looked and felt I bought it here on line since I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store, but after ordering I did find it a Fiesta grocerys and bought more so i won&#x27;t run out. I recommend this product highly. it absorbs into the skin nice and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable after using this product for only a few days.</li>
    <li> Would buy again a friend told me about it makes my skin feel gr  toeat not greasy will recommend yes to a friend</li>
    <li> Me gusto pero nada especial</li>
    <li> This Product is amazing and gives amazing results. My primary use for the product is my face and neck but I also use it on problem body areas such as my feet and thighs. It really helps to diminish lines from my face, neck area and soften feet. I also find it help with the cellulite areas on my thighs, I first bought this product from another website for 3 times the price (they still sell it at an outrages price) so glad I stumble upon the product on AMAZON....</li>
    <li> Amazing product.as good as my Obagi body lotion.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping.  Using it with my other products and loving it.</li>
    <li> the best face cream outhere</li>
    <li> Ok, so I needed a new and this packing caught my attention. &amp; well lets just say this with be my face cream until my last breath on this earth. Love, Love, love.</li>
    <li> I bought  from you the Andes Nature Cosmetic Snail Extract Cream 5 pieces, but you sent me  SNAIL EXTRACT COLLAGEN ANTI AGEING REPAIR MOISURISER FACE BODY HAND SKIN CREAM - LARGE 200g (6.7 fl. oz). way? please resend me again, so items that I have bought for sure. i don&#x27;t want this items,  I did not order these items.  Give me back the items that I bought from you.  They differ from each other in weight and color. Do not lie me and send me the items that I bought from you.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreens because I was attracted to the snail thing...&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it has any or not but I the price was great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite impressed with this moisturizer! I usually use Clarins from Paris (which I still adore!)but&lt;br /&gt;this moisturizer is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all, it absorbs just at the right time...&lt;br /&gt;the face feels moisture and not dry but never greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great too...very moisturizing without being greasy and&lt;br /&gt;the texture it leaves is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin in terms of texture, hydration and a very beautiful natural glow!&lt;br /&gt;it did seem to remove some spots because my face looks clearer...</li>
    <li> An excellent and relatively inexpensive face cream. Excellent results are obtained after only two weeks of use. I use it always&lt;br /&gt;after shaving</li>
    <li> So far only used on hands, it smells really good and really keeps my skin moistured. Will try to use it on my chin, has seriously pore problem</li>
    <li> This has helped tighten my skin...helps keep my skin clear of acne and smells great! It&#x27;s light weight not greasy or heavy. %100 recommend</li>
    <li> The best thing about this cream for me is that it doesn&#x27;t incite acne, and maybe even attacks it, with none of the harshness or sunburn danger of benzoyl peroxide. If you get acne, cleaning with a strong wash and then using this cream might get rid of it, or at least control it. Just don&#x27;t contaminate the cream with germs using dirty fingers.</li>
    <li> Cheapest, best wrinkle action on the market.  Really brings out the best in your skin.</li>
    <li> I have been reading that snail extract is all the rage maybe but not in this product.  This product is packed full of chemicals they do not tell you about in the product details.  Has super strong fragrance from all the parfum they put in it and it is super greasy.  Made my face break out really bad. I would not suggest this to anyone that is looking for an organic product without chemicals.  It is chalked full of chemicals, parfum, and they say snail extract. But not sure that is true.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so good all over when I put this wonderful product on it.  Face, hands, legs, all over.  Wonderfully qualtiy that is very affordable.  My little dog tries to lick it off me, it is so good.  Highly recommended.  Those women in South America that used it for years and kept it secret were no fools.  Who needsx to buy $100 products for the skin when this works bettter.</li>
