      <li>very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>So, basically had to take it all off and just pour out as best</li>
      <li>An EXCELLENT skin cream, recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>I am very glad and happy to recommend it!</li>
      <li>Works great on the skin.</li>
      <li>I suppose this might be a good moisturizer if you have oily skin...</li>
      <li>I am happy with my purchase. :)</li>
      <li>I have tried many face creams but none worked as great as the cream.</li>
      <li>Love it and a great gtreat price.</li>
      <li>Although I understand that each person has their own preference for a product, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like an SPF.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, fair skin, and this is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the REVALE SKIN DAY CREAM.  </li>
      <li>The part I&#x27;m not so sure about yet</li>
      <li>I use Revaleskin Day cream every day and love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product if you get the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Glad I was able to get it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Jo</li>
      <li>I love the fact it has spf in it</li>
      <li>I have hypermigmentation and fine lines through my cheeks and the redness is going away and the fine lines seem like they are diminishing!</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on smoothly but leaves a fine residue.</li>
      <li>A great product that serves both per pose of facial cream + sun screen</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel smooth with no sticky feel.  </li>
      <li>a price way more reasonable than most.  </li>
      <li>+ is very economical in use.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and makes my skin feel soft</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find Amazon carried Revaleskin at a lower price and a much longer shelf life.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s keeping my face moisturized adequately throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and</li>
      <li>My skin always has the right amount of moisture (not too oily, not too dry) even in my problem areas and the SPF protects very nicely against sunburn.</li>
      <li>The printing on the bottle washed off with water [a clue that it wasn&#x27;t the real stuff] and the cream was grainy as if it had fine sand in it,  When I contacted the company that shipped it, WhySkin?</li>
      <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t use a pricier product like this, but found a good deal on Amazon on two different occasions.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a little over a year and love how it makes my skin feel, the spf is good and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love this product and find it hard to find in stores any more.  </li>
      <li>I use this as my day moisturizer, it&#x27;s SPF is only 15, but still it is better than most other moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that works for your skin, get a Eucerin day lotion with SPF, a prescribed Retin-A for night time and Cetaphil cream to put on top of Retin A since your skin will become dry.</li>
      <li>And, I suggest giving it 2-3 weeks to really see an effect of the coffeeberry.</li>
      <li>Alsp, people think I&#x27;m in my early thirties when I&#x27;m 40, so the produc must be doing something right.</li>
      <li>Although I love this product, will not buy it anymore due to this issue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so far, so I can&#x27;t give a review on anti-aging effects yet, but I feels good going on, it soaks into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feeling, it leaves a matte finish.</li>
      <li>this is a 1 not due to the product however this is counterfeit, the lettering started to wipe right off and the pump worked 4 times.</li>
      <li>I am a very active person and love the outdoors.</li>
      <li>It has a faint smell of coffee to it, which is a pleasant wake-up when applying in the morning.</li>
      <li>but so far no changes are visible.</li>
      <li>Day Cream packaging arrived a bit crushed, the label was on crooked and not containing the same info as my original packaging and the exp date was obviously rubbed off.</li>
      <li>Something doesn&#x27;t seem right when the product only lists 2 active ingredients (both are sunscreen).</li>
      <li>I have very dry sensitive skin and rosacea, this minimizes the red and leaves my skin feeling silky an nourished</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the fact it has spf in it and it makes my skin feel smooth with no sticky feel.  Some are saying the pump is bad but if you just put your finger toward the front spout when pumping you wont break it. Just a matter of being smarter than the pump.</li>
    <li> MBARK says--- I LOVE the REVALE SKIN DAY CREAM.  I have only been using it for 1 week and can tell a difference in my tone and texture.  I have hypermigmentation and fine lines through my cheeks and the redness is going away and the fine lines seem like they are diminishing! My skin actually feels stronger! I just received the night cream - cant wait to use it and see the results.   very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> i have been ordering this product for about 2 and 1/2 years from from Amazon. Initially, I received it from my Dermatologist. I have been saving some money ordering both the Night cream and the Day Cream from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My Day Cream packaging arrived a bit crushed, the label was on crooked and not containing the same info as my original packaging and the exp date was obviously rubbed off. Am I supposed to accept this? I am disappointed in Amazon quality control. It needs to be tightened up. In the future I am ordering these skin care products from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;What little money saved is not worth the hassle of wondering if a skin care product is expired. Amazon does not seem to care as others have written the same review previously. It&#x27;s shameful and exploitive.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find Amazon carried Revaleskin at a lower price and a much longer shelf life.  Also, the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> An EXCELLENT skin cream, recommended by my dermatologist. I have sensitive, fair skin, and this is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased. My skin always has the right amount of moisture (not too oily, not too dry) even in my problem areas and the SPF protects very nicely against sunburn. It has a faint smell of coffee to it, which is a pleasant wake-up when applying in the morning.</li>
    <li> At the suggestion of an article on Women&#x27;s Health Magazine, I brought RevaleSkin Day Cream.   I have combination skin and the day cream feels very thick on me.  I tried it out for a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t see any differences on my skin tone.  In fact, my skin started to break out which prompted me to quit using the cream immediately.  Something doesn&#x27;t seem right when the product only lists 2 active ingredients (both are sunscreen).</li>
    <li> What can you say?  Revale is the best.  Love it and a great gtreat price. Works great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many face creams but none worked as great as the cream. Since I use my skin has become much younger and my wrinkles were visibly diminished. I am very glad and happy to recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and find it hard to find in stores any more.  Glad I was able to get it on line.&lt;br /&gt;Jo Jo</li>
    <li> A great product that serves both per pose of facial cream + sun screen + is very economical in use. My fourth year of daily use.</li>
    <li> Been using only 2 weeks. It smells nice and makes my skin feel soft but so far no changes are visible. Will see after a month or two.</li>
    <li> this is a 1 not due to the product however this is counterfeit, the lettering started to wipe right off and the pump worked 4 times. I compared it to the one from the dermatologist and it did not wipe off. I threw it out I was so upset from getting ripped off.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product has been discontinued.  It&#x27;s a great product if you get the real thing.  I ordered it because it was on sale but didn&#x27;t open it until about 10 months later.  The printing on the bottle washed off with water [a clue that it wasn&#x27;t the real stuff] and the cream was grainy as if it had fine sand in it,  When I contacted the company that shipped it, WhySkin?, I got a very nasty reply.  I let the matter drop - I should have pursued it but didn&#x27;t.  Do NOT buy from WhySkin?  Revaleskin, Skin Medica and Skinceuticals all warn about counterfeit products.  Now I believe them.</li>
    <li> I last bought revale day cream in July for $71.21 for 1.7 ounces in July of this year. The product is now listed on your site at $104. Why the increase?</li>
    <li> Product is great, but container is awful.  This is the second bottle I have purchased and BOTH had issues.  After 1-2 weeks in each case, the pump just stops working.  Tried taking apart, cleaning, etc.  So, basically had to take it all off and just pour out as best I could. Although I love this product, will not buy it anymore due to this issue.  For $100, you think they could make it pump out correctly...?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days so far, so I can&#x27;t give a review on anti-aging effects yet, but I feels good going on, it soaks into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feeling, it leaves a matte finish. The part I&#x27;m not so sure about yet is the moisturizing, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s keeping my face moisturized adequately throughout the day. I suppose this might be a good moisturizer if you have oily skin...</li>
    <li> I use this as my day moisturizer, it&#x27;s SPF is only 15, but still it is better than most other moisturizers.  I have very dry sensitive skin and rosacea, this minimizes the red and leaves my skin feeling silky an nourished</li>
    <li> Purchased this after trying the night cream sample. The packaging/bottle is so poorly made that the pump does not work from day one. I had to crack it open and use Q tips to get the lotion out. The entire bottle design and the expiration date smeared after a week of use. I am starting to wonder about the quality of this product. The lotion goes on smoothly but leaves a fine residue. If you are looking for something that works for your skin, get a Eucerin day lotion with SPF, a prescribed Retin-A for night time and Cetaphil cream to put on top of Retin A since your skin will become dry. You will not need your Clairsonic, clay mask nor any other exfoliating creams. Going to the dermatologist and finding a simple regimen truly saved lots of time and money. Use skincare products that are backed by science.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and a price way more reasonable than most.  Alsp, people think I&#x27;m in my early thirties when I&#x27;m 40, so the produc must be doing something right.</li>
    <li> I use Revaleskin Day cream every day and love it. On this bottle the applicator pump is not working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed because this is very expensive day cream. I am going to scoop it out of the bottle and store it in another container.</li>
    <li> I miss this product.  I wish they would bring it back</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a 15 SPF that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or suffocating on my normal to dry skin . . . this is it.  I cannot use any product that contains manufactured, i.e., not natural, fragrance.  Although I understand that each person has their own preference for a product, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like an SPF.  And, I suggest giving it 2-3 weeks to really see an effect of the coffeeberry.</li>
    <li> I bought three if these creams to send abroad and they all expire in 9/2013. I wish the product expiry date would be listed.</li>
    <li> I am a very active person and love the outdoors. I normally wouldn&#x27;t use a pricier product like this, but found a good deal on Amazon on two different occasions. I have been using it for a little over a year and love how it makes my skin feel, the spf is good and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin. I am happy with my purchase. :)</li>
