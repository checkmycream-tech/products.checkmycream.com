      <li>Nevertheless, I love seeing this.</li>
      <li>Nails look so much better, hangnails have disappeared.</li>
      <li>:) would buy again</li>
      <li>This one does not put a protective shinny layer on, it make the nail more able to withstand the problem.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>More like 1/2 the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE MY NAILS NOW</li>
      <li>rats have gnawed on them, now they are healthy looking and stronger.  </li>
      <li>And they look better too.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I orders more.</li>
      <li>I love how it absorbs into the nail rather than coating it.</li>
      <li>First time I have had nails in years!!!</li>
      <li>now I have to CUT them -- a first!!!</li>
      <li>and my nails feel strong and healthy</li>
      <li>This combination seems to make my nails most strong and moisturized too.</li>
      <li>I use it three times a day and after 7 weeks my nails are long and strong and beautiful!</li>
      <li>but now I have a full toe nail!</li>
      <li>I have seen people who use this product and their nails are beautiful healthy and long</li>
      <li>so I suggest that you use this product if you are trying to get long beautiful and healthy nails.</li>
      <li>strongly recommend this product for problem nails.</li>
      <li>Keeps my nails strong</li>
      <li>I have used the Nutra Nail Calcium product for years and always get compliments on my strong nails.  </li>
      <li>I must say this is great:) it really works and the shipping was really really fast .</li>
      <li>I found this product in a free box at a garage sale</li>
      <li>Back to my great nails.  </li>
      <li>I do also rub in Healthy Hoof protein cream after the Nutranail is fully absorbed.</li>
      <li>I liked the product, I have good coments of it, but I cant give it a perfect rating because it arrived 5 days late as the estimated one, and the bottle is not the same as the picture as you can see in the picture I posted.</li>
      <li>, it really makes them smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>As long as I keep using the NN nourishing, growth &amp; strengthening products, and keep the cuticle area neatly clipped, my nails continue to be very nice</li>
      <li>and I still have nearly a full bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a fair amount of similar products with no luck at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to quit dozens of times over the years, but really couldn&#x27;t for more than a week or so.  </li>
      <li>I see the best results when I use this at least twice a day.</li>
      <li>The good thing is that since I&#x27;m a guy it doesnt look like I&#x27;m wearing nail polish or anything since it is matte and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the buildup of similar nailpolishes.</li>
      <li>Works quickly and well.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>No it doesn&#x27;t work in 5-7 days but using it consistently for 2 weeks!</li>
      <li>For the record, I DID polish my nails when first using it, but over the course of the day, the nail polish just &amp;#34;slid&amp;#34; off of each nail in one piece!  </li>
      <li>I had trouble with my once great nails.  </li>
      <li>I eat healthy and take vitamins, but have always had soft nails.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with it so far.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased I&#x27;m buying two more bottles from Amazon, one for me and the other for my daughter.</li>
      <li>By the look of them, only overnight, I am confident that this calcium formula will do wonders for my nails, and I will see the fabulous long and strong nails I once had.</li>
      <li>Works so fast!</li>
      <li>actually use it more than twice a day.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>It really helps my nails grow!</li>
      <li>But first, I took the nail polish off and washed my hands thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I now think that one reason it was so hard for me to be successful</li>
      <li>first of all i was real skepitic about this product</li>
      <li>this product really made my nails grow longer but they didn&#x27;t thicken up</li>
      <li>This DOES work to really improve your nails.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the rate at which they&#x27;re growing -- doesn&#x27;t seem exceptionally fast</li>
      <li>This one made my brittle and pealing nails grow much faster as well as healthier.</li>
      <li>but it keeps me from biting my nails as much.</li>
      <li>and she wants another.....</li>
      <li>and they really do grow much faster.</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>&amp; they really got stronger.</li>
      <li>I used to bite my nails my whole life..when I decided to stop, this product helped me so much.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think this was really going to make my nails grow, but it really did after about a week or two.</li>
      <li>and you may go through a whole bottle in a month..</li>
      <li>Gel nails really ruined my fingernails to a point of having brittle nails and now they are strong and long!</li>

    <li> This DOES work to really improve your nails.  I don&#x27;t think they grow faster... but, if you have ridges in your nails, theyre brittle, or seemingly have different layers, it really makes them smooth and healthy looking.  It makes them stronger, too.  I used it for a little over 2 weeks, and applied it twice a day.  I saw a big difference in my nails. The only drawback is that it seems to have an oil base... so, nail polish won&#x27;t adhere to your nails while you&#x27;re using it. I don&#x27;t think it would work THROUGH polish anyway... but, plan on BARE nails while you use it.  For the record, I DID polish my nails when first using it, but over the course of the day, the nail polish just &amp;#34;slid&amp;#34; off of each nail in one piece!  So, save your polish... it won&#x27;t stay on.  You only need one bottle, it goes a long way. Put a little on each nail, and massage it in a bit. (Just a little.. not until the nail is totally dry)  If you have brittle, ridgy, weak, peeling nails... this IS a great remedy!!  I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Works so fast! Love it will be buying again and again</li>
    <li> I love this product. I love how it absorbs into the nail rather than coating it. I have never been a fan of the strengtheners that coat because they typically chip, never work as intended, and look cheap over time (I tend to avoid painting my nails because they&#x27;re so brittle anyway). Repetition is key with this product. I see the best results when I use this at least twice a day. I would also recommend following it up with Hard as Hoof Nails strengthening cream. Both products, when used together, have been unbelievably perfect for strengthening my nails.</li>
    <li> This works for me.  It really helps my nails grow!</li>
    <li> I used this along with another product, with both products I am starting to see some results</li>
    <li> I had trouble with my once great nails.  They were down to the nub and peeling and breaking all the time.  I tried some very expensive ($20-25 range) products with no results.  I bought Nutra Nail at my local drug store and it has worked wonders on my nails.  They are growing, not peeling and becoming hard.  Back to my great nails.  Just ordered 3 bottles from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a free box at a garage sale so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  There were no instructions so I applied it once a day for seven days, nothing.  I stopped using it until I found reviews on how to use the product.  It took longer than seven days, almost a month but my nails have quit peeling, breaking and splitting.  They have even grown to the length that they need to be cut.  I garden and constantly wash my hands because of work and my nails still improved.  Prior to using this product my nails were so ugly, I use to say they looked like rats have gnawed on them, now they are healthy looking and stronger.  I even think I have fewer hangnails due to using this poduct.  I am so pleased I&#x27;m buying two more bottles from Amazon, one for me and the other for my daughter.</li>
    <li> this works great will order again.thanks</li>
    <li> this item is really good and it really works. this product has done wonders to my nails and I would recommend this to any body who is trying to grow their nails. I have seen people who use this product and their nails are beautiful healthy and long so I suggest that you use this product if you are trying to get long beautiful and healthy nails. [[ASIN:B000EH0NEC Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Calcium Formula]]</li>
    <li> Doesnt work I used until I finished it my nails are still short,stubby didnt help me nails at all !!! :(</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim.  I noticed my nails started getting so long that I had to trim them some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use it more than twice a day. This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Ok. First let me say that i have tried EVERYTHING to get my weak, peeling nails to grow. They are horrible. But i got this product and its AMAZING!!! I use it three times a day and after 7 weeks my nails are long and strong and beautiful! I dont put polish on them because they look so beautiful bare lol.  And i never thought i would say that. I get compliments on them. Please try this if u have weak nails. I didnt believe it would work and it did!! I just wrote to the company too.  Im so happy with this this product ! The only thing that works for me!!</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my nails growing. It makes them grow faster. And they look better too. I order it when ever I run out.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Arrived on time..</li>
    <li> Always used this product, or some other, it does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to grow my short, thin nails; tried this, and it worked. They are so long now I have to CUT them -- a first!!!</li>
    <li> I would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I liked the product, I have good coments of it, but I cant give it a perfect rating because it arrived 5 days late as the estimated one, and the bottle is not the same as the picture as you can see in the picture I posted. In other way, I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I always have trouble growing my nails and it takes forever! But ever since I started using this product, they keep growing and growing. They seem to also be getting stronger and healthier looking. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Have used for years works great</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, does&#x27;t interfere with my other manicure products.  Seems to have made my nails stronger even though I haven&#x27;t given this product a lengthy test.  I am pleased with it so far.</li>
    <li> Nutra Nails 5-7 Day Growth Formula has worked beautifully for me. I do not have experience with the different formulas (regular, Aloe, Calcium), however, the product itself is great and I plan to continue my daily application. My nails have always been weak and easily broken, split and some ridges have been appearing as I age. I have tried other products, but nothing works as well as all of the NN products I have used. I also use NN strengthening products, and I invested in a nice pair of cuticle clippers. Every NN product I have used lives up to its claims. As long as I keep using the NN nourishing, growth &amp; strengthening products, and keep the cuticle area neatly clipped, my nails continue to be very nice and I ACTUALLY HAVE TO CUT THEM because they get too long!</li>
    <li> This surprisingly worked! I&#x27;ve been trying a fair amount of similar products with no luck at all. This one made my brittle and pealing nails grow much faster as well as healthier. Can be applied under polish as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old and have been a serious nail biter since I had teeth to bite them.  I&#x27;ve tried to quit dozens of times over the years, but really couldn&#x27;t for more than a week or so.  I decided this summer to try again and checked Amazon reviews for a great supplement to help me out.  I found this nutra nail and I&#x27;ve applied it everyday from 1-4 times per day (when I think of it) for the past 3.5 weeks.  I&#x27;m shocked at how strong my nails are after how weak they&#x27;d been from years of abuse.  I now think that one reason it was so hard for me to be successful is that my nails were very flimsy before, I&#x27;d mess with them a little, they&#x27;d bend and tear and eventually is give up!  This stuff makes them so strong that even when I do mess with them, they won&#x27;t bend and tear.  I can&#x27;t speak to the rate at which they&#x27;re growing -- doesn&#x27;t seem exceptionally fast but this is the longest I&#x27;ve ever had them...but I can attest to them being strong!</li>
    <li> I put this on my nails, almost immediately after I unwrapped the envelope upon receiving it yesterday. But first, I took the nail polish off and washed my hands thoroughly. I woke up this morning, and I can already see a bit of white of my nails. Yes, I have been biting my nails off due to a bit of stress. Nevertheless, I love seeing this. Also, my nails seem to have a bit of shine to them. I am keeping them free of any other products. By the look of them, only overnight, I am confident that this calcium formula will do wonders for my nails, and I will see the fabulous long and strong nails I once had. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> this product really made my nails grow longer but they didn&#x27;t thicken up so I think I will have to lookfor something else to make them thicker.</li>
    <li> First time I have had nails in years!!!</li>
    <li> After trying everything for thin, peeling nails that weren&#x27;t strong enough to grow long, I finally found NutraNail. Now I can grow them to attractive lengths and they don&#x27;t split. They get long enough that I actually have to trim them. Wow. Recently, I started using on my toenails too because as I&#x27;ve grown older, the toenails were dry and almost crumbly. Now my toenails are nice too. Lacquers and the Sally Hansen products that are packaged as imitations of NutraNail are a disaster and always made my nails worse. I do also rub in Healthy Hoof protein cream after the Nutranail is fully absorbed. This combination seems to make my nails most strong and moisturized too. Both these products are so inexpensive, I worry they&#x27;ll stop making them.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before.  That&#x27;s why I orders more.</li>
    <li> Helped my nails grow fast, but they still grew out very weak &amp; brittle. But if all you need is length then I recommend this baby.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and I swear by it! Keeps my nails strong and they really do grow much faster.</li>
    <li> Works quickly and well.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> first of all i was real skepitic about this product and i thought that my nail wouldn&#x27;t grow a bit but i use about 4 day and i notice that my nail grew 1/2 inches wow this really work and my my nail shine and hard. the item came in on time 5 star</li>
    <li> The best really works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it makes my brittle nails stronger</li>
    <li> I use this product when my nails are short and I want a quick growth but its difficult because when you wash your hands you need to keep reapplying it...it does absorb into your nails but not quick enough and you may go through a whole bottle in a month..I suggest putting it on before going to sleep that&#x27;s what works for me... not  in 5 to 7 days but in a few weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year and my nails have never been stronger.  It takes longer than 5-7 days.  More like 1/2 the bottle.  I put it on like 4 times a day... and after i wash my hands.  My only gripe is the price.  I found it at Walmart for half the cost than the one I bought on Amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to grade a product that takes a week to show its effects, but after I bought this product I feel that the number of times my nails breaks has decreased, which is a good thing.    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not sure if this product is why my nails are stronger. It certainly didn&#x27;t stop my nails from breaking for the umpteenth time despite me using it, but I also cannot rate this anything lower than 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure that I was not the one at fault breaking my nails...    Buy this without too high of an expectations. It will not turn your nails into acrylics. However, it will give you the sense of comfort and added protection which helps, if not physically then mentally.</li>
    <li> I have extremely weak nails that break at the slightest pressure. This product has saved the day. I apply it once a day on and under my nails with amazing results.</li>
    <li> I am still using this  product.  It is taking a long time to see some result.  My Neighbors said it needed to go and get some Olive oil and everything would be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ME</li>
    <li> My Wife said it is good and it is work for here and she wants another.....thank you for that  Product</li>
    <li> I tried gelatin, green tea stuff, and many other supposed fixes.  This one does not put a protective shinny layer on, it make the nail more able to withstand the problem.  Didn&#x27;t completely fix the problem but is the best help I can find.</li>
    <li> Garbage!  A complete waste of money!  I would have not even given a star, but then I would not have been able to write anything!  Save your money!</li>
    <li> best thing ever i was sooo shocked will use forever</li>
    <li> utter waste... no use ..</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was really going to make my nails grow, but it really did after about a week or two. My nails are longer than they&#x27;ve been in a while. I had literally no nails because I would bite them. (so my nails were not strong at all)  I started using this, stopped biting them &amp; they really got stronger. If you want longer nails that won&#x27;t break as they grow-this product is for you!</li>
    <li> nails seem to be a little stronger but I am still having trouble with  breaking and chipping. I have been using this calcium for 14 days now.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nutra Nail Calcium product for years and always get compliments on my strong nails.  It is one of my \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without it\\&quot; routines to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product for problem nails.</li>
    <li> Well this product could be better... I mean it didnt nesacarily make my nails grow any faster than they usually do. But they did grow and hard. Rather than my regular flimsy nails.</li>
    <li> Love it, the only thing I have EVER used on my nails, that actually worked. Easy to use and hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my nails.  They&#x27;re beginning to get smoother and Stronger.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 6 days and I do see a difference in the condition of my nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> Not sure whether or not it works but it keeps me from biting my nails as much. Seems to help a little bit. The good thing is that since I&#x27;m a guy it doesnt look like I&#x27;m wearing nail polish or anything since it is matte and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the buildup of similar nailpolishes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff in March after suffering from a fungus on my toenail as a result of getting a tip put on in the nail salon. Water got underneath and it began to hurt. After I cured the fungus, my brittle nail cracked and all that was left was a thin strip of toenail. I have been using this product for the last two months and my toe nail is almost completely grown back in. I use it twice a day everyday and I still have nearly a full bottle. It WORKS!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the description promised growth and strengthening. I have been using it twice daily (as the instructions say) for about a week and a half and can tell you there has been no growth. My nails grow very slowly naturally and have always been brittle, but they are at the same length they were 2 weeks ago. As far as strengthening goes, it does feel like they are a little stronger however for the $8 I paid for this little bottle it was definitely not worth it. Also, the smell is disgusting!! Try a different product!</li>
    <li> Ok. So I read reviews and was not buying it...but I said what the heck! I&#x27;ve spent $10 on stuff before that didn&#x27;t work. No it doesn&#x27;t work in 5-7 days but using it consistently for 2 weeks! I have my nails back! and better than ever. Gel nails really ruined my fingernails to a point of having brittle nails and now they are strong and long! my toenail was also a mess and it was not growing back (also due to gel nails) but now I have a full toe nail! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Use it! Don&#x27;t expect a miracle ! but it will come.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few items I&#x27;ve ever used that actually do what they&#x27;re advertised to do. I know some people said it takes them a while to see results but it usually takes a week for me. I usually put it on twice a day and cover the entire nail bed, under the nail and the cuticles. Then I rub it in and let that be that. My nails grow longer, stronger and faster. Works wonders and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it because it works and will order it again.  I used to find it in stores but not anymore.</li>
    <li> Nutra Nail resolveu meu problema de unhas fracas e quebradiças tanto dos pés quanto das mãos.Também consegui curar micose das unhas dos pés.</li>
    <li> I used the Nutra Nail 5 to 7 Day Growth Calcium Formula for a month and I felt the difference, it makes my nails stronger ans longer</li>
    <li> This is a great product that really works. I tried many remedies and my doctor was no help. Biotin was no help.  When I first got this I only put on one coat every few days, which did nothing. Then I started putting on 5 coats per day and the results have been astounding.  There is a slight sheen after applying but this goes way, so men could use without it looking like they had on nail polish.  This is worth trying if you have splitting, thin, flaky nails, but you have to be diligent and put on enough.  Also takes more than 5 -7 days, but don&#x27;t give up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it made my nails grow any faster, but it definitely made them strong; they used to break all the time, but I&#x27;ve been applying this twice a day religiously, and they haven&#x27;t torn or softened. Absolutely fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me, I gave it a couple weeks, but chose something else to solve my issues</li>
    <li> Very happy with results so far. Nails look so much better, hangnails have disappeared. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s thumbnail has been split down the center for years. I bought her this, she used it several times a day, and the nail is fusing. It is exceeding expectations.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Got it for my wife and she is very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> it works!!!!  little by little...but yeah i can see the difference every week.</li>
    <li> I used to bite my nails my whole life..when I decided to stop, this product helped me so much. my nails were so soft from all the biting over the years and this helped strengthen it. I put this on the cuticles and sides as well! It&#x27;s great..I LOVE MY NAILS NOW</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week and notice my nails are shinier and a little harder but I think I will only see results as old nails grow out and new nails grow in. I eat healthy and take vitamins, but have always had soft nails. I will update after I finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have always had very weak nails. I&#x27;m using Nutra Nail Calcium and after 2 weeks I see an improvement in my nails. They are not peeling like they always do.  I want to see what they&#x27;re like in a few more weeks. I do recommend this product. I have already re-ordered and gave some to a friend.</li>
    <li> Seems to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I must say this is great:) it really works and the shipping was really really fast . I even got it earlier than the day I was supposed to get it :) and in less than a week my nails where growing . I used to have really short nails because I always used to eat them and I start it using this product and my nails feel strong and healthy:) would buy again</li>
