      <li>If you are looking for a light, non-greasy lotion, this is not for you.</li>

      <li>Even my heels are smooth.  </li>
      <li>, I buy 2 tubs at a time, use it every day, my husband who has very oily skin uses it when he has a psorasis breakout, it not only helps him, but has been wonderful for me.</li>
      <li>The reason I mentioned our dermatologist selling this product, is he was not making a profit off of it, he believes in it and wants his patients to use it as it is a wonderful moisturizer and gives relief to people suffering with dermatitis dry skin.</li>
      <li>I used to love this product so much!</li>
      <li>It came quickly after I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and many moisturizers burn my face.</li>
      <li>The best dry skin solution especially for people with diebetics.</li>
      <li>Works great on mosquito bites-rub a little in after bitten and see the itching and redness go away in 15-30 minutes and</li>
      <li>I am just thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hands next fall/winter.</li>
      <li>It goes right into the skin and there is no sticky residue or grease that gets on my clothiing.</li>
      <li>I have  fine sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t return many items, but this went back ASAP.</li>
      <li>I put it on before I went to bed one night, and the next day my itchy patches started to feel better.</li>
      <li>After using it for the first time, there was an immediate result.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this stuff, but then tried to sell me a tub for 3x the cost of Amazon; very thankful for e-commerce!</li>
      <li>Keeps my sensitive skin smooth and hydrated in winter--I won&#x27;t leave the house without putting it on.</li>
      <li>I have been using Blue Lizzard Sorbolene Cream for many years.  </li>
      <li>Not a big fan of this cream, since it has a pretty intense smell that is more like gasoline than flowers.</li>
      <li>Relief is certain.</li>
      <li>This cream smelled terrible-also it is American, which is fine except for the name of the cream.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it and the jar is large.</li>
      <li>This is very gentle / mild and took care of the dry skin right away.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your promptness</li>
      <li>We have a super sensitive, highly allergic family and this cream works for everyone -</li>
      <li>The original label says, \\&quot;Pure Australian\\&quot; but the product I received says \\&quot;Australian Formulated.\\&quot; I should have known something was amiss.  </li>
      <li>Excellent thick, greasy moisturizer for very sensitive or dry, damaged skin.</li>
      <li>I am going back to my original supplier.</li>
      <li>Really unbelievable effective.</li>
      <li>This is a much thicker and better moisturizer than a product like CeraVe which is ingredient heavy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
      <li>I have tried to find a more non-chemical heavy cream to do what this does and not pay $$$ for it to no avail.</li>
      <li>It works great (super moisturizing and absorbs well) on my body but the chemical SMELL is SO BAD</li>
      <li>I just received Blue Lizard a few days ago and LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It is very smooth and creamy with very little fragrance.</li>
      <li>In cold and warm weather, my skin remains smooth and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>The price was better than I usually pay</li>
      <li>it is amazing and a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>We use the baby or sensitive.</li>
      <li>It leaves a protective, soft barrier over your skin that lasts for awhile.</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the nicest, creamiest cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>In fact, my daughter (4 years old)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and moisturizes fabulously!</li>
      <li>Until I have a better balance for my little one controlling the eczema internally, Blue Lizard Sorbolene will work to help the outside.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole gamut of facial moisturizers before, costing me anywhere from $5 to over $150 for a tiny jar.  </li>
      <li>Just wear loose black clothing over it and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many creams and moisturizers for my feet (heels very dry and scaly) and for my daughter&#x27;s legs (very dry and ashy in the winter), nothing ever worked, especially long term.</li>
      <li>Post shaving, skin is soft and pores seem to be open.  </li>
      <li>The only one that did not cause a reaction on my 3-year old.</li>
      <li>Future purchases will made directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone needing the use of cream for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an old broad with diabetes which equals very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive, dry, eczematic skin - you can use this cream - I promise!</li>

    <li> Excellent thick, greasy moisturizer for very sensitive or dry, damaged skin. Basically you get all of the benefits of straight up petroleum jelly, but with a better texture (the cream is greasy, but whipped; it goes on nicely). If you are looking for a light, non-greasy lotion, this is not for you. However, the greasiness is perfect for my purposes, which is keeping my guttate psoriasis from flaring during the months I don&#x27;t use my Rx ointment. The only downside is that it leaves grease stains on the sheets, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Just wear loose black clothing over it and you should be fine. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought sorbolene cream from my dermatologist several years ago.  I use is as my night face cream.  It is awesome!  I love it and so does my skin! A 16 oz. jar lasts for a year! Best face cream bargain ever!</li>
    <li> How I wish I discovered sorbolene cream much earlier.  This is the best moisturizing cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my face and neck.  In cold and warm weather, my skin remains smooth and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve used the whole gamut of facial moisturizers before, costing me anywhere from $5 to over $150 for a tiny jar.  My face continued to be extremely dry, my skin cracked. Other products made my condition worse.  Until someone recommended sorbolene and I noticed the good results immediately.  I now use it alone on my face and neck day and night, the natural smell is not offensive (perfumed products are not good for my ultra-sensitive skin anyway), and just a little dab is all it takes.</li>
    <li> I have had rashes for the last 20 years and recently found out they are due to a wheat and gluten allergy.  Even after changing my diet, the rash would flare up and Sorbolene soothed the rash immediately.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> I had some itchy patches on the soles of my feet and on my ankles.  They were extremely itchy, and I thought I had gotten athelete&#x27;s foot from a yoga mat.  I ended up going to the dermatologist, and she said it was just dry skin and sold me this cream.  I put it on before I went to bed one night, and the next day my itchy patches started to feel better.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist sells this in his office.  I bought the 16 oz. jar and after one week I could tell this stuff WORKS.  No more chapped and dry flakey skin.  Even my heels are smooth.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My sons (6-months-old and 2-years-old) have eczema, and this works great. Not greasy like other OTC remedies. Great alternative to prescription steroid creams. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many creams and moisturizers for my feet (heels very dry and scaly) and for my daughter&#x27;s legs (very dry and ashy in the winter), nothing ever worked, especially long term. I heard about this cream from my dermatologist (he wasn&#x27;t trying to sell it to me--doesn&#x27;t carry it in his office). The first thing I have to say is that when I opened the jar, the smell was wonderful. In fact, my daughter (4 years old) and I kept smelling it for the 1st week because we thought it was so yummy! I read the other post regarding the smell--I guess it is all up to the individuals smell receptors. I found it to be very mild and clean smelling--no cloying perfume smells. After using it for the first time, there was an immediate result. It is so thick and luxurious. It doesn&#x27;t completely rub into your skin (which has always been the problem with other products). It leaves a protective, soft barrier over your skin that lasts for awhile. It is not greasy or sticky. This is all I use now. I put it on my heels every night, as well as my daughters legs, and everyone is silky smooth! It is expensive, but it lasts a long time as a small dollop does the trick--you don&#x27;t need to use that much. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Helps dry skin. Works great on mosquito bites-rub a little in after bitten and see the itching and redness go away in 15-30 minutes and no more itching! It was recommended for my husband by his dermatologist for dry skin and rash on his feet and ankles. Cleared it up. We gave some to our son to use on the grandson&#x27;s severe eczema on his ankles when he was younger. It cleared it up and he has only had to use it occasionally since and not at all in years. The son gave some he had left over to a customer w/ eczema on her hands and arms. She said it worked better than all those expensive medicines she had been using for years!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Best hand cream on the market.  Thanks for your promptness</li>
    <li> I read several product reviews before purchasing this cream for my baby. She had several dry patches (referred to as infant eczema). After using this product only a few times we have not had any problems. This is very gentle / mild and took care of the dry skin right away. I apply after bath time and have not had to continue using the cream since the skin has cleared up. I also was sun burned in Hawaii and my face was beginning to peel. I used the cream and - NO MORE peeling skin! Thanks for the great product!!</li>
    <li> This cream smelled terrible-also it is American, which is fine except for the name of the cream.  I don&#x27;t return many items, but this went back ASAP.</li>
    <li> This product has a strong chemical odor that I couldn&#x27;t handle. I use it reluctantly because I have paid for it, but am looking forward to when I am done.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this cream, since it has a pretty intense smell that is more like gasoline than flowers.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this stuff, but then tried to sell me a tub for 3x the cost of Amazon; very thankful for e-commerce!</li>
    <li> This product contains mineral oil, horrible for skin issues. This is even stated by dermatologists. I am going back to my original supplier.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan. I just received Blue Lizard a few days ago and LOVE IT! I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter; the skin on my hands cracks and bleeds - I basically lose my protective barrier. Despite Rx creams from my Dermatologist, I still get no relief. My heels are always dry, cracked and scaly no matter the season. For the past few nights before I climbed into bed, I applied Blue Lizard to my heels and then put socks on. What a difference! Within just a few days, the skin on my heels is actually soft and the scaling has disappeared. I am just thrilled and can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hands next fall/winter. I think it&#x27;s going to by my saving grace!!!  Highly recommended. PS - there is an ever so slight scent to the cream but nothing at all offensive.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the nicest, creamiest cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend it to anyone needing the use of cream for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my husband by his dermatologist, he also sells it in his practice for the same price you can get it on Amazon. We have used it for over 10 years, I use it everyday!!! when your body is damp to wet a quarter size amount will cover you. It does not clog your pores, I cleanse my face with it, apply again at night for moisturizer, rinse my face in the morning and re-apply before putting on makeup. I have  fine sensitive skin and this is perfect for me. I put sun block over it when needed, I buy 2 tubs at a time, use it every day, my husband who has very oily skin uses it when he has a psorasis breakout, it not only helps him, but has been wonderful for me. It is not perfumed because it is used on open skin lesions, I think it has a little bit of a medical smell,  that  does not bother me in the least, I don&#x27;t even notice it and the way my skin looks and feels, as long as I can buy it  I will continue to use it. The reason I mentioned our dermatologist selling this product, is he was not making a profit off of it, he believes in it and wants his patients to use it as it is a wonderful moisturizer and gives relief to people suffering with dermatitis dry skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It repairs my dry skin in only a few days.  I tried another brand of sorbolene and it didn&#x27;t work as well so I am back.  My only problem is I am one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like using lotion so I don&#x27;t use it often enough.  They make a awesome sunscreen too!  We use the baby or sensitive.</li>
    <li> The only one that did not cause a reaction on my 3-year old. And we have tried each and every one of them....all lotions and even crisco, extra virgin olive oil, honey, coconut oil, name it we&#x27;ve tried it.  Moisturizing too and even helps relieve itching.  Really unbelievable effective.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this cream.  To be honest, it smells like an oil refinery.  The family member I bought it for won&#x27;t use it.  They suggested it is good for shaving so I tried it but it is a bit thick for the razor to eject it from between the dual or triple blades.  Post shaving, skin is soft and pores seem to be open.  I have not left this on my skin for long periods of time because of the odor.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for those who suffer with dry skin!  It keeps your skin hydrated,but not oily - perfect blend.  Good for those who may suffer with eczema.</li>
    <li> I have been using Blue Lizzard Sorbolene Cream for many years.  It is very smooth and creamy with very little fragrance. I use it to take off make-up, and use it on various dry spots on my body.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The second ingredient after water is petrolatum (I read vasoline).  It is greasy on my skin for 3-4 hours.  I don&#x27;t know if it finally soaks in or just rubs off on clothes, linen, car seats, etc.</li>
    <li> I have horrid hands due to being a nurse for several years. This is the only product that works for me, AND isn&#x27;t all perfumey. Theres no scent, and nothing to irritate skin. It&#x27;s super thick and sinks in well and it&#x27;s  still working after I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this cream. I have used it for several years. It is very good for dry skin. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> This is a one stop solution if you have cracked feet. The best dry skin solution especially for people with diebetics. Relief is certain.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my skin for the better and I will not go without it!  I use it all year round as a cleanser and as a moisterizer in the winter months.</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed. It smells like petroleum!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;No amount of essential oil that I use will mask the smell. The price was better than I usually pay but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  :(</li>
    <li> I used to love this product so much! However, the last time I ordered, unlike previous times, there was no Blue Lizard markings on the container. They also added oil ingredients (which invalidates the claim it is true sorbolene cream)which they fail to mention on this site. I have very sensitive skin and many moisturizers burn my face. This is still soothing, but, because of the oil, it makes me break out like mad. I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  I&#x27;m an old broad with diabetes which equals very dry skin.  This cream does the job.  I apply it while my skin is still a little moist after I&#x27;ve towel-dried after a shower.  The best!</li>
    <li> This is not the product I have previously purchased.  The ingredients shown in the advertisement are not what are in the container.  The original label says, \\&quot;Pure Australian\\&quot; but the product I received says \\&quot;Australian Formulated.\\&quot; I should have known something was amiss.  This crap will go in the trash.  Future purchases will made directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  I should have known better.  Extremely disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Keeps my sensitive skin smooth and hydrated in winter--I won&#x27;t leave the house without putting it on. This cream is fabulous!</li>
    <li> We have a super sensitive, highly allergic family and this cream works for everyone - it is amazing and a little goes a long way! If you have sensitive, dry, eczematic skin - you can use this cream - I promise!</li>
    <li> It works great (super moisturizing and absorbs well) on my body but the chemical SMELL is SO BAD I can&#x27;t put this at all on my face or leave it on my hands because I want to throw up.  Believe me there is nothing &#x27;yummy&#x27; about this product. I wish I never bought it. The two stars is for product effectiveness but the smell ruins it for me.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product. It&#x27;s thick and creamy and moisturizes fabulously! I uses it every day, and it is absolutely worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is a much thicker and better moisturizer than a product like CeraVe which is ingredient heavy. Blue Lizard Sorbolene keeps my little one’s eczema from drying out. I have tried to find a more non-chemical heavy cream to do what this does and not pay $$$ for it to no avail. I gave it 4 stars since the negative I did have at first was that it smelled like permanent marker! Until I have a better balance for my little one controlling the eczema internally, Blue Lizard Sorbolene will work to help the outside.</li>
    <li> This cream does what it says. Sometimes at night when I go to bed my skin gets so itchy I can&#x27;t stay in one position because whatever part of my skin is in contact with the sheets itches like crazy. It&#x27;s enough to make a person insane. This cream amazingly stops the itchiness in about 20-40 minutes. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. It came quickly after I ordered it. It goes right into the skin and there is no sticky residue or grease that gets on my clothiing. You don&#x27;t need much of it and the jar is large. I don&#x27;t know what is in it, but I am very glad I found it. Highly recommend.</li>
