    <li> Love the pleasing scent!  Wish B&amp;BW didn&#x27;t discontinue this item :(</li>
    <li> Love the scent. I was worried because I&#x27;ve never smelled this product nor used fragrance spray before... And I didn&#x27;t want to make anyone get a head ache from overpowering scents. But luckily this one is not too strong nor too girly (sweet/fruity). The bottle is nice too because of the blue coloring.  My fiance is also in love with this scent too. Whenever he smells me, he can&#x27;t help but cuddle more lol. :) I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve purchased this!</li>
    <li> I was so sad to learn that this was a discontinued product at Bath and Body Works in stores. When I saw it here, I bought 2 bottles. It came with tape securing the lid on, and it hadn&#x27;t been tampered with. I love the scent! Very happy.</li>
    <li> Totally love it! I purchased the fragrance from Bath&amp;Body works few years back, but was throughly disappointed to know it has been a limited addition product. But now I am all back to smiley-smiley. I really recommend to this everyone!!!</li>

    <li> I love it. I was happy when I received it.</li>
    <li> The name alone evokes an air of class and elegance.. I must commend B&amp;BW for their exceptional line of fragrances. While the scent is not an overwhelming one, it&#x27;s still a captivating fragrance. will pair well with Ohau/ pure paradise/ mad about you/ cool amazon rain/</li>
    <li> It was a gift they had the one they bought at the store smell better and stronger than this one thought it was the same i guess i was wrong</li>
    <li> YES, I love this fragrance from bath&amp;body works!!!They discontinued it!So, when my daughter said try Amazon I did and was VERY happy tp find it!! So Thank you Amazon!! Signed,VERY HAPPY customer.</li>
    <li> Was almost out of this and bath and body works was out!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I found it online.</li>
    <li> I bought the shower gel, lotion and body cream for my granny in 2014 during bath &amp; body semi-annual sale for her birthday. I wanted to get her some light and refreshing.  I got the SUN (golden magnolia) for my mom. Since their birthdays are in the same week. Then turned around and stocked on both for myself.  They smell like spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish Bath &amp; body would bring the collection back</li>
    <li> I love this bath and body works  mist spray, it smells soooo good. :)</li>
    <li> Product was well packaged and arrived as expected.</li>
