<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best hair iron i&#x27;ve ever got! It&#x27;s my favorite thing! I don&#x27;t pay for hair saloon any more! Absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> This worked great... for several months. And then it wouldn&#x27;t heat up properly. It would say I reached the temperature and then it would waver back down and up. I never abused this product and always stored it away properly. It started not heating up at all when I tried to use it. I contacted the company and made an exchange through my warranty. They replaced it fine but the same thing happened - but sooner this time. It started malfunctioning within a month of receiving it. I bought Nume curling irons and I&#x27;m never looking back.</li>
    <li> I love this iron. It so simple and easy to curl your hair different ways. Plus, my hair hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of damage and I&#x27;ve been using this iron about every other day on colored hair. I feel like it was a bargain because you are really getting 4 irons for the price of one! I recommend this to all my girl friends :)  UPDATE: Almost 2 years later and I still LOVE this curling iron. I use mainly the 2nd largest size, but sometimes swap for the biggest size. It heats quick, stays hot and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. My style stays all day too which wasn&#x27;t the case with another brand curling iron I used to use.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this iron. The heat settings are great, it gets hot very fast, and the curls hold for a looong time with hairspray--even for awhile without any spray, and my hair usually goes flat in no time. The different size heads are fantastic, they give the option of little ringlet curls or big bouncy waves, all of which I love. I can get my hair curled in twenty minutes tops, and I have long hair and plenty of it.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done ,very cheap for the price against its competitors. The only issue I do not like is that its quite difficult to oull apart, if you wish to change out the roller sizes.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about this purchase but I gave it a try. I love it. I am Asian and it is hard to keep my hair curled. After testing it out, I was amazed. My hair stayed curled til the next day. I would recommend this product to anyone. I didn&#x27;t find the need for all the different size head available but love the second smallest one. Good Luck and hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. It works awesome. And I love that I can change to different sizes of sticks to get different curls. And it curls nice and quick. And love that it gives you a handy bag for the wand and a glove to protect your hand from the heat.</li>
    <li> Just received mine and already love it. It only took 8 days to ship from America to New Zealand (almost unheard of!). Came really nicely packaged and the bag that carries everything in the set is really compact - perfect for travelling. The different barrels are easy to change and it heats up to a hot temperature quickly. At a hot temp with the smaller barrel it curls my hard-to-curl hair in less than 5 seconds! Amazing value for the price because you literally don&#x27;t need any other curling wand. It&#x27;s easy to use, even with my waist-long hair. The only con is that the barrel stays really hot for a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t have a stand or latch to lean on so I have to kinda figure out where to rest it whilst it&#x27;s hot. But it does what I wanted it to do so I can&#x27;t rave enough about it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to be in love with this curling wand, however the black rubber of the handle has begun to peel off after only a few uses. Does it work? Yes. Will it last? Probably not. Bummer.</li>
    <li> love curling my hair with this. easy to use. but watch out it gets very hot</li>
    <li> This was an awesome product! It curls very good and they vary in sizes! I totally recommend it! It also has a good quality cord that is good for not burning!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a wedding. Use it only 3 times now it&#x27;s not heating up. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for the last couple of months.  She&#x27;s been very happy with the results</li>
    <li> This item has defects/malfunctions. Starting From The very first use it keeps giving me an error message. It pretty much works when it wants to. I would like to look into an exchange.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how using the Cortex Clipless Iron Set would work out, but I tried it right away when I received it. All 4 heads are easily attachable and removable from the handle. I tried the 1 1/2&amp;#34; head, and it heated up quickly. This was my first time using a clipless curler, and it was really easy! I was able to curl all of my hair fairly quick, and even though my hair never holds a curl, it stayed for several hours. I&#x27;ve tried other curlers, including flat iron curling, and it just doesn&#x27;t hold. Within 2 hrs, my curls would just fall out, and I&#x27;d be left with straight hair again. I have very long hair (below my waist) and this curler works wonderfully. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and I hope that it continues to work perfectly in the following years (considering it has a lifetime warranty)</li>
    <li> I received this item last week it came in a small box. The first time I used it I try to connect it n it wouldn&#x27;t lock it self in I was able to use it once I was done i took it apart and the wire of the barrel came off!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for 21 year old girl.  She loves it.  It has multiple curling irons for many uses.  Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> i love this thing ! takes a little getting used to but .. curls beautifully!! just be careful, it does get very hot !!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I hemmed and hawed and read a million reviews before deciding on this one. I am glad I made this purchase. Part of my concern was price. I have a lot of styling tools, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. I mean how many curling irons does a girl need, right. Well, you need this one. It heats up super quick (up to 450 if you want fast or deep curls) and maintains the heat very well. I love the ability to program how long you want it to remain on before auto shut off. Having multiple barrel sizes is extremely convenient and allows you to create most any style with one curler. I would see the results of this type of curling iron on celebrities but had no idea how it was being achieved. Now I know. The curler comes beautifully packaged in a very sturdy box. I know that seems irrelevant but if a company doesn&#x27;t even take the time to place their product in professional packaging it makes me question the quality immediately. Also, the box is sturdy enough to allow you to store it away when not in use or take it with you. I also love the professional cord, the quality and length are excellent. You are also provided a glove. I find this difficult to use as I need to feel the hair with my fingertips, but burns can occur with this kind of curler if you are not carefuI. I have burned myself twice while getting sued to the curler so I do recomment using something on the forearm, but once you get used to it and respect the fact that you are holding a 450 degree wand in your hand, burns are pretty much non-existent. The curls also really do hold. Mine hold for several days and remain wavy for some time after that. I have used this curler multiple times since purchase. I have only used two of the barrel sizes but as I change my hair style frequently, I am sure all will come in handy. Unfortunately I normally only feel moved to write reviews when I love something or hate it, when I&#x27;m lukewarm I just don&#x27;t take the time. I love this clipless curling iron. It was a great purchase and well worth the price. I am African American and use it mainly on extensions on the higher settings with a heat protectant. The lower settings are ideal for natural hair.</li>
    <li> It refused to work within the minutes after I unpacked it. Such a shame. I will try and re-order and hope for the best as this seems to be a great product.</li>
    <li> My hair is super thick and I&#x27;ve been using lots of moisturizers and oils on it and it doesn&#x27;t curl that well so when I got this I was really surprised at how well it worked on my hair! And so quickly I didn&#x27;t have to hold it long to get a great curl. Heats up quick easy to change the barrels great product for the price you get several curlers in one. My biggest complaint is the off button I hit it often by mistake it&#x27;s so hard to avoid and I don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s off until it stops curling. It&#x27;s annoying,  even when Im trying to not touch the button i still hit it by mistake. But would still hit again it&#x27;s not a deal breaker</li>
    <li> Broke within a couple months. Faulty wiring.</li>
    <li> I am mixed Japanese and African American. I have tried every iron and wand out there. I have spent countless dollars and nothing comes even close to this. Normally I would have to use hairspray and curl my hair which would take 1 1/2 hours because my hair is so long. I was in shock when I was more then half finished in 20 min. Took 30 min for my whole head. I hope all the females in my family know what the present will be now</li>
    <li> Bummed that I have only used it a couple times and it doesnt like to turn on all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Does great when it turns on</li>
    <li> Takes some getting use to so that your hands aren&#x27;t so awkward. Love that it has four different barrels to choose from. I use the 2&amp;#34; one and I love the way it gives me loose curls that last all day!</li>
    <li> Cortex is one of the best lines. And this is the real deal. I use it all the time! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, I have long straight hair and with this curling iron my curls last till the following day and that&#x27;s without any hair products on my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this clueless curling iron because I liked the idea of bein able to change the size of curl with just one unit. For that I give it three stars. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed with this unit so far is this unit gets to the temperature but it doesn&#x27;t stay at the temperature. It fluctuates as I use it but climbs back up to the temperature you set. It digitally shows you the temperature so you can actually see what temperature it&#x27;s at. Also the buttons are easily pushed when I&#x27;m curling my hair. That&#x27;s a little frustrating but in general this curling iron serves its purpose. I also choose this unit among others on amazon because it had the largest barrel.</li>
    <li> Fried out after 1 use, it just started smoking and turned offs! How was it even new? It had no seal</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that really doesn&#x27;t want to hold a curl but these curling irons get the job done. With high heat and no product (other than heat protectant) the curls stay just fine into the next day. And i&#x27;m sure they would stay even longer if I took the time to use some styling product. Watch out for the heat though; I don&#x27;t curl my hair often so I&#x27;m not exactly a pro with maneuvering the wand and have burned my hand in two places (small, but ouch). This set comes with a heat glove but I find I can&#x27;t really feel what I&#x27;m doing...but I should start practicing so I avoid more burn marks. I kinda wish they had a clip so I didn&#x27;t have to use both hands, but I guess it just comes with the territory of trying new designs. This product also comes with a nice storage pouch, and a long cord which I find quite convenient. Overall, great product that does what it says it does!</li>
    <li> I got mine less than a year ago and it already has problems heating up. Sometimes if I change the attachments it works but this past Saturday none of the 4 wands would heat above 80 degrees. So instead of having cute hair when I went out I had to make do with surf spray. I&#x27;m very disappointed..... Maybe somebody knows how to correct the issue?</li>
    <li> I purchase this tool and it broke the first time i plugged it in. I put the barrel on, plugged it in, turned it on, and then sparks shot out and I heard a popping noise. Now it is fully dead. I never even got to test it out on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might try to buy another one to see if it was just a malfunction in that specific one.</li>
    <li> Cortex 4in1 is perfect! I highly recommend this product! I love the different sizes of barrels and the quality of the curling iron. I bought this product a while ago and the packaging looks a little different than back then. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because of their newer design... But I don&#x27;t believe that this curling wand has decreased in quality. With this curling wand, expect to have shiny, healthy looking curls.</li>
    <li> Love it! So many different styles depending on which curling wand you use. Heats up in less than a minute Great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with the product. When plugged in it has an error code: ERR&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I received it until I tried to turn it on.</li>
    <li> It is a great curling wand!! It heats very fast and the curls are amazing and last the whole day . I love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to switch between barrels. Quick to heat. Makes beutiful curls every time. It even comes with the protective glove which is a most.</li>
    <li> Horribly made.  I only used it 4 times and it stopped working.  It kept turning itself off.  Super bummed because the curls were gorgeous:(</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this item but when I did, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  I was really, really bummed. Glad they accepted my return though.</li>
    <li> I was glad because the curling iron arrive before i expected, is super easy to use, it make the perfect curls, i just love it</li>
    <li> Worth every penny! Definitely love it! Curls last forever and you have so many sizing options and heating options! :)</li>
    <li> This curling iron malfunctioned the FIRST time I used it.  I ordered TWO, got ONE.  Amazon did right by me, but I will never buy anything from this company, Cortex again!!</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. I really love it. You can make about any type of curls and waves you wish. Very easy to use, but be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
    <li> I found this curling wand on a different site for $100 and decided to bargain shop for a better deal. I found this one which was great for my budget however, the previous reviews had me skeptical. I bought the wand with the mind frame that it may break and after just 1 week of using it, it broke while I was in the middle of curling my hair. Just a simple pop and the light shut off and would not come back on. I am returning it and ordering from a different website that has better reviews because it works amazingly.</li>
    <li> This wand set is fantastic! It gets so hot that even the 2&amp;#34; wand holds a curl. You leave it on the hair for such a short time (less than 10 seconds per curl) that I don&#x27;t think it does too much damage (obviously heat damages regardless, but at least you&#x27;re not holding the hair on the heat for 30 seconds). Such a great and versatile styling tool!</li>
    <li> I only gave it 3 stars because there was a problem with the wand. It has a locking mechanism to hold the pieces into place and mine unfortunately would not lock. However, Amazon is awesome so they were willing to take back my item and said they would give me a full refund. Otherwise I think it is a great product just needs better quality control because whoever checked this wand at the warehouse did not fully inspect the item. If not they would have seen that there was an issue with the locking mechanism.</li>
    <li> Barrel sizing is misleading. I am a hair stylist and needed an iron with a 2&amp;#34; barrel. This seemed like a perfect fit, but what was advertised as a 2&amp;#34; barrel was at best only an 1.25&amp;#34; and the other sizes were smaller than advertised as well.</li>
    <li> awsome makes the hair shiny and makes really good curls the best curling wand ever I love it buy it</li>
    <li> bought it for my daughter and she loves this thing</li>
    <li> Revised post 8/14/14  Amazon did return my iron free of charge after speaking with a rep. The product itself is great and I love it! By far the best curls I&#x27;ve ever had. Be careful, burns skin immediately upon contact - ouch!    First post 7/03/14  Product only allows one of the \\&quot;heads\\&quot; to work. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t try all four right away, and when I went to try something different I received the \\&quot;Err\\&quot; message and can&#x27;t get it to work. Extremely disappointed &amp; it is past the 30 day return mark.</li>
    <li> live these things. they get very hot very fast.</li>
    <li> My friend curled my hair one day she came to my house. She got this product for Christmas, and she loved it. She curled my thick hair with a 1/2&amp;#34; barrel, and, although it took an hour and a half, it looked like Shirley Temple curls. With a little hairspray and pinning the curls to my head right after she curled them, they lasted for at least 24 hours. This is an amazing curling wand, and I love using it. I recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s especially nice with the four different barrel sizes, so I can have tighter curls for longer days, or loose curls for the beach.</li>
    <li> The packaging was fun, I thought it was a bottle of cognac when I first got it, Ha!  The good part is that the curls comes out beautiful, soft and natural looking and the curls hold really well.  I am giving it a 4 star because of the on/off button,  it is placed on the handle and there is practically no way to avoid clicking it and accidentally turning it off.  It is quite annoying that you have to continuously turn it back on to maintain the temperature desired.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife. She loves it. Loves the different sizes</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and appears of good quality.</li>
    <li> I watched plenty of Youtube reviews on this and I was sold on the fact that it was interchangeable.  This is the first &amp;#34;clampless&amp;#34; curler I have ever used.  I will that would make one rod with a clamp for back-up.  When they do, I will buy that too.</li>
    <li> The best curling wand in the world! My hair is so hard to manage, very dry, hard to style. With cortex I have curls within 15min. Love this product</li>
    <li> The product description *and* the manual both say &amp;#34;140-450 degrees&amp;#34; but it only goes down to 170 degrees minimum!  Seriously -- press the down button and it stops decreasing at 170 degrees.  Ripoff.</li>
    <li> Its amazing i like it</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about the &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; part, but this curling iron ROCKS!  I absolutely love it.  High-quality product, adjustable temperature, super-long cord, automatic shut-off, and very easy to get used to.  I&#x27;ve have used all four different heads and LOVE them all.  Truly a great buy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for a birthday present.  One of the wands did not work right off the bat.  She is currently trying to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after first use. Every time I started it up, it said &amp;#34;error&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t heat up. Did this for about two days and then just stopped turning on.</li>
    <li> Broke after only a couple uses. Also very hard to interchange the different wands. I would not recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> The single most amazing tool for beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> The rods that worked were great but only 2 of the 4 worked when plugged in. Luckily amazon was great and let me return.</li>
    <li> I loved the package it came in, the waiting time was not that bad. everything was in great condition, and the product works great thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great tool but had to get used to wand with glove first.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money at all. It&#x27;s only turned on once since I had it.. It never wants to work right. Very disappointing since it was a present for my daughter.</li>
    <li> after reading some of the reviews I was a little scared to buy. now that I have swallowed my fear and bought it my love of the curling wand makes my fear seem stupid. it is great for girls with curls especially when on the go. all you have to do is add curls were your natural curls fell then out the door. my new favorite hair tool</li>
    <li> I really like the curls And it doesnt damage my hair</li>
    <li> It works awesome I love it !</li>
    <li> Love this product. Very professional utensil,very compact. Awesome</li>
    <li> I used to love this curling iron. I love to curl my hair when I go out with friends. For a while, I loved cortex 4 in 1. It got the job done. However, in January my first iron I bought with them broke. It stopped heating up high, and evenually wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all. No biggie, I thought, and it gave such nice curls, that i replaced it with another. All is going well until it starts to gradually lose heat as im curling my hair, and takes A LONG TIME TO heat up and it will not heat up as long as it says its going to. I&#x27;m very disapponited, I had high hopes for this iron. It gave such wonderful curls, however, I feel that it must be made very cheaply and not with the best of quality.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I have NEVER owned one that works so beautifully!  I have hard to curl hair and this curling iron can put curls in my hair that spring back when I pull on them and I don&#x27;t even have to use hair spray.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected. I LOVE my cortex 4 in 1!</li>
    <li> I have short, thin hair. But a lot of it and it requires about four to five parted sections every time but this handles it just fine. I can use about all of the wands, save the biggest but as my hair gets longer, all four will be able to curl my hair perfectly! Could not be happier with this product. Well worth the pretty penny.</li>
    <li> After less than 2 months of owning this product, all of a sudden the temperature would randomly go up and down in a range from 1-400 degrees. I contacted AMAZON and they were very helpful offering a refund right away. HOWEVER I went through CORTEX for a Warranty..after several phone calls the \\&quot;Warranty Department \\&quot; was on Vacation, I was promised 3 times a return Phone call &amp; email. I was not EVER contacted by ANYONE at CORTEX. I phoned 5 more times over the coarse of 2 weeks. I was told to ship my product &amp;that it would be determined if the product would be warrantied.I had  to pay for return shipping and again was told I would be contacted by CORTEX. After 2 weeks I had not received any kind of contact. EACH time I called the company they had my NAME &amp; mailing information completely WRONG. Again I was told by the customer care dept that she would personally contact me in a few mins with a shipping #..&lt;br /&gt;FIVE hours later I called back &amp; again they seemed to have NO IDEA Who I was or my contact info. I was put on hold and after 10 mins I was given a shipping number.. No company or date of shipment. I lucked out and found it was with FED EX. After yet another week and a half I contacted FED EX. CORTEX has FAILED again!!! The item is still sitting with them and not been picked up for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT ORDER THROUGH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this wand it works really good. I was thinking of buying one that cost $100 more but the Cortex one works just as well. I like that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as much as other curling irons. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Since the time I bought them I cut my hair drasticly and I still use them, semi reguarly. They heat up fast which is great for me since i tend to turn off the iron before i find pieces that didnt stay or i missed. It also has an auto off, again great because i can forget to turn it off if im rushing to work.</li>
    <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
    <li> The only problem w this product is that i keep turning off and on the curling iron by accident while doing my curls because the off and on botton is right on the handel. Other than that I like the Cortex</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY...This item was delivered to me on Aug 12th, it but it&#x27;s now Oct 19th, and it does not work. With only once a week usage,  Seriously Cortex? Two months??No hair tool should last 2 months.If you like to waste your money and make crap purchases, go ahead and buy this.. Oh, and there was no warranty paperwork with my iron...convenient.</li>
    <li> I must say, pretty awesome. I have fine thing hair and not that much. However this wand makes what ever I have beautiful and makes it last. My hair usually does not last curled so long but this one for sure makes it last for a long time. The only reason I gave it a one less star is just the heat of the wand. One it is very damaging and two, be very careful when curling.</li>
    <li> Love this iron!  It has been the only iron that actually curls my hair! The glove is helpful, and can go on either hand.  Other reviewers have complained that the on/off button is on the handle and in the way.  But you have to press it for 3-5 seconds, so I have yet to accidentally shut of the iron while curling my hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and easy to change out the curling iron size. Also, comes with a glove which is a plus!</li>
    <li> I was looking at the higher priced clipless curling irons and was shocked at how much more affordable you can get one here on Amazon! As someone who alternates hairstyles all the time, I&#x27;ve tried the two larger barrels on shoulder length hair and they both work well once you get the hang of your hand placement (YouTube will be your best friend on this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast and includes a nice little pouch for traveling. Pretty neat kit!</li>
    <li> For the most part I was satisfied with this product. 3 of the 4 barrels were awesome, however the fourth was quite flawed. The 2&#x27; barrel came bubbled up and with many wrinkles in its cermaic coating. This means the coating, with time and use, will eventualy crack and fall apart. This is unacceptable. 75% is not good enough. I expected a product that fufilled 100% of my expectations, and this curling iron fell short.</li>
    <li> I love this cortex Curling wand!!! It heats up super fast and it REALLY gets HOT!! My hair stays styled all day long the curls don&#x27;t fall out like they used to with my old curling iron. Plus the removable heads make it so versatile!! When I first got it it took some getting used to. It kept giving me an error message but it was because i wasn&#x27;t pushing the remove able parts far into the heating mechanism. Once I figured that out, I have not had any issues with this curling Iron. I just Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the product but the largest barrel which claims to be 2 inches is not more than I 1/4 inches.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine last week for $62.00 and the price has jumped to $140+. It is not worth more than I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble with the temp control buttons because they have no lock so while I&#x27;m curling my hair constantly press the buttons by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Misleading description&lt;br /&gt;Temp buttons get tampered with while styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Cools down quickly after shut off&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Glove comes in handy</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you plan on owning for 1 year or less. Cortex will not answer the phone or email.</li>
    <li> i really like this curling want set. it comes with a variety of wand sizes for different looks. i really like the big wand because i can get a really beautiful korean wave style with a lot less effort. the smaller wands are good for a messy, natural beachy wave. this product is easy to use and securely locks the wands so they don&#x27;t fall out during use. the wand heats up quickly and has even heat throughout the wand. the display is clear and easy to read to see the temperature setting and the buttons to change temperature are clear and easy to use. this product also comes with a zip case to hold the wands.</li>
    <li> The Curling iron is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Easy and fast curling and the curls remain very long. Awesome price! Delivery as fast as expected. I highly recommend it. Thx.</li>
    <li> We love this curling wand, but the 1-inch attachment did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon says we can send it back and get a refund.  That&#x27;s our only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll get 99 requests for a review, but will they really help us???  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  The curling wand is awesome.  Amazon, not so much!</li>
    <li> I used to be in love with this curling wand set.  Unfortunately it broke after a year and a half or so of use and would no longer stay powered on.  The customer service and warranty process were extremely disappointing.  I refused to send my curling wand back with a check for almost $25 and an empty promise that they MIGHT replace my broken wand.  Do yourself a favor and spend your heard-earned money on a product from a more reputable and upstanding company.</li>
    <li> Does not keep highest temperature after a month of use.</li>
    <li> Great Product, And excellent Seller</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Ok nothing special I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> love it, great product, I just wished the 1/2 inch barrel was bigger because that one gives a cool effect but can&#x27;t use it since it&#x27;s too small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I really liked this product at first. I loved the handy travel pack, the interchangeable barrels. I loved how it made my hair look!  Now it&#x27;s completely broken!  It will heat up, look like its going to work and the instant I pick it up to use it, it shuts off and refuses to turn back on. I have a lot of hair and can only get 2 pieces of hair curled before it breaks. what a colossal waste of money.  I will see if I can contact the manufacturer to get my money back, but its likely because I didn&#x27;t retain all the product packaging that I will be s*** out of luck.  SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy something better!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She is 23 and a nurse.  I would not buy this for someone who is very young because even an adult gets burned, and pretty badly I might add.  It is a good product and we have professional hair stylists who have recommended it!</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful product, I love how it can transform into 4 different wands in just one curling wand !</li>
    <li> I received the curling iron set really fast!!!! it was nicely package in a really nice black and sliver box, which is different from the white box as shown online.  It also came with all the parts as describe online. I absolutely love this product, but it is really hard to lock and unlock when changing -out the curling irons. When I first tried to use it......I almost thought I was going to have to return it for being defective. It took me a while to lock the curling iron into place. This is important because the iron won&#x27;t work if the rod isn&#x27;t locked in place correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I am still very happy about my purchase. I will see if the product stands the test of time. I have gave the product a rating of 4 stars because of the difficulty to change-out curling irons.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when I received this product, it was not new, as advertised, and was also missing the 2&amp;#34; barrel. The box indicated the sizes, but when I compared it to a previously owned 2&amp;#34;, the size difference was obvious. I went ahead and tried the largest barrel size (probably 1 1/4&amp;#34;) to see if I wanted to re-purchase this iron,and was ecstatic with the results! I used small sections (about 3 in.) held for about 20 seconds; slid the barrel out, and held the curl in my for about 5 seconds before letting it fall. I curled my entire head before bed and the curls released just enough while I slept to have nice, flowy curls the next morning. Anyway, as far as the product exchange, I called customer service, and they will be sending me a replacement next day!! Can&#x27;t wait to try the 2&#x27;!!&lt;br /&gt;(Side note: excellent customer service, very helpful, super fast and easy!!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually curl my hair. I went shopping around and found this wand because i wanted to start. I really like the curls I get and how long they last. My only problem is I burn myself a lot even with the glove. I think this will go away with time as I gain more experience with the product.</li>
    <li> So easy to use...normal curling irons would take about 45 mins to do my hair, the longest this has taken me is 20 mins. So fast and gives a nice natural look</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife as a gift because her sister had one.  She absolutely loves it.  She only had CHI products before this so likes the high quality stuff.  She only uses this now.  I think it is well built and well designed.  The LED lights let you know that it is still hot so you don&#x27;t burn your hand off when you go to pick up your wifes stuff.</li>
    <li> I must say I am so glad I bought this product. I&#x27;ve had curling wands before, but this is the best by far. I have extremely long hair that is incredibly difficult to curl usually, but this curls it once and it looks great all day!</li>
    <li> I love this curler and the big waves it makes!! but it broke after exactly 31 days &#x3D;( Thankfully I registered it for the lifetime warranty, so hopefully I will receive a new one shortly</li>
    <li> gets super hot with temp control leaves you with beautiful curls or waves your choice. i love the interchangeable wands</li>
    <li> For the most part, this wand is alright. Unfortunately, when I received it, one of the attachments didn&#x27;t work. I filled out the warranty information online right away, tried calling and emailing the company and have received no response. So far, I&#x27;ve just been using the other wants. Too bad the one size I would actually use the most doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> I love it..I got this product to do an up do I saw online and it did it..people thought I went to a beauty salon to do my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron, but after a year, the largest barrel has quit working. I insert it and turn it on and the display starts blinking and eventually a red error light comes on. I&#x27;ve tried everything I know to get it to work. This is the barrel I use the most, so this thing is almost useless to me now.  Teh other barrels still work . Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received this and it would not turn on at all. Huge pain. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any item before. I&#x27;ll update my review once I receive the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments were easy to put in and take out.</li>
    <li> This has been a great wand so far. I love all of the different sizes of barrels that come with it. When I first tried it out, I didn&#x27;t put the barrel in all of the way the screen said there was an error. You have to push the barrel in pretty hard Make sure it&#x27;s all the way in and then lock it into place.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had! Item arrived on time &amp; in new, working condition as seller stated. I&#x27;m very happy with this item! I&#x27;ve never had such healthy looking curls before let alone the option to choose different barrel sizes with one iron set. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, this set is so worth it. Comes with a glove too.  Made my hair super curly and was fast to heat up.  Will recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Great purchase!  I have nothing bad to say about this.  Love having all the interchangeable sizes and it comes with a nice case for them all to go in and a glove to use so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.  A nice long cord.  Easy to clean.  It feels very sturdy in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this curling iron for a year and a half not and it still looks and works like new.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using this for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is very easy to use and my daughter and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love all the sizes. In regards to reviews saying it is difficult to switches size because of the unlock/lock mechanism, just make sure you push the barrel all the way in then it should be easy.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this wand. My hairstylist has the same one, and she paid full-price directly from the distributor. LOVE this curling wand! It is my very first time using a wand and I am so pleased with it! I asked a friend to teach me how to use it so that I wouldn&#x27;t burn myself. The glove is helpful, but does not completely prevent burns. You can adjust the temperature and it heats up within seconds. It also has a really nice carrying case that makes storing and traveling with it very easy. I wish I would have bought this sooner! Using this wand is way faster than straightening my hair. I have really long, thick Indian hair, and I use the largest (2 in) barrel, and it works flawlessly. Very pleased with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;Styles quickly&lt;br /&gt;Carrying case&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable temperature&lt;br /&gt;Multiple size barrels&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could have bought it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;You must learn how to wand your hair before trying to use any wand successfully&lt;br /&gt;Can burn you because the temperature is very hot</li>
    <li> Let me say that if this product had continued to work I would have loved it.  I loved the versatility of having the multiple size barrels.  I loved how hot it got and how fast it heated up.  What I didn&#x27;t like - really didn&#x27;t like - was that after 4 1/2 months the cord has a short in it and will not stay on.  For this price the quality should be better.</li>
    <li> Works great! Awesome quality!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Would recommend it to anyone. It is very easy to use and can&#x27;t get enough of it. It curls your hair quick as well.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting &amp;#34;Taylor Swift&amp;#34; hair for so long. I had always just tried doing it with a curling iron and either wrapping it around the rod or clamping it down and then wrapping. It would last an hour or two and then slowly fall out. With this it lasted ALL DAY long! I used the smallest rod and it made the cutest curls. My hair is coarse (naturally curly) and i straightened it and then used the rod. I loove this product!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t hit the highest temp setting though...</li>
    <li> Love the versatility of the curling iron, was a bit tricky to figure out the best way to do the curls. I watched a few youtube tutorials and now can create the perfect beach waves that last all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I just got it less than 5 hours ago &amp;i tried the .5 inch wand &amp;my hair came out looking gorgeous , I am very surprised &amp;satisfied with the results  , I never had the chance to have my hair looking like this since my hair is very hard to curl &amp;i don&#x27;t even have to use hair spray! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Love the versatility with the different barrel sizes. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! You are able to set it so that the irons get really hot for hair that doesn&#x27;t curl easily, or you can turn the heat down for hair that you don&#x27;t want to damage.  The blue panel on the front shows you the exact temperature which I thought was cool.  Also it heats up in like less than 30 seconds!  Over all I would get this product again and I think it works great!</li>
    <li> Upon my second use, an error message started blinking on the display screen and the iron no longer heats up.  Unfortunately, this happened when I was halfway through curling my hair.  Unbelievable.  I tried switching out the different heads, unplugging/replugging the iron, etc, to no avail.  The very summary usage instructions included with the box don&#x27;t address the issue.  Buyer beware...</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this curling iron.  She says it&#x27;s the beast one she has ever had.</li>
    <li> This is the first higher-end curling wand I have purchased -- I had a $40 model from Sally Beauty and decided to upgrade when I found I was using it enough to justify the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all four sizes and am amazed how well the curl holds -- with the smallest size, I found my curls were still intact after a night&#x27;s sleep (I&#x27;d used a -very- light dusting of hairspray and had curled at 5 p.m. the evening before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s another Cortex set on Amazon that&#x27;s a little cheaper than this one. The difference is in the wand sizes; for example, its largest wand is 1.5 inches, whereas in this set, it&#x27;s 2 inches. I prefer this set because while the 1.5 is my standard size for med-large curls, the 2-inch is great because it creates volume and soft waves. You can use it to do a quick round around the crown area and be out the door in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> OK, I have tried to do the nice wavy curls that you can get from a flat iron, but have had no luck.  I decided to get this curler and it is VERY easy to use.  I love that it has varying curl sizes, because i can also use it on my daughter who would need a smaller curl.  The glove that comes with it is excellent.  Easy to use without burning your hand (which I did with the flat iron trying to use it to curl my hair)  Excellent quality, great price and if you register your product it has a lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> This item is great, along with the electronics and quality. But for the novice beginner, this style of rolling requires practice and is not easy. There will be a learning curve to use this. I barely use this item since I bought it. I just prefer the regular style roller. But This product is nice in that It can make different diameter curls, and It does do them perfectly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from URUSH but it was fulfilled by Amazon, mine was defective so i&#x27;m basing the review off my experience with it excluding the actual results it gives (this is NOT a review used to broadcast my rantings). I also just based it off of the questions I had but couldn&#x27;t find the answers to prior to ordering it, so hopefully this can help someone else as well :) . Item arrived by estimated delivery date, which was only about four or five days after i ordered it. Packaging was very sturdy, secure, and compact. Item was obviously brand brand new and came in a very pretty box, with a carrying/storage pouch and glove. I was surprised at how small of a space it could all fit into. The actual handle of the iron was very light. My product, like many others, was defective. It wouldn&#x27;t heat up past 90F no matter what. obviously disappointing, Amazon had good customer service and is refunding me. I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that just happened with mine (I think they will all be like this though) but the buttons were very annoying. Maybe it was also because i was still figuring them out, but the screen doesn&#x27;t always respond to them and when the iron is off the screen is constantly flashing saying it&#x27;s &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, so you have to unplug it. Aside from it not working, the cord seemed really durable and promising. It has a special fabric around it so it won&#x27;t melt like others do. I was surprised at how short the barrels are, but I don&#x27;t think it would be a problem unless you have hair down to your waist. My hair is right at my under-boob (lol) and when i wrapped my hair around the barrel there wasn&#x27;t really any of it showing through. I took about a normal 1&amp;#34; section (this was with the 2&amp;#34; barrel). It seems like if it could heat up it would be a good product. I also really like how it has tourmaline in it (there&#x27;s another set of titanium, which is more expensive for some reason?). I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t get it, but just be careful since a lot of other peoplehad theirs become defective after the return period was over. And from what i&#x27;ve read Cortex customer service is dodge-y. It&#x27;s a really good price but I would say only get it if you wouldn&#x27;t be losing a lot, and if you can cope with spending that much for only 3 months of usage (average time it breaks down for a lot of people). This is a REAL Cortex WITH the manufacturer warranty slip inside, glove, and case/zip pouch, this is the newer(apparently there&#x27;s a more outdated version with a circular screen) set with the 2&amp;#34; as the largest barrel, and the lock/unlock is very simple to use.</li>
    <li> Liked the idea of having all the different size barrels. Unfortunately, it broke within a month and a week and was only used 4 times. It also never held the temperature at 450 degrees. Amazon did help me to return the product even though it was a week past the return deadline.</li>
    <li> Came broken. The barrels were hard to put into the socket and then hard to lock. Once on the wand would read &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;. Then it wouldn&#x27;t unlock and come off. Would have been nice if someone would have mentioned that it was a pain the ass and a waste of money. Maybe it would be a good wand but I would never know. Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> Original review: Great! It came on time and I love it! It curls hair quickly, heats up quickly and my hair is quite soft after and super bouncy! definitely an upgrade from curling with my CHI  Update: After a year, it&#x27;s broken and doesn&#x27;t heat up properly, giving me an error message. I&#x27;m very careful with it and maybe used it about 20 times, and it&#x27;s already stopped working and the curls don&#x27;t hold or feel soft like they used to &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I saw that this seems to be a hit or miss item, but I took the risk. It did NOT pay off. After about 20 minutes, one barrel clipped in. The others never did. The barrel didn&#x27;t really matter in the end since the whole thing never heated up. Just said err on the screen no matter what I did (different plugs, heat settings, gave it time, removed and reattached Barrell, etc) if you&#x27;re considering this, you&#x27;re better off paying more for a different product.</li>
    <li> I Purchased this item in August, and frankly I don&#x27;t style my hair much, but I wanted to try the wand because I liked how my friends hair looked, I originally paid $58 for this item, and it since has gone up in price by almost $100, I&#x27;ve used it a total of 5 times, and each time, I&#x27;ve struggle to keep the wand on, it turns off on its own &amp; I hate it. What I think would take 15 mins, takes 30 because it has to reheat &amp; stuff -.- I wouldn&#x27;t pay $160 for a faulty product, maybe $57, but definitely not what it&#x27;s being advertised as now. I wish I would&#x27;ve contacted the seller sooner, but since I hardly use it, I guess it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my 20 something daughter and she loves it can make multiple sizes of curls and fast!</li>
    <li> i received Cortex Curling Set yesterday ,but it never worked!After plugging  it in a main socket,the blue flashing light never appeared and obviously iron remained cold.The most unfortunate thing that i don&#x27;t live in USA and deal with Aramex  for it to be delivered, they charged me 50$ for that, and if i want to send it back they ll charge me just the same.So i really don&#x27;t know what to do with it,i went  to Cortex International site to check if there is any repair services in nearby countries,but i didn&#x27;t find any info.To say I&#x27;m disappointed is to say nothing.It was very unfortunate purchase</li>
