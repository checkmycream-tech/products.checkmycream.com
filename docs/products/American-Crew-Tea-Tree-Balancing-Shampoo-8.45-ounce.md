      <li>my fiancé even loved it.</li>
      <li>It smells good and helps wake me up in the morning.</li>
      <li>Smells good too</li>
      <li>but if you want to pick a good shampoo I recommend Pura d&#x27;or gold label</li>
      <li>I will purchase the John Mitchell brand because I&#x27;ve heard good stuff about the John Mitchell Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others.</li>
      <li>Nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>Nice price.</li>
      <li>nothing special about this shampoo…left my scalp kind of itchy and my hair kind of dry…</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>its so refreshing and calming..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the strong tea tree sensation that I was expecting from the product.</li>
      <li>It always leaves my hair clean and soft and also has the pleasant tea tree smell that I like.</li>
      <li>The refreshing feeling and scent start my day right.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fantastic, and works well on allergy sufferers to give you the clean and just washed quality to your hair.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to clean the way I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>In fact my hair didn&#x27;t even feel clean after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but i do feel clean for a while</li>
      <li>Overall, this shampoo has a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t seem to solve my itchy scalp problem.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 10.14 Ounce]]</li>
      <li>but i do feel the smell and quality are worth the cost over cheap store shampoo.</li>
      <li>I like how cool (temperature)</li>
      <li>The American Crew shampoo cleans my hair, to be sure; but, at this price point, there are better options.</li>
      <li>Very bland/non-descript smell, most other tea tree formulas have a really pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>The shampoo has a minty fresh smell to it</li>
      <li>It has a fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t linger and seems unisex.</li>
      <li>smells great, keeps hair clean and is overall the only shampoo i buy now!</li>
      <li>Right now since I bought this already, I tried it out.</li>
      <li>so I tried the tea tree as well, love em both as I have for the last 12-15 years or so,</li>
      <li>The experience was positive.</li>
      <li>Bought this with the tea tree conditioner from American Crew, the shampoo is good, lathers and cleans well, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
      <li>Only takes a small amount, smells amazing, rinses very clean and moisturizes hair without leaving it oily or greasy.</li>
      <li>I pruchased 3 bottles all filled to various heights.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels much softer after using it.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband who really likes the tea tree smell &amp; the way this makes his hair feel.</li>
      <li>It is very soothing.</li>
      <li>fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop dandruff completely, but reduces it enough that I can rotate shampoos to keep my hair in better shape.</li>
      <li>Its half the price, but its no where near half quality; a fifth at best.</li>
      <li>yup, I love the Crew shampoo&#x27;s, almost 100% plant extracts, never dry my hair, I&#x27;m a run and gun type of guy and this is the best so far for my shoulder length black thick hair, no combing required and it never gets all dried out and tangled like most shampoos leave it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend CREW products</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product because it does what it suppose to do.</li>
      <li>However, it is a little bit more pricey than the American Crew Tea Tree.</li>
      <li>It contains tea Tree oil, and this will help clear up your scalp problems.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used American Crew products for years and really like how they work on my hair.</li>
      <li>, I use the various formulas although the classic is my favorite it seems its real hard to get the clear type now its different and a white formula</li>
      <li>I find that this is priced a little better, but the product does seem to reduce the amount of white flakes on dark colored shirts.</li>

<li> My scalp now has less flakes and irritation.  </li>
<li> There&#x27;s very little scent or sensation of the tea tree oils, compared to the Paul Mitchell.</li>
<li> I usually wash my hair every two days and by the time my hair drys my scalp would start itching again.</li>
<li> Sorry Troy Polamalu, Head &amp; Shoulders was the wrong product for me.  </li>

    <li> The scent is great, and my hair texture after using is great</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Only takes a small amount, smells amazing, rinses very clean and moisturizes hair without leaving it oily or greasy. My favorite shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t has parabens so that&#x27;s a perk but if you want to pick a good shampoo I recommend Pura d&#x27;or gold label</li>
    <li> Very good stuff. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> yup, I love the Crew shampoo&#x27;s, almost 100% plant extracts, never dry my hair, I&#x27;m a run and gun type of guy and this is the best so far for my shoulder length black thick hair, no combing required and it never gets all dried out and tangled like most shampoos leave it, I use the various formulas although the classic is my favorite it seems its real hard to get the clear type now its different and a white formula so I tried the tea tree as well, love em both as I have for the last 12-15 years or so,</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a minty fresh smell to it and I mistakenly bought this instead of the John Mitchell brand. Right now since I bought this already, I tried it out. It works moderately to a fair extend, but once I finish using the bottle  I will purchase the John Mitchell brand because I&#x27;ve heard good stuff about the John Mitchell Shampoo and Conditioner. However, it is a little bit more pricey than the American Crew Tea Tree. Overall, this shampoo has a pleasant smell, but doesn&#x27;t seem to solve my itchy scalp problem. It works for a short period of time from the time I washed my hair. I usually wash my hair every two days and by the time my hair drys my scalp would start itching again. I&#x27;m not blaming this product because I know it might work for other people, but this product is just not compatible with my head and I do not blame it because everyone&#x27;s head is different.</li>
    <li> This was half the price of the paul mitchell so i figured i would try it... Don&#x27;t.  Its half the price, but its no where near half quality; a fifth at best.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic, and works well on allergy sufferers to give you the clean and just washed quality to your hair.</li>
    <li> This is a hard item to find in stores so even though it was a bit expensive, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It smells good and helps wake me up in the morning. My hair feels much softer after using it.</li>
    <li> Great brand and a great product. Smells minty and manly but it releaves my itchy scalp and my fiancé even loved it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very bland/non-descript smell, most other tea tree formulas have a really pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> My comments about this product is the same as my comments about the conditioner.  Works well with conditioned water as well as non conditioned water</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps control dandruff without being as drying as the pyrithione zinc or salicylic acid ones. It doesn&#x27;t stop dandruff completely, but reduces it enough that I can rotate shampoos to keep my hair in better shape. My son uses it as well. It has a fresh smell that doesn&#x27;t linger and seems unisex.</li>
    <li> It contains tea Tree oil, and this will help clear up your scalp problems. I add two capfulls of powdered Rosemary Extract and shake it up well.  I also work it into my bushy eyebrows. A month later, scalp condition is reduced to managable levels .</li>
    <li> great product.great price at amazon. fast delivery.  The refreshing feeling and scent start my day right. I highly recommend CREW products</li>
    <li> The stuff thru pharmapacks ain&#x27;t legit.  I pruchased 3 bottles all filled to various heights.  The bottles had scratches all over them.  Im going to the salon or buying at the grocery store from now on</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. its so refreshing and calming.. its like a beautiful saturday morning in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Sorry Troy Polamalu, Head &amp; Shoulders was the wrong product for me.  I used H&amp;S for years, thinking I had dandruff.  Turns out I had dry scalp.  I finally listened to stylist and bought some Tea Tree shampoo.  I bought a bottle in the salon for twice the price and was impressed with the results.  My scalp now has less flakes and irritation.  Came here and bought the next bottle for half price.</li>
    <li> This seems to work as shampoo. I like how cool (temperature) it makes my head feel. I use it with the Crew Tea Tree Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo. Nice price. Have only used for a few days so can&#x27;t speak to it improving or changing my hair.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to clean the way I&#x27;m used to. I dont think you want me to coment anymore . Thank you</li>
    <li> I switched to this from the Paul Mitchell version which I had used over the last few years. I find that this is priced a little better, but the product does seem to reduce the amount of white flakes on dark colored shirts. I would definitely recommend at least trying it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the strong tea tree sensation that I was expecting from the product. You wouldn&#x27;t know that it had tea tree oil in it.</li>
    <li> My husband worships by this stuff so anytime i can to get deals on this stuff i do! Smells good too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using the Paul Mitchell brand for a long time but used [[ASIN:B003XJNQ56 American Crew Fiber, 1.75 Ounce]] for styling. I thought I&#x27;d give their shampoo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t compare to the [[ASIN:B001CTLCD2 Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo, 10.14 Ounce]] - it&#x27;s not even close. There&#x27;s very little scent or sensation of the tea tree oils, compared to the Paul Mitchell. The American Crew shampoo cleans my hair, to be sure; but, at this price point, there are better options.</li>
    <li> Bought this with the tea tree conditioner from American Crew, the shampoo is good, lathers and cleans well, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay long but i do feel clean for a while after. I think its a step up from the supermarket shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans my hair so it doesn&#x27;t itch and it controls my dandruff.  I highly recommend this product because it does what it suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a good clarifying shampoo and found it here Great smell and great results! It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who really likes the tea tree smell &amp; the way this makes his hair feel.</li>
    <li> This product is not performing as I expected. I would not buy it again. It leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> It did not help my dandruff at all. In fact my hair didn&#x27;t even feel clean after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it!!</li>
    <li> smells great, keeps hair clean and is overall the only shampoo i buy now! this is not the cheapest but i do feel the smell and quality are worth the cost over cheap store shampoo.</li>
    <li> meh…nothing special about this shampoo…left my scalp kind of itchy and my hair kind of dry…</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used American Crew products for years and really like how they work on my hair. The Tea Tree Shampoo is no exception. It always leaves my hair clean and soft and also has the pleasant tea tree smell that I like.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.</li>
