      <li>If this product is anything like its predecessor by Palmer, it is a great tool for use with a depiliatory.</li>
      <li>great product gives me a clean close shave!!!</li>
      <li>Yes, excellent product to use with magic shave.&lt;br /&gt;I will be stocking up.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m sure it works for many others.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone stepped up to the plate to make a no razor shaver since magic shave stopped making this type.</li>
      <li>I hope I can use this product 20 more years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Outstanding razor for use with Magic Shave.</li>
      <li>Glad this product is available and it works well.</li>
      <li>I am so glad these are available for sale.  </li>
      <li>These blades provide a clean smooth slave for Magic Shave users.</li>
      <li>Just like the original</li>
      <li>The original source discontinued making it.</li>
      <li>The Brittny professional is the same as Palmer&#x27;s with the same excellent results.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>So glad that this product came back on the market.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to find in any local store.  </li>
      <li>Shaves just as easy and close; no sharp edges and a nice sharp PLASTIC blade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really helpfull to me.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Good for what it is intended for but the blade edge could be less rough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an exact copy of the Palmer&#x27;s blade that suddenly disappeared.  </li>
      <li>Magic shave has a product that is way too small to hold in your hand.</li>
      <li>Hard find but will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
      <li>Just what I expected, I hope they will be available in the future</li>
