      <li>All in all, good product.</li>
      <li>Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>For a real stain, the Stila lip &amp; cheek stain in the click pen thingy is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>The LipSurgence color line by Tarte is much duped by drugstore brands, but this, the original, is best.</li>
      <li>incredibly vibrant and beautiful for all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>Love this color.</li>
      <li>Love love love love love</li>
      <li>I wouldn´t buy this product again even though I´m in love with the colour and a Tarte fan.  </li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Love the texture, color, etc.</li>
      <li>I love tarts lip stains.</li>
      <li>Am very happy with most Tarte items, especially the foundation, BB primer, and lip stains.</li>
      <li>Love the Tarte lip shade.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it will work better for others?</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the color, but i love the product.</li>
      <li>I love this lip pencil , and can&#x27;t wait until I have the full collection.</li>
      <li>It also settled in the fine lines of my lips.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic color and it stays.  </li>
      <li>overall, the product is great.</li>
      <li>This particular one has a nice scent to it too.</li>
      <li>First Tarte Product and I can not wait to use it :)</li>
      <li>Good luck seeing me in public without this lip color on.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous, lasting color.</li>
      <li>My personal favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little too bright but stays on for hours.</li>
      <li>great and long lasting</li>
      <li>First time buying lip stain</li>
      <li>😊just be careful when opening and keep it cool because mine was a bit melted other than that good worth it!</li>
      <li>It is also very chalky, not at all soft and moisturizing like the original Tarte lip products.</li>
      <li>Color was more pink than portrayed on Amazon.</li>
      <li>If I forget to sharpen it, I can&#x27;t really use it because there&#x27;s no forgiveness.  </li>
      <li>Very hydrating and lasted 6+ hrs without touch ups.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very matte and very intense, in a lush raspberry.</li>
      <li>Long lasting lipstain, love it.</li>
      <li>This item is a cute hot pink color, however it is dry</li>
      <li>It is called natural matte lip stain, but I had to use my original one over it to tone it down.</li>
      <li>I like to apply chap stick first, then lightly coat with stain since a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and I think old.</li>
      <li>But the pencil gets dull easily and because the color is so vivid and saturated, you can&#x27;t just gloss it on; you need precision.  </li>
      <li>I just bought my second Tarte Lipsurge matte lip tint in Lively</li>
      <li>I compared it next to my other Tarte lip stains and the tube is longer and thinner than the real ones (bought from Sephora).</li>
      <li>It comes out a little bit redder than one might think, but it&#x27;s a very vibrant magenta shade.</li>

    <li> First time buying lip stain but I am now a fan. I like to apply chap stick first, then lightly coat with stain since a little goes a long way. This particular one has a nice scent to it too.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off/fake. I compared it next to my other Tarte lip stains and the tube is longer and thinner than the real ones (bought from Sephora). It is also very chalky, not at all soft and moisturizing like the original Tarte lip products. You get what you pay for, unfortunately.</li>

    <li> OBSESSED with this colour.  It´s incredibly vibrant and beautiful for all skin tones.

    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!! AND CHEAPER THAN ORIGINAL PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Color was more pink than portrayed on Amazon. Box bottom was torn.  I would not have minded if it was for me, but it was a gift.  All in all, good product.</li>
    <li> Looveeee it Except mine broke out when I opened it just put it back still works has a minty smell but thats how all of these are! 😊just be careful when opening and keep it cool because mine was a bit melted other than that good worth it!</li>
    <li> Love the color. It is matt but it doesnot dry my lips</li>
    <li> I just bought my second Tarte Lipsurge matte lip tint in Lively and I have never used an entire lipstick before - I always lose them or they melt in the car or I lose interest. But this is a great product. It just isn&#x27;t a stain. It&#x27;s a matte lipstick comparable to the Nars semi-matte. For a real stain, the Stila lip &amp; cheek stain in the click pen thingy is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too bright but stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> Love the Tarte lip shade. But I ordered the wrong color and had to return it. Will be ordering a different color. The Tarte I had before, same product different color, was the only lipstick I wear. Love the texture, color, etc.</li>
    <li> This item is a cute hot pink color, however it is dry and I think old. I was disappointed after trying it on.</li>
    <li> Nothing but a crayon. I tried it twice and then threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> excellent quality.....</li>
    <li> Good luck seeing me in public without this lip color on. It is absolutely perfect. Love love love love love</li>
    <li> First Tarte Product and I can not wait to use it :)</li>
    <li> Amazing product&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect and it stays on. It doesn&#x27;t feel yucky on either.</li>
