      <li>I did get a variety of different packets and the shipping was super fast other than that I will never order this package again.  </li>

    <li> I received my package in a decent time, but was disappointed with the variety. I received ten different tanning lotions. They were; 6- whipped butter step 1 by californatan, 1- deny, 2- dark desire by essence, 1- impulse, 4- hempology by californatan, 3- kelp by botanical, 4- be bold by swdish beauty, 3- be desired by Swedish beauty, 3- hot legs by protan, and 3- opal by essence.</li>
    <li> The variety of lotions are good and conveinent to use and open. ONly thing that keeps me from 5 stars is th amount in each packet is not enough for your entire body.</li>
    <li> got my 30 count order in today was fast delivery however I got tons of duplicates and nothing but generics will not be ordering again</li>
    <li> I got 30 different lotions. Too many to list individually but 3 by Australian Gold, 8 from Devoted Creations,  13 Supre Tans, 2 Designer Skins and 1 each from Level 3, California Tan, Tan Asz U and Swedish Beauty. No duplicates--I&#x27;m happy.</li>

    <li> Fast Shipping.  Good way to try different brands.</li>
    <li> Daily user, great for indoor tanning. Great to figure out what brand/scent you like the best. Love the cooling hemp</li>
    <li> Mostly generic lotions in duplication. Not really worth the money if you&#x27;re an experienced tanner. Half of them smelled awful.</li>
    <li> A lot of the same ones and I got none of the ones pictured. But I still good lotions</li>
    <li> I truly wish I would have read the description a little more, I prefer &amp;#34;no bronzer&amp;#34; in my lotion and all of these had it, so I was a little disappointed but it really wasn&#x27;t the sellers fault. I was sent my order in a timely fashion which was great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best deal!!!!! Great seller!!!!</li>
    <li> Some of these samples seemed like regular hand lotion. A few were ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to order. I wanted to make sure I got a good selection and not a bunch of the same ones. Other reviews seemed pretty good, so I went with this one. Order came in only 2 days, which really made me happy, because I was really exited to see what the mix would be like. Every single packet was different! No duplicates! Yay! All good brands. Mostly Supre Tan, several Tan Azu, Devoted Creations, and Tan inc.  This mix did have a lot of bronzers and a few tinglers as well, Which I like. I am very pleased with this purchase. I love variety and am exited to try them all. I will DEFINITELY be reordering another set of samples when I run out of these.</li>
    <li> Such a good deal! with many different varieties and smells. I AM VERY PLEASED :)</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL OF THE SAMPLE PACKS AND I AM VERY,VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.. YOU SHOULD DIFF TRY THIS PRODUCT:):)</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the packets I got. Generic lotions. I didn&#x27;t get any color from them.  They didn&#x27;t even smell good.</li>
    <li> Love these!! They come quickly and I love always getting to try different lotions! Coming from a devoted 4 to 5 day a week indoor tanner for the past 24 years,these are very legit!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I love the variety that is included and each packet lasts about a tan and a half.</li>
    <li> First  of all you cannot buy with confidence because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting.  Yes, I received a wide variety of different packets of different brands of tanning lotions. 9 of the packet I received were tingle lotion, six of those two lotions I have yet to feel any type of tingle from, one brand of the three of the tingle  six of those two lotions I have yet to feel any type of tingle from, one brand of the three of the tingle brands comes out the package and the consistency of curdled milk, is that because it&#x27;s expired/ outdated? Most of the tanning lotions were either a level one or a step one which does absolutely nothing for somebody that already has a beas most of the tanning lotions were either a level one or a step one which does absolutely nothing for somebody that already has a base tan.  I gave the two star review only because it&#x27;s true I did get a variety of different packets and the shipping was super fast other than that I will never order this package again.  It is definitely not for somebody was an experience indoor tanner. I&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or step on tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators was that on i&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or steps one tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators when tanning. I got one brand (3 packs) of lotion that had bronzer in it ... Thank goodness at least 3 packs out of 30 I could be satisfied with. I took a risk and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a $50 risk because honestly, I haven&#x27;t even noticed a change in my tan since using any of the packets from this bundle. I think I&#x27;ll stick to buying bottles of lotion from now instead of useless randomness</li>
    <li> I like the variety in the packets, my only drawback is that I cannot find the expiration date on the packets. Tanning lotion has a shelf life, and I would really like to know when their end date is. Other than that they work great! A good mix between more popular brands and lesser known ones.</li>
    <li> Love the samples! They worked great!</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Like the wide variety of lotions. This shipped in a few days was so excited to use for my indoor tanning. they all work very well for enhancing your tan.</li>
    <li> Received mine today. I wanted to point out again that the description says: &amp;#34;We constantly update so you may or may not receive pictured items.&amp;#34; --- I got 10 different kinds and 3 of each.&lt;br /&gt;One was from the picture, the other ones were different. Here is what I got:&lt;br /&gt;- Purity by devoted creations&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Thrill by Californa Tan&lt;br /&gt;- Secret Crush by Supre&lt;br /&gt;- Nano Fresh by Fiji Blend&lt;br /&gt;- Spectrum by Fiji Blend&lt;br /&gt;- Passion by Australian Gold&lt;br /&gt;- Coco Beach Ultra Dark Bronzer with Hemp by Supre Tan&lt;br /&gt;- Coco Beach Hemp Ultra Dark Tanning Accelerator by Supre&lt;br /&gt; - Psychic by Zeda&lt;br /&gt;- Flirt tini by Fiesta Sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean that those are the ones you will receive, but hopefully it gives you a general idea what you might get.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I am very happy with what I got for this price. At my local tanning salon I paid between $7 and $9 for ONE sample pack. Here i get 30 for $19.99 +SH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use different lotions and I do get bored with one lotion after a while. Or some lotions smell good before tanning, but get a funky smell after tanning. Some lotions may turn you a weird color after several sessions and some lotions seem to make you whiter than you were to begin with lol. Occasionally, I left bottles in my car for several days after tanning and the heat or cold ruined it and I flushed $30 - $60 down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise --- if you are picky with your lotions, buy them at your local salon. If you like to experiment and try different things and get a ton of different sample packs for a great price, then go ahead and get these! :)&lt;br /&gt;I like surprises so this is perfect for me and I am 100% sure that I will order this again after using all mine. I am glad they change the variety, so hopefully I get some different kinds next time! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PS: I didn&#x27;t review any of the individual lotions, cause the variety changes. But I have used California Tan and Australian Gold in the past and was happy with the result of those brands.</li>
