      <li>My hair took it and looked good nonetheless.  </li>
      <li>and I can honestly say its great.</li>

      <li>Amazing hold, but why did they feel the need to add a scent?</li>

      <li>This hairspray is really amazing.  </li>
      <li>ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT</li>
      <li>you cannot return it to Amazon because it is considered a hazardous substance.  </li>

      <li>I think many women love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this Elnett hairspray.  </li>
      <li>My favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to get hold without achieving non-moving helmet head.  </li>
      <li>Following directions of spraying the roots, then style is the best way to use this product.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>The hairspray is ok but the fragrance smells like cat urine.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
      <li>Maybe back in the day it was the best, but times and hair products have evolved since then and there are better sprays out there.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more after an hour and had to wash it.</li>
      <li>If it was odor-free, it&#x27;d be perfect for those simple up-do&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
      <li>I bought this product after recommendations from many online hair stylists and people.</li>
      <li>OK</li>
      <li>HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS HAIRSPRAY, MY HAIR IS ALWAYS IN PLACE</li>
      <li>There is a much better touchable, flexible hold hairspray: Nexxus Comb Thru.  </li>
      <li>I had read in magazines that this was a top rated hairspray.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not into aerosol hairsprays, but I bought it because it&#x27;s nice to have a light, even hold.  </li>
      <li>This, however, is MORE than fine.  </li>
      <li>What i love: holds my fine hair well without looking &amp;#</li>
      <li>Only problem is the price; search for the best deal and then use on special occasions, as I do.  </li>
      <li>more accurate word for this is hair fog, not spray.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good sheer, fine hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>breaks easily.</li>
      <li>This is supposed to be a strong hold hairspray</li>
      <li>One tip: The \\&quot;strong hold\\&quot; label is misleading.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it hold your hair beautifully</li>
      <li>I keep a light and strong hold in my arsenal at all times.</li>
      <li>I do like a little shine with my hold, lol!  </li>
      <li>I do like a little shine with my hold, lol!  </li>
      <li>the best hairspray ever- hands down!</li>
      <li>It smells like cheap, powdery perfume.</li>
      <li>its light.</li>
      <li>There is an unscented version, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light hold but helps to reduce frizz without giving you the &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>great hold without making your hair look too big or 80s, recommended to all my friends</li>
      <li>You are worth it:)</li>
      <li>and I think this is a fantastic product for my hair.    </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t worth more than $4.  </li>
      <li>I think its perfect for straight hair styles, but its definitely not for lots of curls.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re worth it.&amp;#34; !</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special</li>
      <li>While it contains no water, which is a good thing, it simply doesn&#x27;t hold my hard-to-hold wavy style all day, even if I use a ton of it.</li>
      <li>It woks okay, but I really don&#x27;t like the scent</li>
      <li>true to its word.</li>
      <li>The hairspray is good for high humidity, but not as good as their previous sprays, also discontinued.</li>
      <li>On days where it is super humid or windy</li>
      <li>Got this product at a tremendous savings by buying in bulk.</li>
      <li>very fast service....... fantastic product</li>
      <li>The delivery from the can is a very fine mist that leaves your hair soft and touchable.  </li>
      <li>The best.hold without a sticky feeling especially in high humidity.</li>
      <li>REALLY!?!?  </li>
      <li>Maybe the extra strong hold formula is better.  </li>
      <li>I had read about it for years and knew it was a favorite of models and available only in Europe.  </li>
      <li>its worth the stink.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hairspray is such a fine mist that doesn&#x27;t hold. I have sprayed just the bangs with it to keep them off to the side and it feels like I haven&#x27;t sprayed anything. I thought it would be light since I typically don&#x27;t like hairsprays, but this is a waste of money if you need any hold.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is amazing. It does smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; when you spray it, but perhaps that&#x27;s because the old ladies have it figured out! No one seems to be able to smell it after a few minutes. Think old Hollywood instead of old lady. It&#x27;s worth getting used to.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a strong hold hairspray but it&#x27;s really a more natural, brushable hold.  At least that&#x27;s been my experience.  And it only works in low humidity.  I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and this hairspray doesn&#x27;t cut it on the really bad days.  But if you&#x27;re looking for softer hold, then this spray is a good one.  I purchased 3 cans of this at Walgreens for $4 each when they were discontinuing the strong hold formula (they now only carry the extra strong formula).  I knew of the great reviews it had received in magazines over the years so I decided that I&#x27;d buy the cans remaining on the shelf.  I like it OK but it&#x27;s nothing special and I&#x27;m hard pressed to see what all the fuss is about.  Maybe the extra strong hold formula is better.  This one, however, is no better than drugstore light hold formulas.  While it contains no water, which is a good thing, it simply doesn&#x27;t hold my hard-to-hold wavy style all day, even if I use a ton of it. There is a much better touchable, flexible hold hairspray: Nexxus Comb Thru.  It has a natural hold but it definitely holds all day and into the next.  I&#x27;ve never tried anything like it frankly and it even works in high humidity! And it&#x27;s a little less money than the Elnett. I would never use this Elnett spray for an updo.  For updos, I recommend two:  Helmet Head by CHI and Masterpiece by TIGI.  Both have extra firm hold and your hair is definitely going nowhere when you use either of these sprays.  Even in high humidity.  Just FYI.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for this Elnett hairspray.  It isn&#x27;t worth more than $4.  Maybe back in the day it was the best, but times and hair products have evolved since then and there are better sprays out there. I&#x27;m something of a hairspray junkie (because it&#x27;s so critical to my look) and the two extra hold ones I&#x27;ve mentioned are truly the best, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried almost every one on the market, high end and low.  For drugstore sprays, Got2Be&#x27;s Freeze is a firm hold spray that works as well as the two high end ones.  The new Tresemme runway collection Undone hairspray has durable natural hold that does work in high humidity.  However, the high end ones work a little bit better.  The Got2Be, however, works as well as Helmet Head and when I can&#x27;t find HH at TJ Maxx (where it&#x27;s $10 not $15) that&#x27;s what I use.  You can usually find it at Walmart for $5.  The TIGI has shine properties whereas the CHI and Got2Be don&#x27;t.  I do like a little shine with my hold, lol!  I can recommend the Elnett but only if you want natural hold and don&#x27;t have a problem with humidity.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it three stars.m hold spray that works as well as the two high end ones.

    <li> By far, best hairspray around.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray! It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> very fast service....... fantastic product</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair for a family wedding.  The smell was awful and unfortunately I did not have time to wash it out.  I do not feel it works any better than the less expensive Pantenes.  I had a coupon, but it still is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hairspray gives great hold but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky.  You can brush or comb it right out.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Just expensive.</li>
    <li> Got this product at a tremendous savings by buying in bulk. I may be a man but I like my hair to look nice without the plastered down look. This makes your hair look as though it has no spray on it whatsoever but it holds your hair in place all day long. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It works great, combs out (mostly) with the run of a comb/brush as its supposed to.  The only thing we don&#x27;t care for is the smell.  It reminds me of SURE deodorant my mom used back in the 80&#x27;s.  If it was odor-free, it&#x27;d be perfect for those simple up-do&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is really amazing.  You can spray it repeatedly on your hairstyle, and it never gets sticky or hard. Your hair stays touchable and brushable.  It is somewhat expensive, but totally worth it.  I would never go back to regular hair spray, and that includes brands that were even more expensive than the Elnett spray.  I pray they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> Amazing hold, but why did they feel the need to add a scent? Not only that, but the scent is the most terrible smell. And it doesn&#x27;t go away. It smells like cheap, powdery perfume. It will ruin your day. I wish I knew there was an I scented version before I purchased this.</li>
    <li> For some reason this particular product is hard to find in stores (I&#x27;ve only been able to find the \\&quot;extra strong\\&quot; hold locally), so when I came across the \\&quot;strong\\&quot; hold on Amazon I jumped on it. This version is less stiff than its extra-strength counterpart, and makes a nice finishing spray while still keeping my hair in place all day and leaving it more touchable and bouncy. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the extra strong hold as well, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option of both Elnett products!</li>
    <li> Doesnt dry your hair out. smells good. its light. has a strong hold, and i use it on my african american hair. i have a mohawk. but i just wanted something that wasnt going to be harsh or had alot of alcohol and dry my hair out. this is a perfect product. true to its word. brushes out and leaves your hair soft. versus bed head hair spray where it leaves your hair crispy and you cant brush it out!</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this product for years and is the only one she buys. For some reason, not always well packaged. Last purchase was lacking in padding and the box looked like it had been in a train wreck. One of the cans had a substantial crease or dent in it but she insisted on using it before the others. She like it because it does not cake her hair, between weekly visits to her hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Looking for something like Sebastian Shaper Hairspray. This is nearly as good and less expensive than Shaper. Fragrance fades fast.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair and this is the only hairspray that I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel matted down or overly sticky after applying.  The local stores in my area only carry the Extra Strong Hold - which does not work for me.  This product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  The best.hold without a sticky feeling especially in high humidity.</li>
    <li> I love how this product doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or dried out looking. Holds my curls pretty well all day. On days where it is super humid or windy I loose the curls but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I am 47 and have tried every hairspray on the market.  This is by far the best.  I have thin/fine hair and this gives great volume without be stiff or sticky.  I can run my fingers though without any catching and it smells great!  I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several hairspray products, but none equals this one. It holds without being sticky and gooey. Spray and comb through and you are set for the day.</li>
    <li> the best hairspray ever- hands down! neutral smell, no strong hairspray odor like most brands- great hold without making your hair look too big or 80s, recommended to all my friends</li>
    <li> This hairspray was recommended to me by my stylist who appreciates vintage do&#x27;s as I do. The spray applies nicely and brushes out well. I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I do think I will try to the extra strong hold next time however.</li>
    <li> Would never recommend this to anyone.  Can&#x27;t believe the positive reviews.  This stuff stinks horribly and leaves a terrible film on hair.  BTW...you cannot return it to Amazon because it is considered a hazardous substance.  REALLY!?!?  Strong and extra strong formulas both stink.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> this hair spray really does brush right out, and it is like you never used hairspray.  just about any hairspray will give you decent hold; but this is the only one I have found that vanishes when you brush your hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray smells so bad and it does not dissipate with time.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and get rid of the odor.</li>
    <li> If you want to preserve the relationships of the people you live with DO NOT BUY THIS. This hairspray&#x27;s fragrance is so strong it stinks up our whole apartment and lingers for hours. There is an unscented version so if you must use hairspray, at least use that instead.</li>
    <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t smell the way it does but love, love the way it holds and brushes out with absolutely NO flaking or residue.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray. It&#x27;s a light hold but helps to reduce frizz without giving you the &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb.  Use exclusively because it is good for my fine , thin hair.  I don&#x27;t have to pull my hair out when brushing this spray out.  Been buying for years .</li>
    <li> It woks okay, but I really don&#x27;t like the scent -it&#x27;s not pleasant.  It works okay if you don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> After rave reviews, I finally bought a can of the Strong Hold bottle and I can honestly say its great. It repels humidity, leaves your hair soft and it sprays on without leaving any sticky buildup. I think its perfect for straight hair styles, but its definitely not for lots of curls. I&#x27;m an African American with relaxed hair and I think this is a fantastic product for my hair.    I&#x27;ve read the other reviews (both for Strong Hold and Extra Strong Hold) and I don&#x27;t know what the bad smell is. Actually, my spray smells just fine. I haven&#x27;t tried the Extra Strong Hold (maybe that&#x27;s the problem??)</li>
    <li> ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER&lt;br /&gt;REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this hairspray since I purchased it. It is definitely as good as the reviews claim it to be. I am able to spray my entire head down and then still style my hair how I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am knocking down one star is the smell. It is not like all of the fresh and fruity scents on the market these days, so it takes a little getting used to. I feared that the unscented version wouldn&#x27;t work as well, but I will try that one next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after recommendations from many online hair stylists and people. I was a little bit skeptical since I read reviews about its  fragrance. A little word of advice here: if you are looking for a product that holds your hair do, this is the one. But, if you are looking for a product with no fragrance, I would suggest you go for the unscented one. However, the fragrance is not the issue here and I have no clue as to why is it so much of a big deal to everyone. It has a decent smell and the mist dissolves so quickly as if it was never there. The hair hold is pretty strong and I have very voluminous hair. Just go for it. You are worth it:)</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best hairspray on the market.  I had read about it for years and knew it was a favorite of models and available only in Europe.  So, I was thrilled when it became available here a few years ago.  I have been using it ever since with superior results. It can be hard to find (Target carries but they are frequently out) and it is not cheap. It IS worth it however.  One tip: The \\&quot;strong hold\\&quot; label is misleading.  The formula is actually not very strong at all and leaves the hair quite soft and natural looking.  I actually have both the Strong and Extra Strong in my arsenal and I use both everyday, on different parts of my hair. The best part is that is does not ever seem to build up.  No matter how much you touch up, you don&#x27;t get that crumbly \\&quot;dust\\&quot; like with other products. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the best hold with flexibility I&#x27;ve ever found in a hairspray. I curl my hair everyday with rollers and then spray the curls in hairspray. I hate it when sprays give my curls a crunchy, hard, sticky, dry feel. Yuck. This does what it says. It hold the curl and keep the flexibility and moisture in my hair very close to what it is naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this brand by a coworker a few months ago.  I&#x27;ve purchased 4 Satin hairsprays since then. I keep a light and strong hold in my arsenal at all times. There&#x27;s a reason this has been a best seller for decades. The smell is distinct and brings back childhood memories.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how well this hairspray performs because of the stench.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.  What a waste, since hairsprays cannot be returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> It was not what i spected</li>
    <li> What i love: holds my fine hair well without looking &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;harder hairsprays tend to blow my hair out of the desired shape.&lt;br /&gt;also -- you can comb this out. harder hairsprays are killer on my fine hair,&lt;br /&gt;which breaks easily. its worth the stink.</li>
    <li> I buy this hairspray regularly, as I love it&#x27;s non-stickiness, and it&#x27;s ability to hold my hairstyle in place without making it stiff or weighing it down. It&#x27;s a very good sheer, fine hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my only complaint is that the nozzle gets gummed up occasionally (requiring blasts of hot water to clear it), and it&#x27;s not very accurate (but then again, I don&#x27;t know of ANY hairspray that is accurate enough to prevent getting hairspray in places where you don&#x27;t want it, like your face or clothes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I love it -- it&#x27;s definitely my hairspray of choice!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not into aerosol hairsprays, but I bought it because it&#x27;s nice to have a light, even hold.  It does a great job of that.  However, for the rest of the day I can SMELL it SO strong in my hair!!!  It is nauseating if I am wearing my hair down and if I have it up, every time I stand up I get a waft of the awful chemical smell of it.  I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I read about this hair spray about 2 years ago and decided to try it on my fine thin hair.  After about 3 days I decided this way MY hairspray and have used it exclusively since then.  It holds my hair in the local humidity (about 9 months a year)...and I buy it on Amazon for the best price.  Try it...and see!</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is headache-inducing.  Otherwise, this holds nicely without being sticky.</li>
    <li> I have supper fine, short hair.  But to find a hairspray that actually can hold my hair for longer than the time it takes me to style it seemed impossible.  This stuff is great.  It actually feels like I have no product on my hair.  In fact I stood in front of the mirror just waiting for the style to flop and it never did.  Following directions of spraying the roots, then style is the best way to use this product.</li>
    <li> I had read in magazines that this was a top rated hairspray. The cap was broken on arrival but was easily fixed. The hairspray is ok but the fragrance smells like cat urine. I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It works.  I bought the &amp;#34;Strong Hold&amp;#34; because I read so many reviews on the nasty smell of the Extra Strong Hold (which I&#x27;ve never tried).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t think this Strong Hold smells bad at all.  I bought mine at Target recently, and really, there is no bad, strong smell.  I realize scent is a subjective thing... but other hairsprays smell so much like pure &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t stand using them.  This, however, is MORE than fine.  It does everything it advertises and I&#x27;m so happy I went ahead and purchased!  Really, the scent is not terribly strong, and what scent I can detect is not at all offensive - - as a matter of fact I prefer it over a &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; chemical-smelling hairspray.</li>
    <li> I tried this hair spray because it was touted to be the best.  IT IS!! Not only does it hold your hair beautifully but you do not even know it&#x27;s there!! Your hair is soft to the touch and looks natural..no hairspray look.  Worth every penny!  Will never use anything else. And a simple brush of your hair it is gone.  Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> I was entirely happy with my purchase of L&#x27;Oreal Elnett Hairspray, as well as the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever!  It is not sticky, combs right out.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. I think many women love this product. But ladies, if you spray this in a room with other people in it, it really sucks for the other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lingers, it spreads, it get&#x27;s stuck in my nostrils. I wish my wife didn&#x27;t love this product so much, or that she would spray it outside on her way to the car. It&#x27;s a small tradeoff because her hair does look gorgeous, but husbands beware.</li>
    <li> Certainly the best hairspray on the market; does not remain in hair after a good brushing.  Lends body but not stiffness.  Only problem is the price; search for the best deal and then use on special occasions, as I do.  Or treat yourself &amp;#34;because you&#x27;re worth it.&amp;#34; !</li>
    <li> Great hairspray. The only one I use on my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky or stiff but will hold your style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years - long before it became available in the USA.  It is an excellent product.  However, I would prefer the &amp;#34;normal hold&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t find it on Amazon anymore.</li>
    <li> Stinks like cheap perfume and I could not return it.</li>
    <li> I AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS HAIRSPRAY, MY HAIR IS ALWAYS IN PLACE BUT SO SOFT YOU CAN&#x27;T FEEL IT, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT AND ITS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
    <li> this hairspray is super, duper, ultra AWESOME!  I live in Louisiana, world capital of heat combined with humidity (or maybe a tie with Houston).  My hair is as soft and fine as baby hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to get hold without achieving non-moving helmet head.  This stuff holds and holds and your hair can actually still move very naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more accurate word for this is hair fog, not spray.  The delivery from the can is a very fine mist that leaves your hair soft and touchable.  I can run my fingers through my hair without any resistance, yet it falls right back into place.  Attended a recent barbeque and the wind was blowing very hard.  My hair took it and looked good nonetheless.  The fragrance is light and not unpleasant, although smell is always a matter of personal preference.  Why else would there be hundreds of perfumes???  There is an unscented version, if that is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the product of a lifetime in this hairspray and recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the recommendations and was disappointed in the product (the service and delivery were great, though). It didn&#x27;t hold all that well and it made my hair smell like old lady hair. I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more after an hour and had to wash it. I live in humid Alabama so maybe it just didn&#x27;t hold through the humidity. Whatever it was, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Garnier Fructis for humidity and Big Sexy Hair for hold.</li>
    <li> My go to hairpray. Love it. Keeps style; allows for movement and is a great product to use again in the evening when you go out after work without all the added residue!</li>
    <li> This product was most likely discontinued due to the faulty spray system as the top keeps falling off. The hairspray is good for high humidity, but not as good as their previous sprays, also discontinued. I wish they&#x27;d stick with one and keep it around for awhile.</li>
