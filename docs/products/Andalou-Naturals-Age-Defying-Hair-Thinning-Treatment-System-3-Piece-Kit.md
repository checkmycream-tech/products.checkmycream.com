      <li>Great product and great sevice</li>

      <li>Plus, it smells nice and leaves my hair detangled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of tea tree oil.</li>
      <li>Hopefully with more use things just get better!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even ask for my name and number for a follow up or to ask questions so that they can learn more about their own products.  </li>
      <li>, I greatly feel it&#x27;s worth the price solely on how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>I should have known better.</li>
      <li>We LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, seems to be working.</li>
      <li>I love Andalou hair products, but this one didn&#x27;t impress me and I saw no improvement in my hair at all.</li>
      <li>confident the product is healthy for me.</li>
      <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Cannot say for sure it has helped regrow hair</li>
      <li>Okay shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this product for the ingredients and being cruelty-free.  </li>
      <li>Smells very clean.</li>
      <li>Great product so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that Andalou offers a treatment system package.</li>
      <li>, so don&#x27;t let the strong smell dissuade you.</li>
      <li>The funny thing is I bought this in Hawaii on vacation and the scent was so amazing and</li>
      <li>My husband was worried that I had developed some kind of vitamin deficiency!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and nourishing for my scalp and hair!</li>
      <li>That alone is huge, and is improving my self-esteem and decreasing my worry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shampoo was fabulous.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe here are some free products or here is a Visa gift card for a couple of hair</li>
      <li>the shampoo so fantastic</li>
      <li>Good lather and conditioning for a natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have super fine, silky hair but this stuff makes it feel like straw.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and hair is now back to normal - except for all of the hair I lost!!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a natural shampoo with no chemicals of any kind</li>
      <li>Great buy as well as last a long time due to great concentration and suds up so nicely.</li>
      <li>Mild smell.</li>
      <li>It made my already fine hair feel soft, light, and smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The improved peace of mind is worth every penny paid for this already-economical trio of hair care products.</li>
      <li>Love it so far.</li>
      <li>Whereas I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, i have noticed a HUGE difference in hair loss.</li>
      <li>First, research.</li>
      <li>3 years later it was still falling out, and even more than before.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down like most do.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t see less hair breakage YET.  </li>
      <li>but I certainly have not lost any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The serum goes fast when applied each evening.</li>
      <li>Talk with someone who knows their stuff, a nutritionist or natural pathologist can point you in the right</li>
      <li>the very first time I shampoo my hair, I immediately noticed that I barely noticed any hair</li>
      <li>Hair loss can be due to any number of things and treating it hair loss needs more than one approach.</li>
      <li>but we both love this shampoo and conditioner and it has replaced our previous brand.  </li>
      <li>Bought just the serum initially and saw quick results.</li>
      <li>I use high end products.  </li>
      <li>I am dedicated to using only natural projects and was excited to try this system to thicken my hair.  </li>
      <li>(unlike normally I would tell I catch a lot of hair when I shampoo).  </li>
      <li>After I had a baby my hair started falling out, which the Dr. said was normal.</li>
      <li>I was about to make an appointment with my doctor when I thought, could it be the new hair care products?  </li>
      <li>I find it difficult to believe that something with that much fragrance in it could be good for my body.</li>
      <li>On top of using this product I also take a daily dose of a multitude of vitamins, especially biotin, B12, super greens, silica, inositol...to name a few.</li>
      <li>cuts on us since you now need it cut due to our products causing significant hair loss...</li>
      <li>Have only been using it for a few weeks, but so far loving it.</li>
      <li>I have dry hair but by using this its become more dry.</li>
      <li>I do have some thinning in one area that, once I use the entire product, hopefully will have positive results.  </li>
      <li>so I wanted to try the natural route.</li>
      <li>I have used 2 complete sets of the Andalou Naturals Age Defying Hair Thinning Treatment System with ZERO results.</li>
      <li>Still too early to say if it works as described</li>
      <li>but there are still some unpronounceable elements included in this formula not contributing from natural sources.</li>
      <li>few tips, make sure your hair is SOAKING wet before you apply the shampoo, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t lather very well.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling soft and thicker.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used very long, but cleans hair very well!</li>
      <li>As other reviews have stated it does have an unusual smell but not so much to be off putting.</li>
      <li>I used this product several times and then gave up due to the smell, which is both overpowering and sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>I finally decided to go for the all natural shampoo to see if it would help with the hair</li>
      <li>did notice a considerably less amount of hair loss after first use.</li>
      <li>I just about to finish my first treatment and already got my 2nd treatment a few days ago.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow back in full and thick or anything</li>
      <li>Since beginning the treatment, I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growing in the places where it had been falling out, and it has GREATLY decreased the amount of hair loss for me, and that alone is so worth</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair, I eat well and exercise</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dry hair but by using this its become more dry. However smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I am discontinuing it but can work for others as  a friend of mine uses and  it works for her.</li>
    <li> Used for two months, showing no signs of hair loss improvement. As other reviews have stated it does have an unusual smell but not so much to be off putting. I give it only two stars because it makes my hair softer and easier to brush unlike other shampoos but not much else.  I was expecting a natural shampoo with no chemicals of any kind but there are still some unpronounceable elements included in this formula not contributing from natural sources.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, silky hair but this stuff makes it feel like straw. The serum makes my scalp feel like I&#x27;m being stung by fire ants and has caused scabs and bumps on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I had already thinning hair.  I am dedicated to using only natural projects and was excited to try this system to thicken my hair.  Instead of thickening my hair started to come out by the handful!  So much hair was coming out that our drain was clogged every few days.  My husband was worried that I had developed some kind of vitamin deficiency!  Handful of hair came out every shower!!! I was about to make an appointment with my doctor when I thought, could it be the new hair care products?  Went back to my old shampoo and conditioner for a few days and tried this stuff again.  Same result - hair came out by the handful.  I stopped using it and hair is now back to normal - except for all of the hair I lost!!!!!!!  I had my long hair cut short (was below my bra strap and is now an above the shoulder bob) to try to cover up how thin it now is.  Horrible experience!  I called customer service and they did not care in the least.  Didn&#x27;t even take my name and number/address for a call back or for even a coupon.  Don&#x27;t know what I expected but at least some care/concern.  The store refunded my money but I thought the company would care too.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe here are some free products or here is a Visa gift card for a couple of hair cuts on us since you now need it cut due to our products causing significant hair loss...I don&#x27;t know what but something besides Sorry &#x27;bout that!  Didn&#x27;t even ask for my name and number for a follow up or to ask questions so that they can learn more about their own products.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE COMPANY AS WELL AS THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Love the smell, seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I like this product is because I have serious hair loss problem. This product does help me away from it.</li>
    <li> This is the first Andalou product I was not happy with.  It has an odd scent and it didn&#x27;t help my hair look healthier.  I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair thinning/breakage due to a thyroid problem.  Love this product for the ingredients and being cruelty-free.  Have only been using this system since it arrived.  My hair feels and smells great.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t see less hair breakage YET.  I do have some thinning in one area that, once I use the entire product, hopefully will have positive results.  An update:   The smell and the way my hair feels is the only benefit.  Does nothing to help my hair loss/thinning.</li>
    <li> Told about this by friends for helping hair to slow the falling out of hair. Works better than I thought it would. I&#x27;m sold on it. Already re-ordered.</li>
    <li> The shampoo was fabulous.</li>
    <li> I just about to finish my first treatment and already got my 2nd treatment a few days ago.  This past winter has been really hard on my hair, and I been losing a lot more hair than usual.  I finally decided to go for the all natural shampoo to see if it would help with the hair lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the very first time I shampoo my hair, I immediately noticed that I barely noticed any hair (unlike normally I would tell I catch a lot of hair when I shampoo).  I was very happy with this.  The smell is a little odd, but if it keeps my hair on my head I had no problem with it.  I kept switching back and forth from 2 - 3 different shampoo that treats various things (volume, dryness..etc).  I can always notice the difference in my hair loss when I use the Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips, make sure your hair is SOAKING wet before you apply the shampoo, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t lather very well.  The smell is &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; but I wouldn&#x27;t say it stinks or anything ... like I said, if it keeps my hair on my head, nothing a little perfume can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> Since using the Andalou age defying hair kit my hair has gotten thicker and has grown. I know that sounds strange? But at the age 40 I have fine thin hair, I eat well and exercise and I&#x27;m tired of hair loss and this does work. My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out like it used too, it seems thicker. stronger. I&#x27;m addicted! Its cruelty free too, and has good ingredients its a win, win situation.</li>
    <li> I used this product several times and then gave up due to the smell, which is both overpowering and sickly sweet. I find it difficult to believe that something with that much fragrance in it could be good for my body. DO NOT buy this if you have sensitivity to chemical fragrance. I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I love Andalou hair products, but this one didn&#x27;t impress me and I saw no improvement in my hair at all.</li>
    <li> The funny thing is I bought this in Hawaii on vacation and the scent was so amazing and the shampoo so fantastic, I wanted to bring some back.  Then I found out it was made in Novato!  So, I ordered on Amazon not only the shampoo, but the conditioner.  We LOVE it.  And, I am picky.  I use high end products.  I have color treated, porous hair.  Both my partner (he has curly, thinning hair) and I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s mild and nourishing for my scalp and hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for a few weeks, but so far loving it. It leaves my hair feeling clean, and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighed down like most do. Hopefully with more use things just get better!</li>
    <li> Great product so far.</li>
    <li> I decided to try Andalou Naturals for my hair loss instead of Rogaine, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;ve had a bit of thinning hair due to hormonal problems (I&#x27;m around 30 and female). I had read up on some side effects from Rogaine so I wanted to try the natural route. Since beginning the treatment, I&#x27;ve noticed new hair growing in the places where it had been falling out, and it has GREATLY decreased the amount of hair loss for me, and that alone is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is no quick fix system. You need to keep at it for several months before you will see any improvement. I think it took about a month before I noticed the new hair coming in, but I noticed my overall hair loss decrease within only a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about the smell, it definitely is different. It kind of reminds me of tea tree oil. I use a mousse on my hair after I shower and I&#x27;ve not smelled any remnants of the shampoo and conditioner smell, so don&#x27;t let the strong smell dissuade you.</li>
    <li> Okay shampoo and conditioner. Mild smell. Good lather and conditioning for a natural shampoo. Does nothing for volume. Didn&#x27;t notice any thickening of hair, but in all honesty, I only used 3/4 of the shampoo/conditioner. The serum goes fast when applied each evening. Should come with a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I love these items!!!  you get the benefits of the thinning hair treatments without all the terrible chemicals!!  it works!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he is losing some hair but I ended up using it too. Not sure if it helps the hair loss situation yet but we both love this shampoo and conditioner and it has replaced our previous brand.  Very concentrated..a little goes a long way. Leaves hair feeling soft and thicker. Great buy as well as last a long time due to great concentration and suds up so nicely.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t find that this trio makes my hair particularly soft, or that it is prompting new hair growth, it has seriously decreased my hair loss, and my hair just gleams. That alone is huge, and is improving my self-esteem and decreasing my worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The improved peace of mind is worth every penny paid for this already-economical trio of hair care products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product three stars because I haven&#x27;t been using it long. I read all of the reviews for this product and I think it should be stated that relying solely on ANY shampoo, conditioner, or any hair re growth product for that matter is going to prove as inadequate. Hair loss can be due to any number of things and treating it hair loss needs more than one approach. There is no one cure all for this sort of situation. First, research. If you have access to a computer, do your research. Just because a product is organic does not guarentee that it is going to be &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; for each individual. Next, a proper diet always goes a long way. Having plenty of veggies and lean proteins in your diet is not only going to improve your hair, it&#x27;ll improve overall health. Lastly, vitamins. Talk with someone who knows their stuff, a nutritionist or natural pathologist can point you in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My actual review for this product is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a considerably less amount of hair loss after first use. It made my already fine hair feel soft, light, and smooth. I used all three products included in this kit as directed. On top of using this product I also take a daily dose of a multitude of vitamins, especially biotin, B12, super greens, silica, inositol...to name a few. I message my scalp to stimulate blood flow to my hair follicles for at least 15 minutes a day. I eat a balanced diet and I exercise 4-5 times a week. My battle has been extreme amounts of stress, so this is my routine to counter the stress I undergo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, I greatly feel it&#x27;s worth the price solely on how it makes my hair feel. I can&#x27;t say that it does what it states it should do, but that is because I have a entire routine in place to help with my situation.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it. Still too early to say if it works as described</li>
    <li> I just order my third set of this system. I have pretty serious hair loss (female) in my mid-30&#x27;s. So I started using this product. Whereas I haven&#x27;t noticed any new hair growth, i have noticed a HUGE difference in hair loss. It seems to slowed down quite a bit. I use the topical treatment 1-2 a week. Plus, it smells nice and leaves my hair detangled. Which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST product I have found that helps me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Bought just the serum initially and saw quick results. I&#x27;m happy that Andalou offers a treatment system package.</li>
    <li> Great product and great sevice</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product by a sales person, after searching for something to help with thinning and losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for just over a year now. Cannot say for sure it has helped regrow hair but I certainly have not lost any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im confident the product is healthy for me.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used very long, but cleans hair very well! The serum makes my scalp tingle, which I figure is a good thing. Smells very clean. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claims it will do.</li>
    <li> I have used 2 complete sets of the Andalou Naturals Age Defying Hair Thinning Treatment System with ZERO results. No new hair, still losing hair, hair is thin and fragile and the product did not make any difference.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo but no didn&#x27;t help hair loss at all.</li>
    <li> This product really helps slow down hair loss. After I had a baby my hair started falling out, which the Dr. said was normal. 3 years later it was still falling out, and even more than before. I bought this on a reccomendation, and was skeptical. Within three days my hair stopped falling out in clumps. I didn&#x27;t use the little hair serum pack, just the shampoo and conditioner. It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow back in full and thick or anything but I definetly noticed it stopped my hair from falling out. I have been improving my diet to get my hair to grow back in thicker.</li>
