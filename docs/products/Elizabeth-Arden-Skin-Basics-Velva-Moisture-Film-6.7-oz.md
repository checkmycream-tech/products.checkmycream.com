      <li>this is a good deal to get this product, better price than stores.  </li>
      <li>I have used the product for many years and have always liked it.  </li>
      <li>and I cannot understand why Elizabeth Arden would discontinue such a popular product, it is perfect for my skin.</li>
      <li>Many department stores did not carry the Elizabeth Arden moisturizer that I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this for MANY years..</li>
      <li>In my opinion, Velva Moisture Film works better than Oil of Olay.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I can purchase this from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s up, Elizabeth Arden, that you discontinue a product so many love and have used for years?  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I tried it and love it.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Velva Moisture Film many years ago.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and can no longer find it online or in stores.</li>
      <li>I am very excited to have found this product at half-price.  </li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted at a good price</li>
      <li>It does feel like velvet, and leaves my parched dry skin feel smooth and wonderful!!  </li>
      <li>Great to be able to buy things when the local stores no longer carry them.</li>
      <li>It was easy to find it on Amazon and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to buy it for her if it remains available.</li>
      <li>It really does penetrate the skin instead of smearing around on top of it.  </li>
      <li>Super upset.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbed amazingly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the old-fashioned scent, but it is worth all the 5-star reviews that others have given it.   </li>
      <li>It is also useful as a stand-in for night cream or a hand cream.</li>
      <li>The recipient of the gift was pleased to receive it, as she had been using it for several decades and could no longer find it in stores.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>Too bad that the Elizabeth Arden company is so clueless about marketing their best products, pays no attention to the desires of loyal older customers, and keeps chasing after a younger generation which does not believe in brand loyalty and only wants the newest and latest trendy stuff.   </li>
      <li>And all reviews are so strongly positive.  </li>
      <li>If you put Velva Moisture Cream on your face first, and then apply makeup, the makeup goes on much smooother.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended product!</li>
      <li>fast ship will buy again</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, Wife could not believe the price.  </li>
      <li>I feel good with it, however, it looks difficult to absorb at the first time, so you have to massage it for a while to get it not visible on your face.</li>
      <li>I love this product and was having trouble finding it locally.</li>
      <li>Every morning for the past several decades I have rinsed my face with warm water, dried it, and applied this moisturizer -- it has maintained my skin health and elasticity very well.</li>
      <li>Recently I found a bottle at a Macy&#x27;s store, the last one they had, and I wondered if it would live up to my memories.  </li>
      <li>I was just sick last year when I learned that Elizabeth Arden is discontinuing this great product.  </li>
      <li>but can no long get it..</li>

<li> Money down the drain!!!!!</li>

<li> What is wrong with Elizabeth Arden???</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this moisturizer for over 40 years but Elizabeth Arden has discontinued it.  Was happy to find it on Amazon.  Elizabeth Arden, bring it back, please!</li>
    <li> I used to use Velva Moisture Film many years ago.  It became scarcer and scarcer until I could no longer find it anywhere.  I tried other moisturizers, including some that contain wax which is supposed to fill up the wrinkles, but nothing seemed to measure up.  Recently I found a bottle at a Macy&#x27;s store, the last one they had, and I wondered if it would live up to my memories.  The first night I used it, I thought, this stuff really is great!  I&#x27;m not crazy about the old-fashioned scent, but it is worth all the 5-star reviews that others have given it.   I&#x27;m at the age when everything is wrinkling at once, made worse by a recent spell of dry windy weather.  After using Velva Moisture Film for a week, I still think it is helping.  The cost at Macy&#x27;s was about $45 for a 6.7 oz. bottle, while a much smaller bottle of an Estee Lauder product costs about $70.  Too bad that the Elizabeth Arden company is so clueless about marketing their best products, pays no attention to the desires of loyal older customers, and keeps chasing after a younger generation which does not believe in brand loyalty and only wants the newest and latest trendy stuff.   A few years ago, Consumer Reports did a study of a sampling of moisturizers (NOT including Velva Moisture Film or a lot of other commonly-used moisturizers).  CR concluded that none of them worked very well, but Oil of Olay worked as well as the expensive brands, for a lot less money.  In my opinion, Velva Moisture Film works better than Oil of Olay.  It really does penetrate the skin instead of smearing around on top of it.  I do wish Elizabeth Arden would re-introduce this moisturizer to the world.</li>
    <li> This is the very best mosturizer I have ever used.  It truly leaves your skin feeling different than any other cream you will ever use.  It is great under your make-up.  I promise that you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  It has been around for at least 30 years, so I doubt they will discontinue it tomorrow!</li>
    <li> fast ship will buy again</li>
    <li> Many department stores did not carry the Elizabeth Arden moisturizer that I wanted.  It was easy to find it on Amazon and it arrived very quickly.  In fact, everything I have ordered has come in a timely fashion.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000H7KY3E Elizabeth Arden Skin Basics Velva Moisture Film 6.7 oz]]  Great to be able to buy things when the local stores no longer carry them.</li>
    <li> We never got the Elizabeth arden cream we ordered. Super upset. Will not be ordering anything else off here. Money down the drain!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Wife could not believe the price.  All these years, she paid double OTC.  She&#x27;s asking me to look for other makeup and skincare items.</li>
    <li> I was just sick last year when I learned that Elizabeth Arden is discontinuing this great product.  Now, I&#x27;m running out and am looking for a new supply and the price of the few bottles out there has mushroomed to $125-$130 per bottle.  What is wrong with Elizabeth Arden???</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice online as a gift for a relative.  The recipient of the gift was pleased to receive it, as she had been using it for several decades and could no longer find it in stores. She is 93 years old and says it is the secret of her youthful appearance!  I will continue to buy it for her if it remains available.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and can no longer find it online or in stores. Please, please bring Elizabeth Arden Velva Moisture Lotion back. There is not a comparable product on the market like it and I cannot understand why Elizabeth Arden would discontinue such a popular product, it is perfect for my skin. Thanking you in advance, I hope you will reconsider putting it back in stores or online.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absorbed amazingly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Goes great under makeup. Highly recommended product!</li>

Great night time moisturizer for me.  So sad that it is no longer available anywhere.  And all reviews are so strongly positive.  What&#x27;s up, Elizabeth Arden, that you discontinue a product so many love and have used for years?  Kudos to the product, but boos to the company that decided to stop making it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that I have ever used and have used it for decades.  I can&#x27;t imagine why it has been discontinued by Elizabeth Arden.</li>

    <li> I am so glad I can purchase this from Amazon.  Elizabeth Arden no longer carries \\&quot;Velva Moisture Cream\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;It is the best and I have used this moisturizer for 30 years.</li>
    <li> If you put Velva Moisture Cream on your face first, and then apply makeup, the makeup goes on much smooother.  I like that.</li>
    <li> The size of this product is much larger than the usual ones. I feel good with it, however, it looks difficult to absorb at the first time, so you have to massage it for a while to get it not visible on your face.</li>
