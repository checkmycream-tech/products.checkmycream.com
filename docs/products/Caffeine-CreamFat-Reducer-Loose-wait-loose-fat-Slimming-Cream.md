    <li> i love this product you will see a difference as long as you exercise and eat healthy. use 3 times a week as recommended for about 1 month or 2. and also corset train along with it you can def expect to lose those inches and also get great lookin curve</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second day using the cream &amp; so far so good I hope to loose inches by my birthday in September!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing what it claims to do but I&#x27;m addicted. I believe I&#x27;m seeing less cellulite but since I still have some my doubts remain.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY !!! NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY AT ALL !!</li>
    <li> Amazing love the results...</li>
    <li> Worked out everyday, hard cardio about a month really didn&#x27;t see a huge diffrent maybe it take a couple of months or so to work. That&#x27;s why I rated it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.. It really does work.  Using it regularly will tone up your skin.</li>
    <li> Its amazing itswork I like The product and I recomend and help me toreduce apperance the cellulite en two weeks</li>
    <li> Great smell. I have not seen in difference in reducing my fat on side of legs. If looking for cream this is nice</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do squat. I wish I could get my money back</li>
    <li> I can not rate this product yet as it takes several months to see improvemt. But I certainly will write a review at a later time.</li>
    <li> I thought it would work to help reduce the appearance of cellulite because it said it had the caffeine cream in it. I used it all religiously, wanting to finally end my war with cellulite and it didn&#x27;t work. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the smell so really haven&#x27;t used it not sure if it works....</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously but I try to apply at least once a day, I try not to do it before going to bed cause the bangay smell isn&#x27;t very romantic. It&#x27;s enough that my fiance teases me about it, he knows when I&#x27;ve applied it. So besides that as far as results go, can&#x27;t really say.  My cellulite is smoothing out but don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s owed more to working out &amp; loosing weight. None the less I bought it &amp; will continue to use it &amp; hope that I am benefiting from it.</li>
    <li> I been useing this product for three weeks now and no changes</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen no results ,been using for 2mouth</li>
    <li> I could actually see the difference of cellulite disappearing and it did help reduce inches and noticed it activated some sweat.  I wore this lotion and then wrapped myself in plastic and did my house chores.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I do not see any fat reduction my legs do look a little smoother .I think its to soon to judge.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of not taking before pics but I think it&#x27;s working. Expensive but Im a fan. Smells like muscle cream.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and it works with the belt trimmer</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> si te ayuda asudar y si reduce</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been more effective</li>
    <li> Wow! I have definitely noticed a decrease in cellulite on my legs and butt!</li>
