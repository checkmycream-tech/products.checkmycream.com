      <li>tHIS IS A GREAT ITEM.</li>
      <li>Great price also.</li>
      <li>My husband liked it too!</li>
      <li>It does not work very good for fingernails though, the floating head is more for feet.</li>
      <li>I used it with just 2 batteries on the level 1 and it worked so good.</li>
      <li>and she loved it.</li>
      <li>A good value for the price.</li>
      <li>Some people give it good reviews, maybe there is a bunch of defective ones out there</li>
      <li>I am sure it will be as great.</li>
      <li>Also, the best time this tool works is right after you semi-dry your feet from soaking in the warm water for about 5 min.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I think it works great the soles of my feet - gets them really smooth.  </li>
      <li>It does a nice job of smoothing the skin out.</li>
      <li>am so thrilled with this Jerdon Pedismooth</li>
      <li>is excellent for doing nails,and works great on bunions and all rough areas of the feet.  </li>
      <li>I thought I needed to spend a lot more money to get something effective.  </li>
      <li>I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I&#x27;ll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  </li>
      <li>The little machine works great, has very good power.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is better than the others I had bought after the &lt;br /&gt;first gave out.</li>
      <li>I would not pay more than 2.00 for this.</li>
      <li>Best as part of a larger arsenal of pedicure equipment.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I got it before the beginning of sandal season.</li>
      <li>Im Not One to trust to many online products</li>
      <li>I sure hope so.</li>
      <li>It is better to removes the calluced skin.</li>
      <li>As stated by others, this needs more sandpaper refills.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that i bought the product, it works well.</li>
      <li>I would like to see an AC adopter option for th power which would provide more ummh, but for the price and for it&#x27;s abilty, I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it as well.</li>
      <li>and today I ordered 7 more.  </li>
      <li>I used it on my heals and it works really good and fast.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it does a good job, but it stops if you put too much pressure.  </li>
      <li>The batteries don&#x27;t fit easily.</li>
      <li>thing, the attachments that work the best are the little sand paper-like pieces, and you should go ahead and order some extras of these while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
      <li>10 dollars is too little a price to pay for great feet!</li>
      <li>Its made of CHEAP materials.</li>
      <li>Well, if 3 refills cost $6, this tool is quite cheap.</li>
      <li>My feet feel silky smooth after a pedicure.</li>
      <li>This product works well, I actually enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I saw this product and bought one for myself and for my sister.</li>
      <li>Make sure you soak your feet first.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I guess I will go with the original hand tool after my refill is used up.</li>
      <li>Would be great if the tool has a little more power.</li>
      <li>Maybe I got a dud, considering many others&#x27; positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>It is a cheap piece of garbage and does absolutely nothing!!  </li>
      <li>The only attach I use is \\&quot;sand\\&quot; which does a good job.</li>
      <li>Overall I would say I was a good buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could find something better in the future?</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT REMOVES THEM QUICKLY, AND HAS MY FEET NOT ONLY LOOKING BETTER, BUT FEELING BETTER</li>
      <li>I liked it, however, I wish it had a little more power to it.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap product, but does work reasonably well.</li>
      <li>I thought my feet looked better than when I get a professional pedicure done</li>
      <li>the only thing that is missing is a electric plug adapter otherwise it is a excellent product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it might last -- only had it about 3 months so far, but it seems fairly sturdy and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Here this is the first time in 10 years he can wear sandels.</li>
      <li>A similar gadget will cost 10 to 20 times more in stores.  </li>
      <li>I cleaned my  rugged heels in exactly 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I used the Jerdon Pedismooth Pedicure set when it first arrived.</li>
      <li>I tried it on myself first.  </li>
      <li>product smooths, and will improve hardened/rough skin, but it&#x27;s not enough to get to fresh smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the more effective pedicure tools I&#x27;ve owned although still takes a little more time than I&#x27;d like to remove the dead skin and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Like normal pedicure, soak your feet in warm water with liquid soap / shampoo for 5-7 minutes, dry them and then use the machine.   </li>
      <li>If you have some dry skin, it might work okay for that.</li>
      <li>IT comes with three different sanding attachments: fine, medium and course.</li>
      <li>in(you really have to shove them in there).</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to purchase this because I wanted something that would really work.</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>It worked really well for about a dozen times.  </li>
      <li>do not waste your money!!!</li>
      <li>It takes three AA batteries, which I though was unusual, but it is plenty powerful enough to get the job done very fast.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product is for real and that people gave this high ratings.  </li>
      <li>I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn&#x27;t shoddy.  </li>
      <li>However, I like it a lot: it really makes your feet smooth; the replacements are \\&quot;everlasting\\&quot;; it doesn&#x27;t consume lots of energy; I have dropped it several times and it&#x27;s still in one piece, working properly.</li>
      <li>Plus, at under $10, it would totally be worth it even if it didn&#x27;t last forever.&lt;br</li>
      <li>...and it wasn&#x27;t worth having to send it back.  </li>
      <li>save your money and get the toes done professionally!</li>
      <li>Though there&#x27;s a year warranty, it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth the cost of shipping it back.  </li>
      <li>Mine came missing a piece, the one that attaches the head securely to the body.</li>
      <li>Everyone could use soft feet for the summer.  </li>
      <li>ONCE AGAIN MY SOFT FEET.</li>
      <li>There are two speeds, high and low.  </li>
      <li>No other site had reviews about this product</li>
      <li>I do agree with other reviewers in the fact that the heads do tend to detach frequently , but once u learn to hold the machine lightly &amp; not press it onto your foot too hard it works great without falling off.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know what I am doing, so I just used it to get rid of the rough jagged calluced skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using various types of things to help me avoid having calloused heels for 10-15 years. I was excited when I saw this product and bought one for myself and for my sister. What a disappointment! It just doesn&#x27;t work well. There isn&#x27;t enough \\&quot;power\\&quot; in the spinning for it to really have an effect on serious callouses. If you have some dry skin, it might work okay for that. But anyone with serious callous problems needs to look elsewhere. This isn&#x27;t your answer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all.  THIS WILL IMPRESS YOU!  And for the cash you can&#x27;t afford not to try it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   JUST DO IT!  I even bought extras as gifts!</li>
    <li> Despite mixed reviews, I got this pedicure set. I think it works great the soles of my feet - gets them really smooth.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> It worked really well for about a dozen times.  Then the motor stopped rotating.  Though there&#x27;s a year warranty, it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth the cost of shipping it back.  I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Not enough power to do anything. Drags on the skin and slows it down. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I am glad that i bought the product, it works well. I would like to see an AC adopter option for th power which would provide more ummh, but for the price and for it&#x27;s abilty, I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to a self pedicure.  I have purchased a total of 5 units.  They make great gifts.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I got mine a week ago and today I ordered 7 more.  For my daughter, daughter-in-law and gifts for upcoming birthdays for my girlfriends. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just 5 days and it has  transformed my feet from dry to soft. It&#x27;s like getting a salon treatment at home.... I would definitely recommend the Jerdon Pedicure set.</li>
    <li> ...and it wasn&#x27;t worth having to send it back.  Seriously.  I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched them.  No luck. It ran very, very slow, and then it just quit.  As another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use, it&#x27;s my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism.  I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I&#x27;ll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn&#x27;t shoddy.  Maybe I got a dud, considering many others&#x27; positive reviews.  I sure hope so.</li>
    <li> At the beginning it was difficult to learn how to control this apparatus. If you put a lot of pressure it stops. Sometimes the heads go off. The batteries don&#x27;t fit easily. However, I like it a lot: it really makes your feet smooth; the replacements are \\&quot;everlasting\\&quot;; it doesn&#x27;t consume lots of energy; I have dropped it several times and it&#x27;s still in one piece, working properly. A similar gadget will cost 10 to 20 times more in stores.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It works very good, efficient, good potency. It is better to removes the calluced skin. If you are diabetic, it&#x27;s a very good solution to avoid accident with the blade-cutting-callous. I recommended this set.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best pedicure sets I have owned.  My feet feel silky smooth after a pedicure. I am glad that I got it before the beginning of sandal season.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap product, but does work reasonably well. &lt;br /&gt;That said, after buying this, I then purchased the &#x27;Tweezerman Callus Shaver &amp; Rasp&#x27; and &#x27;FootSmart Pedicure Set&#x27;. Since I purchased these other Amazon items, the Jerdon Perismooth hasn&#x27;t been used once. &lt;br /&gt;This product smooths, and will improve hardened/rough skin, but it&#x27;s not enough to get to fresh smooth skin. Best as part of a larger arsenal of pedicure equipment. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> tHIS IS A GREAT ITEM. I USED IT ALL OF THE SUMMER BECAUSE I WEAR SANDALS AND WELL MY SKIN WAS GETTING ROUGH BUT AFTER BUYING THIS I HAVE ONCE AGAIN MY SOFT FEET.</li>
    <li> This pedicure set is great! I gave it to someone for a gift, and it was a big, big hit! Now the person I gave it to is buying some for others. I don&#x27;t know how long it might last -- only had it about 3 months so far, but it seems fairly sturdy and it does a great job. Plus, at under $10, it would totally be worth it even if it didn&#x27;t last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, the attachments that work the best are the little sand paper-like pieces, and you should go ahead and order some extras of these while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
    <li> Whaow! I bought this product based on reviews on Amazon. No other site had reviews about this product and I was skeptical about buying it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But what a surprise! Its an awesome piece of work. I used it with just 2 batteries on the level 1 and it worked so good. I cleaned my  rugged heels in exactly 10 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Quick tip: Like normal pedicure, soak your feet in warm water with liquid soap / shampoo for 5-7 minutes, dry them and then use the machine.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am so thrilled with this Jerdon Pedismooth that now I am gonna use the Jerdon Manicure kit too. I got that also on Amazon. I am sure it will be as great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Kiss roughness goodbye!</li>
    <li> The little machine works great, has very good power. is excellent for doing nails,and works great on bunions and all rough areas of the feet.  the only thing that is missing is a electric plug adapter otherwise it is a excellent product.</li>
    <li> This pedicure set is great! I do agree with other reviewers in the fact that the heads do tend to detach frequently , but once u learn to hold the machine lightly &amp; not press it onto your foot too hard it works great without falling off. 10 dollars is too little a price to pay for great feet! go ahead &amp; get this!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product is for real and that people gave this high ratings.  It is a cheap piece of garbage and does absolutely nothing!!  do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> The only attach I use is \\&quot;sand\\&quot; which does a good job. The only concern I have is that the refills of sand are quite expensive. You have 3 refills coming with this purchase. But I accidently dropped one in the toilet and the one attached on the tool was flying out one day after I used it maybe 3 times. So I only have 1 refill left. I looked at the price--$6 for 3 refills purchasing from the factory! Well, if 3 refills cost $6, this tool is quite cheap. Anyway, I guess I will go with the original hand tool after my refill is used up. Also, the best time this tool works is right after you semi-dry your feet from soaking in the warm water for about 5 min.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much you can say about this product except that it doesn&#x27;t work. I put the batteries in(you really have to shove them in there). The battery cover doesn&#x27;t even close all the way. You turn it on and as soon as you touch anything to the sandpaper the machine stops as if it had no power. Just a bad product. Some people give it good reviews, maybe there is a bunch of defective ones out there and I got one of those, but enough people complain that they got a bad one, so maybe it isn&#x27;t worth trying. Pretty sad.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the more effective pedicure tools I&#x27;ve owned although still takes a little more time than I&#x27;d like to remove the dead skin and smooth.  Would be great if the tool has a little more power.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price. I thought my feet looked better than when I get a professional pedicure done and I only spent a few minutes on each foot. My husband liked it too! For the low price too, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This product works well, I actually enjoy using it. Purchased 3 as Christmas gifts havent heard any complaints yet.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this products as a gift about 10yrs ago. &lt;br /&gt;When it finally gave out, I search and seach and it was &lt;br /&gt;no longer in the market. &lt;br /&gt;Then I had order something else from you and I reviewed &lt;br /&gt;you foot products and .........hurray!!!! it was back. &lt;br /&gt;I ordered it for my daughter-in-law and she loved it. &lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered for myself. &lt;br /&gt;It is better than the others I had bought after the &lt;br /&gt;first gave out.</li>
    <li> I used it on my heals and it works really good and fast. I don&#x27;t really know what I am doing, so I just used it to get rid of the rough jagged calluced skin. It does a nice job of smoothing the skin out. It does not work very good for fingernails though, the floating head is more for feet. It takes three AA batteries, which I though was unusual, but it is plenty powerful enough to get the job done very fast. IT comes with three different sanding attachments: fine, medium and course. Also there are three refills for a total of 6. I can not see using it enough to ever need the refill that it came with. The sanding attachment seems to hold up real good.There are two speeds, high and low.  I recommend this item and I think it would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> It only works on SLOW speed, if it cost more I would have sent it back</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy I bought this item.  Everyone could use soft feet for the summer.  The price was very affordable for what this little machine can do!  I recommend buying it because it is affordable!!</li>
    <li> As stated by others, this needs more sandpaper refills.  The other two seem useless to me.  Mine came missing a piece, the one that attaches the head securely to the body. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does a good job, but it stops if you put too much pressure.  I&#x27;m sure I could find something better in the future?</li>
    <li> this is a piece of junk.  save your money and get the toes done professionally!</li>
    <li> I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND BECAUSE OF MY MEDICATION I SUFFER WITH HORRIBLE CALLUSES ON MY FEET AND TOES. THIS PRODUCT REMOVES THEM QUICKLY, AND HAS MY FEET NOT ONLY LOOKING BETTER, BUT FEELING BETTER AS WELL. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR EVERYONE.-------APRIL SMITH</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because his feet are very rough on the bottom.  I specifically ordered this one since the head was bigger than the other ones I found on line.  I tried it on myself first.  It has NO power to it at all and if you put any pressure on it, it will come to a stop.  After a few seconds with it on, it started to smell of burnt plastic.</li>
    <li> I used the Jerdon Pedismooth Pedicure set when it first arrived. I liked it, however, I wish it had a little more power to it. Make sure you soak your feet first. Overall I would say I was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This pedicure set does what I expected it to do.  The batteries are difficult to get in and out but the product works well.  A good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Im Not One to trust to many online products But my husband had a horrible Fungal infection on his toes within a week a 50% Improvemnt and Now with the summer Here this is the first time in 10 years he can wear sandels. We didnt Have to spend $100.s of dollars On the anti fungal creams and medications .This is Great for men and woman.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because I wanted something that would really work. I thought I needed to spend a lot more money to get something effective.  But I am very, very pleased with it! It worked great, and my feet look beautiful!  I like it so much, I&#x27;m going to buy one for my sister too.</li>
    <li> Dont even think about it. This product should be discontinued. Its made of CHEAP materials. I would not pay more than 2.00 for this. Has 99cent store quality. Can buff nails at best.  Pass on this.</li>
