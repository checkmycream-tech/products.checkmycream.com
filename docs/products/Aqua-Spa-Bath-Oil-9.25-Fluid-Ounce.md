      <li>Thanks Aqua Spa!</li>
      <li>I love the different, spa-like scents.</li>
      <li>Just bought this tonight and used it for the first time....</li>
      <li>Buying products where a scent is an important part of the experience without being able to smell them first hand is a little tricky, so here is my take on how they smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Eucalyptus fragrance was very rightfully names Sooth, since it really does help sooth and calm irritated lungs when one has a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
      <li>you are trying to live like a princess while stretching your beauty budget - be sure to check out the entire Aqua Spa line!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil to use especially in our sons baths with his dry skin.</li>
      <li>The Sooth bath oil is wonderful to have when you&#x27;re suffering from a bit of a cold.</li>
      <li>It is also very inexpensive to purchase unlike pricier competitors.</li>
      <li>I love the lavender scent, and plan to purchase the other 2 scents very soon.</li>
      <li>I like the vibrant colors the bottles bring my bathroom.&lt;br</li>

      <li>The scent is incredible and helps soothe my tired and over dry skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to put on lotion when I came out because my skin was so hydrated and soft!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>The scent is not overwhelming like many lavender products.  </li>
      <li>really seems to calm down my irritation.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
      <li>Large bottle and includes a Marine Youth Complex to leave your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>so it is  my least favorite of the bath</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a moisturizing bath oil that will not leave you feeling soft, not greasy, afterwards, give Aqua Spa&#x27;s Relax Bath Oil</li>
      <li>Made the water so silky and my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>mo2F2GYEATGVUZX]]Aqua Spa Bath oil is a thin oil with the bold sweet scents.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m totally digging this new oil.</li>
      <li>After the bath my skin feels very soft and totally non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua</li>
      <li>I actually used it on myself AND our 6 year old son who has eczema.</li>
      <li>It only takes a few drops and it makes my skin super moisturized without feeling greasy afterwards.</li>
      <li>A few drops in the bath when i have super dry and itchy</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2F2GYEATGVUZX]]Aqua Spa Bath oil is a thin oil with the bold sweet scents.

    <li> The Sooth bath oil is wonderful to have when you&#x27;re suffering from a bit of a cold. The Eucalyptus and Mint fragrance is so relaxing on lungs that are fatigued and tender from excessive coughing. This fragrance is not flowery, so if guys are worried about coming out from the bath smelling too girly, that isn&#x27;t an issue with the Sooth version of this bath oil. The Eucalyptus fragrance was very rightfully names Sooth, since it really does help sooth and calm irritated lungs when one has a cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I did like the bath oil, the scent wasn&#x27;t too overwhelming. I actually used it on myself AND our 6 year old son who has eczema. Although it was nice on my skin, I wish it was a bit more &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling.  That of course is my own personal preference..I&#x27;m always looking for a good oil to use especially in our sons baths with his dry skin. I will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> I try to stretch my dollar as much as possible so I&#x27;m totally digging this new oil. Here are a few of the uses I&#x27;ve discovered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A few drops in the bath when i have super dry and itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. While showering I add a few drops on my shoulders for an aromatherapy steam shower.&lt;br /&gt;3. I also find after using it in the shower or bath, I don&#x27;t have to apply body lotion after toweling off.. my skin seems to stay hydrated with a nice glow - not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;4. I have eczema on my scalp and use this once a week as a scalp treatment - really seems to calm down my irritation.&lt;br /&gt;5. My favorite use... massage oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be interested in hear if anyone else finds other uses :) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love this amazing bath oil. The scent is incredible and helps soothe my tired and over dry skin. As a busy work at home mom of three, I don&#x27;t have time to waste on products that don&#x27;t work. This one is amazing!</li>
    <li> If you are someone who loves relaxing bath times, then you will love Aqua Spa Bath Oil! It has a wonderful smell, and makes your skin feel like silky velvet. It is also very inexpensive to purchase unlike pricier competitors.</li>
    <li> Aqua Spa Bath Oil made my skin feel so smooth. I usually do not use bath oil, but I will be using Aqua Spa from now on! I love that there are three scents to choose from: Lavender &amp; Chamomile, Eucalyptus &amp; Mint, and Citrus &amp; Ginger. The Lavender and Chamomile is extremely relaxing and soothing.</li>
    <li> Leaves you refreshed but bathtub a little slicky. Like the refreshing smell and feel.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nighttime, the Lavender and Chamomile infusion is the perfect way to relax! Large bottle and includes a Marine Youth Complex to leave your skin feeling silky smooth. I definitely recommend for any momma on a budget. You can afford luxury!</li>
    <li> Love the bath oil!  Aqua Spa Bath Oil maked my bath feel so comfy.  I like the fact that the bath oil comes in three scents: Lavender &amp; Chamomile, Eucalyptus &amp; Mint, and Citrus &amp; Ginger.  The aroma of the Lavender and Chamomile is extremely relaxing and soothing.</li>
    <li> Aqua Spa Relax Bath Oil can be used as a massage oil, an oil in your bathtub after a long day and of course a skin oil in place of lotion.  One thing I have noticed is that since using the Aqua Spa products my use of lotion has decreased significantly. It is a fantastic product that I couldn&#x27;t live without!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a moisturizing bath oil that will not leave you feeling soft, not greasy, afterwards, give Aqua Spa&#x27;s Relax Bath Oil a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it&#x27;s soothing purple tint and the light scent of lavender and chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs quickly in your skin and makes a great alternative to lotion. I like to use it on my dry patches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to live like a princess while stretching your beauty budget - be sure to check out the entire Aqua Spa line!</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is intoxicating!  Makes my 5 minutes of piece seem a lot longer and a little relaxing aroma therapy in the bath is perfect for a pregnant woman!  I also added a cap-full to some heated milk/water that I soaked my feet in and it was amazing!  Great product!</li>
    <li> My 1st love is the fact that this was made in the USA! 2nd-the scent-Lavender and Chamomile was light and calming! Loved it. 3rd  the way it made my skin feel~soft and smooth-best of all it was not OILY! My skin just drank it in-it is refreshingly light. Great product I would recommend to anybody that needs their own personal getaway. I can not wait to try the other 2 scents soon!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this - will put on my arms and legs before bed to moisturize and love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this bath oil, it actually works, is a great value so if you&#x27;re on a budget I&#x27;d highly recommend this brand. If you&#x27;re in a hurry after your bath there&#x27;s no need to apply lotion, this oil keeps your skin hydrated all day. There&#x27;s no oily residue and after your bath if you have dry patches of skin just rub it in. It&#x27;s scent is perfect, a lot of products have over powering scents, this one has a soothing scent perfect for the morning or  before bed.</li>
    <li> I love the lavender scent of this product. On stressful days,I can start a nice hot bath and pour some of this amazing oil in it and it just lets me drift off in relaxation. The price is great, I have tried many others that are pricier and that aren&#x27;t as moisturizing or smell as great as this. 5 stars!</li>
