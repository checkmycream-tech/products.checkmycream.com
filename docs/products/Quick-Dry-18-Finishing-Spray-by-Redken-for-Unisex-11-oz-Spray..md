      <li>pretty good hold...</li>
      <li>easy to brush out.</li>
      <li>Luckily Amazon was super nice about getting me a refund.  </li>
      <li>I like this hairspray and been using for years and years as it&#x27;s a flexible hold for my fine hair</li>
      <li>I had to use three or four layers to get any hold at all on my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Just buy a cheap powder bronzer and miss in w the powder.</li>
      <li>I can avoid it if I get my hair exactly how I want it with clay, then very quickly spray on a light coat of QD18,</li>
      <li>I love the Redken hairspray and the small bottle is great for traveling.</li>
      <li>good price and same as i buy at salon.</li>
      <li>Quick drying...</li>
      <li>The reason I like this hairspray is that it dries so quickly --</li>
      <li>Holds great without weighing down!</li>
      <li>I really like this Redken hairspray because it is light and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a helmet.  </li>
      <li>Great product for not too stiff hair</li>
      <li>Even though it is more costly than many other hair sprays, it lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this level is too high.  </li>
      <li>The spray clogs up all the time so that you have to rinse it out under hot water every time you want to use it.</li>
      <li>This is my ultimate favorite hairspray.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>this is the first time I have purchased it online through the Amazon site.  </li>
      <li>Save yourself the money and spurge on the real product at your salon!</li>
      <li>I dont believe this really is a Redkin product!</li>
      <li>No amount of hot water, removing cap and scrubbing, nothing works.  </li>
      <li>No amount of running under hot water or cleaning out with a straight pin will rectify the problem when I get one of these defective cans.  </li>
      <li>I would then comb through the dried hair of the  body and then spray it lightly w a spray oil for fine hair (I use phyto)  </li>
      <li>Product arrived as scheduled but not packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>I am so thankful for this hair spray because not only does it fit my needs, but I am NOT allergic to it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon and BeingJoli.</li>
      <li>When you pay $18 for a can of hair\\&quot;spray\\&quot; you really expect it to work.  </li>
      <li>Not too much fragrance either.  </li>
      <li>wait about a minute, then another light coat, and possibly a 3rd if I notice stuff falling out of place.  </li>
      <li>4 stars because it&#x27;s pricey and may not be something I buy regularly but a go to for me for important hair styles.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I loved it because it left my hair &amp;#34;combable&amp;#34; and not so rigid as other sprays.  </li>
      <li>When my hair is oily,  I give a very light spray to the body of my hair (after teasing it just to give it natural body) and let it dry.</li>
      <li>This spray comes out in a fine mist &amp; it is dry.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a dance I have to perform with my weird fine swirly cowlick etc.</li>
      <li>This particular can has never worked from day 1.  </li>
      <li>Pricing is decent.</li>
      <li>It will foam up at the nozzle and the most you get is little droplets of the stuff.  </li>
      <li>It is quick drying, which is nice, especially if you&#x27;re about to run out of the house and don&#x27;t have time to watch and adjust your hair as it inevitably falls down during the drying the process.  </li>
      <li>and I am grateful he was kind enough to help an average, &amp;#34;non-beautiful&amp;#34; person.</li>
      <li>I normally like RedKen products</li>
      <li>I received a reply to this review and the seller sent me a label to return the unusable can and sent me a new one which does work.  </li>
      <li>The clerk couldn&#x27;t tell me they were getting the exact produce in in the future</li>
      <li>Instead I received the old silver label, so the price increase is a mystery to me.  </li>
      <li>My local store was out of the product because of the new look in packaging.</li>
      <li>only complaint is that for some reason it tends to \\&quot;separate\\&quot; my hairs, for lack of a better description.  </li>
      <li>When I received the bottle, the hairspray would barely spray out of the nozzle and I had to remove it and wash it out (which would work for a few quick sprays)</li>
      <li>It dries extremely fast without that wet look</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, and after shampooing and blow drying… I spray it on lightly… it dries in no time… then I style my hair … because it doesn&#x27;t dry stiff..</li>
      <li>but the other day I just gave up and went to Ulta and bought a new bottle which works</li>

    <li> BEST HOLDING HAIRSPRAY EVER!!</li>
    <li> The only hair spray I use! Works great and is not sticky!</li>
    <li> My favorite hairspray! The perfect amount of hold, without stickiness or too much stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;Works great through humid weather also.</li>
    <li> Love the hairspray but hate the nozzle as it doesn&#x27;t work well. Always foams up and ends up not working.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as scheduled but not packaged very well.  I had this product in my cart, and was notified of a price increase, so I thought I would be receiving the NEW designed black label.  Instead I received the old silver label, so the price increase is a mystery to me.  I love this produce I have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> I use this spray after some other clay products that do the majority of the \\&quot;holding\\&quot;.  I just use the Redken spray to help keep everything in place.  It is quick drying, which is nice, especially if you&#x27;re about to run out of the house and don&#x27;t have time to watch and adjust your hair as it inevitably falls down during the drying the process.  It also dries without leaving a really weird feeling like a lot of sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that for some reason it tends to \\&quot;separate\\&quot; my hairs, for lack of a better description.  I like my hair to be in chunks, and I find when I use this spray and touch my hair even slightly before it dries my chunks tend to break down and expose all the individual hairs.  I don&#x27;t know if the spray is like dissolving the other product(s) in my hair and causing things to not stick together anymore or what, but it gets on my nerves.  I can avoid it if I get my hair exactly how I want it with clay, then very quickly spray on a light coat of QD18, wait about a minute, then another light coat, and possibly a 3rd if I notice stuff falling out of place.  It&#x27;s kind of a dance I have to perform with my weird fine swirly cowlick etc. hair to get it to do what I want.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite Hairspray, never thought I could order online</li>
    <li> good price and same as i buy at salon. thanks</li>
    <li> love the hair spray,but 2 of the cans (purchased 3 cans) lost the air &amp; would not spray  resulting in having lost&lt;br /&gt;at least a third of each can of spray. Will purchase mine locally from now on.</li>
    <li> This spray works great for people with fine hair like me! Holds great without weighing down!</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite hairspray. It dries extremely fast without that wet look you get with just over the counter hairsprays. Firm hold with that just stepped out of the salon finish.  My hair always looks great when I use this hairspray. I haven&#x27;t found any other hairspray out there that can hold &amp; not look wet all day long.</li>
    <li> The reason I like this hairspray is that it dries so quickly -- that&#x27;s especially important in hot, humid weather. It holds well also.</li>
    <li> Quality of this hairspray is the best.  It has a very fine spray which holds for a great length of time without feeling sticky.  Even though it is more costly than many other hair sprays, it lasts longer.  Only spray I use.</li>
    <li> It works! My hair loves to go all over the place and this spray manages to keep it stead without making it look unnatural.</li>
    <li> The spray clogs up all the time so that you have to rinse it out under hot water every time you want to use it.</li>
    <li> This No. 18 arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I am so thankful for this hair spray because not only does it fit my needs, but I am NOT allergic to it.  Thanks, Amazon and BeingJoli.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now and for what it does I haven&#x27;t found anything better - I am still tempted away occasionally and regret it every time.  If the product is applied to the underside of the hair it works well and keeps the volume loft throughout the day.  The downside - IMO the white flake shedding.  Not as bad as other products but it still flakes off the hair and is noticeable on dark clothing.</li>
    <li> My most favorite hairspray ever.  Great hold, but still allows movement.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Quick drying...no flakey residue...pretty good hold...easy to brush out. 4 stars because it&#x27;s pricey and may not be something I buy regularly but a go to for me for important hair styles.  If you have the money...go for it!</li>
    <li> Same quality at a lower than store price.</li>
    <li> Normally love this hairspray.  This particular can has never worked from day 1.  All I get is a sticky dribble.&lt;br /&gt;I tried every remedy found on Google...to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointing and a waste of $$ cuz I cannot return.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and much more affordable on Amazon. Perfect hold for hours. Try it.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Arrived in great shape.</li>
    <li> I am not giving this hairspray a bad review because I don&#x27;t like the Redken quickdry 18 (I actually love this hairspray) but this is the first time I have purchased it online through the Amazon site.  The hairspray has been horrible.  When I received the bottle, the hairspray would barely spray out of the nozzle and I had to remove it and wash it out (which would work for a few quick sprays) and then it would clog and stop working.  I have babied this bottle 1/3 of the way along (super expensive so I am not going to just waste it) but the other day I just gave up and went to Ulta and bought a new bottle which works fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I am super disappointed at the quality of the product when I purchased online.  Buyer beware</li>
    <li> The can arrived dirty with food or something yellow and sticky (looked like egg) on it and the can was dented. I was not impressed and will not order from this provider again.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray! it&#x27;s not sticky, but holds thick hair really well.</li>
    <li> I dont believe this really is a Redkin product! My hair dresser warned me that imposters are on amazon and I didnt believe her until I bought this! Save yourself the money and spurge on the real product at your salon!</li>
    <li> Always works on my hair time after time. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this reken product for years and i love it.  i use it as i&#x27;m styling because it&#x27;s not a strong hold and you can spray and style, spray and style, and then finish with a stronger-hold hairspray.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for the hold you get.  I had to use three or four layers to get any hold at all on my fine hair.  I can do that with Suave at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I had not used this product before but I have been pleased with it. Works well and priced well.</li>
    <li> the spray mechanism is broken and therefore not useable...</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair sticky and frizzy. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> This spray is a great product to use on fine hair, however, the spray nozzle on many of the cans clog up rendering the remainder of the can unusable. Most attempts to unclog the nozzle fails. I have started saving nozzles from the cans that work to use as replacements! Really, this is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I really like this Redken hairspray because it is light and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a helmet.  However, every few cans I get will have a problem with the spray nozzle. It will foam up at the nozzle and the most you get is little droplets of the stuff.  When you pay $18 for a can of hair\\&quot;spray\\&quot; you really expect it to work.  No amount of running under hot water or cleaning out with a straight pin will rectify the problem when I get one of these defective cans.  I didn&#x27;t see any way of contacting the seller about it.  Stuck with another expensive can of hairspray that I can&#x27;t use. ............UPDATE:  I received a reply to this review and the seller sent me a label to return the unusable can and sent me a new one which does work.  Five stars for making a positive out of a negative from this seller.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the wonderful service...the products came in perfect condition.  I love the Redken hairspray and the small bottle is great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the scent, but has a good hold.</li>
    <li> Great product for not too stiff hair</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hairsprays -- well priced.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser gave me a sample size of this product last year, and I didn&#x27;t try it until very recently, when another bottle of spray ran out.  I loved it because it left my hair &amp;#34;combable&amp;#34; and not so rigid as other sprays.  So when that little bottle ran out I rushed to Amazon to find a replacement.  I think 11 ounces might last me for five years!</li>
    <li> I normally like RedKen products but this one was awful.  Luckily Amazon was super nice about getting me a refund.  This left a chalky residue in my hair.  I will never use it again!</li>
    <li> use this all the time and love it.</li>
    <li> I like this hairspray and been using for years and years as it&#x27;s a flexible hold for my fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down... BUT, I can&#x27;t tell you how many cans of this size and the travel that clog up the nozzle and it becomes unusable.  No amount of hot water, removing cap and scrubbing, nothing works.  My husband actually ended up puncturing the bottle when he tried to get it working again while we were on vacation and needed my hairspray!!!!</li>
    <li> Always great product!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this level is too high.  I prefer 12. With my hair type it made my hair dry and shellac-ed into place. I want a flexible hold. Not really sure of any current style where you don&#x27;t want your hair to move at all. Tacky.  When my hair is oily,  I give a very light spray to the body of my hair (after teasing it just to give it natural body) and let it dry. Remember to flip over and get there too. This is also after I put a small amount of baby powder on the visual roots and worked it in. Dark Hair? Just buy a cheap powder bronzer and miss in w the powder. (bronzer has shimmer so it adds slight sparkle.  I would then comb through the dried hair of the  body and then spray it lightly w a spray oil for fine hair (I use phyto)  This restores the shine.  I then add a touch of philosophy strength cure repair treatment.  Just a touch.  To da!  My tutorial on how not to wash your hair for 5 days.  (and get compliments). You will thank me for this.  However,  I still prefer REDKEN hairspray in the black bottles. The silver bottles are no longer in production.  Not sure if there is an expiration date....</li>
    <li> My local store was out of the product because of the new look in packaging. The clerk couldn&#x27;t tell me they were getting the exact produce in in the future so I went home and purchased it from Amazon. I try to always have an extra one so I won&#x27;t run out! This is the lightest and quickest drying spray I have every been able to find. I like to scrunch my hair while I&#x27;m spraying it and  my hair behaves beautifully all day. I hope I never have to go with out the Redken Quic Dry 18!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. This spray comes out in a fine mist &amp; it is dry. It does not weigh your hair down or make it wet like some sprays do. This is by far the best and I will continue to buy it over and over!</li>
    <li> A famous, nationally known hair dresser recommended this product, so I bought it.  It did a wonderful job on my hair and I am grateful he was kind enough to help an average, &amp;#34;non-beautiful&amp;#34; person.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and after shampooing and blow drying… I spray it on lightly… it dries in no time… then I style my hair … because it doesn&#x27;t dry stiff.. like other air sprays… and my hair style stays all day.</li>
    <li> Hairspray did not work after a few times!! Wasted whole cans of hairspray. Will only by from beauty supply house from now on even though it is more expensive at least I can use the whole can!</li>
    <li> Great light hairspay but can be hard to find where I live.  Not too much fragrance either.  A little spray will do you.</li>
    <li> I have used Redken products for years and love them.  Unfortunately, the can of Redken Quick Dry 18 I ordered has a problem with the can pressure and doesn&#x27;t spray.  I have had this problem before with other cans I purchased from other distributors.  I think it&#x27;s a Redken problem.</li>
    <li> Spray works as expected.  Pricing is decent.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair spray in a sample size so I was very excited to get more for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray i like.  Thanks!</li>
