      <li>The soap dish itself is ok</li>
      <li>One of the better soap dishes I&#x27;ve ordered.  </li>
      <li>This soap dish allows the soap to dry in between uses, which greatly extends its life.</li>

      <li>It is staying pretty clean on its own.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Perfect look, but it gets moldy and has to be scrubbed often :(</li>
      <li>Anyway I was worried alittle about getting such a plain wooden soap dish about stuff like staining and the soap slipping off, but it works real fine, even better than the glass dish I always used, the soap is allowed to air dry btw uses and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find staining like some of the other reviewers - the soap does somewhat stick to and leave the color of the soap, but it rinses right off.  </li>
      <li>very organic looking...matches my other accessories in the bathroom shower.</li>

<li> very organic looking...matches my other accessories in the bathroom shower.</li>
<li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t know it was soo small!</li>
<li> the quality of wood and workmanship was limited.  </li>
<li> Shipped as expected.  </li>
<li> Pretty sad</li>
<li> unlike the previous reviewer I hadn&#x27;t noticed any staining at all, perhaps she was using a soap that bleeds colour?</li>
<li> I received my soap dish in a less than satisfactory condition.</li>
<li> Broke down after a few months of having it in the bathroom.</li>
<li> Had for a little while now</li>
<li> Could be because it fell a few times.</li>
<li> This is a plain wood dish, so plain that there is no apparent varnish on the dish so that the water soaks into it and makes it an ugly dark, stained soap dish after only a day or two.</li>
<li> moves around, and the soap suds escape, and makes a mess!</li>
<li> no more melty soap.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this occurred during shipping or if it&#x27;s just poor craftsmanship.</li>
<li> The slats were crooked and when I removed it from its plastic wrap, one of the slats just fell away from the base, exposing the small nails used to keep it affixed.</li>
<li> Besides that you can see them from the side of the dish, not attractive to me.</li>
<li> one dish had a nail coming through because it was in the wrong place.  </li>
<li> , yep the wood does gets a permanent ugly stain which cant be removed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like the wood look and it stays where i put it  soap stays on it really well  stays clean soap doesn&#x27;t get mushy Had for a little while now and i really like it</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose. Doesn&#x27;t get moldy or slip.</li>
    <li> The soap dish itself is ok but it had these sticky things on the bottom that weren&#x27;t mentioned in the description.  Even though I was not going to use the sticky things, I know they will look ratty after a while of use on my bathroom counter. Besides that you can see them from the side of the dish, not attractive to me. Guess they are good if you want it to stay in one place but that&#x27;s not my style. I sent it back. I would never have bought it if I had known.</li>
    <li> Works great. Broke down after a few months of having it in the bathroom. Could be because it fell a few times.</li>
    <li> Great lil dish for the price.</li>
    <li> I think this is great! unlike the previous reviewer I hadn&#x27;t noticed any staining at all, perhaps she was using a soap that bleeds colour? Anyway I was worried alittle about getting such a plain wooden soap dish about stuff like staining and the soap slipping off, but it works real fine, even better than the glass dish I always used, the soap is allowed to air dry btw uses and the zen design suits my bathroom nicely.    Edit: couple of weeks in use and I see the problem, yep the wood does gets a permanent ugly stain which cant be removed. Pretty sad cos I really like this soap dish</li>
    <li> This is a plain wood dish, so plain that there is no apparent varnish on the dish so that the water soaks into it and makes it an ugly dark, stained soap dish after only a day or two.</li>
    <li> One of the better soap dishes I&#x27;ve ordered.  Others fall apart, this one still in good shape.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner.  Was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap holder I have found. It is not rotting. It is staying pretty clean on its own.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting pores.</li>
    <li> Cute but a little darker wood than is shown here. Still a good deal.</li>
    <li> for my husband who never (NEVER) takes his soap out of the shower. no more melty soap. and yes, I&#x27;m the one who puts it back on the counter.</li>
    <li> Best defense against soap scum. I love a bar of soap not liquid and this fits in to my minimalism plan</li>
    <li> This good quality but very small. Check the measurements if you are looking for one for large size soaps bars.</li>
    <li> Shipped as expected.  I like the product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect look, but it gets moldy and has to be scrubbed often :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my face soap.  It works great.  Comes with sticky things on legs to stick to counter.  I will not be using this function but thought you all should know.</li>
    <li> nice. just as pictured.</li>
    <li> This thing stained after the first use in the shower. It is not properly sealed, if at all. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> nice in the kitchen...very organic looking...matches my other accessories in the bathroom shower.</li>
    <li> I received my soap dish in a less than satisfactory condition. The slats were crooked and when I removed it from its plastic wrap, one of the slats just fell away from the base, exposing the small nails used to keep it affixed. I&#x27;m not sure if this occurred during shipping or if it&#x27;s just poor craftsmanship. I&#x27;m leaning towards the latter. Either way, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> These work perfect for soap and look really cute too.  Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> This soap dish allows the soap to dry in between uses, which greatly extends its life.</li>
    <li> the quality of wood and workmanship was limited.  one dish had a nail coming through because it was in the wrong place.  my husband found much nicer teak dishes online elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to keep your soap from sitting in a puddle of water and prolong the life of the soap.  This is made of bamboo so eco-friendly too.</li>
    <li> I love this soap dish.  I make homemade soap and this really extends the life of my soap.  I don&#x27;t find staining like some of the other reviewers - the soap does somewhat stick to and leave the color of the soap, but it rinses right off.  It is much better than my soap sitting in a puddle of water that will turn the soap to mush!  I bought 4 and I will be buying more since I like to hand them out as gifts when I share my soap with family.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep soap from melting away in the shower.  Looks great, too!</li>
    <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t know it was soo small! My fault, for not reading it&#x27;s size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moves around, and the soap suds escape, and makes a mess!</li>
