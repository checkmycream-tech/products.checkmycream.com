      <li>I love love this product, but was over priced for what I received!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very small compact, like a trial size, but for the price, it&#x27;s perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, translucent mineral veil to help you look flawless for the rest of the day.</li>
      <li>It provides that same flawless finish that the BM mineral veil is known for.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Both products were great, but this one is extra handy.  </li>
      <li>As expected, great Bare Minerals product at a great price!</li>
      <li>, it give great coverage.. is pretty small but fits great in my purse.</li>
      <li>Based on the price, I thought it was the full size.  </li>
      <li>(I thought it was full sized), but actually I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s smaller.</li>
      <li>I love using this mineral veil touch up after applying bare minerals powder foundation.</li>
      <li>I still use the loose powder in the morning, but keep this handy throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>but it was at Ulta for only 12$ I do love it</li>
      <li>And the best part is that it&#x27;s translucent, so color/shade is irrelevant.  </li>
      <li>First I ordered the foundation, and then I ordered this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a stay at home mother of infant and made this purchase in a hurry not realizing that this is pretty much a sample</li>

      <li>I have the full size at home and bought this to carry in my little pouch, it&#x27;s a great small travel size product to use during the day as touch up.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized this was travel size - you can buy the full size for the same price elsewhere on amazon or this half-size for $10.95 and save yourself a couple bucks!  </li>
      <li>Touch Up Veil feels so comfortable and looks so natural it has become the only makeup I use.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little light though.</li>
      <li>The compact it comes in is small, and the small pad applicator that comes with it is great.</li>
      <li>Bare minerals</li>

<li> My foundation is there, just a little splotchy from the sweat, so this compact does the trick.</li>
<li> When I get a little shiny and want to touch-up, it&#x27;s effortless.  </li>
<li> so I avoid  heavy makeup.</li>
<li> Small compact</li>
<li> Not sure what that&#x27;s about</li>
<li> If you scroll down, it will eventually say travel size, but I missed it unfortunately.  </li>
<li> so buyers know this is a rip-off for the price.  </li>
<li> but I need it now unfortunately.</li>
<li> I did read some review that it smelled weird</li>
<li> So, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of the BM product line, and have yet to be disappointed by any product.  </li>
<li> am very unhappy.  </li>
<li> BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED..</li>

    <li> I love love this product, but was over priced for what I received! I was under the impression that it would be regular size. I could have drove to the store a basically have bought the regular size for the samre money. So I do feel a bit ripped off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stay at home mother of infant and made this purchase in a hurry not realizing that this is pretty much a sample size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase from this seller again!!!!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of the BM product line, and have yet to be disappointed by any product.  A friend of mine told me about the &amp;#34;Ready&amp;#34; line of products, and I was eager to try.  First I ordered the foundation, and then I ordered this.  Both products were great, but this one is extra handy.  The compact it comes in is small, and the small pad applicator that comes with it is great. It has a mirror just big enough for a touch-up, and the portability of it is great.  I still use the loose powder in the morning, but keep this handy throughout the day.  When I get a little shiny and want to touch-up, it&#x27;s effortless.  It provides that same flawless finish that the BM mineral veil is known for.  And the best part is that it&#x27;s translucent, so color/shade is irrelevant.  Flattering on everyone.  Should be a staple for any BM user.</li>
    <li> The description of this product does not indicate it&#x27;s a travel/sample size of BM.  Based on the price, I thought it was the full size.  If you scroll down, it will eventually say travel size, but I missed it unfortunately.  Charging $17.99 for a tiny compact is ridiculous, and this seller should list this, in the title, as a travel size.  Intentionally misleading. BOOOO!</li>
    <li> This is just a sample size.  Don&#x27;t buy this!&lt;br /&gt;This is only good if you want a purse size compact, not worth $17.99.</li>
    <li> This was a little smaller than I expected (I thought it was full sized), but actually I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s smaller. Great for purse, pocket, or travel. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have the full size at home and bought this to carry in my little pouch, it&#x27;s a great small travel size product to use during the day as touch up.</li>
    <li> I little smaller size than expected.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized this was travel size - you can buy the full size for the same price elsewhere on amazon or this half-size for $10.95 and save yourself a couple bucks!  Seller really should put the size in the title so buyers know this is a rip-off for the price.  Wish I had enough time to return it and spend my money elsewhere but I need it now unfortunately.</li>
    <li> As expected, great Bare Minerals product at a great price!</li>
    <li> So pissed that I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a tiny compact size! That&#x27;s what I get for being in a hurry and not reading reviews!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy this here online but it was at Ulta for only 12$ I do love it, it give great coverage.. is pretty small but fits great in my purse. I did read some review that it smelled weird, I don&#x27;t blame the seller for that, mine smells a little strange too and I got it from Ulta. Not sure what that&#x27;s about but there it is.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.. I EXPECTED THE FULL SIZE POWDER &amp; IT WAS THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE.</li>
    <li> Small compact and I love it. I keep it in my pocket at work. It&#x27;s a little light though. Guess I should&#x27;ve ordered a tented powder. Still like it though.</li>
    <li> Smaller compact than I expected. I could have overlooked the size content</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so I avoid  heavy makeup. Bare minerals Touch Up Veil feels so comfortable and looks so natural it has become the only makeup I use. My skin says thank you for giving it a way to look its best.</li>
    <li> I love using this mineral veil touch up after applying bare minerals powder foundation. It&#x27;s the best finishing touch and feels like silk!</li>
    <li> I picked this up for touch ups after the gym. My foundation is there, just a little splotchy from the sweat, so this compact does the trick. It&#x27;s a very small compact, like a trial size, but for the price, it&#x27;s perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, translucent mineral veil to help you look flawless for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!  This is sooooo small.&lt;br /&gt;I looked back on the description and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that said this is &#x27;travel size&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy.  I&#x27;ll NEVER buy from this seller again.</li>
