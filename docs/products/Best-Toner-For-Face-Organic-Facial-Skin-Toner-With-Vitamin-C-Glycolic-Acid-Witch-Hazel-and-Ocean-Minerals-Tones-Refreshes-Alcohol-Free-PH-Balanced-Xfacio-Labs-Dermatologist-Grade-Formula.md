      <li>Moisturizing and easy to use!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful ,amazing facial skin toner .</li>

      <li>If you research what your skin needs to appear youthful and supple, Xfacio put that into this magical toner.</li>
      <li>I am so glad that I got it.</li>
      <li>received this bottle and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, so I decided to give it a try for a week</li>
      <li>I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  </li>

      <li>great products and thanks</li>
      <li>I do notice a lovely change to my complexion.</li>
      <li>Love the tightness it gives I skin and can be used over makup to moisten your face.</li>
      <li>face has a more tone look also</li>
      <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s significant and I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I spray this toner on my face AFTER I have  applied other XFacio products and it is AWESOME!  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and the company is very responsive and professional.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply with the spray.</li>
      <li>It dissipates very quickly</li>
      <li>It does not dry sticky, and is a wonderful first step.  </li>
      <li>I liked this product the first time I bought it</li>
      <li>It kind of smells like a sunless tanner at first, but it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>It smells kind of funny, but that smell goes away after it&#x27;s on your face.  </li>
      <li>Fine lines are even finer</li>
      <li>Over time, it reduces the appearance of fine wrinkles and some of the ingredients may even help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>fine mist feels wonderful and helps eliminate wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
      <li>The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
      <li>Soothing Witch Hazel and organic Aloe calm your skin, and it also has one of my favorite inflammation fighters, MSM.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>Great communication, very solid products!!</li>
      <li>But thank you for the free toner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
      <li>My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together.</li>
      <li>It comes in a cool spray bottle which fits in my bag which makes it easy to take to the office with me.</li>
      <li>It is a very refreshing toner , it feels wonderful when it is sprayed , your skin feels as if it is renewed on the spot, it does not dry your skin like some other tners.</li>
      <li>This is a fun toner!</li>
      <li>though they have the best customer service, however, after tried all the products, I&#x27;m not sure I will buy anything twice now.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Good product, tightens and has a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>after I clean my face</li>
      <li>It smells pretty strongly of witch hazel</li>
      <li>but I have been so happy with Xfacio&#x27;s other products that I had to give it a try.</li>
      <li>When it comes to toners, most have a squeeze top or even just a regular cap.</li>
      <li>It plumps up your skin and gives it a great surface for other products to be readily absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>First of all...great customer service!</li>
      <li>, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  </li>
      <li>I tried one of their products which didn&#x27;t do much but was sent this product free of charge.</li>
      <li>Once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin, the smell disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>In addition my skin feels so much better and actually feels smooth.</li>
      <li>This toner from Exfacio Labs contains an impressive blend of almost two dozen botanicals plus several other ingredients formulated to improve the look and feel of skin.  </li>
      <li>Just because it works, brings the right amount to the part of the face you are applying.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this Toner for quick and positive results!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this company&#x27;s products because of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me but this one did.  I truly believe what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this company&#x27;s products, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  I&#x27;m fast approaching 50 so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the hydraulic acid and moistuizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C and I have still seen results. However, keep reading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products worked so well on my face, that last night I tried them on my forearms.  On one arm I put just the hydraulic acid and moisturizer.  The other arm I used the Vit C serum, hydraulic acid and moisturizer.  Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, hydraulic acid, and moistuizer.  After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  I am going to do a personal comparison test on the spray toner tonight and will update my post tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  With that, keep this in mind....why would I want another bottlle of something in my cabinet thatdoesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of products I&#x27;ve purchased and thrown away because the products didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one too so that I do not catch myself without.  As a business woman, kudos to this company for a marketing plan that not only benefits them but truly benefits the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to see this similar but basically same post from me on the vitamin C serum and moisturizer cream.  I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  No need to recreate the wheel each time!</li>
    <li> I have being using the xfacio products for almost an year now.excellent anti aging serum.&lt;br /&gt;My face has a more tone look also my eyes had bags all my life. Since I have being xfacio under my eyes after two week the bags has disappeared. I love this product can&#x27;t go a day without xfacio.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;m definitely a fan after a couple of weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my skin feel amazing!!! I am extremely acne prone and this stuff does wonders! ive been using the toner and the facial cream now i want it all! I&#x27;m so in love this this product line!!! So thank you to those busting butt getting us our stuff!! SUPPER HAPPY customer!</li>
    <li> I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face. People are asking me what are you doing you look wonderful !! It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent. My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together. I use once in the morning before my makeup and than again as my nightly routine.  I have been only using for 2 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use. The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise. I will be buying again. Love It !!</li>
    <li> This is not just an amazing product, but the seller&#x27;s care and support is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Toner for quick and positive results!!</li>
    <li> If you research what your skin needs to appear youthful and supple, Xfacio put that into this magical toner. I am excited by the change I have seen in the last week. I am 31 years old and have dark circles and large pores. In only a week of use I am noticing radical results. My dark circles have almost gone away. It&#x27;s significant and I am pleased. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just ordered my 2nd round of this product. I have been getting compliments that I look younger than my age and can safely say its due to this product. 31 years old and being told I look 22-23. In addition my skin feels so much better and actually feels smooth. I have been though horrific places in my day and my skin took a beating (military service). This product rejuvenated my skin and I am now trying their other products. Thanks Xfacio!</li>
    <li> Just because it works, brings the right amount to the part of the face you are applying. And it absorbs immediately</li>
    <li> I really like this new toner. I can immediately feel the tightening, firming effect. It gives my skin a nice glow. I  also use it later in the day as a refreshing mist. It comes in a cool spray bottle which fits in my bag which makes it easy to take to the office with me. Love it!</li>
    <li> When it comes to toners, most have a squeeze top or even just a regular cap. I&#x27;ve always preferred the sprays, and this not only has an excellent delivery system, it is filled with good things for your skin. Soothing Witch Hazel and organic Aloe calm your skin, and it also has one of my favorite inflammation fighters, MSM. Great for morning puffiness. The black glass bottle protects the solution from damaging sunlight that can break down some of the ingredients, making them less effective.&lt;br /&gt;The fine mist feels wonderful and helps eliminate wasted product.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep it in the fridge for an extra refreshing spritz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to test and review.</li>
    <li> First of all...great customer service! Thank you, Mia!&lt;br /&gt;I received this bottle and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, so I decided to give it a try for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars, is because of the smell. It kind of smells like a sunless tanner at first, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin, the smell disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good points: it is very refreshing and absorbs quickly into your skin. It plumps up your skin and gives it a great surface for other products to be readily absorbed into your skin. I let it dry and then add my other Xfacio products on top.&lt;br /&gt;Great new product to add to my arsenal of age fighters! It&#x27;s a keeper, for me!</li>
    <li> This toner is certainly very refreshing. Its hard to explain but when you put it on, it makes your skin feel rejuvenated and nice.  They sell this as a base coat for the vitamin c serum and I have used both on top of each other.  I&#x27;m not sure that this makes the vitamin c serum work any better or not (its so hard to tell these things). But it does make your skin feel nice and refreshed even if you chose not to put anything else on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this product is that when you first spray it on, there is a slightly metallic smell that I don&#x27;t love.  It dissipates very quickly but it&#x27;s certainly there and I can feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice product and a great way to freshen up your skin.  Spray on a little bit and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> This toner from Exfacio Labs contains an impressive blend of almost two dozen botanicals plus several other ingredients formulated to improve the look and feel of skin.  It has a sharp vegetal scent dominated by witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner should be applied after bathing or washing the face.  When misted onto the face with the eyes closed and then massaged into the skin, it has an immediate cooling and tightening effect.  It does not strip or dry the skin, but moistens and protects it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well with other moisturizers such as jojoba or argan oil or cosmetic serums.  Over time, it reduces the appearance of fine wrinkles and some of the ingredients may even help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner is packaged in what appears to be a black bottle with a safety-sealed black cap and a black label.  The thick glass is actually a deep blue or violet color and protects the contents from the harmful effects of light. Store the bottle in the refrigerator to further protect the contents and increase the refreshing effect when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is presented in a flocked drawstring pouch and a misting pump with a cap is included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by Exfacio Labs for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I just started using it and already like how it makes my skin feel.  It comes in a wonderful glass bottle and the sprayer works great, very refreshing and I can use it throughout the day which is nice, and can carry it in my purse for convenience.</li>
    <li> This mist contains great ingredients and is good for my skin.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had with this is the smell, but i have a sensitive nose, and I&#x27;m trying to use the product anyway.  I normally use this as a liquid hydrator, prior to putting on other skin care such as serum, moisturizer, and SPF in the a.m. and have not been disappointed with the results!  Xfacio also offers a serum which I will try once I&#x27;ve used all of my Lancome Visionnaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side-note, I can say that the Xfacio Labs customer service is 2nd to none.  Great communication, very solid products!!</li>
    <li> The ingredients are all great nutrients for my skin. Easy to apply with the spray. And I love that slight tightening feeling after I&#x27;ve misted my face. Whether or not I choose to wear makeup that day, the toner makes me feel ready to face the day.  :)</li>
    <li> Very light and refreshing toner!</li>
    <li> I liked this product the first time I bought it but when I had run out I REALLY missed my morning spritz! I reordered and just love my post shower blast.  I follow with other Xfacio products and definitely see a difference.  My skin is firmer, smoother and younger looking.  My go to products for sure.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this XT Toner but I have been so happy with Xfacio&#x27;s other products that I had to give it a try. It is really something. I can immediately feel the flash firming effects and I do believe that it helps my other products to work better just as they said it would. I have also tried spritzing this on late in the day for a refresher and it feels like a wake up call to your skin that is really invigorating. From someone who hasn&#x27;t used a toner in years, I&#x27;m sold on this stuff. You have to try it to see what I mean. BTW, great customer service as well.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I tried one of their products which didn&#x27;t do much but was sent this product free of charge. It does helps some to minimize lines but if you are looking to uplift your skin, keep looking. But thank you for the free toner. Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> It is a very refreshing toner , it feels wonderful when it is sprayed , your skin feels as if it is renewed on the spot, it does not dry your skin like some other tners. I gave it 4 stars just because I did not care for its smell.</li>
    <li> I apply this toner every time I wash my face and wait few minutes before I apply other Xfacio products. It make your skin so ready to absorb other products better.  In fact I have started carrying it in my purse.  It is so refreshing for all day use when your skin gets tired and dry from drying heating systems or weather.  - Mojan</li>
    <li> I spray this toner on my face AFTER I have  applied other XFacio products and it is AWESOME!  It smells kind of funny, but that smell goes away after it&#x27;s on your face.  Great stuff...great products and thanks so much for the great customer service and the great products!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and the company is very responsive and professional.  I recommend them. Martin</li>
    <li> It feels like water, sucks right into the skin. Didn&#x27;t feel tight as it said, other than just like water. though they have the best customer service, however, after tried all the products, I&#x27;m not sure I will buy anything twice now. they are not bad products, they just didn&#x27;t have dramatic effect as stated in the product listing.</li>
    <li> Very good product. It leaves your skin feeling soft, and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is a fun toner! It feels great!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent would have gave it a 5 star but the bottle was leaking</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and I can say that it is just like a facelift from a bottle. You do not need to use very much - after I clean my face I just spray it on and let the toner dry. I put it on under my face cream in the morning and at night. OMG it is wonderful. I am so glad that I got it.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and every evening.  It appears to be making a bit of a difference.  It is light and refreshing!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I pair it with the XFACIO Vitamin C serum and together they make my face feel so refreshed.  Fine lines are even finer and I love the way it makes my face feel.  I put it on under my normal moisturizer.  After bragging on it...now my mom has ordered her some!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product</li>
    <li> This is a A++++ toner that I&#x27;m reviewing. The best part is that its organic and does smell great. Most toners that I buy make you use some kind of cotton applicator to use to put them on. This one you can just spray!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful ,amazing facial skin toner . It also works along with Anti Aging serum -Organic- Natural- Anti Wrinkle Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you for a great customer service, Lovely people.</li>
    <li> I am conflicted about this toner.  Not sure if I like it, but will keep trying.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I ordered the xt toner and vit c serum and two other products for my wife. Two containers had a leak from not being tightened properly. The company immediately sent replacements at no cost to us . My wife says that the products are as good, if not better, than namebrand higher priced products. Best of all, it is made in the USA. GREAT SERVICE + GREAT PRODUCT + MADE IN THE USA &#x3D; #1 Winner for us&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love the tightness it gives I skin and can be used over makup to moisten your face.</li>
    <li> I love the products from XFacio! They are helping me look younger!</li>
    <li> Best experiencia Ever.</li>
    <li> think basically this is witch hazel with something sticky mixed in. did not work for me</li>
    <li> This toner has an interesting blend of minerals, vitamins, amino acids, amino peptides and botanicals in a base of witch hazel, water and Aloe Vera. The directions for use are simple and clear. Shake and spray on face and neck after cleansing and before putting anything else on. It smells pretty strongly of witch hazel but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much because the smell dissipates fairly quickly.  I have been using this product for about month now. I am in my forties with combination (dry to oily) skin prone to occasional breakouts. The skin around my eyes is thin and prone to dryness. Since I&#x27;ve started using this toner the moisture level in my skin has evened out and I would now classify my skin as normal to oily and not dry anymore. This toner is gentle around my eyes and mouth and it hasn&#x27;t made any breakouts worse. In fact it seems that the acne is healing a bit quicker than usual and I have less residual redness. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles on my face so I don&#x27;t know if it would be of any benefit there.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many toners that really did nothing at all, but this product is different.  It contains so many anti-aging ingredients it is incredible.  It does not dry sticky, and is a wonderful first step.  I will never use anything except XFACIO products.. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Good product, tightens and has a clean feeling. Seller is very involved in being sure that the customer is happy with products&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using the Xfacio toner, C serum, Acid serum and the anti aging serum for about 3 months now. I do notice a lovely change to my complexion. I would highly recommend this product line, and the customer service folks are very professional and knowledgeable.</li>
