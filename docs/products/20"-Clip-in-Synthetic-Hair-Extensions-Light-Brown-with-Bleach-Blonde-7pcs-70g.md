<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love them  was easy to use an great  price</li>
    <li> The color was perfect…but i don&#x27;t recommend 20&amp;#34; 70g unless you have really long hair already.  They got so thin at the ends and it looked really awkward with my shoulder length hair even though my hair is thin.  Got here very quickly and you cant beat the price…if you need</li>
    <li> Clip fell off first time used and the hair was very thin. The hair was a good match. Not a good long lasting hair extension though.</li>
    <li> I love the hair extensions so much they feel awesome!  Going to buy more I am going to tell everone about these!</li>
    <li> The colour was exactly as shown, matches my hair colour perfectly, however they are super thin, I did buy 2 sets however so I can sew them together. My husband thought they looked natural and really pretty :)</li>
    <li> I was disheartened after I ordered these extensions and it told me they would take weeks, almost a month to get here.. lol  But, I got them in about a week, so that was a nice surprise, and I love them!!!  The colors are beautiful and natural, and the clips blend perfectly.  Wonderful quality product!!  :)</li>
    <li> The pieces were a little thinner than I expected. However, sewed them together to create a thicker piece.  Overall, better suited for a person with longer thinner hair.</li>
    <li> I have not got these and my hair is pretty normal thickness but how many packs would I need??? Please respond ASAP!!!!</li>
    <li> good but needs more extensions</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great quality!</li>
    <li> The extensions are very sparse, so you need 2 of this, and the long is not good because ends of hair are very thin</li>
    <li> Love these! I have bought $120 extensions from Sally&#x27;s and even though these are a bit thinner you could buy 4 packs and it would still be cheaper than Sally&#x27;s and you would have more extensions.  I have not curled or straightened them yet, but they are soft and the perfect length.  I don&#x27;t think they are overly thin or wispy.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I had heard very good things from a friend of mine and did not think I would receive what I did. It was probably just a random screw up and more than likely does not happen a lot, but I will say I am dissatisfied. Once I viewed my extensions there was barely any hair on the tracks and it was already falling out..</li>
    <li> Bought for my wedding highly recommend</li>
    <li> The color and texture were okay, though the extensions were too thin so i had to saw them together so the looked thicker.</li>
    <li> these extensions came into the mail within a week, and i am very pleased. they are soft and true to color. blend into my hair well</li>
    <li> Hair is extremely thin. Doesn&#x27;t work well at all with thick hair.</li>
    <li> I love these. I feel as though I have thicker hair. They blend in great with my real hair. I got a lot of compliments. My boyfriend sister even made the comment that my hair has gotten really long. I didn&#x27;t tell her why. lol.</li>
    <li> I loved these the only thing I disliked was when I died them not all the blonde died out. But the curl and straighten great.</li>
    <li> Not 100% human hair!!!! It didn&#x27;t dye or take color ?! It all fell apart when dyed! I don&#x27;t recommend! No fo</li>
    <li> THESE ARE AMAZING! I love my hair extensions, I never take them out! I recommend getting two sets though it&#x27;ll look more natural. I got the mixed blonde color and they match PERFECTLY I didn&#x27;t have to redye my hair or my extensions. I have worn mine like I said almost everyday since Christmas and they are still solid and are holding really well.</li>
    <li> Nice, but think, it shreds a lot of hair. For the price, it is good!</li>
    <li> Love my hair! Came as expected and just as it said it would. Looked just as they pictured it! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Way too thin. Like 50% thinner than Sally&#x27;s . Unless you have 20 inch hair, you&#x27;re going to look really strange.</li>
    <li> should advertise that the extensions are THIN. Not sure the hair is REAL. Thumbs down!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;In laymans terms they SUCK!!!</li>
    <li> They are super thin and they melt when I straighten them. I&#x27;m really disappointed with these extensions and I won&#x27;t bye the again.</li>
    <li> Because the color matches great and cURLs like I want and I can use it for both of my girls.</li>
    <li> This in nice color and well blended how ever very thin. Thought it would be thicker to cover up some empty spots on my hair, going thru chemo for third time and haven&#x27;t lost hair just got very thin was hoping to cover better.</li>
    <li> Is nothing like The picture took 2 months to recive the item and is other color , try to dye it and don&#x27;t even work not even real hair</li>
    <li> I love the color! The extensions are a bit thin. I bought two packs to add thickness. They do not curl too well. Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> These extensions are real hair. The problem is that they are very thin an wispy. I had to cut off several inches just so hey wouldn&#x27;t look bad. It is good i you are looking to just thicken up your hair some but not f you want to add to your length</li>
    <li> Very complicated to put in hair. As a matter of fact, I gave up. I was losing more hair by putting these in then I was losing without them.</li>
    <li> shipping prompt.  as described.  thank you.  not sure yet how it wears/washes.  to be continued....</li>
    <li> i see the other reviews are some good and bad reviews it takes a long time to come i still dont  have it but sometimes it is bad on people because they did something wrong</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Doesn&#x27;t feel natural but looks very good. Actually says synthetic hair! Most people think it&#x27;s real. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews after I had ordered this product. It came in exactly a week, which i was happy about. But after a few times of straightening and curling them they became damaged and frizzy. Also, two of the clips fell off not long after they arived. I did expect not very good quality for the price. And they are very thin. Keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This was purchased by my teenage daughter and she loved them. The color was almost a perfect match and  after she did a slight trim, you could not tell the extensions from her natural hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use while trying on wedding dresses (as I hope my hair will be long for my wedding but since I need to buy a dress ahead of time, the extensions would help just in styling). However, I put them in (I found a great how to video on YouTube) and unfortunately, my hair being SUPER thick and these extensions being not so much, they just don&#x27;t look good at all. I tried straightening my hair before putting in the extensions as directed, but I think because my hair is just SO thick (I mean my pony tail is a solid quarter width in diameter), its just super obvious it isn&#x27;t real. I&#x27;ve considered getting a second set and putting them in all at once, which I might still do, but just one set isn&#x27;t enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO if you have super thick hair, I&#x27;d think twice. It was nice to see what my face looks like with long hair again, but to wear them out partying or something? Not for me.  Will have to buy a cheap wig lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS It only took about a week or week and a half for them to come :)</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter for Xmas. She has thick hair these look great. Thick enough and perfect color match</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get these it&#x27;s not worth it, they were so,thin and the clips are too big and don&#x27;t hold in your hair. Spend your money on better extensions</li>
    <li> The hair extentions were fine they were just much thinner than i was expecting. I would have to buy atleast one maybe two more sets for it to not be crazy obvious that i had extentions in</li>
    <li> when i order i was unsure but now that i got them LOVE THEM .....i would order again an tell others</li>
    <li> it is good hair, but you don&#x27;t get a very a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Worst extensions I have EVER owned. I have been a hair extension freak for years and these have been the WORST! The hair does not curl, it&#x27;s shinny like Barbie hair. You can&#x27;t run your fingers thru it. Completely horrible. So upset..</li>
    <li> I do not like them. Ends were stingy, and the hair isn&#x27;t real. did not curl. and takes shape easy. Best to wear with natuaral hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered these extention about two months ago. It took almost a Month and a half to get. Them I waited for about a week to wear them. When I went to curl them as the advertisement said I could do because they were suppose to be 100% Remy real human hair, they would not style. They are completely fake hair. They are now fried and kinky because of the heat of my wand. You should be ashamed lying to people. I know they are not that expensive but that not the point</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair extensions brown with blonde highlights and I was sent a deep red wig with two clip ins for updos. My question is how do you mess up that bad? I&#x27;m currently waiting for a response about a return.</li>
    <li> this company is a scam. do not order from them save your money. i orderered five sets of these extentions and only recieved one set . however when i checked my accnt it stated the other sets were delivered. im very disappointed</li>
    <li> The blonde seems sorta grey-ish &amp; the clips are very very stiff. Hopefully they loosen over time but I use extensions almost daily and these tend to clump up more often than my first set. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or if it&#x27;s the product.</li>
    <li> These where really thin. I didn&#x27;t think my hair was that think but when I put these in they didn&#x27;t blend at all. I tried to put them in a ponytail and still too thin. If you get these I would suggest buying 2-3 sets or do what I did and buy a dark colored one piece extensions to match my under layers and then put a few of these on top. If you look for one piece hair extensions on amazon there are SEVERAL ones for like 3-7 dollars. Most all are synthetic but they are heat safe on a low setting. Hope I helped!</li>
    <li> Big bummer for me. I finally received the hair and it was black not blond so there is not much I can do with it!</li>
    <li> these are thin!! that is the first thing i want to say. i wasn&#x27;t privy to the whole weight of hair extensions so when i pulled these out of the bag i was a little disappointed that they were so thin when the look i wanted was length AND volume. That was my fault though, so just understand if your thinking about buying these, they are thin maybe purchase two sets of these and mix the two to get a thicker look.&lt;br /&gt;I will say! they are very good when styling and dying. I dyed these multiple times and they always styled very nicely along with my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these if your looking for maybe a little length and your not worried about thickness.</li>
    <li> I did not like them at all it so was not worth the money wish I could have got my money back</li>
    <li> Not too pleased! This isn&#x27;t human hair by any means like they said as I&#x27;ve had two other sets of human hair extensions I can tell you these are not real! And if you have any plans of dying them because they do NOT come in the color as shown above they will not dye! You get what you pay for... FAKE HAIR!</li>
    <li> Great item.good shipping</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was better than I ever expected. My granddaughter wears it every day and it looks like her hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered many sets of hair extensions and this one was not even close to the color showed on the picture ! it was much darker, black  and bleach blonde . It look like a skunk color !  The extensions were so thin .... and the package came without any label so I even wonder if they were real human hair which is necessary for me to  dye them and get my natural hair color to match . I returned it  the same day .</li>
    <li> They were gorgeous when I first got them. It says you can curl &amp; dye them but you can&#x27;t. They go to crap about 2 weeks later. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> They melted whenever I straightened them so they obviously weren&#x27;t human hair, they are frizzy and do not look like human hair. Not worth that much money</li>
    <li> Too fake looking.  The clips are bulky and show through my hair. This item wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> As I clicked on my order to make sure I read it right, it said &amp;#34;Remy Human Hair&amp;#34; and then the page reloaded and said &amp;#34;synthetic clip in hair extensions.&amp;#34;  I waiting a loooooooong time for these to come from China, only to find out they are NOT was I was looking for.  Last time I ordered from this company, the extensions were real and they were great.  I wore them for many months and they did everything real hair does, because they were real.  I paid the same price.  I have to say, I&#x27;m very disappointed and feel misled.  They&#x27;re worth $20 bucks as far as fake extensions go, but for the bait and switch tactic of the company, I&#x27;d give no stars at all, but they&#x27;re making me give a star to finish my comment.</li>
    <li> These extensions hold curl well and no one even knew I had them in for my wedding.  They look like natural hair.  If you are looking for lots of volume you may need to order 2 sets, but my stylist was very happy with these and added just the right amount for me!</li>
    <li> Its very thin. And breaks very easily. It is not what I was expecting at all but for 20.00 I should have. :(</li>
    <li> The color of these extensions were perfect for my hair. I should&#x27;ve paid attention to some of the other reviews. They are not that thick and I have to trim mine so they didn&#x27;t look so stringy. For the price though it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect coloring and what I wanted just a little thin but they make my hair look much fuller would recommend for occasional use.</li>
    <li> i really liked this extension, its long, soft, and a good price. it looks better when i add other extension in with it but thats not a problem for me....but i honestly dnt know that id buy it agin :/ shipping took forever</li>
    <li> These extensions were okay, they&#x27;re not the best. You cannot curl them like ot claims you can. Overall I give them  1star</li>
    <li> Lindo cabelo. Entrega econômica . Vendedor atencioso.&lt;br /&gt;Entrega realmente no prazo.&lt;br /&gt;Recomendo a todos que desejam aumentar o volume do cabelo</li>
    <li> I love to shop online but when it comes to extensions I like to look and feel them in person. Well, I finally made the move and ordered them online. Took about a week to get them, when I opened the package and pulled the hair extensions from the plastic cover, the hair fell into my hand so silky! The hair is so soft it honestly feels better than my own hair. I will definitely buy more from them and even different colors. The light brown in this package was more like medium brown, not light brown. Still love it. oh yeah I also curled them with my flat iron and they look great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve a star.  They are not real human hair it was nylon. Would not ever buy from them again. Gooaction deserves nothing.</li>
    <li> These extensions are really nice, true to color and silky smooth. They are only 70 grams so of course they&#x27;re gonna be thin. I ordered 4 sets &amp; plan to sew the wefts together to make the hair thicker. I&#x27;ve done that in a similar situation, problem solved! Still cheaper than the $200 I spent on Foxy Locks!</li>
    <li> I got these to add into my Captain Jack Sparrow human hair wig and they were perfect! Thanks for a great product. I bought two packets.</li>
    <li> Totally worth it. The quality is great, and they got here in two weeks. The clips are nice and strong, and the hair is still super soft after being washed and straightened.</li>
    <li> easy to put in and love it. the length is great and the color is great. love them a lot. yay</li>
    <li> When I had bought the extensions, they were very nice and beautiful until I went to straighten them. After I did that they basically melted and now are frizzy. Clearly not 100% real human hair. I do not recommend these extensions.</li>
    <li> kinda thin, but overall good product. took a while to get here, but worth the wait. i love them.&lt;br /&gt;deff worth the price though, id rather have these than the 200$ real hair.</li>
    <li> I did not like them. The strands were way too thin and the clips were pretty flimsy.  They just look cheap.</li>
    <li> very cheap and ratty. had to buy new ones very quickly</li>
    <li> the pieces are perfect!! the color is nice. and it&#x27;s really soft! I flat iron it and girl it with my hair and it blends in well!</li>
    <li> Extensions are nice but I was looking for thickness and they are very thin. Also more wire like than real.</li>
    <li> So thin you can read thru them. Sparse, scraggly amount of hair. Listen to the other reviewers who say buy the ones from Sally&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these :(</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter and they macth her hair perfect . she loves them they look real and feel real .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t enjoy the big clips. Hair is good quality kind of thin so purchase more than one set.  The clips are not high quality but fr the price great deal.</li>
    <li> not all like description not even usable you get what you pay for very thin doesnt feel like real hair would not recommend</li>
    <li> hair too thin clips don&#x27;t stay on and the hair is damage. VERY DISPLEASED WITH THE HAIR WOULD LIKE A REFUND ?</li>
    <li> It is not human hair. I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; know the difference between synthetic &amp; human hair. DO NOT PUT HEAT ON THESE. I put a low heat setting just to straighten out the kinks from the packaging &amp; some of the hair singed up, meaning it&#x27;s synthetic. But you pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> The product took over a month to get here.&lt;br /&gt;Right away I could tell that it didn&#x27;t match the picture at all..&lt;br /&gt;It is a lot lighter, therefore doesn&#x27;t match my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took them out of the package, I realized that they are&lt;br /&gt;CLEARLY NOT 100% HUMAN HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re synthetic..&lt;br /&gt;Which means you can&#x27;t wash them, or curl them.&lt;br /&gt;BIG DISAPOINTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I compared them to my 18&amp;#34; extensions, and they&#x27;re shorter..&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re supposed to be 20&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product if you&#x27;re expecting them to be what the description says...</li>
    <li> i dont have complains in so exited!!! it is human hair and they fit great!! so thanks a lot i will buy another!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love love love these extensions! They wouldn&#x27;t be good for Some with super thick hair but thin to med they will look perfect. The color was perfect the length is perfect I hate taking them out because I love the way they look!</li>
    <li> Not bad but not the best. Very good for the price. I would buy them again if I ever needed them</li>
    <li> Matches my hair perfect! I love them! I just ordered more, they are very thin though. So if you want a thicker look, you need more then you will need more</li>
    <li> I had bought these extensions for temporary use while I waited on a shipment of microloops from overseas. They felt wonderful when I took them out of the package, but when I went to style them, I discovered that they are CLEARLY NOT 100% human hair as they claim. The first few times I wore them, I received a lot of compliments on them. However, they did not hold a curl and were completely useless after a few wears. I was not very disappointed because I had only intended to use them for about a week. But do NOT purchase these extensions if you are expecting them to endure long-time use.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Great price. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waste ur time I ordered these n they look so horrible there so thin n feel so fake big rip off</li>
    <li> Not as much hair as I would have liked for a full set.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them! They are a perfect color match for my hair, and the fact that the hair is fine and not too coarse or full is perfect for me, because I have super fine hair. They also take to dyeing really well. I will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because these were exactly what I wanted. The color was great and they look just like the picture. I straighten them and curl them just the same as I would do to my hair. I did need to trim the bottoms a little but that was expected. Also a great price for Remy extensions.</li>
    <li> I actually have pretty short hair and with 2 packages I have a beautiful full head of silky soft hair. I love it!!! Shipping and delivery was within the week. Not only will I absolutely continue buying these for myself but I also use them on my clients. Love, love, love!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for! So soft and the clips r so easy to use and comfortable! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
