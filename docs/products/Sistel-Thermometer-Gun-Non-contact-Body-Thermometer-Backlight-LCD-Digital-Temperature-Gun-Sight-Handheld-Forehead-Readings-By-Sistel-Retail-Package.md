    <li> I loved this at first.  Great for checking for fever.  I only had it for less than 6 months and it stopped working.  I only really used it maybe 30 times so that is not very use.  So three stars for the fact that it didn&#x27;t last a year.  I would probably try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Thought it was broken, but turns out the battery that came with it was bad.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy way to check a temperature. No hassles and quite accurate.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2. 1 arrived broken</li>
    <li> easy to use.  came calibrated out of the box. this will make taking temps a piece of cake!</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine. Simple and easy to use.</li>
    <li> The instructions are not complete. Still not sure what symbols mean.</li>
    <li> As a nurse I need an accurate temperature. I have used temple types too hard to use, ear temp to me always read low this is a very Accurate temperature will refer to friends.</li>
    <li> Fairly accurate and easy to use and good price point.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of months so we&#x27;ll see how it performs.</li>
    <li> This product is a piece of crap. Bought it for my 16 month old to easily check his temperature since he spits out your traditional &#x27;under-the-tongue&#x27; thermometers. Worked fine the first few times, then we heard a faint and rapid beeping from the unit itself and when we tried to turn it on and scan for a termperature we got a weird &#x27;ERC&#x27; code on the main screen. Tried a couple of brand new 9V batteries and still the same issue. I tried turning the battery around inside the housing, un-pinching some of the wires, and adjusting the mount that attaches the actual battery to the + and - terminals but nothing. The thermometer alternated between not turning on at all (even with a brand new battery inside) to just the screen lighting up but being blank. There is also nothing in the user&#x27;s manual for this &#x27;ERC&#x27; code or any thorough troubleshooting instructions. Maybe I&#x27;m unlucky, but the thermometer I have is garbage.</li>
    <li> Works great and was accurate right out of the box--no adjustment needed.  Great addition to sick room supplies!</li>
    <li> Does not work. I haven&#x27;t found any website for further instructions or contact information. Could Sistel please contact me? :-(</li>
    <li> Does not have an option for the Ambient temperature although it is advertised to have it.</li>
    <li> My wife is a pediatric home health nurse and after a few short days found this invaluable working with kids. I&#x27;m an infection control nurse and more concerned with accuracy than ease of use. I&#x27;ve compared this thermometer with both rectal thermometer ( the gold standard) and a temporal thermometer. I&#x27;ve consistently had 0.1 or less deviation which indicates a very high level of accuracy. It is very easy to use and can be practical in many care settings and at home. My wife believes this is one of the better tools I have bought her to allow her to do get job with the least amount of stress on her patients yet provide a high level of accuracy.</li>
    <li> Cost was within my budget. Product worked great.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not very accurate. I can take someone&#x27;s tempature several times in a row and get a +/-2 degree difference. Would be great if it were reliable.</li>
