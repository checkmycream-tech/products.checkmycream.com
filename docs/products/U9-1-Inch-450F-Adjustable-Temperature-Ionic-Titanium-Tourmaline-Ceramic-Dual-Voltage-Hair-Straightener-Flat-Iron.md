      <li>I was very pleased with this product after reading mixed reviews online.  </li>
      <li>gets very hot, but the auto shut off is the life saver.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this flat iron for a trip to Ireland and it turned out to be the perfect purchase.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, yet just the right size for the job.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find that the flat iron worked and functioned properly upon my arrival to Mumbai on 220 volts.  </li>
      <li>Its&#x27; easy to use, it heats quickly and has a thermostat, shuts off automatically, is smooth and does not catch hair and it stays cool enough on the outside to hold it with my fingertips.  </li>
      <li>Purchased for trip to France (ability to convert to higher voltage).  </li>
      <li>Gets hot and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
      <li>It has never failed me.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as is needed.</li>
      <li>Pro Tourmaline Ceramic Dual Voltage Super Smooth Hair Straightener Flat Iron.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gets really hot, really fast.</li>
      <li>but I certainly don&#x27;t feel the need to get one now.</li>
      <li>Worked better than expected.</li>
      <li>i did not like it as much as my chi at home</li>
      <li>she absolutely loves it</li>
      <li>I had a couple of international business trips this spring and picked this up primarily because of the dual voltage feature; I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>I took it Italy and with the adapter plug I purchased separately, the flat iron heated up quickly and worked very well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>BTW it also works great in the US, but I have another (much more expensive) flat iron for my daily US home needs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my very first flat iron</li>
      <li>It worked fine in other countries, but I don&#x27;t use it in the US when I can use any of my other straighteners because it takes significantly longer to style my hair with this one.</li>
      <li>It was easy to carry in my suitcase and worked like a charm everyday.  </li>
      <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works better than my high dollar flat iron that I got at the salon a few years ago.</li>
      <li>The hotel I stayed at had an outlet to accommodate the standard US 2 prong plug - however I still needed my travel adapter (not voltage converter) to convert the plug since the one prong was too wide fit in the multi-plug outlet.  </li>
      <li>It gets hot, has a long cord, and travels well.  </li>
      <li>Worked as good as my expensive Chi iron at home.  </li>
      <li>It heats quickly, did not blow any fuses or melt down in the 3 weeks we were traveling.</li>
      <li>Purchased this flat iron specifically for my 6 week business trip to India - so I really wanted to find something dual voltage</li>
      <li>Much nicer than the flat iron I have which is now in a drawer.</li>
      <li>Definitely got hot enough to straighten my hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this flat iron for overseas travel.</li>
      <li>no other haircare tools have ever caused this problem.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have especially thick or curly hair, it&#x27;s more wavy and a normal thickness, and I couldn&#x27;t always get my hair totally straight with this thing.</li>
      <li>I chose this product over other dual-voltage flat irons mainly based on low price and number of positive reviews, and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> dual voltage works but the straitening function doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product after reading mixed reviews online.  I took it Italy and with the adapter plug I purchased separately, the flat iron heated up quickly and worked very well.  I have hair that is wavy and easily frizzy and I was very happy I had this iron with me, especially after sightseeing on a few rainy, humid days!  The price for this flat iron was excellent after doing some comparison shopping!</li>
    <li> I have this amazing &amp;#34;U9 Pro Tourmaline Ceramic Dual Voltage Super Smooth Hair Straightener Flat Iron.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair that breaks very easily. This straightener is very smooth and works so well it only takes me 5 mins to straighten. It&#x27;s amazing. I have not had a chi but I certainly don&#x27;t feel the need to get one now. BTW I&#x27;ve had it for a year now without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed reviews attached to this product but they are for other styles of straighteners by the same brand. Too bad cause I&#x27;m sure for this model it would have 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is a frat flat iron. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a trip to Israel.  I agonized for weeks about what to take &amp; read reviews that said to take a converter, not to take a converter, etc.  I was so confused.  Finally bought this one and found out there was NO need for a converter--just an adapter plug.  Worked as good as my expensive Chi iron at home.  So now I can take it anywhere and no worries about needing a converter or whether it will do a good job on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great straitener fast shipping</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this flat iron for a trip to Ireland and it turned out to be the perfect purchase.  It was easy to carry in my suitcase and worked like a charm everyday.  The second temperature setting worked best for me and straightened my hair beautifully.  I highly recommend this flat iron for overseas travel.</li>
    <li> Auto-off feature has saved me numerous times. Gets hot and doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Cover is nice for travel. I have coarse thick hair and this works well for me daily.</li>
    <li> I took it on our trip to Belgium and Portugal and it worked well with an adapter. BTW, they work in US as well.</li>
    <li> Greatest straightener for overseas travel i have ever used. i did not like it as much as my chi at home but it was amazing for the price. no overheating or problems with use of adapter only. I used in UK and Israel. I have very thick hair and it did the trick without being too bulky. I will be keeping this for future travels</li>
    <li> I bought this flattener a couple of months ago so that I can take it to Europe and not fry my Chi, since this is a dual-voltage flattener. I have used it many times and it works great. It is lightweight, yet just the right size for the job. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron about two years ago to take with me on international trips. I haven&#x27;t had any of the horrific experiences that some other reviewers have had, however I didn&#x27;t find this flat iron to be especially great either. It worked fine in other countries, but I don&#x27;t use it in the US when I can use any of my other straighteners because it takes significantly longer to style my hair with this one. I don&#x27;t have especially thick or curly hair, it&#x27;s more wavy and a normal thickness, and I couldn&#x27;t always get my hair totally straight with this thing.</li>
    <li> My daughter used it for her college trip abroad and it proved very handy throughout Europe.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my trip to Prague. It worked great but be sure to buy the outlet converter!  I made the mistake in China of thinking the outlet converter would work for my regular flat iron and I fried my hair and my flat iron. Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Worked great in Europe, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I was impressed such high technique hair tool.</li>
    <li> Worked in Middle East</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron specifically for my 6 week business trip to India - so I really wanted to find something dual voltage so it wasn&#x27;t something I could only use when I&#x27;m overseas. BINGO! I tried it at home in the states prior to leaving and it worked great on 110 volts.  I was happy to find that the flat iron worked and functioned properly upon my arrival to Mumbai on 220 volts.  The hotel I stayed at had an outlet to accommodate the standard US 2 prong plug - however I still needed my travel adapter (not voltage converter) to convert the plug since the one prong was too wide fit in the multi-plug outlet.  This was a very simple fix and not a deal breaker - it fit fine in the US.  It gets hot, has a long cord, and travels well.  This may turn out to be my every day flat iron - not for just when I travel.</li>
    <li> This review is a long time coming.  I ordered this iron last year for my daughter who was about to spend the summer abroad.  It&#x27;s the one I chose specifically for its dual voltage capabilities.  But it never worked.  The display lit up, and it allowed us to set the temperature, but it never even warmed up.  The temperature display rocked back and forth between 77 and 79 degrees, and the plates remained cold.  Completely useless!</li>
    <li> Bought for traveling in UK. Dual voltage works great with a power converter and adaptive plug. Good heat and appears to be well made.</li>
    <li> Everything about this product compares to the brand name that is so popular.  The price is what attracted me to the U9 Pro and I cannot find any reason not to like this flat iron.  Its&#x27; easy to use, it heats quickly and has a thermostat, shuts off automatically, is smooth and does not catch hair and it stays cool enough on the outside to hold it with my fingertips.  The extra feature I like is the cover that closes it for storage!  When or IF this one wears out, I will buy another U9 Pro to replace it.</li>
    <li> I used this when I went on a trip to Paris and Budapest, and it worked great!</li>
    <li> It has all the features recommended by my stylist, for the very best price out there. My daughter took mine so I had to buy two. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have ever used.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great iron but it&#x27;s NOT dual voltage.  There is no setting to choose from 110 or 220 and as a result, if you try to use this abroad (with or wothout an adapter) it will simply short and die as mine did (with the appropriate adapter).</li>
    <li> Granddaughter was very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This one made my hair staticy and stopped working after a few uses. I retuned for a refund.</li>
    <li> After years of frying various flat irons and attempts to use electricity adapters while traveling abroad, I finally decided to invest and buy a flat iron with dual voltage. What a good decision! This iron worked perfectly on my trip to Germany and France, I only had to use an outlet adapter to fit the plug, no power converter. Glides smoothly, heats up in seconds. Still works beautifully after a 3 week trip, I&#x27;ll be using it next summer when traveling abroad again. I chose this product over other dual-voltage flat irons mainly based on low price and number of positive reviews, and I&#x27;d buy it again. BTW it also works great in the US, but I have another (much more expensive) flat iron for my daily US home needs.</li>
    <li> great flat iron.  gets very hot, but the auto shut off is the life saver.</li>
    <li> Well my mom bought one of these last Christmas and it still works. So I went ahead and bought one for myself. That was in August. I went to plug it in today (November) and it is completely dead. Of course it&#x27;s &amp;#34;past the return date&amp;#34; so I am out the money. Don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> best hair iron ever I love it</li>
    <li> Dual voltage - Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi temp - wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cools quickly for packing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly curved edges help not have ends that stick out.</li>
    <li> Works well. Gets really hot, really fast. The protective cover is a plus for traveling, as is the dual voltage. This is now the flat iron I leave in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Still need to try this overseas as that is why I bought it.  Dual voltage.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as is needed.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of international business trips this spring and picked this up primarily because of the dual voltage feature; I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works better than my high dollar flat iron that I got at the salon a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected. Wife loved it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present she has told me more than once it is the best Christmas present I have got her in a long time she absolutely loves it I would recommend this product to anybody who wants to make a very picky woman happy lol</li>
    <li> Purchased for trip to France (ability to convert to higher voltage).  Worked perfectly with adapter I purchased on Amazon.  Definitely got hot enough to straighten my hair.  Usually couldn&#x27;t plug into a bathroom outlet in France so always had to do in the bedroom.  Cord was long enough to make that possible.</li>
    <li> I used this for over a week in Europe.  It worked well with the voltage (don&#x27;t forget an outlet adapter though).  I thought it was plenty hot enough for my hair (wavy, thin strands but a lot of it).  It actually seem to catch and pull hair a bit less than the $125 straightener I bought from a beauty supply house.  It looks sturdy enough to last for awhile especially since I won&#x27;t be using it daily</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron that I could use in Ireland. This was perfect. Dual voltage.. It heats quickly, did not blow any fuses or melt down in the 3 weeks we were traveling. Now back in the USA and have  continued to use this product. Much nicer than the flat iron I have which is now in a drawer.</li>
    <li> caused my lights to flicker. threw item out because i was afraid of fire. i had already discarded all packaging material so i could not return.  no other haircare tools have ever caused this problem.</li>
    <li> I really like it but I&#x27;m still learning to use it..It&#x27;s my very first flat iron</li>
    <li> I travel the world for work and I&#x27;m on my second one.  It has never failed me.</li>
    <li> Was bought for my daughter.. She seems pleased with it</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding and met my every need as I traveled in Europe.</li>
    <li> Yay it worked great in Europe with just an adapter plug!</li>
