<li> Seems like it well last a long time.</li>
<li> I recently made the switch to Wet Shaving with a Double Edge Safety Razor.</li>
<li> sure to cleanse your brush thoroughly and always hang it upside down to dry &amp; your expensive brush will last you a life time.</li>
<li> you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and using soaps, it does take a bit to get the right water soap combo right; don&#x27;t get frustrated!</li>
<li> water quality may affect this soap and give different results.every other day.</li>
<li> Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap has the cleanest looking and cleanest smelling of any shave soap that I melt down in a double broiler in my shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> After Effects: It always leaves my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind and not the least bit dry.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with some of the more expensive creams because they&#x27;re easier to lather with my hard water.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There is one negative to the VDH Glycerin soap, I started using it around early November 2012, by mid-January 2013</li>
<li> It was my entry into the wet shaving world</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied, you&#x27;re only out $2.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other glycerin soaps, but this one does the job.</li>
<li> And I shave about every other day.</li>
<li> I could even skip the post shave lotion that is typically used with a wet shave routine.&lt;br</li>
<li> cons are simply the nature of being a hard soap.</li>
<li> Just make sure you PREFER the glycerin base (that&#x27;s the milder soap you can kinda see through) or else</li>
<li> Even if you live in an area with hard water, and I do, the lather just glides onto your face thick as cream.  </li>
<li> so the lather needs to go longer than just my face; this soap hands down does the job every time.</li>
<li> Cuts are down to a minimum, razor burn is almost non-existent now.</li>
<li> It may take about a month until you master the razor blade, then you&#x27;ll be done shaving in less that 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
<li> Once your brush is loaded, add a few drops of water and whip it around in a bowl for another 30 seconds.  </li>
<li> With hard soaps, water is your enemy.  </li>
<li> Razor literally glides over my thick beard - leaving nick free/smooth shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband loves this soap. His skin is very touchy. He has to shave every day and it works really well for him.</li>
    <li> Husband loved trying this brand, it was just what was expected of it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you.  This soap represents the single best value in wet shaving, if you lather it right.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with some of the more expensive creams because they&#x27;re easier to lather with my hard water.  Creams are good but they leave ugly soap scum all over my nice razor. That was until I decided to clean my brush with dish soap and start using distilled water.  HUGE DIFFERENCE! Now the VDH stuff lathers up nice and thick, and so far, has outperformed Proraso. It has a nice light scent too which is a simplicity I&#x27;ve missed. Oh, yeah, I can also buy it at my local supermarket for $1.67 a puck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are that it is super slick and outperforms soaps and creams costing 10 times as much.  You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere.  Most major supermarkets carry Van Der Hagen soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are simply the nature of being a hard soap. You have to spend more time loading and lathering it versus creams. If you have hard water, you need to clean your brush monthly so it lathers properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to soak your brush, then shake out all the water you can.  Load with a damp brush for 30 seconds.  Once your brush is loaded, add a few drops of water and whip it around in a bowl for another 30 seconds.  You should get a nice dense lather that should be good for 3 passes.  If you still can&#x27;t lather very well, you may want to consider cleaning your brush and/or using distilled water.  With hard soaps, water is your enemy.  Of course, if all else fails, face lathering is pretty much foolproof.</li>
    <li> Whether it&#x27;s our water....probably so, but I cannot get this one to lather up.</li>
    <li> This is some great shaving soap.  Smells good to.  Another great thing is the price.  I bought 5 of them to offset the shipping. But I saved lots of money compared to a store price. If I could fine it.  That for a great product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The old-fashioned way of shaving is still the best!  I highly recommend this product.  You will like it too</li>
    <li> This was my first ever shave soap some several months ago now.

I&#x27;ve tried The Art Of Shaving Products and love them...however, like many have noted, they are quite pricey and can break the wallet real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, I know...\\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; right? Well, let me tell you, this shave soap at $2 a cake is right there with Taylor of Old Street, Art of Shaving, and any soap costing 5 times more than this. I use a homemade pre-shave oil (combo of 3/4 castor, 1/4 Jojoba, &amp; lavender essential oil) and the fragrance with this blends nicely. I&#x27;m a bald man so the lather needs to go longer than just my face; this soap hands down does the job every time. And it lasts, and lasts, and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving and using soaps, it does take a bit to get the right water soap combo right; don&#x27;t get frustrated! Keep at it and it will make your shave routine not only a joy but an event to look forward to. I just can&#x27;t say enough about this soap. I have others, but I reach for this most of the time. At $2 a cake, I went back and bought 3 more which will probably be enough to last well over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and check it out! You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> At first i wasnt that impressed.More water was what made for a better lather.Seems like it well last a long time.</li>
    <li> got this as a gift set for my father and he couldnt be more happier.&lt;br /&gt;he has very sensitive dry skin and this helps with both of that.</li>
    <li> Soft perfect for my sensible skin</li>
    <li> Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap has the cleanest looking and cleanest smelling of any shave soap that I melt down in a double broiler in my shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a double razor with (only &amp;#34;Feather New Hi-Stainless Platinum Coated Blades&amp;#34; from Japan - they give the sharpest and cleanest shave at 25 cents a blade, give or take.) and a 100% Badger Tail brush to lather.&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving this way for 5 years now - I find it the most economical way the shave now with very high priced blades on the market with 3 to 5 blades at about $5.00 per blade.&lt;br /&gt;Invest in the best Badger Tail brush you can get, then buy your razor blades and soap in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong.  It may take about a month until you master the razor blade, then you&#x27;ll be done shaving in less that 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to cleanse your brush thoroughly and always hang it upside down to dry &amp; your expensive brush will last you a life time.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap.  Lather stays moist for entire shave.  Razor literally glides over my thick beard - leaving nick free/smooth shave.  Recommend A+++++</li>
    <li> Good to go, helps with keeping your face smooth and lets the razor guilds  during your shave</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any other glycerin soaps, but this one does the job. Keep in mind I have no point of reference though.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for people with sensitive skin, especially in combination with a little shaving cream/ gel. It smells good, and really helps the razor glide, and cuts back on irritation. I just wish they sold it in local stores. If you decide to purchase this, I recommend Chanda&#x27;s stuff, as it only took 3 days to receive my order.</li>
    <li> Great soap the lather great and long lasting and that a good quality u want in a shaving soap.</li>
    <li> good value and very good shave soap. will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Out of all the shaving soaps and creams I&#x27;ve used throughout the years, I always go back to VDH Glycerin Shave Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price: $2 and this puck will last you months, MONTHS, even with daily usage.  Meanwhile, a can of shave gel/cream goes about $12.  If you can make a can last a month of daily usage, I&#x27;ll be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lather: This soap is the holy grail of lathers.  It whips up real thick real quick.  Even if you live in an area with hard water, and I do, the lather just glides onto your face thick as cream.  The quality is just as good as high end creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The After Effects: It always leaves my face smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind and not the least bit dry.  I could even skip the post shave lotion that is typically used with a wet shave routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Scent:  Here is where I will concede that perhaps to some, it is a fault.  It is mild and clean smelling, nothing offensive.  I appreciate it for this however, because by itself it is very subtle but pleasant.  It also won&#x27;t overpower or have to compete with the scent of an aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  If you&#x27;re already a wet shaver who&#x27;s avoided the VDH brand because of its reputation as a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; brand, or if you&#x27;re new to this, or even if you&#x27;re curious about getting into this kind of shaving routine, you should give this one a chance.  If you&#x27;re not satisfied, you&#x27;re only out $2.</li>
    <li> I recently made the switch to Wet Shaving with a Double Edge Safety Razor. I do not want spend a large amount of money so the \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; shaving products are not for me, I will not spend more than $15 on a shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially invested in a shaving set sold by Van Der Hagen with a Bowl, Boar Hair Brush, and a \\&quot;puck\\&quot; or bar of their \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; Shaving Soap. It seems obvious that the \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; is their basic soap. It was okay at first while I learned the basics, but my skin becomes dry and easily irritated during the Winter months. The \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot; soap did not provide sufficient protection against cuts and irritation(in my opinion). The DE razor and blade did not glide over my skin, therefore leading to red spots and short term razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched razor blades several times and then bought a package of Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shaving Soap. Even with an \\&quot;inferior\\&quot; Boar Brush(Badger Brushes are more popular) I was able to stir up sufficient lather within seconds. At first it is a little watery, but improves in quality over time. I apply it several times during a shaving session, for each pass or touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One benefit of using a brush to apply shaving lather is that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands afterward like I need to when using shaving foam from a can. Each layer of lather is added with precision at the point where I need it, I don&#x27;t feel like I am applying too much or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been un-satisfied with the results(while using this soap). Cuts are down to a minimum, razor burn is almost non-existent now. Even while using cheap Astra blades I end up with smooth skin from the neck to the sideburns. My beard area is now soft to the touch after shaving, which was not always the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one negative to the VDH Glycerin soap, I started using it around early November 2012, by mid-January 2013 the original puck/bar/cake is now almost gone. So this means it lasted me around 2.5 months. And I shave about every other day. I would prefer it to last longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently in the phase of exploring different Shaving Soaps in the $1-15 range, to find the best balance of quality and price. I bought more Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap as a back-up though. I would recommend it to people like me who are trying out DE Razors and Wetshaving. Note: water quality may affect this soap and give different results.every other day.

    <li> This is a great GLYCERIN based shaving soap and a superb value for the price. It foams nicely and has a very mild and tasteful fragrance. Just make sure you PREFER the glycerin base (that&#x27;s the milder soap you can kinda see through) or else get the non glycerin soap (the white-ish creamy soap).</li>
    <li> Unbelievably cheap and it delivers a nice smooth shave on sensitive skin. I wish it was available as a cream. Highly recommended to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
