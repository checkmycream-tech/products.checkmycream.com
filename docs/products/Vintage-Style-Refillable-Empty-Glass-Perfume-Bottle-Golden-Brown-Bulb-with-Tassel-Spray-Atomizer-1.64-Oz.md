      <li>This atomizer worked fine for 6 months, but then all of a sudden it stopped working.</li>
      <li>Overall this bottle works fine, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t spray as &amp;#34;cleanly&amp;#34; as a bottle of perfume from the store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty in a retro way, but didn&#x27;t work for long.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I really like this little bottle and will be buying another one again soon.</li>

    <li> This is another nice bottle in that it is just the right size (petite) in conjunction with any larger perfume bottles you may have.  Also very elegant looking on your vanity tray.  I&#x27;ve ordered three of the same bottle (different colored bulbs) to put in the other bedrooms in my house.</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
    <li> I bought this beautiful perfume atomizer for my niece,s 30th birthday.  It is something that she has always wanted and will enjoy for many years to come.  Thanks for the wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and nicely packaged. The opening was easy to fill,  even without using the funnel. The bulb functions perfectly. I gave it as a gift to a coworker and she loves it.</li>
    <li> works good, pretty, worth the money.  I have had these leak and not pump well but no issues with this one and I have owned it for a while now.</li>
    <li> stopped spraying after about a month but still looks nice on my dresser</li>
    <li> Once I filled this item with my favorite perfume it would not spray out. I do not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Horrible! The liquid did not go through. Please test or check your products before sending them out!!</li>
    <li> Fellas, if you have a wife or girlfriend that is in to perfume, this is a great idea to score some brownie points.</li>
    <li> This worked for a while, maybe a couple of months, then the bulb stopped working enough to get up a puff. It&#x27;s pretty in a retro way, but didn&#x27;t work for long.</li>
    <li> This atomizer worked fine for 6 months, but then all of a sudden it stopped working. I unscrewed the top and screwed it back on, but it still wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I just love it. After hours online searching for the right product for me. I decided on this one. I loved how the gold mixed well with the bottle. It was also on sale. I definitely recommend to buy it. It is the perfect size. It is not too big and it fits nicely in your hand. I also like the weight of it. It is not plastic, or if it is, it sure fooled me, I didn&#x27;t add perfume yet but the product appears to be in working condition, air comes out when I squeeze the pump. I didn&#x27;t expect for it to come so soon. I&#x27;m really impressed I ordered it on the 24th of July and I got it two days later. It came so quick. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that I wish these were glass. But hey, for the price they&#x27;re definitely worth it. They look very nice and add just a tiny touch of glamour to my makeup mirror.</li>
    <li> I get the wrong color!!I order gold...  :(  and I got black, the material is nice But I did not like the color</li>
    <li> Very Pretty and Just what I wanted! It came on time!Will purchase a couple more for holiday gifts in differnt colors!</li>
    <li> Overall this bottle works fine, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t spray as &amp;#34;cleanly&amp;#34; as a bottle of perfume from the store. It has appropriate pressure and sprays a nice amount, but it seems to make a soft hiss when you spray. Otherwise, I really like this little bottle and will be buying another one again soon.</li>
    <li> The bottle and sprayer were fine until after 1 use. I put my favorite perfum in the bottle and after 1 use the bulb and sprayer no longer work. I took the perfume out and rinsed the bottle out with warm water and refilled it with water and it still does not work.Will not buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> The tube was too long and made it hard to close the bottle. This was a gift for a friend and she likes it and it works.</li>
    <li> Nothing comes out when I squeeze the pump. Air seems to be leaking out somewhere, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t have the suction it needs to pull liquid through &amp; out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 &amp; they&#x27;re nice decorations, but I wanted to actually use them.</li>
    <li> Useful for room perfume as well.</li>
    <li> Looks nicer in the picture. Glass is cheap, &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; plastic is cheap...but hey, it has a pump if that is what you&#x27;re into.</li>
