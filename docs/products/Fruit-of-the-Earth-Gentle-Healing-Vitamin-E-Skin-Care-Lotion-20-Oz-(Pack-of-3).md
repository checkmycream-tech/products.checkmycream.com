      <li>lol.</li>

      <li>and it is light and provides great coverage on my hands and body.  </li>
      <li>stuff really is the best!</li>

      <li>Love product, use all time .</li>
      <li>So glad I was able to find through you.</li>
      <li>It is the best skin lotion for hydrating dry skin.  </li>
      <li>All natural, smells great and not oily.</li>
      <li>It seems to penetrate into the skin more than most skin lotions, and contains more natural ingredients like barbadensis leaf juice and sunflower seed oil.  </li>
      <li>I never get acne and very rarely peel.</li>
      <li>So many lotions go on smelling pretty</li>
      <li>I find the others aren&#x27;t absorbed as easily and don&#x27;t provide any additional benefit that I can see or feel.</li>
      <li>Best hand cream that there is out there,  hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Healing Vitamin E Skin Care Lotion for years and love it because it really works</li>
      <li>Not greasy and leaves your skin feeling cool.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is just right</li>
      <li>In the morning &amp; evening, I shower &amp; very gently wash my skin.</li>
      <li>Thank goodness for my skin, that I found this product again-my skin looks better in the short time that I have been using it.</li>
      <li>I skin is soft, smooth and heals the scars.</li>
      <li>Whenever the skin feels dry, add more.</li>
      <li>After FotE offered the others with added ingredients I had a hard time finding the &amp;#34;plain stuff&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available now on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Get some the 3 pak for the whole family.</li>
      <li>Did arrive on time and couldn&#x27;t be happier,  thanks.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t seem fast absorbing</li>
      <li>No longer available locally.</li>
      <li>Simply, my skin absorbs this cream quickly, there&#x27;s almost no greasy residue</li>
      <li>After many months of trying to locate the big bottles of this lotion I finally found it with this seller.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is very reasonably priced on Amazon, much cheaper than in the stores which enables me to stock up for a long time.  </li>
      <li>This is, I believe, the original &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; offering without aloe or other additions.</li>
      <li>but it did leave my skin soft.</li>
      <li>My skin no longer flakes or peels and has even made my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin and usually break out from most skin lotions.  </li>
      <li>So far didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it enough times to form a solid feed back, but it is not as I expected it to be so far.</li>

    <li> Best lotion ever. After you try it you will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Healing Vitamin E Skin Care Lotion for years and love it because it really works</li>
    <li> Been using for years. No longer available locally. Great for use during sex if there are lubricant issues. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand &amp; type of lotion for at least 25 years. It&#x27;s a great full body lotion &amp; spectacular for sunburns. I started using it when I got sunburns in AZ. The trick is to keep applying it every hour or two. Whenever the skin feels dry, add more. In the morning &amp; evening, I shower &amp; very gently wash my skin. This is the only lotion that works for this! I never get acne and very rarely peel. Other brands cause acne when continually reapplied. I try hard to not get sun burns but it happens sometimes. At least with this lotion, I don&#x27;t add zits &amp; peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is the best! It&#x27;s lightweight &amp; not greasy. And at least for me... If I get physical, it doesn&#x27;t make me smell like skunk. lol. So many lotions go on smelling pretty but then I go do yard work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hard to find in stores around here.</li>
    <li> I have been using Fruit of the Earth for many years now and unfortunately, can no longer find it in my area but thankfully, Amazon has it.  It is the best skin lotion for hydrating dry skin.  I have extremely dry skin and usually break out from most skin lotions.  Fruit of the Earth is the only skin lotion I do not break out from.  It seems to penetrate into the skin more than most skin lotions, and contains more natural ingredients like barbadensis leaf juice and sunflower seed oil.  It is very reasonably priced on Amazon, much cheaper than in the stores which enables me to stock up for a long time.  My skin no longer flakes or peels and has even made my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent because it does what its supposed to do.  MADE IN USA is a plus. My whole experience with this order was on point as it arrived way before it was supposed to and in perfect condition. After many months of trying to locate the big bottles of this lotion I finally found it with this seller. I would recommend and did tell my friend where I got it because she cant find it anywhere around here either.</li>
    <li> Cleared up psoriasis that my prescription ointment wouldn&#x27;t. Works on all kinds of dry and irritated skin. Get some the 3 pak for the whole family. My dog likes it TOO! licks it off me if I dont stop him.</li>
    <li> Simply one of the best skin care products on the market.  Not greasy and leaves your skin feeling cool.  Always a great bulk price through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Refuse to use anything else.  I started using this product in the 90&#x27;s.  Love it</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use it daily and it is light and provides great coverage on my hands and body.  It has a very light scent and it great for people who are allergic to scented items.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent.  My skin also had a reaction to it which I found odd.  It didn&#x27;t seem fast absorbing but it did leave my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years all over my body because I have VERY DRY SKIN and it helps keep it moist.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for almost five years and love the results.</li>
    <li> When I start using this brand, I notice a difference in my skin; I suffer from eczema. I skin is soft, smooth and heals the scars. All natural, smells great and not oily. I will use this brand again!</li>
    <li> Love product, use all time . Fast delivery. packed safe.</li>
    <li> There is not a better product for my skin than Fruit of the Earth. This used to be in all of the major stores but began impossible to find until I found the product on Amazon. Thank goodness for my skin, that I found this product again-my skin looks better in the short time that I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream that there is out there,  hard to find in stores anymore. So glad I was able to find through you. Did arrive on time and couldn&#x27;t be happier,  thanks.</li>
    <li> Simply said, this product meets my expectations. The consistency is just right and my skin feels nourished after application.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly, not sticky!  I like this product and will continue to use it on my Alligator skin. that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> Simply, my skin absorbs this cream quickly, there&#x27;s almost no greasy residue and it&#x27;s truly healing. This is, I believe, the original &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; offering without aloe or other additions. After FotE offered the others with added ingredients I had a hard time finding the &amp;#34;plain stuff&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available now on Amazon. I find the others aren&#x27;t absorbed as easily and don&#x27;t provide any additional benefit that I can see or feel.</li>
    <li> Smells perfumy, but moisturizes nicely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find Fruit of the Earth vitamin E lotion, but it is. They used to sell them at Safeway and Dollar Tree, but I haven&#x27;t found them there in years. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff back when it was less than $2 a bottle. I don&#x27;t know what FOE&#x27;s deal is, they make a great product, but it&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t believe in marketing. And just sponsoring a US Ski team isn&#x27;t enough! I&#x27;m reaching out to you FOE, let me help you. If you were to go out of business and I could no longer get your lotion, I would be facing a serious skin crisis. Take care of your skin folks, you only get one.</li>
    <li> Our favorite lotion for softening skin and massages.</li>
    <li> So far didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it enough times to form a solid feed back, but it is not as I expected it to be so far.</li>
