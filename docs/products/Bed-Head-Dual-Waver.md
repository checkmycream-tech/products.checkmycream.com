      <li>I&#x27;m SO HAPPY with the results - creates a cool look...</li>
      <li>is very easy to use and it takes me about 30 minutes to get all of my hair curled.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and curls a lot of hair at one time.  </li>
      <li>It is better than most 3 barrel curling irons becuase you can change the size of the crimp that you get!</li>
      <li>And I also love the fact that you can turn the nob to which kind of waves you want.</li>
      <li>I was using my roommates for a while and decided I better get my own.</li>
      <li>This made a great gift to my sixteen year old she absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot to make good waves.</li>
      <li>Perfect with two different settings for the price, It&#x27;s s a steal!!</li>

      <li>Have had no problems at all with it:)</li>
      <li>my favorite hair tool.</li>

      <li>I use it more than my $100 Chi curling iron.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>its more like a crimper...</li>
      <li>Love the Bed Head Dual Waver</li>
      <li>I wish it would give more defined waves.  </li>
      <li>most effect comes from the edge of the plate which is not the look anyone is going for.</li>
      <li>The waves weren&#x27;t even that cute looking.</li>
      <li>Everyone else seems to love this.</li>
      <li>I love that it has 2 wave settings.</li>
      <li>(our Daughter-in-Law and Grand-Daughter) and they both absolutely love the Dual Waver.</li>
      <li>I am hairstyle-challenged but this does what it&#x27;s intended to do :)</li>
      <li>but I was hoping for more defined waves.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I do think it still made my hair more crimped than wavy</li>
      <li>but it does ok with building up the look of volume in your hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the two settings</li>
      <li>Its ok, but I prefer my Conair Waver over this any day.</li>

      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>maybe it was a better one</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a great present for a teen. :)</li>
    <li> This curling iron DOES NOT work with ethnic hair whatsoever! :(</li>
    <li> Was so excited for this product but doesn&#x27;t work half of the time</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter because she wanted \\&quot;beach\\&quot; wave hair. It does just that. You can have loose waves or tight waves. It works great.</li>
    <li> I love this waver. Its really big. And the waves it makes in your hair last longer than I expected. It only takes one time to make the waves to. And it gets really hot in a short amount of time.  Its a great gift for yourself or another.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is better than most 3 barrel curling irons becuase you can change the size of the crimp that you get! It works very well!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to do something different with my hair... the price was right so I took a risk.  I&#x27;m SO HAPPY with the results - creates a cool look... I use it more than my $100 Chi curling iron.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Worst order ever! Not easy to use and the results are not what I expected!</li>
    <li> My hair is really thick and the waver did not work for me at all,  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I got this item VERY quickly. I love how fast I got it. I used it last night for the first time. I think it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the placement of the controls because I kept knocking the darned thing off. Like I said, it was my first time using it last night and it came out pretty good. I assume it took me a while because I was trying to figure it out. I used the defined waves and it looked a little crazy (80s rock star) at the time, but I went to bed and it looked really good in the morning. I will do an update when I use the looser waves. At first you need to unlock the barrel and there&#x27;s a button on the underside to unlock the whole thing. That was the only confusing part. At this point in time, I would buy it again. I will post an update soon!    *********update*********  I used the setting for looser waves and it looks WAY better than the smaller ones, I am convinced I just need to play with the small one though. I did bigger sections and it looks amazing. I would recommend doing this at night and then sleeping. (I put all my hair sprawled out on my pillow as to not mess it up) and spray my fingers with hair spray and smooth fly aways in the morning. Touch up if need be. Loves.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves her Beauty salon accessory.</li>
    <li> cant even make my hair curl, it is hard to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and I love it.  I was using my roommates for a while and decided I better get my own. I like that you can switch up the waves to get certain looks.  Definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad but I was hoping for more defined waves. Not sure if the heat dial works that well.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for both and mother and daughter (our Daughter-in-Law and Grand-Daughter) and they both absolutely love the Dual Waver.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just my hair. Everyone else seems to love this. I do have short hair and what I was looking for was a product that gave me just one wave. This poofs out my hair and creates for of a crimp. I tried both settings and it still does the same thing. Then it makes my ends look weird when I did not even use it on my ends.     This is my 2nd Bed Head waver and I am giving up until my hair gets longer. They should make one smaller for those with short hair.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that this gives you two options as to how big you want your waves. Heats up fast and has many options for temperature</li>
    <li> not as good as past wavers. I don&#x27;t really see a difference in the two types of waves. I would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> They work really well highly recommend</li>
    <li> Its ok, but I prefer my Conair Waver over this any day. So back to using the conair</li>
    <li> I love my waver!   In a bulk order of lots of Amazon stuff, this was the LAST to arive!  It was the one thing I was looking foward to, and when it finally came I was excited!  Right then I started using it!  I looked up youtube videos to work this odd product!  The results are amazing!  I love the wave and crazy volume it adds to my hair, plus it heats well and fast! Well worth the 20 bucks! :)</li>
    <li> I immediately used it to test it and it did wonders on my hair. Not like other wavers that I have purchased in the past that just damage your hair without the wave. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. AND YOU CAN CHOSE THE WAVE YOU WANT. The price was excellent. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and ended up using it my self all the time.  Since I have naturally curly hair I am like most that are curlier under neath than on the top layers and this iron matches my underneath curls perfectly.</li>
    <li> You guys have no idea how much I love this ! I was debating whether to buy it here or look for it at target and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it here ! It came in two days ! And ever since I can&#x27;t stop using it ! I truly recommend you to get it !</li>
    <li> Love these wavers but they go quick</li>
    <li> used it about 3 times and its a good waver but not the best</li>
    <li> Does such a great job waving. I have jaw length hair and when I am done, it looks like natural messy waves. I absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> I like this curling iron a lot.  It is very easy to use and curls a lot of hair at one time.  I have fairly thick hair that is just past my shoulders and it only took me about ten minutes to curl all of it.  I haven&#x27;t tried the tight curls yet but the looser setting creates the perfect beachy waves.  Overall, very please with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love Bed Head, but this particular product is not great. I own a similar model of a different brand which works much better. This seemed to not really give different size waves and for some reason caused my hair to become frizzy while using it and I have never had that problem with my hair or any other styling tool in the past.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use, my daughter 12 years old - couldn&#x27;t do on her own, then hair went frizzy. A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works perfectly as described. Use it on my hair and my 4 yr old daughters hair without any problems!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Perfect for when u need a new style for ur hair!!!</li>
    <li> Would be nice if the instructions were written better to tell you how to unlock the bigger weaver. Thank goodness they had a video on here that shows you. This iron makes having waves so easy. I tried looking online on how to use a curling iron and flat iron to get the beachy look and it took forever and never looked right. This is super simple and fast.</li>
    <li> The dual waver itself is a fine product mechanically, heating up quickly and hot, but I&#x27;m just not fond of the &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; it produces. On my hair it looks like I&#x27;ve stepped back to the 1980&#x27;s and had my hair done by a crimping iron - very Madonna&#x27;ish. The original intent was to find a tool that would give my hair some waves quickly and I thought this would be the tool to do just that. Unfortunately, the wave was more like a crimp which doesn&#x27;t suit my taste.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love the variety it gives me and its simple &amp; fast. Everyone in my house ended up using it.</li>
    <li> Did not last long. The locking mechanism failed and will not unlock after less than 20 uses. It worked well before that.</li>
    <li> Not great but not horrible.  Mine the lock was broken where you can lock it into place, but I don&#x27;t use those anyways.&lt;br /&gt;When using a moose or gel the waives are very pretty, I got lots of compliments.  I had a deep waiver I like much better but since I cut 10-12 inches of hair off I need a smaller waiver for my just past the shoulder hair cut.</li>
    <li> There is a knob that you turn to adjust the waves from tighter to looser. It was very hard to turn the first time. I finally gave up and put some muscle into it at the risk of breaking it. It finally worked, but the knob didn&#x27;t seem to be in the right position. The waver takes me a while to use because I have thick hair. I like it when I am looking for something different.</li>
    <li> The Bed Head Dual Waver works well for the purpose intended. It takes me a while to do my hair with it but the end product is exactly what I wanted. I use the looser wave setting for my hair because the defined makes it look too crimped. I do get frizz and huge hair when i use this but a few hair taming products smooth it right out. Over all this is a really good product for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty interesting tool.  Took me a minute to figure out the twist top and stuff but its a great price for a dual product.</li>
    <li> I love this Bead Head Dual Waver because it makes perfect waves and it&#x27;s fast and easy!!! It literally only takes me 10 minutes or less to do my hair and I have fine medium length hair. And I also love the fact that you can turn the nob to which kind of waves you want. (Beachy waves or dramatic waves). Whatever the case, I love this Waver and I am very thankful! :)</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because I didn&#x27;t have the option to give it no star ...I was not satisfied with this waver at all</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars however the lock on the barrel became jammed with the first use and I had to break it in order to use it. Other than that this product is amazing. I can completely style my entire head of long hair in ten minutes. The waves will last the entire day. This was worth the money even though I can no longer lock the barrel.</li>
    <li> I like the waves that this creates, and the ability to adjust how they look. I have super fine, straight hair and the waves hold well, but are especially nice if I let it dry in a bun or braids &amp; use a little mousse.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this 3 stars because I&#x27;ve only had it about 6 months and used it a few times, but the lock to keep it closed broke and my husband had to pull it open. That in itself is not a deal breaker for me, but it makes me question the quality of it. However, it was pretty cheap and still does what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> this iron is awesome!!!! it heats up fast and waves fast. it is adjustable for tight or loose waves. the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the heat setting part moved to easily to where if I moved it a little on accident then its heat would change.</li>
    <li> I can usually figure out how to use small appliances, electronics, etc.  But this thing is very difficult to use!</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter who lives in another state and while I don&#x27;t always hear about the results of something, I got called and thanked profusely because THIS is the one she wanted the very most she said. Therefore I will assume it lived up to it&#x27;s highest value in her eyes. I probably would have heard if it didn&#x27;t but not always.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear my hair crimped/wavy very often so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a waver. This does the trick. The waves stay ALL day and I don&#x27;t use any hair care products with exception of leave in conditioner (or oil). I marked a star off because this iron is pretty heavy...that being said, I&#x27;ve never used any other wavers so I don&#x27;t have a comparison.</li>
    <li> Good packaging, nice looking item but the result to myhair is not that good as what it was say..thanks</li>
    <li> the barrels do not lock as described and thin hair does grab good enough, not tight enough</li>
    <li> love it works great! HEATS UP SUPER QUICK</li>
    <li> Love the Bed Head Dual Waver but it makes my hair a little frizzer but other than that, makes my hair look great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. Especially for the great bargain.</li>
    <li> Its a good waver, however i can get the same look using my regular hair straightner and quicker. Just go to youtube and look up crimping with a straightner, thats how i learned. But this waver works well also, but use alot of product if your hair has any frizz.</li>
    <li> I love it I can&#x27;t stop using it</li>
    <li> not happy with the results.  Very little curl or wave effect.  most effect comes from the edge of the plate which is not the look anyone is going for.</li>
    <li> Didnt work. Waste of money. Very unhappy &amp; disappointed in the tool &amp; the company. Bed head usually has better products</li>
    <li> I would give this Zero stars if it were an option. It created Frizz not waves. I had a couple friends test it out also just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t just me. They told me to get a refund.</li>
    <li> This heats up extremely fast, and creates a full head of waves in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the kind of waves I was looking for! I love how you can switch the setting to two different kinds of waves. Works great &amp;nd easy to use!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not using it properly but it left my hair a wavy frizz mop. The waves weren&#x27;t even that cute looking. Was going to send it back but decided to play around with it more. I&#x27;m feeling like this will end up in the rummage sale pile, tho.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I like. I love that you can adjust it for different waves! Made for thinner hair. My favorite is the revlon 3 barrel jumbo waver!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect new packaged condition. My teenage daughter found it extremely difficult to use. Her hair looked sloppy and messy after &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; it with this. But, to each their own. Not knocking the product necessarily, but I doubt you&#x27;ll get the look the show on the video unless you have a professional do it for you.</li>
    <li> I love this and it really does work well.</li>
    <li> What am I doing wrong here?  I have it set to the highest heat setting and I hold it for a decent amount of time on a thin strip of hair, and I get the loosest, craziest looking waves.  I don&#x27;t like this tool AT ALL.  My friend owns a Revlon and hers works perfectly.</li>
    <li> love this product! two settings for loose and tight waves and it stays for 2 days! much better than waving with a straightener.</li>
    <li> This item works as promised, but I think I need to straighten my hair before I use this waver.  I did not have much patience, but that&#x27;s me.  It takes a lot of time to get your whole head done, but that is to be expected.  I wish it would give more defined waves.  You really have to use small sections of hair to get a good result.  But, for the money, it works good and my granddaughter loves it. I prefer the Remington Pearl Curling Wand.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really wave......its more like a crimper... makes a big puffy mess. do not like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ana</li>
    <li> I received this last night and have had a chance to play with it some. The waves are not as good as some I have seen with other machines but it does ok with building up the look of volume in your hair. Some of the buttons look like they will break easily so be careful to take good care of it. Over all it seems to be a good machine for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it and I use it everyday. The only thing I would say negative is that you can get the same style using a flat iron. Just look it up on youtube. So I didn&#x27;t  really need to go out and buy a new tool. But if you like crimpers then get this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have my already wavy hair to be a little bit thicker and defined. So I decided to purchase this one. And I think it changed my I tire look from my actual age to like 10 years younger. I love it. It&#x27;s my first time to use it so I hope it only get better from here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And FYI I&#x27;m 29</li>
    <li> Love! My hair stays wavy for days using this!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this to get that \\&quot;just back from a day at the beach\\&quot; look.  She puts a Tbsp of salt and a Tbsp of tanning oil in a spray bottle with water, shakes well and lightly mists her hair, then uses this tool to get the naturally wavy look she gets every time we go to the beach.  This is a great little styling tool, works just as well as the more expensive ones our salon carries and it came much faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> It works well for my hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people how have thick hair it may not work as well but it was okay over all</li>
    <li> I have short/medium, fine hair and was looking for something different and something to add body.  This product is awesome!  I had my whole head done in about five minutes.  The cord is extra long, the waver is lightweight and easy to use.  It recommends that you use the low setting for fine or thin hair, but I think it&#x27;s just a precaution for the chance of someone damaging their hair by keeping it on too long.  I used the high setting so I could quickly move from one section to the next with no problem.  I would definitely recommend this waver.</li>
    <li> Bought this for myself but guess who uses it? My daughters, they used it and just loved it! They said it was like they had beach waves. Very satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to use this because it had the tight / loose setting, which works. My problem is even at high heat, this thing made my hair frizzy and it made my ends look like crap. This was with no product on my naturally curly hair that always holds curls without hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my second attempt I straightened my hair first--same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third attempt, used hair product while my hair was in its natural state--looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth attempt ... Straightened it and used product--looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the loose and tight adjustments. Every time I did small sections of hair as well. My hair is long, btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could get a better result by French braiding my hair before bed and letting it loose in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money and time. Not to mention your hair will break because it gets stuck and tangled near the base where it meets the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost looked like a bad crimp job .... I guess that&#x27;s the best description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY, just braid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I used high heat the entire time and even though I held it in place for longer than needed, it looked and felt like the heat adjusted.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE COOLEST TOOL EVER.. MY DAUGHTER IS STYLING EVERYONES HAIR THAT SHOWS UP AT THE HOUSE. ABSOLUTELY GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have used this waver for YEARS.  Mine broke and I was ecstatic to find another on amazon, as I tried many other deep wavers and none worked like this.  my favorite hair tool.</li>
    <li> This waver is pretty nice.  It doesnt exactly give you the boho waves I was going for, but in a pinch when I am in a rush, it waves my hair pretty fast.  Like it.</li>
    <li> The iron itself feels very bulky and almost cheapy, which is surprising for it being a Bed Head product. I like that the whole handle is illuminated when it is turned on, but I don&#x27;t like that there isn&#x27;t a proper stand for the tool to sit on in between usage. This means that when i have to separate my hair into chunks, while in the middle of getting ready, my hot iron is hopefully leaning on something fireproof! Also the shape of the waves is kind of weird. Both the barrel and the flat piece would imply that the waves would be a natural round shape, but they turn out slightly kinked. I guess that’s great if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but i was disappointed. I do have to say that I haven’t had much luck with the last two wavers i tried. I enjoyed the Revlon one, but i had to purchase two in the last two years because they tend to break apart super easily. WHAT A WASTE! Hopefully i will get used to the waves that this one gives once my hair gets a bit longer. We will see! Overall it is an okay waver for an okay price, but if i had the choice of which one to buy again this would not be in my top selections.</li>
    <li> I returned this it put funny lines in my daughters hair that made the wave look funny. Maybe we were doing it wrong? I bought the Conair MiniYOU Deep Wave Ceramic Styler and it works so much better for my daughters thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift. My stepdaughter has thick, long hair, and the wider setting on this was perfect. Well made &amp; great price.</li>
    <li> It works great! I love the two settings</li>
    <li> I love it.  Works great on my hair.  I got the body I wanted.</li>
    <li> better for thin hair than thick</li>
    <li> Gives my hair a wavy/beachy feel to it. I don&#x27;t use it that often, but it works as expected and does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a waver before so I have no point of reference but this seems to do the trick.  I would  say that it does take a long time to do all your hair, especially if you do it in layers BUT I have a ton of hair.  I also only use it on the &#x27;big wave&#x27; mode as the &#x27;small wave&#x27; didn&#x27;t seem to give enough wave.</li>
    <li> The middle adjustable bar is not working: it simply doesn&#x27;t adjust itself at all. But I like the waves it made to my hair. please someone tell what&#x27;s wrong with adjustment bar? I will be then happy to give a five star.</li>
    <li> I would tell anybody to buy this product. The price is way worth it..and the product works grerat. Great stely</li>
    <li> This waver does exactly what it should. I love that it has 2 wave settings. The only drawback is that it is a little difficult to use alone. It is a bit heavy, so my arms get tired trying to do the back of my head. Overall, I love it. The waves it makes come out beautifully. Good product.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but after using this waver, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I normally have very straight, fine hair that will not hold any kind of curl so I was very skeptical about buying this product but I figured for $25 I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waver is very easy to use and it takes me about 30 minutes to get all of my hair curled. It gives my normally flat hair amazing volume and waves and a little bit of hair spray ensures that it stays curled all day. I would recommend this product to anyone who has straight hair and wants a little curl every now and again.</li>
    <li> I love this waver! The waves are just beautiful! I didn&#x27;t give this product the full 5 because I would love for the device to become hot a little quicker! But works well!</li>
    <li> Bed head dual waver is Amazing! Worked really well on my hair. It does leave my hair a little poofy but i just put some smoothing cream in it to control the frizz. I do think it still made my hair more crimped than wavy but it still looked awesome.</li>
    <li> This waver is awesome! I had a little trouble &amp;#34;unlocking&amp;#34; it from a clamped position when I first received it, but pulling as hard as I could opened it (without breaking!) and now it works exactly as expected. I bought this for a model shoot I did and my hair looked amazing all day.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product. I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market trying to get natural looking waves/curls in my stubborn hair. This not only gives me waves but gives me a lot of body and also lasts a couple of days. It&#x27;s easy to use, my hair looked great the first time I used it. If you can use a curling iron, you can use the waver. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this. As soon as it came I washed my hair, dried it completely, then started playing with my new toy.My hair is just a bit past my shoulders, so I had plenty to work with. But it was disappointing to me. I could not get it to make a decent wave without having to put tons of product in my hair which made it stiff and not bouncy at all. I then tried it on my sisters hair, and her hair is about 4 inches longer than mine, and I still couldn&#x27;t get the desired look. I regret buying this one, I would&#x27;t do it again.</li>
    <li> I am hairstyle-challenged but this does what it&#x27;s intended to do :)</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  Received quickly and just as described</li>
    <li> PROs:&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable for different wave depths&lt;br /&gt;- iron lock for storage convenience&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable heat settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- highest heat setting still not very hot - I had to hold my hair in the iron longer than I was comfortable with and it still didn&#x27;t give solid waves&lt;br /&gt;- the construction of the whole mechanism is flimsy and feels like it could break easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve seen many other people use this with ease, this specific waver didn&#x27;t give the intended result as I&#x27;ve seen with other ones.  I wish I would&#x27;ve spent the extra money and purchased a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, blonde hair that falls just below my shoulders. I used this for the first time for a party last weekend. AMAZING. My hair actually looked full!! And the waves were so cool. I&#x27;m almost 40 and was worried I&#x27;d look like a tween who found her mom&#x27;s crimper from the 80s. Not at all. It was modern and fun. Tons of compliments, and the waves lasted all night. Oh...and it only took me about 10 minutes to do.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this, saying that it heats nicely and does the job.  The color is really nice and the design is sleek.</li>
    <li> I am incredibly happy and satisfied with my purchase! The Dual Waver gives my hair incredible volume and with two options for bigger, retro style waves or for smaller, tighter waves I can easily change the way my hair looks. In the past I&#x27;ve had trouble with getting curls or waves to stay in my naturally straight hair but with this tool I have no problem keeping my hair looking good for two days in a row. And of course the price is very reasonable for a Bed Head styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything the Dual Waver can be a little time consuming to style and heat up, and after holding it the Dual Waver can start to feel a bit heavy and awkward but I would assume that is the case with any styling tool such as the waver. But again, I am completely in love with the Dual Waver and encourage everyone to buy one for themselves!</li>
    <li> She was test driving it as soon as she opened it and loved it.  I waved her hair as advertised.</li>
    <li> my old waver broke, It waved its last goodbye and I was devestated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one, so I thought that this one would do...maybe it was a better one cause it has all these doo dads and a dual waver for tighter waves...but this thing is like an alien vessel to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an unlock, and a lock, and glows green and you turn a knob to make your waves bigger and you have to lock that down and so on and so forth. I found that the waves were more like crimps than waves..and I was a bit disappointed in that. You have to really understand what temp to wave your hair at and how long. My other one was so stupid simple, this one is just ...outrageously complex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt buy it again if it broke, I actually bought my old brand after using this ...always stick to what you know is good!</li>
    <li> Maybe hate it is a little strong.  Since I usually wear natural hair, using this thing just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, just be prepared to spend awhile doing your whole head, up side it lasts a couple days if you don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
    <li> This made a great gift to my sixteen year old she absolutely loved it. Makes a great gift for birthday ..</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very hot to make good waves. I thought with the 2 settings for waves it would be perfect, but they&#x27;re still not tight enough waves for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great waver. It works for both thick and thin hair, even in large sections! Best waver i ever tried/bought.</li>
    <li> Not so hot. Hair doesn&#x27;t stay in mechanism.</li>
    <li> I am a little dissappointed with this bed head. I hate being the one that gives products an okay or a bad review, but this product just isn&#x27;t for me. It doesn&#x27;t heat up like it should. I put it to the highest degree, and still not as hot as it should. My hair looks like I just woke up out of bed when I am finished using this product, and I have medium length hair so I was hoping I would have a new hair style, but it&#x27;s just not working out for me :/ I do recommend Bed Head products, I will reccommend this one too anyone who wants to try this if you want tiny waves, and like Bed Head products. Hopefully your iron will heat up.</li>
    <li> This product works great just takes a little wile but it looks great</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I like it,  but I think my hair is still too short for it.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail quickly! Have had no problems at all with it:)</li>
    <li> Great hair waver!! Perfect with two different settings for the price, It&#x27;s s a steal!! I&#x27;ll agree with another customer it is better for fine hair and I knw tht bc I hv thin hair and if I had thick hair is say it would tk to long to do! It does heat very very well it&#x27;s HOT!  Hope this helps anyone who may wondering!! 😊</li>
