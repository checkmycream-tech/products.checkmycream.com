### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed.</li>
      <li>You need to practice to perfect the application of dermaflage.</li>
      <li>Customer service has been the best.</li>
      <li>have very good support and response time.</li>
      <li>This is a product that takes a great deal of practice and patience.</li>
      <li>This product is great in covering up recessed scars.  </li>
      <li>I am a happy client and would recommend some with scars to try this product.</li>
      <li>i will be always a great customer .</li>
      <li>but once you get it you&#x27;ll be so happy as no one will know the scar or the Dermaflage is there</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, it will take some time to perfect the technique, but</li>
      <li>so I can also tell you that the people that answer the phones at Dermaflage are very nice and helpful</li>
      <li>this is an awesome product when used correctly...not sure about the make up thing as one review stated</li>
      <li>I hope more people continue to find out about this excellent product!</li>
      <li>good concept,</li>
      <li>With some practice, you can feel great and feel like you&#x27;ve magically transformed your skin.  </li>
      <li>It has literally changed my life for the better!</li>
      <li>I love dermaflage!</li>
      <li>NOT ANY MORE!</li>
      <li>Even after a year, I still sometimes I have to do it twice in the morning to make it near flawless.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t remember being this excited about anything that allowed me to look and feel good about myself as I have with Dermaflage.  </li>
      <li>Areas that move more, like around your mouth, won&#x27;t work with this product.  </li>
      <li>For me, the best way to match it to my makeup is to use my mineral based foundation all over my face and then, with a cotton swab soaked in alcohol, I remove my powder foundation from my scar area only.</li>
      <li>When it gets on the patch, it becomes more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Besides those, I found the applicator tool works better than a finger to apply.</li>
      <li>I have tried and tried, practiced so many times.  </li>
      <li>Life is better with you in my makeup drawer.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>The more you use this product, the better and faster</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use (and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with practice).</li>
      <li>The directions are easy and I was able to get good results on my first try.  </li>
      <li>It is a very good product to give you back confidence and hide depressed scars and Dermaflage</li>
      <li>Not as easy as advertised or made to look.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Dermaflage!! :)</li>
      <li>and you absolutely cannot wear with any kind of makeup./</li>
      <li>Tricky to work with for achieving a smooth skin appearance as it firms up quickly.</li>
      <li>The right skin tone for the perfect match is also key, DF customer service is willing to make it right for you...</li>
      <li>Maybe just for special occasions.</li>
      <li>It takes a little practice to use and perfect at first</li>
      <li>I love that it lasts so much longer than any makeup would.  </li>
      <li>The customer support is excellent and the staff helps customers on an individual basis when necessary.</li>
      <li>I had already purchased a product called Glamoflage after watching a video, but found that trying to rub makeup into the scar only created more redness and made the scar more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found you can make it last for a day or more longer if you take nail clippers to the edges that start to lift up!</li>
      <li>I have worn this product twice in public after getting it 3 days ago, and feel confident and secure.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to regain your self-confidence.</li>
      <li>It does take some practice in applying to get it done right.  </li>
      <li>a real confidence booster!</li>
      <li>I just have one smallish scar and my first tube</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely changed my life as I&#x27;m now much more confident to go out in public.</li>
      <li>You Tube videos that I watched before I used it the first time</li>
      <li>My scar is in between my eyebrows and was the first thing I saw when I looked into the mirror.  </li>
      <li>So, when I would try to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; my scar with regular makeup, which didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d end up having to doing the rest of my face and looking way more &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; than I like.</li>
      <li>But after I&#x27;m successful, it is so worth the extra 5-10 minutes spent to eliminate the scar for 24+ hours.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is THE ONLY product I have been able to find that works fabulously for my specific needs.</li>
      <li>It even covers a large dog bite scar on my face.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It dries way too fast, it&#x27;s so sticky....</li>
      <li>However, it absolutely works as advertised.</li>
      <li>Thanks again DF...</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>I have gotten this to work perfectly only a few times but it is very convincing, or should I say concealing, when it turns out right.  </li>
      <li>I have two small pock marks on my nose and its amazing when applied correctly</li>
      <li>The concept was great, but its really not a very good product.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m sure any female with a facial scar can relate).  </li>
      <li>As anyone with an indented scar on their face will tell you, regular makeup will actually make your scar look MORE pronounced.</li>
      <li>:) The first time i tried to use it, i was having a little problem but with enough practice everything became as simple as i could think of.</li>
      <li>Then, I came across a few videos on Dermaflage, by consumers, makeup artists and right before my very eyes, I was sold!  </li>
      <li>It peels off and is very embarrassing in public.</li>
      <li>Dermaflage covers my scar&#x27;s depth and redness completely, just like makeup, to where</li>
      <li>I have never ordered this product from Amazon as I&#x27;ve always ordered it directly from the Dermaflage website or over the phone</li>
      <li>as they say practice makes perfect...the key is obviously use the right amount</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;m sure you can tell, I&#x27;m a huge advocate of this product and can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say about it.  </li>
      <li>For example, Last month , it had an issue with the recent order because demflage was more oily than usual, so i called the customer service</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars for products to cover, hide or mask large acne scars.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using dermaflage on a moderate scar for nearly two years now.</li>
      <li>I buy Dermaflage direct from the company, but Amazon seems to sell it at the same price.  </li>
      <li>As other users have mentioned before, the product can be a bit of a challenge to use when first starting out.</li>
      <li>Trying to cover a scar with makeup only makes it look 10 times worse, so for many months I wouldn&#x27;t even leave my house unless I had to</li>
      <li>You have very little time to combine and put where you need it, you should use less than what you expect you will need, you do not want to put make up on it or it on top of liquid foundation, and DO NOT DAB or PAT.</li>

<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I found Dermaflage and it&#x27;s been a lifesaver for me...and it stays put thru my long and demanding hours in the air.</li>
<li> Only took a couple of tries to hide my frown line.  </li>
<li> I have always worn very little makeup and preferred a natural look.</li>
<li> I actually found Dermaflage before I was going to be in a wedding and was super stressed out about how the deep ugly scar on my nose was going to look in wedding pictures-  </li>
<li> Hides scars that all other solutions that I have tried didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I work in the public eye as flight attendant and had become increasingly self-conscious of a small scar on my face as a result of a recent bad cystic acne outbreak.</li>
<li> Still, only having to use a very small amount of product on my frown line every two or three days will make this a bargain.  </li>
<li> If you have serious, pitted,discolored scars,this is the ONLY product you need to purchase.  </li>
<li> I thing that anyone unfortunate enough to have a deep scar that makes them self concious needs Dermaflage.  </li>
<li> Before starting to use this, I was having some serious issues with my self image.</li>
<li> My confidence is then restored to face the hundreds of people I come across in an ordinary day at work.</li>
<li> Trying to find a balance between covering with makeup and dermaflage is quite hard.</li>
<li> I hope to eventually find a permanent cosmetic solution, but in the mean time this helps restore my self esteem.  </li>
<li> If you are unable to take the time to learn how to use it, then it will be a waste of money.</li>
<li> It is just too expensive to keep &#x27;practicing&#x27;.</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> This is easier then trying to apply foundation afterwards as it&#x27;s difficult to get it close to the edge of the Dermaflage patch without getting powder on the patch.</li>
<li> Too difficult to use</li>
<li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars for products to cover, hide or mask large acne scars.  I don&#x27;t remember being this excited about anything that allowed me to look and feel good about myself as I have with Dermaflage.  With some practice, you can feel great and feel like you&#x27;ve magically transformed your skin.  I love that it lasts so much longer than any makeup would.  Mirrors are no longer the enemy.  Dermaflage will change lives as it has done with mine.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE ONLY product I have been able to find that works fabulously for my specific needs. If you have serious, pitted,discolored scars,this is the ONLY product you need to purchase.  You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermaflage for almost 2 years now and I LOVE it.  I actually found Dermaflage before I was going to be in a wedding and was super stressed out about how the deep ugly scar on my nose was going to look in wedding pictures-  not to mention I feel like it&#x27;s all anyone sees when they look at me (I&#x27;m sure any female with a facial scar can relate).  Trying to cover a scar with makeup only makes it look 10 times worse, so for many months I wouldn&#x27;t even leave my house unless I had to, I was that self concious about my scar.  So having to be in a wedding was the last thing I wanted to do and if I hadn&#x27;t found Dermaflage I probably would have backed out of it.  In short, Dermaflage makes very deep scars virtually disappear and it has totally restored my confidence in public.  It takes a little practice to use and perfect at first but once you get it you&#x27;ll be so happy as no one will know the scar or the Dermaflage is there but you.  There are some helpful You Tube videos that I watched before I used it the first time and they definitely helped me so check them out as it might save you some frustration.  I thing that anyone unfortunate enough to have a deep scar that makes them self concious needs Dermaflage.  One time I covered my scar with Dermaflage before going into my plastic surgeons office for an appointment and he thought my scar had somehow healed!  He couldn&#x27;t believe there was a product that would cover a scar so well and at his request I actually requested some Dermaflage brochures from the company and put them in his front office!  As I&#x27;m sure you can tell, I&#x27;m a huge advocate of this product and can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say about it.  I have never ordered this product from Amazon as I&#x27;ve always ordered it directly from the Dermaflage website or over the phone so I can also tell you that the people that answer the phones at Dermaflage are very nice and helpful so if you ever have a problem you can always call them. I hope my review will convince someone on the fence to try Dermaflage as it is/was a life changing product for me.</li>
    <li> Totally changed my life . :) The first time i tried to use it, i was having a little problem but with enough practice everything became as simple as i could think of. Customer service has been the best. Dermaflage staffs are always looking forward to hear to your feed back so that can improve the product. For example, Last month , it had an issue with the recent order because demflage was more oily than usual, so i called the customer service and they were so cooperative to listen to me and they promised me they will fix this problem. Thank you guys. i will be always a great customer .</li>
    <li> Hides scars that all other solutions that I have tried didn&#x27;t. It is a very good product to give you back confidence and hide depressed scars and Dermaflage have very good support and response time. I am a happy client and would recommend some with scars to try this product.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  Took some practice but now I can apply it like a pro!  My scar is now gone!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Tricky to work with for achieving a smooth skin appearance as it firms up quickly.</li>
    <li> You need to practice to perfect the application of dermaflage.</li>
    <li> This proudct was awful !</li>
    <li> Not as easy as advertised or made to look.  Not enough in this starter pack to start with and you absolutely cannot wear with any kind of makeup./</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed. I have a recessed scar on the bridge of my nose from being hit in the face with a blade. As anyone with an indented scar on their face will tell you, regular makeup will actually make your scar look MORE pronounced. I have always worn very little makeup and preferred a natural look. So, when I would try to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; my scar with regular makeup, which didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d end up having to doing the rest of my face and looking way more &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; than I like. This product allows me to lessen the appearance of my scar without requiring me to put make up on the rest of my face. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with a recessed facial scar. It&#x27;s also easy to use (and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with practice).</li>
    <li> I came across this product while searching &amp;#34;how to hide a scar with makeup&amp;#34; on YouTube.  I had already purchased a product called Glamoflage after watching a video, but found that trying to rub makeup into the scar only created more redness and made the scar more pronounced.  Then, I came across a few videos on Dermaflage, by consumers, makeup artists and right before my very eyes, I was sold!  I immediately purchased Dermaflage.  The directions are easy and I was able to get good results on my first try.  I have worn this product twice in public after getting it 3 days ago, and feel confident and secure.  The product will only come off if you peel it off.  My scar is in between my eyebrows and was the first thing I saw when I looked into the mirror.  NOT ANY MORE! I feel like I have  a &amp;#34;do over&amp;#34; from a fainting accident and am no longer self conscience.  Thank you Dermaflage,  Life is better with you in my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. The price was reasonable and the delivery was fast. The product however is not one I will buy again. Too difficult to use and you can wear make up with it. The concept was great, but its really not a very good product. Sorry.</li>
    <li> This product takes a LOT of practice otherwise it can come out looking like a sticker. So because of that, I am rating it lower.  I have gotten this to work perfectly only a few times but it is very convincing, or should I say concealing, when it turns out right.  Tips: the directions are spot on. You have very little time to combine and put where you need it, you should use less than what you expect you will need, you do not want to put make up on it or it on top of liquid foundation, and DO NOT DAB or PAT. Besides those, I found the applicator tool works better than a finger to apply.</li>
    <li> I love dermaflage! It has literally changed my life for the better!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it will take some time to perfect the technique, but as they say practice makes perfect...the key is obviously use the right amount...if you need to error...error on the &amp;#34;not enough side rather than too much&amp;#34;....I have two small pock marks on my nose and its amazing when applied correctly I cannot even notice in a magnfying mirror..  The right skin tone for the perfect match is also key, DF customer service is willing to make it right for you...this is an awesome product when used correctly...not sure about the make up thing as one review stated but if the color matches your skin tone you should not have a problem  Thanks again DF...a real confidence booster!</li>
    <li> I work in the public eye as flight attendant and had become increasingly self-conscious of a small scar on my face as a result of a recent bad cystic acne outbreak. I found Dermaflage and it&#x27;s been a lifesaver for me...and it stays put thru my long and demanding hours in the air. For me, the best way to match it to my makeup is to use my mineral based foundation all over my face and then, with a cotton swab soaked in alcohol, I remove my powder foundation from my scar area only. I then follow with the primer on my scar and then apply the Dermaflage according to instructions. This is easier then trying to apply foundation afterwards as it&#x27;s difficult to get it close to the edge of the Dermaflage patch without getting powder on the patch. When it gets on the patch, it becomes more noticeable. I use a magnifying mirror for precision application. Dermaflage covers my scar&#x27;s depth and redness completely, just like makeup, to where only I know it&#x27;s there. My confidence is then restored to face the hundreds of people I come across in an ordinary day at work. Thanks Dermaflage!! :)</li>
    <li> Only took a couple of tries to hide my frown line.  Areas that move more, like around your mouth, won&#x27;t work with this product.  Still, only having to use a very small amount of product on my frown line every two or three days will make this a bargain.  HELPFUL HINT:  I&#x27;ve found you can make it last for a day or more longer if you take nail clippers to the edges that start to lift up!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as they make it seem for me</li>
    <li> Although I buy this product from Dermaflage, I wanted to assure  people considering this product that it works. It even covers a large dog bite scar on my face.  My dermatologist could not even find the scar after application. The customer support is excellent and the staff helps customers on an individual basis when necessary. It&#x27;s worth the money to regain your self-confidence.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dermaflage on a moderate scar for nearly two years now. It&#x27;s definitely changed my life as I&#x27;m now much more confident to go out in public. Before starting to use this, I was having some serious issues with my self image. If you&#x27;re just starting to use dermaflage, I recommend spending a lot of time reading various tips that users have posted online. As other users have mentioned before, the product can be a bit of a challenge to use when first starting out. However, it absolutely works as advertised. The more you use this product, the better and faster you will get. I hope more people continue to find out about this excellent product!</li>
    <li> I buy Dermaflage direct from the company, but Amazon seems to sell it at the same price.  This product is great in covering up recessed scars.  It does take some practice in applying to get it done right.  Even after a year, I still sometimes I have to do it twice in the morning to make it near flawless.  But after I&#x27;m successful, it is so worth the extra 5-10 minutes spent to eliminate the scar for 24+ hours.  I just have one smallish scar and my first tube lasted about 7-9 months, even with mess-ups.  I hope to eventually find a permanent cosmetic solution, but in the mean time this helps restore my self esteem.  Thank you Dermaflage!</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe people buy this. It peels off and is very embarrassing in public.</li>
    <li> Can not use with makeup.  I have tried and tried, practiced so many times.  It dries way too fast, it&#x27;s so sticky.... good concept, but it needs improvement. Lots of improvement. It is just too expensive to keep &#x27;practicing&#x27;. I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> This is a product that takes a great deal of practice and patience. If you are unable to take the time to learn how to use it, then it will be a waste of money. The solution does what it says in regards to filling in scars. However, it does not conceal discoloration well. Trying to find a balance between covering with makeup and dermaflage is quite hard. Maybe just for special occasions.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my survival scar</li>
