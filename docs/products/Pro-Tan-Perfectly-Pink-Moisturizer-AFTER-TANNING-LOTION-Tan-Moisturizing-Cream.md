      <li>The smell is nice and light.</li>
      <li>This product is just okay.</li>
      <li>but it smells amazing and is super moisturizing not like</li>
      <li>i dont really know how to describe the smell, its not too fruity, not over powering at all, it just smells good.</li>
      <li>The paint is chipping off of the silver as well, so obviously it is cheaply made.</li>

      <li>Really goes on great and soaks in fast.  </li>
      <li>I bought this a month or so ago and was really excited to get it</li>
      <li>That was the selling point for me because I like sweet smelling lotions.</li>
      <li>Although the smell is too sweet for me.</li>
      <li>The formula is pretty good though, I ended up just using it as regular lotion.</li>
      <li>It has reduced scars, itching and moisturizes very well!!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, great smell after getting out of that burnt smelling tanning bed, ..a little thin, but still great stuff..</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing not only has it lasted forever</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this ProTan lotion as a nice way to prolong the life of your tan.</li>
      <li>Turns dry skin into moisturized healthy looking skin!</li>
      <li>I chose this lotion because the price was very reasonable and the bottle is a 22 oz.</li>
      <li>but when I did it smells more like an actual tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>I would definitly order from them again even though I lost my first package.</li>
      <li>She informed me that my lotions had opened inside and the post master need to open my package to close the top tighter.</li>
      <li>Smells good, but very watered down.</li>
      <li>Its like a subtle amazing, if you slathered it all over your body you still wouldnt smell like a middle school girl, youd just smell good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing makes your skin so soft and makes your tan last longer</li>
      <li>As regular lotion- good, smells okay, and the hemp makes your skin REALLY soft after a few uses.</li>
      <li>you just put pure coconut oil all over ur body moisturizing, but it does the job without being greasy.</li>
      <li>It smells like I dumped a whole bottle of baby powder  on me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
      <li>Fast shipper too</li>
      <li>What I can say is Amazon was amazing with giving me full refund because of the broken &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I definitely live by it.</li>
      <li>and I sould be expecting new lotion</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: It does definitely smell like a mild tanning lotion (Or hemp, which would be obvious from it having hemp in it).</li>
      <li>my only complaint is the smell if you like the smell of vanilla then you will love it.</li>
      <li>It was too runny to work well after tanning when your skin is dry, absorbs too quickly and skin will be dry again soon after.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years now and I definitely live by it. The only lotion I&#x27;ve needed. Whenever my skin is damaged (burnt, rashes, or cuts/abrasions) I use it until it&#x27;s fully healed. It has reduced scars, itching and moisturizes very well!! I definitely recommend this lotion to anyone and everyone. Very great product and reasonably priced (one bottle has lasted me a little over a year)&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: It does definitely smell like a mild tanning lotion (Or hemp, which would be obvious from it having hemp in it).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great smell after getting out of that burnt smelling tanning bed, ..a little thin, but still great stuff..Fast shipper too</li>
    <li> I have to say this was a great purchase. I use it along with my tanning lotion and I get great results! It has a nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> its a great product and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I bought this a month or so ago and was really excited to get it but when I did it smells more like an actual tanning lotion. I was kinda disappointed because I was wanting something that smelled like something other than tanning lotion. Needless to say, I will be getting something else.</li>
    <li> I like to use a lotion made just for after tanning. I chose this lotion because the price was very reasonable and the bottle is a 22 oz. product. I use this lotion every morning after bathing. It helps my tan last longer and gives your skin great hydration. I would definitely recommend this ProTan lotion as a nice way to prolong the life of your tan.</li>
    <li> Smells great and you don&#x27;t feel it for the rest of the day. Tan Salon had this as complementary and it was like velvet!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a good buy it feels really good and you get a big bottle for a small price my only complaint is the smell if you like the smell of vanilla then you will love it.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice and light. A great moisturizer.  I would order it again and recommend it to my friends. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing not only has it lasted forever but it smells amazing and is super moisturizing not like you just put pure coconut oil all over ur body moisturizing, but it does the job without being greasy. Its not sticky when you put it on at all, its like silky. i dont really know how to describe the smell, its not too fruity, not over powering at all, it just smells good. Its like a subtle amazing, if you slathered it all over your body you still wouldnt smell like a middle school girl, youd just smell good.</li>
    <li> I got this last night, it smells like candy and lasts all day! It does a wonderful job as an after tan body moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and the price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. I don&#x27;t really like the smell. Another person&#x27;s review said this smells like candy. It does not. That was the selling point for me because I like sweet smelling lotions. It smells like baby powder and is kind of strong. Also the hydration it provides is not so good. I tan about three times a week and this lotion leaves me feeling dry about an hour after I put it on. Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells good! Works nicely.</li>
    <li> So not happy with this lotion. It smells like I dumped a whole bottle of baby powder  on me.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the softness this gives my skin!  Turns dry skin into moisturized healthy looking skin! Will reorder then more needed!</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> Really goes on great and soaks in fast.  Leaves skin smoother than a regular moisturizer.  Although the smell is too sweet for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing makes your skin so soft and makes your tan last longer</li>
    <li> I Love the way it makes my skin feel , and it smell very nice to , u  will order this again</li>
    <li> I got my order yesterday 1/3/13 and I got a knock on my door the post lady had my package. She informed me that my lotions had opened inside and the post master need to open my package to close the top tighter. When I opened it all the lotions from both bottles had leaked out. I messaged the companey and told them that they should use a box not an envelope to ship in the USPS. I got a message back today and I sould be expecting new lotion and they took my advise and going to use a box. I am very happy with the company and the lostion smells so good. I would definitly order from them again even though I lost my first package. I give them 5 stars for being a good companey.</li>
    <li> When I got the bottle, the top part was missing so it was impossible to pump the lotion out. Smells good, but very watered down. Probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again. What I can say is Amazon was amazing with giving me full refund because of the broken &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Its a little runny, and part of the silver squirty part broke. The paint is chipping off of the silver as well, so obviously it is cheaply made. The formula is pretty good though, I ended up just using it as regular lotion. As regular lotion- good, smells okay, and the hemp makes your skin REALLY soft after a few uses. As after-tanning lotion- next to useless. It was too runny to work well after tanning when your skin is dry, absorbs too quickly and skin will be dry again soon after. Left slightly greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product though. I still use it but idk if I would ever buy it again.</li>
