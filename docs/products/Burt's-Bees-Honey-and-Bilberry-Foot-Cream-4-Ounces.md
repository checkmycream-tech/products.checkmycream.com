### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This is the best foot cream ever!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product!</li>
      <li>Wonderful creme to soften feet.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect solution to keep my feet from drying and cracking.</li>
      <li>Gave this for a gift and was told it was the best foot cream they ever used.</li>
      <li>Works well, but doesn&#x27;t taste very good.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>Even the world&#x27;s favorite discounter, Walmart, doesn&#x27;t have a very good price on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so good</li>
      <li>Gotta love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell!  </li>
      <li>So I think this should be used regularly to be effective.</li>
      <li>It worked very well, and smalled great!</li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I plan to order more of this product.</li>
      <li>Truly a top notch product.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I was reunited with this product, I have been using it since.</li>
      <li>Both my husband &amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>What more do you want anyway, Just filling in req&#x27;d</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a better bargain than buying the seperate body or hand lotion.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product, start out using the smallest amount, then determine if you need more.</li>
      <li>always love Burts Bees anything</li>
      <li>Love, ,love, love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
      <li>no. of words. : )</li>
      <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s not my favorite produce from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect cure for winter hands, extremely dry skin etc, not just feet.</li>
      <li>I look for better prices online, even with buying more than one at a time, but with the shipping added (whether rolled in to the higher product price as \\&quot;free\\&quot; or as a separate postage add-on), it drives the price up even more than brick-and-mortar retail, so I have to pass.</li>
      <li>Incredibly good creme and extremely highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Great product that I&#x27;ve been buying/using for several years now.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff and cannot live without it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s beautifully emollient, smells heavenly, and it really works on those dry feet.</li>
      <li>Since I was with friends, I wanted to be quick about it, so I took the first tester I saw and tried it on, then scurried on my way.</li>
      <li>We put this on our calloused heels every night and it keeps our heels soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t yet know what the long term effects/benefits will be, but it seems to work pretty well, and it smells good enough to eat - literally!  </li>
      <li>My only gripe is that it washes off quite easily, so when I use it on my hand I have to either avoid washing my hands or reapply it.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t buy it very often (if ever) because of the price.</li>
      <li>With this treatment she walks around the neighborhood daily and is virtually free of discomfort.</li>
      <li>I also have keratosis pilaris that is particularly prominent on my upper arms, and this combined with frequent exfoliation makes it almost unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>Smell is a little strong but still definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for dry feet and dry hands, especially after a day in the salty waters of the sea.</li>
      <li>Despite the fact that she is very trim at 110 pounds and is otherwise in excellent health, walking causes painful callouses on the balls of her feet.  </li>
      <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have significant issues with dry skin.</li>
      <li>It was made for feet, though, so I suppose frequent washing was not something really taken into account for the product design.</li>
      <li>This makes my old, dry, scaly feet as smooth as can be.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m getting old.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for about three years now, and of course everything has gone up in price, but I used to buy this for about $7.50 back in 2009, which was reasonable for me.</li>
      <li>99% natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Honey is a natural antibiotic and regular used does not build up an immunity.</li>
      <li>It has a soft gritty feel to it as well, maybe from the oat flour.</li>

    <li> This is the best foot cream ever!  Both my husband &amp; I love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful creme to soften feet.</li>
    <li> I plan to order more of this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff and cannot live without it! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for dry feet and dry hands, especially after a day in the salty waters of the sea. I also have keratosis pilaris that is particularly prominent on my upper arms, and this combined with frequent exfoliation makes it almost unnoticeable. My only gripe is that it washes off quite easily, so when I use it on my hand I have to either avoid washing my hands or reapply it. It was made for feet, though, so I suppose frequent washing was not something really taken into account for the product design.</li>
    <li> My wife has a serious problem with callouses on her feet.  Despite the fact that she is very trim at 110 pounds and is otherwise in excellent health, walking causes painful callouses on the balls of her feet.  However, for the last couple of years I have rubbed her feet with the Bert&#x27;s Bees Honey and Bilberry foot cream for about 15 minutes (on each foot) every night.  With this treatment she walks around the neighborhood daily and is virtually free of discomfort. It is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great product that I&#x27;ve been buying/using for several years now.  Not too thick, not too thin, just enough to moisturize your feet.</li>
    <li> We put this on our calloused heels every night and it keeps our heels soft and smooth.  We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I now know this is for feet, but one day about 5 or 6 years back, I was walking through the aisles of Target, and noticed Burt&#x27;s Bees products and of course I had to try. Since I was with friends, I wanted to be quick about it, so I took the first tester I saw and tried it on, then scurried on my way. On my way back home (40 miles away) I noticed that even when I washed my hands, the lotion kept my hands moisturized and the smell was indescribable. I loved it! So I decided to go back, after smelling hand cream after hand cream and trying to find this one again, I had no success. It took me a really long time to realized that I had tested the &#x27;foot&#x27; cream. I recommend this to everyone I know now. Especially those who do house cleaning or food service as a profession, because of the harsh chemicals used for cleaning that dry out hands. This is the perfect cure for winter hands, extremely dry skin etc, not just feet. I am so glad I was reunited with this product, I have been using it since.</li>
    <li> Gave this for a gift and was told it was the best foot cream they ever used.</li>
    <li> It worked very well, and smalled great! I would tell anyone to try it. You must go and get some now!</li>
    <li> Very thick, but when you put it on it&#x27;s watery (if that makes sense).  Also has a strange smell to it.  I like it, but it&#x27;s not my favorite produce from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I like it. Though the texture does bug me slightly. It&#x27;s lanolin, which is very thick and sticky. Those who have used lanolin products before will know the texture. It has a soft gritty feel to it as well, maybe from the oat flour. It does absorb in, though it takes a little longer. I suppose that is why the directions say to use at night. I use it in the day though after my shower. I still have dry heels. They aren&#x27;t cracked but they have the ridges like it will if I don&#x27;t keep up on it. So I think this should be used regularly to be effective.</li>
    <li> Healed my dry cracked feet. Smell is a little strong but still definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, use it on my hands a couple of times a day.  I have significant issues with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love, ,love, love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I get a lot of compliments from men on this because of the honey I think. They think it smells like candy, and thus, I smell like candy. Plus, it&#x27;s creamy and works well. I use it all over though, not just for feet. It&#x27;s a better bargain than buying the seperate body or hand lotion. And, it&#x27;s cruelty-free (except maybe for the bees who don&#x27;t like us stealing their honey, I imagine).</li>
    <li> The front range of Colorado is very dry and I&#x27;m getting old.  This is the perfect solution to keep my feet from drying and cracking.</li>
    <li> always love Burts Bees anything</li>
    <li> Outstanding product, start out using the smallest amount, then determine if you need more.</li>
    <li> Although this is foot cream, it use it on my hands too.  I absolutely love the smell!  It moisturizes well without being too greasy.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Gotta love Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gotten so expensive! I&#x27;ve been buying this for about three years now, and of course everything has gone up in price, but I used to buy this for about $7.50 back in 2009, which was reasonable for me. Now it is $11-13, wherever I look (Target, Walmart, Walgreen&#x27;s, Amazon). Wonderful product but I can&#x27;t buy it very often (if ever) because of the price. Even the world&#x27;s favorite discounter, Walmart, doesn&#x27;t have a very good price on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know expenses have gone up but my pay, sadly, has gone down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, Burt&#x27;s Bees, help! I would buy your foot creme to the exclusion of all others, but you (and your retailers) are pricing it at least $3 higher than I can afford. I look for better prices online, even with buying more than one at a time, but with the shipping added (whether rolled in to the higher product price as \\&quot;free\\&quot; or as a separate postage add-on), it drives the price up even more than brick-and-mortar retail, so I have to pass. I can&#x27;t find savings on Amazon for this, where I would expect to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a terrific product. I just wish I could afford it! It&#x27;s so good I refuse to buy other cremes, so I go without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautifully emollient, smells heavenly, and it really works on those dry feet. Knees and elbows, too.</li>
    <li> Helps my feet from getting too dry. What more do you want anyway, Just filling in req&#x27;d no. of words. : )</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  99% natural ingredients.  Smooth and absorbs easily into the skin.  Incredibly good creme and extremely highly recommended.  A little goes a long way.  Truly a top notch product.</li>
    <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t taste very good.</li>
    <li> This makes my old, dry, scaly feet as smooth as can be.  I have used tons of products but nothing works like this.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic!  I don&#x27;t yet know what the long term effects/benefits will be, but it seems to work pretty well, and it smells good enough to eat - literally!  Believe me, when they say &#x27;honey&#x27;, they mean &#x27;HONEY&#x27;!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this for years after a Registered Nurse recommended it for my diabetic husband&#x27;s dry feet.  It softens cracked heals and helps heal.  Honey is a natural antibiotic and regular used does not build up an immunity. The fragrance is not overpowering and  I prefer the Honey and Bilberry instead of the coconut version.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube of the foot cream.  I use it after bathing and like the way it leaves my skin feeling.  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
