<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair- this product did nothing special for my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....does exactly what it claims to do!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have cable or satellite TV.  My viewing choices are limited. Thanks to Prime and Netflix and decent internet access, I can watch what I like to watch for about $18/month.  On my budget that&#x27;s important savings.  On the down side, the one channel I do enjoy watching mentions Wen projects about 4 times an hour, and has four half-hour infomercials a day.  With all this brainwashing, I decided to order this stuff on Amazon, at a price significantly higher than the infomercial gives. Why?  Because the small print of these commercials locks you into a contract where you pay $30 a month for a supply of this stuff every 3 months.  I figured I&#x27;d be better off trying this even in the huge pint bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an older woman and have not dyed my hair for 40 years or more.  But my hair is fairly thick (though much less so than when I was younger) and coarse.  I wash it when it&#x27;s dirty and usually let it air dry.  I often  add in conditioner and may even put in hot curls, which hold well to the next shampoo and give my mop shape and definition.  My problem has been this: My hair looks great the day after the day after I wash it.  It may look good two or three days.  But if I&#x27;m not careful, my hair gets weighted down with conditioner--leave in or wash out.  So, I should have known not to try this stuff.  Because it is soapless--all conditioner. But cosmetics are hope in a jar, and I thought this might rejuvenate my aging hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance on it, because this product seemed to have better reviews than the others, which warned this is not something to use all the time--it weighs down the hair and alters hair texture.  Should have listened and saved my money.  Dean says, &amp;#34;Just use my products one time and you&#x27;ll see a difference.&amp;#34; Not in my case.  I do better with shampoo and conditioner.  In fact, my hair was so lackluster after I washed it with Wen, I dug out a hair dryer (which I haven&#x27;t used in many years)and dried it and added hot curls.  So I probably damaged my hair more than &#x27;nourishing&#x27; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I did not follow the instructions of the bottle.  I used a much smaller amount of product and waited 10 minutes.  I used cool water (not great in the current chilly weather), rinsed it out with cool water, and rinsed and rinsed some more.  I did not put it in twice, because my softened water would never rinse it out.  When I put in the curlers the hair came back shiny, but the curls do not hold, and the next day my hair was dull as it had been when I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude it may have not been washed out thoroughly enough.  And this product is heavy, with its natural oils attracting dust, I suppose (my house is oil heated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the packaging was outstanding.  None of the stuff leaked anywhere.  But if you try this, do NOT put in all the product you&#x27;re told to use.  Don&#x27;t rinse and repeat.  Just rinse, rinse, rinse.  Or better, listen to all the Amazon reviewers.  Whenever I&#x27;m tempted to buy some of the junk advertised on TV, I&#x27;ve learned to check out the reviews on Amazon first.  Saves a ton of money.  I just failed to follow my own good advice on this one.  Wish I could send it back and get a refund, but I have used it.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair, love it.</li>
    <li> it is thicker than the other ones I have tried (Pumpkin, Lavender) yet works great. I love the fresh lemony vanilla scent, wish it lingered after I rinsed. great product, I always have a good hair day when I use this!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this product is great. I love the thickness and the smell is awesome. I have tried other products and none compare. I don&#x27;t use as much as it says and I don&#x27;t have to wash every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using wen for sometime and love the results, the 13/6 has new packaging at the wen website, so very happy when I found on amazon for 1/2 the price.  I don&#x27;t much care about the packaging.</li>
    <li> All of Chaz Deans Wen products are great.  I have no found one I do not like.  This one is exceptional and the seller on Amazon offered it at a very fair price.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It does very good on my hair and I got it at&lt;br /&gt;a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> I really love this formula.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of the WENs, but I&#x27;ve tried most.  I have found that some make my hair blonder, or dryer than others, but they&#x27;re all awesome in comparison to regular shampoo and condition.  Apparently 613 use to be the expensive one, but not many people were buying it because of the ridiculous price.  Now it&#x27;s one of the cheaper ones, so I&#x27;m buying it up!  It smells heavenly.  Super clean, but with a twang of rosemary and vanilla.  It&#x27;s excellent for men and women.  It&#x27;s not loud and perfumey.  It makes my hair super soft and manageable.  It is worth the money, if you have it to spend.  My hair is to my elbows and I use 12 pumps, with a splash or two of water.  YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW The directions (besides the amount used), or it will make your hair limp and oily.  MAKE SURE TO ADD WATER!!!! You should have a little lather (but not suds).  Also, rinse very well at the roots, or you&#x27;ll have the same problem.  If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, go for it... it may change the way your hair looks, for real.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love my hair now. smells much better then the other wen products.  great for when I am out of town I only need one bottle</li>
    <li> Sixthirteen is a fantastic moisturizing conditioner for my long hair.  Before I began using it, I would need mousse or spray gel for styling - but no more.  It controls the &amp;#34;flyaways&amp;#34; without gumming up the works or making my hair stiff.  One of the things I like best is that -- if I&#x27;m wearing my hair up -- at the end of the day, I can still brush it when I take it down.  Couldn&#x27;t do that when the sticky mousse and gel were in it.  Because this product is very concentrated, I have found that I can use a little less and still get good results -- another plus factor in my book.  By the way -- the fragrance is fresh and lovely, but not overpowering.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to see a decent price for this here. I have to say I was a little dissapointed though. I usually use Wen Lavender and that works best out of all of them for my hair (thin and fine). I think this makes my hair TOO soft and it gets really whispy and flyaway. It smells absolutely amazing though! It does give my hair an extra boost of moisturization and &amp;#34;swing&amp;#34; if I mix two pumps of it in with the Lavender during the second cleans, so I&#x27;ve been using it for that. I would re&#x3D;purchase it and use it that way, just can&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations (as a current Wen user).</li>
    <li> I have been using this line of shampoo for a couple of years now. I have tried various formulas, and like all of them. I&#x27;m excited to see what the next new fragrance will be. I received this product ahead of schedule. I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo because it does not strip hair color (in my case henna) from your hair.  And I can use it everyday if I wanted and I get great results every time.  I&#x27;m a loyal user of Wen for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This is the fifth Wen product I&#x27;ve purchased and again, it&#x27;s a winner.  I am in love with Wen!  I am so glad that I made the investment.  For me, it is SO worth it.  I will absolutely never use anything else on my hair.  I work in a salon and I tell everyone about Wen.  I get so many complaints on my hair.  Clients ask me what have I done to my hair that it looks great.  My hair is so shiny and healthy.  Even humidity has not been an issue and humidity has always been my enemy.  I get caught in the rain and it hasn&#x27;t affected my hair at all.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I absolutely love my hair and I truly believe it is because of Wen.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and this product has definitely helped tame my frizz. Its no better than any other expensive deep conditioner, but it did make a difference compared to Walmart brand stuff. ps people, you can scrub your scalp and hair with any conditioner (sounds gross and absurd, i thought that too when i first read it, but IT HONESTLY DOES CLEAN YOUR HAIR AND WORKS AS WELL AS A CLEANSING CONDITONER) , then just follow up by soaking your tresses in a deeper conditioner and bam, healthier less frizzy hair.. dont dog it till you try it</li>
    <li> this is so good word can not describe what it does to your hair I had a bad perm and it is still not like it should be but this is making it so I can at least not wear a  will buy it again</li>
    <li> Favorite Wen product.  Next in order I like Fig, then Summer Mango, Pomegranate.  I wish it didn&#x27;t have silicones though.  3c/4a natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> Never used anything like this before. VERY different way to clean hair. I LOVE how my hair feels and reacts to this product. Had to get use to the lack of suds but the results are amazing. MUST follow directions and remember to use cool water with this product.</li>
    <li> The product was ok, it did not last a month. My hair is just as dry as before. Might be the severe heat we&#x27;ve had but I&#x27;m going back to my OTC regimen</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;ve used wen products for the last year but recently ran into some financial issues and this was a decent price for what I know is a good product. I do like this product but not as much as the general products I have previously used. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I like Wen.  I have naturally curly, color treated hair that is also naturally dry and frizzy.  My hair is also very fine and thin.  I was hoping this Wen treatment would help with the severe hair loss I&#x27;ve had for several years.  SixThriteen does make my hair softer and I think it has helped reduce, slightly, the amount of hair I see in the drain.  I gave it 4 stars because I still lose color, just as I have with other shampoos, including Wen products, and,  I still need to use other products to de-frizz, control, and define my curls.  I would love to find one product that does it all, but, I&#x27;m still looking.  I&#x27;m still using my first bottle of this, so, I&#x27;m hoping my results will  improve over time.  The price at Amazon is much better than anywhere else I&#x27;ve looked.  I received my product quickly and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Excellent feel to hair. Soft, smooth, no frizz. The only downside is the cost because you have to use so much of it.</li>
    <li> I like i very much  my  hair respond every good to it. I will continued to used like better as a leave in condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge WEN fan.  I have thick, curly, dry hair; one step WEN cleans and conditions it.  I typically use fig but tried this new type after reading a raving review by someone else with thick hair.  By far this is the best WEN (for thick, dry hair) yet!!!  Right now I am well over due for a hair cut.  My ends are dry from the flat iron and they are split.  WEN Sixthirteen has made blow drying my hair so much easier and it feels clean, soft and shiny.  I also love the smell of this product.  It smells like a salon shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this product for thin, normal or oily hair but if you have thick, dry hair then give it a try.  Totally worth the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing - I wouldn&#x27;t use this item if your hair is Keratin treated.  It cleans so well it will pull the keratin from your hair. (Learned this the hard way.)</li>
    <li> I will never use traditional shampoo again...AND...there r alot of imitators out there but none come close to Wen.  Worth the. money...skip take out..take care of your hair</li>
    <li> love this wouldn&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It&#x27;s okay, but I thought it would make my hair look more clean/pretty. I think Suave could have done the same job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month now and found my hair looks weighed down.  It did make my hair feel soft, but not bouncy at all.  I also noticed more hair loss than with traditional shampoos.  Will probably use the rest of the bottle as a leave in conditioner,</li>
    <li> I love this....it does not make my hair greasy if I skip a washing.  Has a nice tingling feeling when you use it!!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered Wen cleansing conditioner in the past because I was totally sold on the idea of a healthier way to cleanse my hair. The other cleansing conditioners from Wen I tried were okay, but it seemed something was missing. After using a full bottle of the SIXTHIRTEEN conditioning cleanser and ordering my second, I can 100% recommend this product. I use it for about 4 days in row and use a clarifying shampoo on the 5th day because I have an extra oily scalp. I have fine hair, but alot of it and the texture is almost wavy. I encourage the waves by styling and it is past my shoulders in length. Wen has helped make my long, tangled hair easy to style and manage. I also like the fact thst this formulation is not too heavy and not too light. My waves aren&#x27;t weighed down and the formula is enough to tam the frizzies and tangles. I&#x27;m going to see if subscribe and save is available.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Provides good cleansing, wonderful conditioning and lasts for months.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you; it lasts so long that it is quite economical as well as an excellent shampoo and conditioner in one.  Just use about a quarter size dollop on 2-3 parts of your head and add water and work in.  Easy and great results. Highly recommend.  Good for all hair types, but works especially well on wiry or kinky, dry hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and my hair seemed drier than usual.  Please note that I do have colored hair so perhaps this is great for virgin hair but really did not do much for me.  I think it was pretty pricey and if you have long hair as I do the bottle will NOT last very long.  And yes, I followed directions exactly.  I just can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well AND smells great. My only complaint is that 16oz for $40 doesn&#x27;t get you very far. As the instructions stated, the more I use it the softer my hair. I only wash my hair every 3rd day and by the 3rd day, my hair is definitely dryer from not have using Wen for a few days. This works better on my hair than Kerastase so I think if you need it - it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is some great stuff.....I use with my coarse, fizzy hair.I leave it on my hair for a real deep conditioning.I get softer, smoother hair.I am a Wen girl!!</li>
    <li> I sent this to my daughter-in-law who absolutely loves the product.  The post office said they delivered it, but my daughter-in-law never got it.  I gave her this product before.  That is how she knows she loves it.  I only rated this one star, not for the product, but because it didn&#x27;t arrive.  Now I am out the $45 or so I spent for it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be my miracle hair care. I tried using this a few different ways but it just made my hair greasy and unclean looking. I ended up having to get rid of over half the bottle because it made my scalp break out so bad. Now I&#x27;m looking for the next best thing. I&#x27;m sure this may work for some, but to my average length colored hair that&#x27;s always a little frizzy, this isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This was great to use. My hair felt wonderful and was easy to manage. The smell is great. I will purchase this gain.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for 3 years and love them, I usually get the Lavender or Cucumber.  I thought I would try this and was really hoping to like it and I thought the ingredients list was exceptional, HOWEVER the first day I used it I felt it went on really nice in the shower, I dried my hair as usual...then as the day progressed I started noticing that my scalp was itching.  Day 2, it became worse.  Day 4, I washed with Six Thirteen again and same thing.  This time I REALLY started itching and I noticed extreme dandruff and that the ends of my hair were REALLY dry.  Its too bad, I was hoping to like this product.  However, I will stick to my usual Wen Lavender.</li>
    <li> Im an avid WEN user already. I was blown away with this product. I have every one feel my hair. I even sent before an after pics to friends. I use it every few days. Its  amazing!</li>
    <li> WEN Sixthirteen has done remarkable things for my crazy, frizzy, curly hair. I use half of the recommended pumps, because I have fine hair. I could see how this product may be too heavy for people who tend to run oily, but works great on my dry hair. It also seemingly helps to protect from styling and heat damage. I still believe Keratin treatments are the best cure for frizz, but WEN smells great and works great. Worth spending the extra money for shiny locks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a WEN girl for quite some time, but even with following directions to the letter, I had to occasionally use a shampoo with the regular cleansing treatment. This new 613 is AMAZING. My hair feels clean, soft, smooth (my hair tends to frizz easily in humidity while also going flat) and is super manageable with lots of body. I am 45 and a brunette and my hair is starting to significantly gray - but with this treatment, the gray is actually very pretty and I get compliments on the color combination. I ride motorcycle, so my very long hair can get pretty beaten up - I use this every day and my hair is undamaged, strong &amp; healthy. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I hardly ever have to dye my hair. It is healthy and thick. I will never use shampoo again. So glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it is my favorite &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend it.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that from the first day I washed my hair in it, I immediately ran to my computer, and ordered another bottle. WEN SIXTHIRTEEN gave my scalp a soothing tingle, that assured me that my hair was clean and conditioned. I strongly recommend this product to all who are interested in receiving a good conditioner cleaner, and hair that manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for about 3 years now. I like many others, saw the info on tv, and thought it would either be a learning lesson and waste of money, or, it would do as it claimed. Now I can&#x27;t, go back to regular. if you want to call it, shampoo that suds. My hair is naturally thick and curly, so I need a product that keeps the moisture in my hair or it look dry and fried out, though I \\&quot;do no harm\\&quot; to my locks. I let it air dry with a leave it curl shape holder like curls rock, after the party, by TiGi or It&#x27;s a Ten. I have used other things when I have had to and yikes does it show. So I guess i will forever be a Wen girl. Just a tip, when you make your initial purchases, it gets cheaper as you can place your order when you need it, and so it balances out to be that $20 for 16oz that lasts about 3 mo. and that is worth it. It has something like no other, and this will be my new fav.!!!! Lavender and pomegranite are the best for moisture. This is just top notch!!!!</li>
    <li> I heard so much about this Wen product, so I though I would try it.  I have been a Wen girl&lt;br /&gt;for 2 years, but do not think this product does any more than my regular wen conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for about 8 months and decided, on a whim, to try the Sixthirteen. Underwhelmed doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe my opinion. I did use the entire bottle, waiting for it to improve, but that never happened. I have fine hair and this product just left it limp, dry and scraggly-looking. The awesome smell everyone raved about in reviews I read is just that of a Tic Tac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixthirteen may be miracle serum for others but I will not be re-purchasing. I&#x27;ve found the Pomegranate formula to be the best for my hair, so I&#x27;ll just stick with that moving forward.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! My processed hair drinks it up and feels so soft and looks so much healthier without feeling weighed down.  It even protects my color from fading.  Wish they would offer larger size at better price than the other online Wen carriers.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great in fine hair with no build up. I have received a lot if complements since u started using the product.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny, I have thick long blonde hair that needs moisture.  Already ordered more after a week of using wen.</li>
    <li> My hair got very dry after using the product! Instead of throwing my money away, I should have given it to my church.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth every penny. For starters, it smells absolutely wonderful. It is much thicker in consistency than the regular Wen cleansing conditioners, and I find I can use less of it. I have very long natural red hair, thick and wavy. SixThirteen is very right for my type of hair. I am going to try the mousse as soon as I can afford it...yes, what Chaz sells is expensive, but totally worth it. Just like everything in the world, no single thing is perfect for everyone - but find the one that works for you, and you will be addicted. Like so many other ladies say, I will never use regular shampoo again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Six Thirteen for a month but so far, I love it.  My color has never lasted this long.  I&#x27;m sure I will be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this is highly concentrated but my hair appeared dull.  Will continue to use in case this takes time to see results.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly &amp; tried the product 4 times &amp; the results were really not better than the average haircare products I usually use, especially for the high price that it was.</li>
    <li> I have been a Wen Girl for about 8 years.  I have gone from the original almond mint, to the fig to the winter vanilla mint (my favorite).  I saw the reviews for this and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I mean hey, I took a chance on trying Wen in the first place....right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed.  I have long layered hair, and while it smells fantastic and is much MUCH thicker, it is actually too thick.  Even adding water does not help me blend it through my hair properly, and it does not have the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; that I get from regular Wen.  It&#x27;s that \\&quot;slip\\&quot; that I need to properly work through all of my hair and that I require from a leave in, in order to keep my ends nice and healthy.  Does my hair look good once it is dry and styled?  Yes.  Do I like how it feels while I am getting it there?  Or how much got pulled out because it did not truly \\&quot;detangle\\&quot;?  Not at all.  It feels like I am over processing it and like it is getting drier and drier every day.  I&#x27;ll mix it with a leftover bottle of Wen, use it up and never order it again.</li>
    <li> I swear... and his products are perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been better. I have really dry coarse hair and this works great on restoring that extra moisture that I need.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this. I followed the directions to the T.  I have straight hair. It left my hair feeling flat and did not meet any expectations.  This is nothing more than a heavy conditioner.  This product is way overrated.  I rely on Amazon reviews, but was let down this time.  You could do better buying something from your grocery store and save a lot of $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I found out something very interesting.  I have always relied on purchasing Amazon products based on the number of positive reviews they receive-as I am sure many others here do.  I am now very wary of products with 4-5 * reviews that are overly enthusiastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your search engine and type in \\&quot;buy Amazon reviews\\&quot;.  Apparently, there is a company that will have reviewers go out and give glowing reviews on a product for a hefty $.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the late night TV product sellers may utilize this service frequently.  If you think about it, it makes sense.  They&#x27;ve already put a lot of money into a long advertising spot on TV, what&#x27;s a few more thousand dollars to get positive reviews out there?  I bought another product with glowing reviews that was \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; and it was horrible as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a warning to my fellow Amazon shoppers, be very wary.  Do your research.  Pay attention to what the negative reviews say.  I have since learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> i like the way my hair feels after, but sometimes the next morning it looks greasy, which doesn&#x27;t happen with other shampoos and conditioners</li>
    <li> For naturally curly Caribbean hair, this CoWash is phenomenal! I prefer it over their regular Wen hair line. I use it every 3-4 days and my locks are shiney and silky. In between I use Queen Helene Cholesterol to CoWash.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Wen and I really loved how Fig and Six Thirteen worked on my curly hair and the fragrance of Six Thirteen is amazing...however, I am so sad I had to return it. I used it over a week or so with my Fig and my scalp started itching and I got welts on my shoulders and neck and face. I looked at the ingredients and there is an orange oil in it :( I am allergic to anything with orange oil and I started to react to it. Again, I love how this product works, but now I can&#x27;t use it. I need to be careful from now on which one I use. I need to check the ingredients. Please make this one without the orange! :) It has so many other lovely things in it, does it really need the orange? :) My hair loved Six Thirteen :(</li>
    <li> For everyday washers, I highly recommend it. I sweat a lot at the gym and I need to wash everyday, I discovered this, and I am so happy. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, leaves it soft. I used the previous regular cleansing conditioner, this one is richer andhas more conditioning power</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of WEN for quite awhile, it has completely altered my hair (and I live in Florida).... LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving this too, different smell, and not sure of the difference in result, but also happy happy. Will continue to purchase. I did notice I use less of this product then of WEN, but I have pretty short hair, so that may not be everyone&#x27;s experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders for my hair. Wen always leaves my hair soft, shiny, healthy and manageable.  Smells great.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I had tried Wen products before this and was never impressed. They worked for about a week, then my hair started to drop, look dry, tired, weighted down. Then I got a small sample of this and was I ever impressed. This is the real deal. This could make me leave shampoo for good. It leaves my hair (which is fine, color treated and curly)moist, with great body, curls defined, minimal to no frizz, color deeper and richer.  I use regular shampoo about once a week because my scalp just needs that cleansing that Wen cannot provide. When I do shampoo, my hair is drier, frizzier, lighter in color. I look forward to days when I go back to WEN. Thanks Chaz!</li>
    <li> I only use it on the ends of my hair every other shampoo, it seems to be a bit too much conditioning for my fine thin hair. My daughter who has coarse wavy hair uses it more often, it seems to help the frizzyness.</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews for this before I purchased it. A lot of people were describing (maybe even complaining) that this cleanser is too thick and leaves your hair &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; and weighed down. As I have fine but VERY curly and unruly hair, I was intrigued. I am always looking to weigh down my hair with creams and moisturizers. I even got into the habit of using a little of my regular in-shower conditioner as a leave-in. So I went ahead and ordered Wen Sixthirteen. I&#x27;ve used the regular Wen cleansers for a couple of years now and I really do like them. After a while I don&#x27;t feel like I get that super conditioning effect of when you first try it or when you go back after using other cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Sixthirteen for almost a week now and I am super happy with it. The scent is strong but I don&#x27;t mind it. It is different from the regular Wen cleansers. No mintyness and no fruit smells. More vanilla musk than anything. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair, at least it doesn&#x27;t in mine. I did find that I needed less in my hair than I do with the regular Wen. Definitely add a little water when you apply it to your hair and massage heavily. I make sure I rinse my hair thoroughly before putting the Sixthirteen in. It lathers up real nice. After my shower, combing my hair feels awesome. It also kept that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look for most of the day. No frizz and my roots were pretty silky. My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this healthy since I had it all cut off and was growing it out again. Like having virgin hair.</li>
    <li> I LIVE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND HAVE LONG GREYING COLOR TREATED HAIR, IT IS VERY DRY, FRIZZY AND CAN BE UNMANAGEABLE. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT, NO HARSH CHEMICALS, LEAVES HAIR SOFT. I APPLY A SMALL AMOUNT TO ENDS AFTER TOWEL DRYING. I ONLY WASH MY 1-2 TIMES PER WEEK. THIS HAS BEEN A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO A BRAZILIAN BLOW OUT AS FAR AS TAMING MY HAIR. THE PUMP ON THE BOTTLE IS INEFFECTIVE, THE PRODUCT IS TOO THICK TO BE DISPENSED THIS WAY AND YOU WILL LOSE PRODUCT TRAPPED I THE DISPENSER :( THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE BUILD UP ON SCALP, SO I USE PUROLOGY SULFATE FREE CLARIFYING SHAMPOO 1-2 TIMES A MONTH TO SCALP AREA ONLY. OVERALL A GOOD PRODUCT JUST WISH IT WAS CHEAPER!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. My hair is very fine and usually very dry, from coloring, but WEN SIXTHIRTEEN gives it softness and body.  The cleanser also has a delightful light scent that is so nice. My hair is short and 2-3 pumps of cleanser is sufficient. I think I have found the perfect product and won&#x27;t go back to using anything else!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length fine/thin hair and found that sixthirteen leaves my hair with body, volume and shine- just make sure you thoroughly rinse out the shampoo otherwise it can make your hair greasy- I find it works best to use sixthirteen 3-4 days a week and reg shampoo/conditioner the other days- I will definitiely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used the lavender Wen before when my sister started receiving the auto shipments and gave me some to try. I liked the smell and the way my hair felt, so I decided to buy some for myself. I didn&#x27;t want to commit to the auto shipments, so I decided to buy some on Amazon, my go-to store. It arrived quickly and I tried it the first night. I cannot say enough about the smell! A mixture of lemon, vanilla and rosemary, the subtle scent wafts around you all day. My hair is very straight and thin so, if I use Wen every day, it tends to look a little greasy. I use Wen for 2 or 3 days, and then I use another shampoo before going back to Wen. This works great for me and my hair has never looked, smelled or felt better. I&#x27;m hooked on Wen!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it makes my hair so soft.  I have corse, wavy hair and now I don&#x27;t have to use the straightener on it!</li>
    <li> WEN SIXTHIRTEEN this is a really nice product and I like the way my hair feels soft to the touch and smells with a hint of vanilla.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the Wen cleansing conditioners, this one is one of my favs. It smells great, not as minty as some of the others. And it leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; with a clean scent to it. I leave a bit in the ends to use as a leave in treatment. I have an ombre hair color &amp; fine hair, but a lot of it. This is my favorite Wen shampoo right now. I do love trying out different ones, but I&#x27;ll stick with this one for now :-)</li>
    <li> It does do a good job like other Wen products, but I did not care for the smell, it smells to me like men&#x27;s cologne or deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I sure won&#x27;t buy that one again.</li>
    <li> My hair is an uneven curly and I have fought for years to get it straight enough to be straight or curly enough to be curly and never been happy. From the first time I used Wen 613, my hair was so soft and much much straighter than normal just in blowing it out. I love the smell too. I bought this product in conjunction with the HSI Flat Iron and it has been the PERFECT combination to get my hair straight and silky.  I want to touch my hair all day now.  If you have unruly hair, you definitely need to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price because you need to use quite a lot each time.  I have been switching out regular shampoo and conditioner on days that I am not planning to style my hair. At the current price, it is worth it to me to have silky straight hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN products for a long time. I particularly like the way this leaves my curly, but thinning hair--especially the first few days after I use it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always use exactly as the directions state, however my hair has gotten much softer without being weighed down. The smell is lovely, and I can go two days between washings (as usual). My ends seem less harsh despite not having had my hair done in over a month, and that is just after a week of use. This is an expensive product, but so far it does seem worth it. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update after my next hair appointment to note how long I can go after a fresh cut and the next one (normally only 6 weeks before the ends get to rough).</li>
    <li> I am a long time Wen user, I use the Lavender scent.  I have fine hair but a lot of it.  I also color my hair and found that Wen is about the only shampoo I can use regularly that does not accelerate fading.  I am a runner so I wash my hair daily.  I was curious about this shampoo and decided I would try it.  It&#x27;s by far my most favorite.  I love the scent, I love how it moisturizes my hair and I love how my hair looks when I dry and style it.  I don&#x27;t need to use very much for my just below the ears, bob style cut.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, I would definitely encourage you to try it.  I continue to use the Lavender Wen….normally about 2/3 times a week.</li>
    <li> After searching for the &amp;#34;perfect blonde&amp;#34; color for my hair, and after trying loads of different brands and shades my hair was in rough shape. I had been using a well known brand that was supposed to make my hair stronger, but I never really thought it was doing much, I came across this shampoo from a blogger, and thought I would give it a try. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to regular shampoo again! The trick is to really rinse well, and only use a small amount for the leave in (and only apply to the middle and ends of your hair when using it for a leave in conditioner). If you don&#x27;t your hair might feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, and it makes my hair feel like silk in the shower, and it stays soft. If you are looking for something different, I would certainly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;For those who color their hair....I used this after using a high lift blonde with a 40V developer and my hair didn&#x27;t show any signs of damage after. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver my hair is bye dry and frizzy. After 2 weeks of using WEN cleansing treatment my hair was felt for softer and moisturized. Best part us my hair felt like it grew faster.</li>
    <li> This product does make my hair softer and easy to manage but having to use so many pumps every time you wash your hair for the price is totally ridiculous. This product is way too expensive to have to use so much . The results are not great and product is so overpriced. I will not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Best product ever. it is amazing for everything it is styling shampoo and cleanser and amazing. It helps your hair and everything. My hair was fried before this product and now it is amazingly soft and alive :D</li>
    <li> I have coarse curly hair that I wear straight, Wen leaves my hair soft, smooth and shiny!  I am a huge fan and have been using WEN for several years.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, I am going to be very honest, I like it because it does leave your hair soft and is not made with harmful sulfates, it does not completely  eliminate frizz and all the other stuff that the adds claim, it does a better job than regular shampoo in terms of being a more healthy product for your hair. I do not like that it is so expensive I think they can do a better job with pricing this product as it is not a magic formula but it will last about a month if you only use it once a week with long hair. It does not leave any soapy residue behind after you rinse and it has a mild lovely sent. I suggest you try it at least once to determine if it is right for you, the product is nice the price is not.</li>
    <li> My hair feels really good and looks much better.  I would highly recommend this product.  I have thin fine hair and this product helps.</li>
    <li> I only used this twice. The fragrance in it is so strong it gives me a headache. It&#x27;s my fault that I was too busy to notice I could have returned it, which I wish I would have done. If you are sensitive at all to fragrances, this is not for you. Plus, it makes my hair dull and lifeless.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that this was the most hydrating conditioner from when, but it was not the case for my hair.  It was very thick and smelled nice, but didn&#x27;t help with detangling.  I&#x27;ll stick with the mango coconut cleansing conditioner, that one is my favorite &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This daily cleansing doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the other wen cleansing conditioner.I&#x27;m a really big fan of wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> As a first time user of this product, I found it moisturizing and really loved the minty scent!  I did not use the recommended dosage of product per wash (I used fewer pumps based on my hair density), plus I was trying to conserve product since I found this product pretty pricy from the usual store brand shampoo/conditioners I buy.  I understand you&#x27;re suppose to wash your hair every other day with this product, which i did try, but if you have an oily scalp like mine it would be hard not to wash your hair everyday.  I even use dry shampoo a couple times a day between washes.  So I used it as a daily wash, which is probably a no-no.  Overall, I do love this product and hope one day it could be more affordable.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. My mom had given me a bottle and when I ran out, I HAD to have more! The smell is just SO wonderful!!  And it makes my hair so soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> first off, this stuff smells amazing. I have super bleached out hair and it makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have thick/coarse/dry/damaged hair.. Every woman&#x27;s dream lol. I usually use Wen fig and it has never let me down. I&#x27;ll admit I use crede shampoo in between at times to remove build up and to enhance my Japanese Liscio  treatment. Decided to give this one a shot and I am wowed by it! Instant lustre and sheen from one use! This may be my new go to for a while before I decide to change it up again. If you have hair similar to mine, give it a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product at another site.  Amazon has the best price.  Use if you have very dry hair or if you color + your hair.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, often frizzy hair, somewhat damaged but Wen makes it so much easier to style, and it feels so silky and soft - as though it had never been overly dry and uncontrollable. It is expensive, but I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner or a drawer full of styling products, so I don&#x27;t actually spend much more. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using cleansing shampoo for quite awhile now. Most recently I was using the Loreal kind and loved it. However my local Walmart all of a sudden, never seemed to have it. I had used regular Wen before and liked it ok, but when I saw the reviews for sixthirteen I decided to splurge on myself ad give it a try. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. My hair is currently armpit length and I have been trying to grow it out for years (it seems to grow but always breaks off, so it never seems to get longer.) I only use sulfate free products, havent colored it in about 8 months, and don&#x27;t blow dry it anymore. I hated it after the first use but decided to hold judgment until I played around with how much to use etc.. It&#x27;s been about a month and no matter how I use it, my hair looks greasy. I have naturally dirty blonde hair with natural highlights and have always been able to go long periods between coloring because it blends nicely as it grows out/fades. With this shampoo it makes my color look so dull and lifeless. I can rinse and rinse and it always feels like there is still product in my hair, it does not make my hair feel clean at all. I bought this stuff because of all the reviews and hopefully mine can help someone save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> It was weird not having shampoo lather up but it does the trick.  My hair is fuller and thicker it stays clean longer!  I am constantly being complimented on how my hair looks and shines!  It Great!  I would buy this product again and again, too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever after using this product a few times.  My ends actually look worse, but I can&#x27;t be positive if it is the product.  If you are looking for a miracle solution than I don&#x27;t think this is it.  My hair is dry, frizzy, curly.</li>
    <li> I have used many shampoos and conditioners and this one is by far the best.  Wen system takes awhile to do the process but this is a pleasure and my hair is like silk afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I purchased this and now I have a trash can full of junk products to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using Sixthirteen&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret making the switch</li>
    <li> Price is fair for wen. I love this cleanser but I like it better when I diluted and use it as a detangler instead. I notice my hair falls off in the shower more than usual. It has a nice scent. I still shampoo once or twice a week because I have thin hair and the roots sometime feels and look greasy.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and her hair looks fantastic</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> I have a cabinet of every type of shampoo and conditioner out there.  I may even be a hair product hoarder!  This is by far the best I have ever tried.  It leaves your hair feeling clean and conditioned.  I have really curly hair and can see how much more healthy it looks after just a few washes.  This is something I would buy again and again (I might even throw away some of the other stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, you don&#x27;t have to join a club to buy this and you aren&#x27;t obligated to cancel a membership.  It just makes it that much better!</li>
    <li> Best leave-in conditioner on the market! I have tried everything and this stuff is the best! It is not too heavy and it smells heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has super curly hair and I have thick processed hair and SixThirteen leaves it smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this... After using it for two weeks my hair was a greasy mess. As it is, I only wash every 3-5 days and usually have no problems just using a little dry shampoo every night. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough so I doubled up and the results were the same. Stuck it out using this for a total of 3 months. I finally had to switch back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this would be great for people with lots of volume and frizzy curls but it was terrible for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many WEN products but it never worked for me I always felt my hair was too greasy after word.  I bought this and I love the smell it is perfect.  I find it makes my hair super soft but not flat.  I have very coarse thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it every day, I have learned to alternate this with a sulfate free shampoo. This seems to prevent that greasy feeling.  I do wonder if I did not shampoo in between if my hair would balance out but can&#x27;t get past 3 days in a row without shampoo.  It still is a great condition or shampoo conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked better than the regular WEN and did not have that menthol smell that all the WENs have, that was a huge perk!  I hate that Menthol smell.</li>
    <li> I swim in a chlorine pool several times a week so I wash my hair every other day. Wen products are terrific, it&#x27;s their marketing schemes that bother me. They want to put their customers on an automatic delivery schedule and they send you additional products that I don&#x27;t use. This is a great product and it keeps my hair hydrated and feeling soft. Fast delivery. I want to freedom to pick and choose my Wen products at cheaper pricing and Amazon gives me those chooses.</li>
    <li> I like the regular Wen Cleansing Conditioner but hate 613. It is so thick it doesn&#x27;t come out of the pump.</li>
    <li> Excellent! The best Wen shampoo I have tried. Non drying....easy to comb thru hair after showering. Smels good!</li>
    <li> This is a better product for my long, curlyish, very dry hair than the regular cleansing conditioners. I really like the softness &amp; shine.</li>
    <li> I have been using wen shampoos for a long time, and I really love all of them, and especially the Sixthirteen. I have long dark curly hair and I have to say it is not that great at helping frizz, but it definitely makes my hair feel soft and manageable. It&#x27;s great at detangling my curly frizzy hair. A bit pricer than his other formulas.</li>
    <li> I love this Wen, it smells awesome and I feel like it works better than the other types.&lt;br /&gt;I never use any type of conditioner now.</li>
    <li> It is a grear product and I am happy with the results. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other products at this time.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying any Wen product and I love it!!  I purchased a bottle for both myself and my niece.  I would definitely cut the amount of pumps they recommend in half to start off because I believe they recommend way too many.  My hair length is just above my shoulders and I only use 5 pumps to clean my hair.  The smell is very pleasant and this stuff makes my hair very soft. It has a cooling/tingly effect on my scalp.  I occasionally switch back to my Aveda shampoo just to give my hair a little more volume. I would use caution when trying to use this as a leave-in like they suggest on the bottle.  It can really weigh your hair down and look a little oily. I do not use any more than just the 5 pumps to get great results (I don&#x27;t repeat as a conditioner or as a leave-in).  I use this on my child who has very curly hair and it looks very shiny and the curls are very soft.  I have since purchased the pomegranate just to try something different.</li>
    <li> I started using Wen about 2 years ago as a friend let me try hers.  Sold from the very 1st time.  Love their conditioners.</li>
    <li> Not sure what I will do if I am no longer able to get this.  Great for hair (you only need a little) and smells great.  I love this stuff.  The spray is great too!</li>
    <li> I love Wen. I have used it for a long time.  This doesn&#x27;t feel like the other creamy, thick wen choices.  It smells like MALE COLOGNE.  I gave it to my son.</li>
    <li> I have been a user of WEN for the past several years.  I have to admit that I am a &amp;#34;product junkie&amp;#34; and have tried most everything on the market for my colored fine/thin hair, but I always come back to WEN.  I never even finish another product before I go back to it.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny.  My favorite cleanser/conditioners are the SixThirteen, Spring Gardenia and Cucumber Aloe.  I also use the Cucumber Aloe styling cream.  My hair always looks its best when using WEN.</li>
    <li> Good product I been using wen for 3 month and my hair is better every day. Healthy and growing</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much that I have now ordered a total of five bottles. My hair feels soft and clean after use. If I feel that my hair gets a build up, I will use a different shampoo once and then go back to this product. It has made a big difference in how my color stays brighter.</li>
    <li> Best Wen product for sensitive skin.  Will not weigh hair down which is what I was concerned about.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using 6/13.  How amazing!!  I live on the beach and have very fine hair.  6/13 leaves my hair soft, silky and clean.  I love the scent and my hair feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well.  It is a much better option than regular daily shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo for everyday use.  Leaves hair soft and shiny, not gummy or sticky.</li>
    <li> The product was great. But the bottle was open, the seal was broken. It wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap so to have the bottle open was not a nice thing to find.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely addicted to this product. I am a fitness swimmer and have never found a product that works so well. I have dry curly, sometimes frizzy hair, this conditioning cleanser leaves it silky yet still full of body. I love the ease of use, gets me out of the shower in record time, it is truly a one and done product replacing shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner and leave in conditioner/styling product. Product smells great, clean refreshing sent. The one and only drawback to this product is the cost. The cost. The cost.Yet I keep coming back.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really preserved my haircolor and doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy as the other Wen product. It says it&#x27;s for use on sensitive skin so that&#x27;s why I bought it. I will definitely but it again.</li>
    <li> Another reliable Wen Haircare product. Does a good job cleansing and conditioning like the other Wen cleansing conditioners but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the premium price above the regular Wen cleansing conditioners.</li>
    <li> My hair feels much better but it does not kill all frizz. I have thick coarse curly hair and it is much calmer but the humidity is gone in the air here as well.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT. VERY PRICEY</li>
    <li> I just used SIXTHIRTEEN (all caps--very YELLY) for the first time this AM. Like the other WEN products it requires a good amount of product. As I read the back of the bottle in the shower I thought, \\&quot;OH HELL NOS--I am not going to wet-scrub-rinse AND then repeat (using half as much product) AND THEN (seriously) &#x27;leave it on as long as possible&#x27;---AND (wait for it) &#x27;use a dime-size drop for a leave-in)&#x27;\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t know about you but I actually have to get my ass to work--so not a ton of beautifying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywhoo:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells vanilla-ish (as in for hours)&lt;br /&gt;-My color treated hair is soft--and looks nice today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Ton-o-Product is necessary if you follow the directions&lt;br /&gt;- 14 hour ritual (I KID)....</li>
    <li> This product is not that great.</li>
    <li> I did not want to like Chaz Dean products after being ripped off by a T.V. (Mislead would be a more political correct way of wording it :-0) ad. But these products cannot be beat!  The Six Thirteen has turned my hair into good hair.  I used to keep my hair long, so I could put the mess up and out of the way.  Now I keep my hair long because it is actually finally pretty!!!  I will not be caught without this product-ever.  It calms frizzy, puffy hair, and makes it actually silky! :-0</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft!  Love it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I seem to need less of it than I did when I used the sweet almond mint.  Smells great.  Just wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like it was really wen. I could be wrong but I have bought wen products before from the actual wen site, and this didn&#x27;t get my hair as clean. Might have been mixed with another conditioner :( smelled good though and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This is the best of the wen products and it&#x27;s so thick you don&#x27;t have to use as much as you of the others.</li>
    <li> i really like it.  love the scent.  hair is shiny and feels silky.  due to the price, i use it sparingly and not on a daily basis.  i feel it&#x27;s very pricey for the amount you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather new to Wen products and still exploring which formula I&#x27;ll like the best.  So far, I like the Almond better than the Lavender and I&#x27;ve ordered the Pomegranate to try next, which I think will be the best formula for my type of hair.  The way I use SixThirteen is to mix it in with whatever Wen cleanser I&#x27;m using during the final washing.  I work the Wen cleanser through my hair and rinse out according to instructions, then apply a second cleansing mixed with SixThirteen (about 3 or 4 pumps to every 6 to 8 pumps of cleanser), then leave in for the rest of the shower before rinsing out.  It really boosts the results of the cleanser and leaves my hair feeling luxurious afterwards, more so than if I don&#x27;t use it.  I know it&#x27;s designed to use as a cleanser by itself but I&#x27;m using it as an enhancer to the regular Wen cleansers and getting great results!</li>
    <li> Aided in my dry scalp...nothing else has worked...i used less than they recommended and was very happy here. Large size for the money too. I think my bottle will last two or three months which makes it cheaper than discount shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like the p;roduct but really don&#x27;t see much difference.  It is not as heavy as the shampoo cleanser product</li>
    <li> Least favorite Wen product.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my naturally curly hair and actually takes the curl out.  It also seems to dry my hair.  Also, the smell is odd, can&#x27;t really describe it, but not a good smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Wen shampoo,  and do not care for it so stopped using.  However,  I do love the Sixthirteen.  I am not a paid reviewer,  and I&#x27;m sure this may not work on all hair,  but it works for mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving four stars I instead of five because of the ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural. My natural hair type is 4b (zig zags). My hair is soft, moisturized, and very easy to comb through after using this product. I&#x27;m also experiencing little to no breakage after 4 weeks of using this product. This is a deep conditioner so I&#x27;ve only used it twice to accompany Wen Cleansing conditioner Sweet Almond and Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioners. I love these conditioners they work wonderfully for me!</li>
    <li> Love it...smells great. Follow directions when using cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells good, keeps my hair tangle and static free. My hair is thick, but very fine and does not make it look greasy. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean my hair too well, I end up using a little shampoo and using it as a conditioner instead. Putting a little in after for leave in conditioner kind of weighs my hair down  so I don&#x27;t do that anymore.</li>
    <li> Another Wen product that does just what it says. Great!</li>
    <li> I do like Wen and found mixing Tea tree with 613 has the best results but I do not advise anyone to purchase from sellers who are not authorized. From what I was told the only place that sells authentic Wen are Qvc,Chaz Dean.com or Sephora.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff... Can&#x27;t seem to keep enough of it on hand. I got my friends using it now.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting use to since it does not lather but works beautifully</li>
    <li> love this product, i have started ordering from the Wen sight, why is the packaging different?  anyways its a great product works great, does wonders for the hair....</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle--can&#x27;t believe how much better this works than shampoo--does incredible job of preserving highlights &amp; color, no more dry ends.  Received it really fast.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be very drying. At least that has been my experience after using it for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Like the way it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this this product. It helps control frizz and add shine.  I purchased this in April on Amazon for $28.00. Now it has gone up to $47?  It is good, but not THAT good.  I would give it 4 stars but for the new price it would have to instantly dry and style my hair to make it worth it.</li>
    <li> Left my hair greasy. Am a fan of the regular Wen.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle.  I had thin, lifeless hair that was breaking off by the handfuls from stress.  Six Thirteen saved my hair (and my sanity!  I will never go back to regular shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I love my regular Wen, so when I saw this I gave it a shot. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s alright. It works in a pinch, but I ordered my regular Pomegranate Wen because I just love it much more. If I run out before a new bottle can be ordered, I&#x27;d use the Six Thirteen, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> After several years of watching Chaz Dean&#x27;s infomercials and seeing numerous ads, I finally decided to try WEN.  SIXTHIRTEEN is the conditioning cleanser that provides the most repair for damaged, frizzy hair.  I use it as an add-in with the regular cleanser, as a leave-in conditioner for my ends, and as a weekly treatment.  I was so excited to find a salon-sized bottle as such a reasonable price compared to the price on the WEN website.  It should last quite a while since it&#x27;s used sparingly.  I&#x27;M A WEN GIRL NOW!</li>
    <li> I am 66 and with the wen sixthirteen my hair is actually sort, shiny and youthful looking. I love it. It can be a tiny bit heavy sometimes so I occassionally mix it with the wne fig cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. No other product is as good -- not even the other Wen offerings. My stylist said it has transformed my hair, which is color-treated and often heat styled, so can be a little coarse and dry. Don&#x27;t want to trade for anything else.</li>
    <li> The smell alone makes me love this product. Really doesn&#x27;t take much longer then the typical shampoo/conditioner routine. Makes my hair feel smooth and soft. Will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Got it for 27.00 was on sale...gonna give it a try...love his shampoo..now just waiting ...hate the waiting part....</li>
    <li> love this stuff so glad my niece told me about this stuff.</li>
    <li> My 2c/3a hair loves this!! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and smells devine :)  I have CLE and I always seemed to have a lupus rash on my neck at the hair line. Using the 613 has eliminated the rash and my scalp is happy once again. The entire line of Wen products can&#x27;t be any better than they already are. I&#x27;m a Wen girl for life!!!</li>
    <li> makes your hair manageable but did not stop the breakage which is unfortunate for something to be so expensive. i only use it on the shoulder down otherwise hair is too weighed down and dirty looking just after wash</li>
    <li> Made my hair flat and lifeless.</li>
    <li> Just started using Wen products but love them. My hair feels more healthy and shiny too.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite way to cleanse my hair since it came out. Like it much more than the original WEN products. I have fine hair, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I do shampoo very several days with gentle shampoo or I get buildup.  I then use as conditioner following,  I do mix with the normal almond mint Wen as well.  Just expensive</li>
    <li> love this i am a Wen girl for over ten years and this is just an improvement</li>
    <li> At last... I&#x27;ve found my Cleanser/Conditioner.</li>
    <li> For chemically treated hair, this is a must. Great scent, though a little more on the dude side. I can easily run a round brush through my long hair during drying with any snags. Very nourishing. I mix this into my weekly routine with other wen products to kick up the moisturizing. Probably not good for thin or fine hair as it could be too heavy. But great for my thick Asian/Caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> Smells fresh like Rosemary ad Vanilla Citrus, you can tell when you wash it out it is really hydrating the hair! I don&#x27;t know how people use this as a cleanser but I use it between washes and as a deep conditioner. I use about 2-3 pumps and not 16-24 as the directions suggest and I have long curly thick hair (so that was a bit odd). But overall I feel like this is a great hair treatment since I tend to bleach my hair often, hate trims, and love hair to feel hydrated and not dry!</li>
    <li> The best kept secret in hair conditioning!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t understand the difference between this and Wen. Works the same as Wen. Wen breaks my hair. Not sure if I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sweet Almond Mint and Lavendar Wen Cleansing Conditioners. I was not as happy with this product. It seemed much heavier in my hair and I was not fond of the smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleansing conditioner EVER!!</li>
    <li> This smells delicious and makes my hair so silky and soft!!! I am so in love with the WEN line and I use many of their products!!!</li>
    <li> Love WEN SIXTHIRTEEN... only use WEN products &amp; my hair thanks me :)</li>
    <li> My new have to have hair product.</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious break to my normal Wen.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice- but faint.  None of the scents linger as much as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;But my hair looks great!</li>
    <li> A colleague told me she used these products, and I bought this variety of Wen first to give it a try.  I honestly noticed a difference in my super-dry, over-processed hair the very first time I used it.  While using my blower dryer, it was actually difficult to tell when my hair was no longer wet because it didn&#x27;t feel dried-out, just dry.  I have used a number of different Wen fragrances, but I still prefer this one because it really doesn&#x27;t have any floral or fruity scent.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t over-cleanse your hair and remove the essential oils from your hair. It leaves my hair soft and manageable and it smells good too,  I wash my hair everyday so this is very important to me.</li>
    <li> I like how soft my hair is after using the 613, but unlike what others have said I am not fond of the smell.  The Vanilla Bean is very strong.  I&#x27;ve even mixed it with the pomegrante and it&#x27;s still overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for six months now on my very fine dry, damaged hair. It&#x27;s also wavy and tends towards frizz. I SO wanted to love this product and I&#x27;ve used it properly. It cleans very well, feels like silk in the shower, etc. I just wish that silkiness translated outside of the shower! No matter what additional pumps of leave-in, styling creme, serum, etc. I could not get my hair to be frizz-free or moisturized or silky enough for me to run my fingers through. I tried air-dry, blowing out with the Wen brushes, playing with varying application time of products, you name it.  Never had a greasy day, just never had a moisturized day! And this is the most moisturizing of the bunch. Finally, after working with Wen for months, I tried Living Proof for frizzy hair and it did in one shower what Wen claimed it would do for me. So bummed that Wen wasn&#x27;t the right one for me, happy I found a sulfate-free solution.</li>
    <li> I have tried Wen shampoos before with varying results.  I was excited to see this new more intense version and was hopeful it would be the holy grail product for my dry hair.  After following the directions exactly and giving it three tries I relegated it to a conditioner substitute.  Using this along left my hair lang and greasy.  Will not be rebuying.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  My hair is so soft and conditioned.  it does make me want to wash even twice a day, as it gets limp and looks dirty after a few hours.  For me-limp after many hours beats dry and destroyed hair all the time,  this really is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> arrived so quickly and I love the fragrance best of all the WEN products.  Also does a nice job.  There</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft it&#x27;s incredible.  My curls are a little more defined, not as much frizz as before.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN Sixthirteen for almost 3 years.  In 2011 I went through a very stressful, difficult time and (including but not limited to Menopause)...and my hair started falling out.  I have long, fine, color treated blonde hair.  I went to the Dr....bought the products he recommended...then went to the store, and salon and bought more and more products that claim \\&quot;to help hair loss\\&quot;...but they did nothing.  Then I took a chance on Sixthirteen (I&#x27;ve been using WEN, along with regular shampoos, for over 10 years)...and oh my gosh...my hair slowly started growing again.  If you have ever priced out Rogaine and the like, you won&#x27;t complain about the cost of this product.  I spent over $300 on products that didn&#x27;t work...and $80 on one that did...It may not be for everyone...but so far this week...I have recommended this to 2 friends.  Its amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great.  Leaves a bit of buildup on hair that can be taken care of with a clarifying  shampoo once a week.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! Makes my hair super soft. I do have to use a little shampoo a few times a week on my scalp as my hair is a little oily, but no other complaints. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down even though it is very fine.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love wen 613!!  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my course, curly hair!  Even using it on my daughters hair!  She asks for it she loves it so much!</li>
    <li> I first bought this on April 4, 2013, and since then I have bought three more bottles of it.  Each bottle lasts me about one month.  I first tried the Pomegranate Wen before this and compared to that, this one is much thicker.  Because it is thicker, I am able to use less of it.  I use about 7 pumps and I have very long hair.  I like to color my hair with red hair color and it does not usually last, but with using this product it lasts much longer than usual.  That saves me some money on having to color my hair  My hair is/was also previously damaged when my sister tried to bleach highlight it about six months ago.  It was so dry and awful.  It has helped with this problem.  It is not entirely back to how it was before, but there is a difference that I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to buy this product and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try it sooner.  The scent is great and my hair turns out  bouncy and shiny with just normal blow-drying.  I previously tried the Wen Fig and the Sweet Almond Cleansing Conditioners, but I will be splurging on the Wen  613 from now on.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course hair and a dry scalp. I have fought with breakage, dryness, frizziness and control. This is the only product I use in the shower on my hair. It smells amazing ! Lemon and rosemary. It doesnt have detergents in it, the same as the other Wen products, but this is a much more intense conditioner, but still cleanses. I have not had a dry flake, any frizz, and my hair os so soft after using ths. Friends I skype with who havent seen me in a cuple of years have been stunned and asked me what Ive done to get my hair looking so beautiful, and I tell them, I use Wen, sixthirteen, and a drop of serum after and thats it. Thats my whole hair regimen. My curls are softer, and if I want to flat iron it, the damage it used to do, just doesnt happen anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had this when I was a teenager !</li>
    <li> I had high expectations because I love the almond cleansing cream. This one made my hair seem &#x27;greasy&#x27; and flat! Hate that I spent so much on a product that didn&#x27;t work for my hair!</li>
    <li> I am currently in Kuwait in the hottest, driest place ever and ordered the Wen Six thirteen and it is saving my hair - I LOVE IT.  Will never get a different cleansing/conditioning product!!</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product from a blogger. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it; it&#x27;s now my holy grail. I have dry scalp and this has helped decrease the flakiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but I like 613. I have LOTS of fine textured hair and while it leaves a weightiness to my hair it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t look oily. I initially followed the recommended amount of pumps for my hair length (medium), but am experimenting with less (3 and only one wash) and it seems to work for my hair. I use to have extremely oily hair, but since I&#x27;ve turned 40 I&#x27;m noticing more dryness in my hair and skin. I purchased WEN to see if it would weigh down this new slightly wavy texture my normally stick straight hair is morphing in to. I like the scent, even the hubs can use it without smelling like a lady! Before he knew I used this he asked me why I smell like his shaving cream! I agree with him, it does have a slight menthol scent, but it is warmed by vanilla and patchouli.</li>
    <li> Love this. it really is an all in one. Works better than expected for my &amp;#34;African American&amp;#34; hair ;-)</li>
    <li> Almost finished a bottle, love it. Great for everyday use, my hair looks good. Will try other products by WEN.</li>
    <li> My hair looks weighted down and oily after using this product for a couple of washes. I only use it about once a week now. Can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and a bottle of Pantene.</li>
    <li> I have tried many of the WEN scents, and this one smells the best and works the best for me.</li>
    <li> Yes, it smells nice - but am I the only one who doesn&#x27;t wash their hair EVERY darned day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you leave a couple of days in between washing, then your hair will feel greasy, like when you were a teenager. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even have the other WEN products and that too leaves the same heavy, oily feel.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(this review left by Alan&#x27;s wife, user of said products)</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner after using my regular shampoo when I need that extra moisture. I love love the scent. I basically want to bathe in this conditioning shampoo because of its scent. I do not use this every day, more like once-twice a week because it&#x27;s so concentrated.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I mix a little with some of my other WEN products. It always does a great job.</li>
    <li> Wen is wonderful. My hair has never been better.</li>
    <li> Works well, just like all of the WEN products! Been a WEN girl for several years now and I am a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product.. I just feel like they are advertising it&#x27;s use incorrectly. You should not just use this, on its own, as a cleaning conditioner. It will not &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; your hair like the other types of Wen. So  you should use it as a moisture Booster instead of for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I&#x27;ve tried to use this stuff to only  clean my hair, I&#x27;m left with very oily, dirty looking hair, no matter how much I rinse and rinse. If I use it with my pomegranate Wen, my hair looks and feels wonderful. hope this helps!</li>
    <li> It feels good on your scalp, but then ir dries your hair terribly.</li>
    <li> This is ok, but not worth the money!  I find my hair breaking more than before since using this product.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. A perfect compliment to the Wen products. I  recommend it to all my friends and family.  My husband uses it add a shave lotion.  It is a really wenderful  product  :-)</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy (if you use it right) and makes your hair so soft and bouncy. I like that the smell is not overpowering too. Worth the price!</li>
    <li> My hair is much healthier.  My suggestion is just use this in place of shampoo.  Don&#x27;t forget to use 1 pump as a leave-in.</li>
    <li> I must have read a 100 reviews of both this product and the regular WEN line of conditioning shampoos, trying to decide whether this investment in a shampoo was worth the gamble.  It seemed that people either loved Chaz&#x27;s products (voluminous, shiny, healthy hair) OR hated them (weighed hair down, hair fall, not good for everyday use).  I use &amp; already have many high-end shampoos &amp; conditioners, but I am always looking for a better, healthier one.  I opted to try this product, and so far, I love it. My hair is bleach-blonde, thin, and damaged. This product has made it feel full &amp; soft, without ANY build-up or oiliness. You do need to follow the directions - it does take a lot of product &amp; you do need to work it in &amp; through with your fingers or wide-toothed comb. But I think it is so worth it. My hair is good for a solid two days without needing another washing. And it smells incredible. I NEVER thought I would be a person who didn&#x27;t need a separate conditioner &amp; tons of spray-in detangler, but here I am. If you are on the fence about it, I would definitely give this Chaz Dean product a try.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but love the original Wen.  Wen products  have made a major difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I use WEN products and this is the first time I tried the 6 13.  I got both the cleansing conditioner and the treatment mist and I can see visible results.  I do miss the wonderful fragrances of the other ones though.  This one smells like chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the best Wen product for my hair so far.  Within 2 days my curls were looking like real &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; and not a frizzy mess, even without any other product in my hair.  Lots of people are asking what I use in my hair and I can&#x27;t stop going on and on about Wen 613!</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for 3-4 days and can already tell a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
    <li> As a &amp;#34;Wen Girl&amp;#34; I have been using Wen hair products for years and love them all!! The difference with SIXTHIRTEEN is that it has other treatment ingredients vs the traditional cleansing products.  It has a wonderful scent, fresh and a bit flowerly and as with all Wen products is safe on any hair type or color and can be used everyday.  The only major difference is that you use cool water rather than warm water.. It is the only downside if you do your hair in the shower, but I wet my hair, add the SIXTHIRTEEN and then warm the water up until I am ready to rinse out, then just turn it down to cool.  I have actually found that the colder you can stand the water, the better your hair does with the SIXTHIRTEEN, I am sorry I don&#x27;t know the correct answer as to why, but all in all I of course, would recommend this product. Chaz Dean is the best!!</li>
    <li> The ultimate question: is this very expensive product worth the money? Because you have to use a minimum of eight pumps of this product, the bottle only lasts for about eight to twelve uses, which is about $3 to $4 per use. I have an oily scalp and a lot of fine, limp, colored and highlighted hair, and I usually shampoo and condition my hair every day. Normally, I use Living Proof Full shampoo and conditioner, but my hair still tends to be a bit dry, so I was looking for something with more conditioning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved about this product: the smell is fantastic and it leaves a very light scent in the hair. It is deeply conditioning and creates very good shine, probably the best shine of any product I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is definitely in better condition, softer, smoother, and with fewer split ends, than with any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I disliked about this product: I cannot use it every day because it makes my scalp too oily. It does NOT create any volume, so I have to omit the final step of using SIXTHIRTEEN as a leave-in conditioner and use Living Proof Full Thickening Cream for styling. Using a thickening cream seems to counteract the tendency of SIXTHIRTEEN to make my hair too limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Analysis: I like SIXTHIRTEEN as a one-a-week treatment much better than as a single solution for my hair. That makes it more practical, too.</li>
    <li> works, I like the smell. wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly. I like this product better than some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  it smells sooooo nice.  It does work best if you leave the product on your hair, then comb through, and let it on for another 2 minutes or so.  The lemon vanilla scent is very lovely.  i have thin, long, baby fine hair and this product works great.  i also break out easily around my hairline from many, many hair products, but not Wen.</li>
    <li> I tried the wen products with the initial 5 product kit (I don&#x27;t remember the exact name right now) I liked the cleaning conditioner from that set however the other products didn&#x27;t help my hair.  I tried the Wen Sixthirteen and WOW!  My hair is soft and hydrated and stays that way for a while.  I leave it in overnight as a deep conditioner. My hair was breaking, I had bald patches...my hair just went into shock from a bad perm.  I saw instant results.  I&#x27;m an African-American female and this is the first time I have ever experienced hair loss and I was desperate to try anything.  It is a little pricey however, I&#x27;ve spent a lot trying to keep the few locks that I have left</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and I never even think of using a different product. The smell is amazing and it keeps my hair healthy and strong.</li>
    <li> Delivery: The product arrived promptly&lt;br /&gt;Quality: This conditioning shampoo performs better than I expected. My hair feels soft and it is more manageable. I have curly hair and this product really helps when styling my hair - more so than any other shampoo/conditioner I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite wen product! Love the smell, it&#x27;s a very clean scent. Very moisturizing and gentle on the hair. Would recommend anyone to try it</li>
    <li> Completely different than any shampoo I have ever tried. My is feels thicker, softer, and I color much less. Great product.</li>
    <li> Who knew in order to get the desired results you have to read and follow the instructions.  I mean it&#x27;s shampoo!  I find myself to be a smart person, but the first 2 times I used this product I was really disappointed.  I was getting ready to throw in the towel when I read the instructions and follow them.  I get the best results during the second step I leave the product in as long as possible and use a little steam.  The final step I also leave a little more of the product on my hair than what&#x27;s recommended and then let my hair air dry to damp.  I learn pretty quickly not to let my hair completely air dry because it got frizzy and dry feeling.  I plan to keep using the product at the sale price since it&#x27;s only one product I have to buy, but at the regular price I would go back to my old product line.</li>
    <li> I have very thick heavy hair. I used this in between conditioning cleansing to style my hair. It allows me to restyle easily with shine and soft control.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen products in the past - Fig being my favorite. I have coarse, thick, naturally wavy hair which tends to be dry and frizzy. This product smells great and leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable. My hair is not quite chin length and I use about 12 pumps. I don&#x27;t count any more as I can feel when I have enough product in my hair. I like that this pump is bigger and has a larger diameter straw. I do wish that the product was in a different type of container - it is hard to pump when your hands are slippery and when the product is almost gone.  I generally put the product in a jar and scoop out what I need. I add water and shake to get out the last little bit. I have also cut the bottle open to get it all. It is not cheap but you don&#x27;t need a conditioner. The only other item I use is a thermal protector when I am drying and styling.</li>
    <li> smells good, better than other Wen products. Seems to help my hair. will see over time how my hair reacts.</li>
    <li> I have used the product two to three times a week and see no difference after using it than before.  When you spend the amount of money Wen costs, you expect to see some benefit or difference.  I see none</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this shampoo. I am a fan of WEN but this did nothing for me. Shipping from seller was fast.</li>
    <li> works great and smells awesome.  my scalp feels better when i use it and my hair dosent seem to fall out as much</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so I can&#x27;t say it has done some miraculous thing to my hair, however it smell like a dream.  My fiancé hates the smell of all of my natural cleansers and he won&#x27;t stay out of this one.  It is amazing how it doesn&#x27;t lather at all but you can come through your hair like silk with it is in and then it rinses completely clean.  I have used it when my hair was really dirty and it really made it squeaky clean.  I&#x27;m hooked, Love!</li>
    <li> this is silicone product; it will make your hair look good for about 3 weeks. I have find hair. It was good for one day. Silicone sticks to your hair and ultimately, your hair will not look better. I don&#x27;t even have the heart to GIVE it away. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product  went back to biologic I was losing too much hair after shampooing</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites along with the winter vanilla mint. Its not heavy and leaves my hair very soft but with volume. I have thin fine hair.  I love wen products.</li>
    <li> Of all of WEN cleansing conditioners 316 is my very favorite. It leaves your hair softer than all the others. It is a little thicker but my hair is easy to comb out in the shower with the 316 in. My hair also dries faster and leaves my hair so soft and full. I will never be without this. I use it about every 3 or 4 days....lasts longer this way.</li>
    <li> my hair is stressed and this product makes a difference on first contact.  after several treatments, my hair seems longer and definitely stronger.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping to remedy my dry frizzy hair.  The results were MEH, at best.  Maybe a little less dry than before.  After 2 weeks I noticed my hair had a sticky build up thing happening and had to wash with regular shampoo.  Side note I bought the cheaper versions of cleaning conditioners at Sally and Walgreens and they actually were better than the 613.  At least there was no build up.</li>
    <li> Best product for hair, just a little too expensive ...</li>
    <li> Love how this rich conditioning cleanser does not weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for a couple of months and my hair is a lot more manageable and the conditioner is really good and make my hair really soft....</li>
    <li> This is my first use of WEN.  After reading all of the reviews, including many negative reviews, I was very happy when I started using this product.  It smells great.  I use 4 to 5 pumps and my hair comes out so much better than it does with other shampoos and conditioners.  And no need to conditioners!  I am now a true believer.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all from Almond mint to Apple Spice to Fig, Spring Gardenia, Summer Mango and all the rest too. I ordered a 2oz bottle of the sixthirteen to get an idea of what it smelled like. It was fresh and clean, so I ordered the cleanser. The seller got it to me in only 2 days and I could not wait to try it out. It did not disappoint. It smelled so clean like vanilla and citrus. I love it. It makes my hair so soft and easy to manage whereas the rest of them gave me frizzies. I will continue to buy SixThirteen as I find it to be the best. Yes, it is more expensive, but I feel like my hair is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for dry weather. However I don&#x27;t recommend it for humid summer weather. It is a bit too heavy for that time of year. Also it would be a great once weekly product.</li>
    <li> I really like the way six thirteen works. The product is really rich and creamy and I love the way it smells. Works great with all the other WEN products too.</li>
    <li> I really like WEN shampoos and have been trying different kinds.  This one leaves my hair a little dry, and I need more after shampoo product.  Maybe I don&#x27;t really understand what it&#x27;s all about but it certainly cleans all existing product out of the hair.  My scalp feels clean and there isn&#x27;t a strong product smell afterwards.  Whether I reorder, I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
    <li> These are exceptional products. They make your dry hair really soft and help repair split ends. I highly recommend wen products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use anything else on my hair for results like this;  soft, smooth, shiny,  healthy looking hair despite my frequent coloring and blow drying. I love the smell of the product and my only gripe is that the product is very thick, which makes it difficult to pump once you&#x27;re getting low. I have to dilute it and end up slamming the open bottle against my palm to get it all.  Good to the last drop apparently!  My hair never feels over conditioned or heavy.  Never looks dull or greasy. Worth every cent in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Best wen product on the market. Besides the wen remoist hydrating conditioner Love this. It is extremely thick. Keep adding water to it and rinse well</li>
    <li> Love Wen but not the smell so I started to look elsewhere until I tried this and it smells and works better than all combined!! Who wants to smell like medicine hair all day!! This is the answer!</li>
    <li> I wish this was not so expensive, because it works MAGIC on my hair! I have very fine, wavy hair, but I have A LOT of it, and it is bleached platinum blonde.  I also play roller derby, so I am skating and sweating 3 to 4 nights a week, and can&#x27;t STAND not washing the sweat and helmet stink out of my hair. With other products, my already damaged hair was really suffering from the almost daily abuse, but not with WEN!  My hair is down to my waist, so it takes a ton of product, but if I went by their recommendations, I would be out in a week!  I leave my hair soaking wet and put 3 pumps on at a time in sections, and can usually saturate my hair with 10 to 15 pumps and that seems to be enough.  It smells REALLY good too!  Like all hair products, it wont work for everyone, but it works WONDERS for me.  I am going to try and find a cheaper distributor, but if not, I&#x27;ll just keep paying top dollar.lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of Wen since trying it several years ago, and have loved ALL the products I&#x27;ve used so far (including 613).  However, like most women, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  Most Wen products are a bit steep in price for me, forcing me to go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner from time to time (although I&#x27;d prefer not to).  I&#x27;d love to use Wen regularly for good (and would definitely do so if it was just a bit less expensive).  But, another reason I need to use products besides Wen for my hair, is because of my very dry scalp and dandruff (which Wen, unfortunately, does not help me with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is terribly dry, brittle, coarse and VERY frizzy.  I&#x27;m Caucasian and do have color treated hair to cover those grays.  My hair is also very wavy and hard to manage because it&#x27;s so out of control, brittle &amp; frizzy.  The back is especially thick &amp; coarse and I&#x27;m ALWAYS fighting with frizz &amp; fly-aways.  On top of dying my hair to try and hide my gray, it&#x27;s also damaged from &amp;#34;fighting&amp;#34; with it so much (using a flat iron or other heat device to try and maintain nice, smooth looking straight hair - which can be quite time consuming for me since it&#x27;s so coarse, frizzy and unmanageable).  Because of the thickness &amp; how &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; my hair can be, I have to put it into several sections to straigten it (and since it&#x27;s very difficult to straighten, I aso usually need to go over the same section of hair several times with a flat iron to get it from wavy/frizzy to CLOSE to straight - with minimum fly-aways &amp; frizz).  It&#x27;s a long, time-consuming project for me, but I love the results in the end when I DO get them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen definitely makes my hair softer, easier to comb and a bit more manageable.  As I said, the price is really the main reason I DON&#x27;T use it on a regular basis.  It IS a great product, but I personally think it&#x27;s too expensive (at least for my budget).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, although I&#x27;ve tried several different types of Wen products, I&#x27;ve yet to find one that helps me with my dry scalp &amp; dandruff.  Along with my annoying frizzy hair that&#x27;s very difficult to straighten and get under control, I also suffer from an extremely dry scalp and dandruff.  I&#x27;ve yet to come across a Wen product that assists with these issues, so I still DO need to use a dandruff shampoo a few times a week or my hair&#x27;s covered with flakes.  I&#x27;ve used every popular dandruff &amp; dry scalp shampoo out there and still haven&#x27;t found one that REALLY works on my tough dandruff.  I also not always only find dandruff in my hair.  A lot of the time, I end up seeing &amp;#34;dry scalp flakes&amp;#34; left behind - or &amp;#34;debris&amp;#34; (or whatever you&#x27;d like to call it) that comes from my dry, itchy scalp and ends up just laying near the roots in my hair.  I use a leave-in dry scalp treatment sometimes to help me with this and it DOES help to relieve some of the dry scalp symptoms and also makes it less itchy.  But it doesn&#x27;t stop preventing my dry scalp from &amp;#34;flaking&amp;#34; into my hair (along with the dandruff).  Usually, the best thing I can do is comb my hair while it&#x27;s wet (as that&#x27;s when the dry scalp flakes are extremely noticeable).  I use a small comb and comb near the scalp in very small sections (usually just pulling the comb an inch down from the scalp), so the comb kind of &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; the dry scalp flakes that have ended up in my hair - then I rinse the comb and do it again until I get as much of it out that I can.  If Wen came out with a dry scalp/dandruff formula, I&#x27;d definitely try it!  But, in the meantime, I will certainly continue to use their products when I can afford it as it makes my hair much softer and healthy looking than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of frizz and thick, coarse, brittle dry hair usually makes it nearly impossible for me to comb it when it&#x27;s wet, especially in the back and near the ends.  I always need to use a leave-in conditioner as my hair is just so dry.  Even deep conditioning treatments have not made my hair as nice as Wen has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m not sure about, however, is the fact that it states on the bottle that &#x27;the more you use and longer you leave it in your hair, the better it works.&#x27;  I usually use about 3-5 pumps on my shoulder length hair.  If I&#x27;m running low, I&#x27;ll use one pump and apply it all over, add water, then use another two pumps on the back of my hair, focusing on the ends.  If I have enough of the product, I&#x27;ll use about 5 pumps, (one pump on each side, two pumps in the back where my hair is thickest and most brittle &amp; dry and then an additional pump focusing on my split, dry ends).  Most of the over-the-counter conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past state to leave it in anywhere from 3-10 minutes before rinsing (both regular conditioner and deep conditioners).  I do leave Wen in for as long as I can - I don&#x27;t really time it.  But it&#x27;s usually the first thing I do as soon as I get in the shower - then, as it remains in my hair, I do everything else such as shave, etc - then I&#x27;ll rinse my hair right before I get out of the shower so the product does stay in my hair at least the entire time I&#x27;m showering on average.  So far I haven&#x27;t really noticed much a different when it comes to the length of time I leave it in before rinsing, but I personally leave it in approximately 5-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to try using a significant different amount of the product, however, so I don&#x27;t know if using something such as 10-15 pumps actually WOULD make a huge difference than the usual 3-5 pumps that I generally use.  Because of the price, I prefer to make the product last me as long as I can.  &amp;#34;The more you use and the longer you leave it in&amp;#34; DOES sound like a &#x27;sales tactic&#x27; for the company so the customer will use more &amp; more, then run out of the product faster and end up buying more.  However, I CANNOT say that this IS, in fact, true.  As I said, I never tried using a very large amount or a significantly different amount than I usually use, so I don&#x27;t know if doubling the amount I normally use, for example, actually WOULD make a noticeable or significant difference in my hair.  It actually may be something I just might have to try though just out of curiousity.  Perhaps it does depend on the person as well (and the hair type).  Like I said, whether I leave it in for 3-5 min or 10-15 min, or longer, it seems to work just as well (so I AM a bit skeptic when it comes to using more of the product for better results).  But, again, I&#x27;ve never tried this so I can&#x27;t say one way or the other whether that works for my hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I HIGHLY recommend to anyone who is considering trying Wen for the first time (no matter what kind) is to ADD WATER with the product.  Do NOT expect &amp;#34;bubbly suds&amp;#34; like you receive with &amp;#34;regular shampoo.&amp;#34;  You WON&#x27;T get that no matter what - and that&#x27;s okay, you&#x27;re not supposed to!  But you SHOULD add enough water until you at least get somewhat of a lather and can distribute the product thoroughly throughout your hair.  After I apply it, I&#x27;ll sometimes stick my head quickly under the shower and then the water will help distribute the product nicely through my hair.  Also, I&#x27;ll sometimes put a pump or two of the product in my hand and, before applying it to my hair, I&#x27;ll add a splash of water in my hand, then rub my hands together so the product is on both of them.  Then I basically apply it to my hair with both hands kind of like how you apply mousse or hair gel.  I just take both hands and start near my scalp and rub them both down the sides and back of my hair, down to the ends.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll add another small pump to the back and, again, more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used Wen, it does NOT &#x27;feel&#x27; like a regular shampoo (because it isn&#x27;t!)  It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, but I guess the texture is similar to a lotion as opposed to a shampoo.  It&#x27;s NOT &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; at all.  You don&#x27;t use your fingers to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; the shampoo throughout your hair (and you won&#x27;t have a handful of &amp;#34;bubbly suds&amp;#34; to rinse off after you shampoo).  It&#x27;s best to apply Wen in sections, esp if your hair is long and/or thick.  Start with one section and just put a pump of the product into the palm of your hand, then apply it to that section of your hair.  Start near the scalp and &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; or apply the product with your hands by bringing it down towards the ends.  Add a splash of water beforehand or, add water when you&#x27;re halfway down your hair applying the product - then just continue to apply it from the middle down to the ends.  It really won&#x27;t look or feel like regular shampoo but, again, it&#x27;s not supposed to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s probably important for me to add that I DO have an underactive thyroid and, like many people, nearly all of my &amp;#34;hair problems&amp;#34; started when I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  Before that, my hair was never this stubborn, brittle, damaged, dry, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has ANY recommendations for me as far as my extremely bad dandruff and dry scalp and dry scalp flakes, I&#x27;d truly appreciate it!  If by some chance Wen DOES make a product for people with a dry scalp or dandruff and I somehow missed out on this info, PLEASE let me know!  Otherwise, if you happen to suffer from the same issues and found something that works well, I&#x27;d really appreciate your recommendation.  Thanks!or a significantly different amount than I usually use, so I don&#x27;t know if doubling the amount I normally use, for example, actually WOULD make a noticeable or significant difference in my hair.

Sometimes I&#x27;ll add another small pump to the back and, again, more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used Wen, it does NOT &#x27;feel&#x27; like a regular shampoo (because it isn&#x27;t!)  It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, but I guess the texture is similar to a lotion as opposed to a shampoo.  It&#x27;s NOT &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; at all.  You don&#x27;t use your fingers to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; the shampoo throughout your hair (and you won&#x27;t have a handful of &amp;#34;bubbly suds&amp;#34; to rinse off after you shampoo).  It&#x27;s best to apply Wen in sections, esp if your hair is long and/or thick.  Start with one section and just put a pump of the product into the palm of your hand, then apply it to that section of your hair.  Start near the scalp and &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; or apply the product with your hands by bringing it down towards the ends.  Add a splash of water beforehand or, add water when you&#x27;re halfway down your hair applying the product - then just continue to apply it from the middle down to the ends.  It really won&#x27;t look or feel like regular shampoo but, again, it&#x27;s not supposed to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s probably important for me to add that I DO have an underactive thyroid and, like many people, nearly all of my &amp;#34;hair problems&amp;#34; started when I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism.  Before that, my hair was never this stubborn, brittle, damaged, dry, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has ANY recommendations for me as far as my extremely bad dandruff and dry scalp and dry scalp flakes, I&#x27;d truly appreciate it!  If by some chance Wen DOES make a product for people with a dry scalp or dandruff and I somehow missed out on this info, PLEASE let me know!  Otherwise, if you happen to suffer from the same issues and found something that works well, I&#x27;d really appreciate your recommendation.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found to moisturize my thick, kinky 4b hair. If I go too long between wash days, I have too definitely work harder to clean my scalp with this.</li>
    <li> This smells nice but after repeated use it kinda left my hair feeling heavy. Would only use once or twice a week</li>
    <li> I love Wen products and I switched to this one because in the winter the other Wen cleansing conditioners don&#x27;t seem to be enough to fight the dry air.  This was a life saver!  My hair is soft and smells great!  Honestly the best test with Wen is to use it for a couple weeks and then try to use normal shampoo and conditioner.  I ran out once and had to wait a few days to get a new bottle and omg my hair felt like straw!  I can never use normal shampoo/conditioner again!  Tip for those of you who feel their hair is too greasy when using Wen, I use literally a nickel size amount of shampoo on the top of my head/roots to add volume and to keep my color fresh (use John Frieda blonde or brunette color enhancing-depending on my current hair color) and then I use the Wen after it and it works great!  LOVE LOVE LOVE WEN!</li>
    <li> this price is REALLY REALLY GOOD, I was scared it was going to be a fake or something because this  conditioner is way more expensive everywhere els. However I am SO glad to report that this is the real deal! It is amazing, you dont need to use nearly as much as you do with the other wen cleansers, I used wayy too much my first go. Also my hair has never felt better ever in my life. It was SO soft I couldnt keep my hands out of my hair and I made everyone feel my hair as well. It was amazing. I didnt think Wen could get much better... I was clearly wrong! It is higher in protein so I will only use it once a week but It is so worth it and I will totally repurchase again and again! The ingredients are all top notch aswell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Scent- the most amazing fresh lemon cake type of scent. It isnt a fake smelling scent to me it is a very fresh natural scent. I was worried when reading other reviews that I was going to not like it but I absolutely LOVE it, almost as much as I love the wen kids apple scent if not more.  Unfortunately for me it dosent really linger in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*cleansing ability- This cleans my hair very well, my scalp feels very clean and soft and my hair smells very good. No hair styling products or build up is left on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*conditioning ability- ohh my God, hands down the best conditioner thats ever been in my hair and ive used EVERYTHING. This completely changed what I thought was possibly for a hair care product.  My hair is so so  soft and tangle free. My hair before wen and without wen is very very course and tangles so easy and is very dry. my hair feels like silk when I use these products and people would have no idea what its like with shampoo.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the fig or other products.  It was ok not great.  The others are better.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using Wen products for several years and have fine hair and really like all of the ones I have used, but this one especially makes my hair full and soft and other people notice my hair.</li>
    <li> I am only a Wen user now, going on a year.  This is like silk to your hair.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  The smell is divine.  I use it every few days, and use my regular Lavender Wen daily.</li>
    <li> I have very thin fine hair and it gives me softness with body. My only complaint is my hair seems a little oily before it normally does, but I love it any way. I even use it as face wash.</li>
    <li> I already love Wen so decided to give this formulation a try.  My hair was super soft and shiny BUT didn&#x27;t stay clean long enough. With the original formula, I can go 3 days between washes.  With this, I had to wash my hair everyday.  If you&#x27;ve got super dry damaged hair, this could be a very good choice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but the scent of Six Thirteen is amazing! I love it. I have been using Wen for a little more than a year now (mostly the almond mint) but I switched up and started using this a while back and I love it. The texture is the same but I love how it makes my hair smell.</li>
    <li> I Love It! It Really Conditions Deeply From Roots To Ends. It Will Remain A Staple In My WEN Collection. Thank You Chaz Dean For Creating Sixthirteen I Love It And You!</li>
    <li> I love Wen products. The SIXTHIRTEEN works great in my hair. I have long, blonde hair that is very fine and this leaves it smooth and silky.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it&#x27;s so expensive. I usually buy some cleansing conditioner at the store (herbal essence or pantene) and use it with this so I can make it last longer.</li>
    <li> Works great on fine hair! Just ordered a second!</li>
    <li> Great price compared to QVC or other sites, and I use 1 full pump a day on my medium lengh naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s lasted 2 months.  It helps protect and I love the feel and smell.</li>
    <li> The best WEN yet!!  The same luxurious cleaning and conditioning as other WEN but with a more subtle fragrance.  Also free of nuts and wheat, which makes it great for people with allergies.  I have used WEN for years and found that most formulas have a very strong fragrance and cause a rash.  I was skeptical when I saw this formula but have been happy with the results.  I have long, naturally curly, color treated hair and it works better than any shampoo/conditioner or combo I have tried.  I live in a very dry climate (CO) and our water is very hard.  One note:  I have only used the recommended amount one or two times.  You can use less; you&#x27;ll need to experiment to find the right amount for your hair.  Too much can cause hair to feel greasy, even if hair super dry.  Remember, the company does want to sell their product, and will be happy if you use large amounts!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo/conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have used other Wen products, but this is by far my favorite.  I love the scent and the moisturizing it gives my hair.  This is a cleansing treatment and will not suds up like normal shampoo.  You still have to use alot and rub it into hair and scalp just like you would a sudsing shampoo.  I wet hair very well prior to applying product then add a little more water after rubbing in and through hair and do it again.  RINSE WELL then reapply a couple more pumps and do the same.  Squeeze hair out and apply a dime size amount as a leave in treatment.  It is pricey, but takes the place of separate conditioner and leave in conditioner.  I have fine hair with dry, bleached ends and oily roots, but have no problem with oily looking hair with this product as some others have stated.  You have to scrub with it and then rinse.</li>
    <li> I color my hair regularly and this is the only shampoo that keeps not from being dried out and frizzy. I have tried other shampoos and always return to this one. It&#x27;s the best shampoo I have found yet.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly on my fine graying hair, bringing back the manageability and shine that&#x27;s been missing for a long time.  I&#x27;ve used Wen products before, but this one is better than the others for my hair.  I will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m ordering more today while it&#x27;s still on sale.  pwb</li>
    <li> I not only enjoy and love the feel of my hair but the shine and control I have now is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;No more knots in the morning!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of Six Thirteen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faye</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen products before, Sixthirteen is my favorite.  I have thin hair with a lot of body.  Sixthirteen does not weigh my hair down at all.  Once a week I&#x27;ll use a regular shampoo and conditioner to change up my hair routine.  I DO NOT use 8 pumps to wash my hair.  I feel like it&#x27;s excess and wasteful.  I use approx 3-5 pumps.. even that feels a little too much but I use a lot of hair product (hairspray) and want to make sure I get it clean.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The product gave my hair shine and manageability! I would definately purchase this product again!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have shoulder length fine hair that dries out easy.  I find that 1 1/2 pumps is plenty.  I keep working it a little during my shower.  Never feels weighed down and I finally have shiney hair again.</li>
    <li> Great price, great arrival time, &amp; great product! I would highly recommend this product &amp; the company that sells it!</li>
    <li> Love the Wen products and this one did not disappoint.  I think it has a better smell than the previous Wen products I have used.  It smells clean but not minty.  I will be ordering this again.  I have color treated hair and this makes my hair way smoother and more manageable.  Wen has fixed my frizzy hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have never bought this for myself, but have used it and it works much like the WEN cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using Oribe products religiously, as it has completely transformed my life into having a great hair day every single day. A friend mentioned to me that I should give 613 a try for my ombré over-processing. I have only used it once but I can tell I love it. I feel my hair is on-par with my holy grail Oribe and think it might make my hair happier with more conditioning. I plan to use this once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. ....simply amazing. ....need i say more.....AMAZING! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love. I was very skeptical but after using for several weeks I will not switch back to regular shampoo and conditioner. Also Wen is not tested on animals which is a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my hair soft. I only wash my hair once a week, but for my hair it is beter than other shampoos I have tried</li>
    <li> Love the cleanser/conditioner.  Makes my hair manageable and not frizzy in the humidity.</li>
    <li> I use several of Chaz Dean&#x27;s hair products and this one is probably the best.  I have blonde, baby fine hair and it gives my hair life and manageability - I love it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the good stuff is so much more expensive.  I have purchased Wen Fig for years and even tried Hair One (knock-off from Sally Beauty and not as good) but this one is the real deal.  So far it works very well and the smell is much better then the original Wen.  I hate to go back to the original but cheaper Wen.</li>
    <li> Great, my hair is growing back.</li>
    <li> treats your hair great.  Smells like old Hollywood, funky 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s sort of smell.  But your hair is happy.</li>
    <li> This product is very rich and creamy.  It made my hair very soft and has a wonderful scent.  It seemed to distribute easier through my hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Have been using regular wen for over a year.  Tried them all and happened to stumble across 6-13 the other day and ordered it. After one use I got back online and ordered a second bottle. In love! Smells great and my superfine hair isn&#x27;t weighed down in the least. My favorite wen product to date and I have tried them ALL. if price stays this low ill be a loyal customer :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive and if your hair is of any length you need a lot of it each time. It is a very, very expensive shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works amazingly - it&#x27;s flat out the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish I could afford to keep buying this stuff. Will save it for special occasions. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I love this!! I highly recommend this,I have thick dry out hair. After each wash my hair get more manageable and soft.</li>
    <li> If you want that &amp;#34;oh my god&amp;#34; feeling just rub  some of this six thirteen into your hair and scalp, rinse in cool water and feel for yourself. It is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I really loved the original Wen but when I learned that Wen now has a new improved cleanser with more moisture I was excited but for the price I was skeptical about spending so much money and not being sure of the outcome. I love it! Yes it more moisturizing, which I need with very curly hair and the dry long winter this year. It is pricey, don&#x27;t know why but I do love it and will stay with it. I only wash my hair twice a week and it&#x27;s just me so it will last longer and buy a bigger bottle next time. It cost but too much but my hair is baby soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> My favorite smelling WEN of all.  It&#x27;s super thick and luxurious on your hair and does that wonderful WEN magic!</li>
    <li> I love all of the wen products, but the six thirteen is by far the best. It is literally a miracle in a bottle. It is alot more moisturizing than the regular Wen cleansing conditioners (which I absolutely love) and it makes my hair so silky soft and manageable. It smells delicious, and best of all it is a very convenient way to get a great deep conditioning right in the shower.  It is so rich and creamy that I usually add it to my regular WEN cleansing conditioners (two to three pumps and my hair is waist length) a little goes a long way with this luxurious product I only need to use it once or twice a week. I haven&#x27;t used it alone yet. I bet it would be amazing for super damaged hair. A little about my hair, very long, thick, wavy,frizzy, and color treated. I would highly reccommend this product to everyone, especially for women who have tried everything to help repair their hair. This product is just amazing! Way to go, Chaz...!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about a year now and I am now a total Wen girl! Wouldn&#x27;t want to use anything else. I honestly thought Wen couldn&#x27;t get any better. BUT IT DID! This product is amazing. It smells great, very light weight, and I feel its more hydrating then the original Wen cleansing conditioner. When this product is used correctly its just a miracle in a bottle. My hair is more healthy then it has ever been and grew so fast! I have wavy long hair, but its on the thinner side which means I have some frizz issues. This product eliminates that, and I also use it as a leave in conditioner. Its truly a all in one product that every girl must have! My boyfriend also likes it, although he has super short hair it still smells good so guys feel free and try this too! ha!</li>
    <li> I absolutely expected this product to be mostly hype - figured it would be pretty good, but didn&#x27;t expect a real change.  But my hair is fuller and softer than ever.  It normally tends to be dry and get frizzy, but it stays soft all day now.  I can tell that it&#x27;s really growing too and there is hardly any breakage in the shower unlike the normal amount usually completely covering the drain.  I honestly never thought it would be so different - and expected it might work for a day or two because is was something new, but then wouldn&#x27;t make much difference, but it really just keeps getting better and the improvement of my hair is evident.  My hair feels so much stronger now too.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a WEN girl and have seen the difference in my hair. This was just the icing on the cake and now I am totally delighted. Excellent price on this too. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN for 2 years and am able to grow my hair past my shoulder for the first time since I was a kid.  6/13 is great - I use it 4-5 times a week and leave it on my hair while I shave/wash and rinse out.  In the winter I put about a dime size on my hair and then blow dry.  I even travel/camp and bought some for my twins curly hair.  I can actually comb their little curls without tears ! :)</li>
    <li> It smells good and it distributes nicely through the hair BUT it makes my hair very frizzy. As soon as this is gone I am going back to sweet almond mint ... if i can make it till then.</li>
    <li> I am African American. I first started using the WEN Fig in December of 2012, and was very happy with the results.  My hair became much softer and easier to style.  This past month, I decided to try the 6-13.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! What a difference.  I started to use the 6-13 on my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is now much shinier, softer, and is growing.  The dandruff is gone!.  The 6-13 smell is wonderful and the cleanser is thick and moisturizing.  I highly recommend for thicker, coarser hair.  Now I realize how much damage the sulfate shampoos do to the hair.  I will not ever use regular shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Well, lets face it.  This is Wen with the entire kitchen sink thrown in.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if I am a good example at this point though because I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for a while now and my hair is in great shape.  So for me 613 is so over-the-top rich it&#x27;s like trying to eat cheesecake when you are already stuffed to the hilt.  We all know THAT feeling right?  So I wonder if I&#x27;m even getting the fullest benefit of this product because I question how much of it is even penetrating the hair shaft at all - it&#x27;s THAT creamy deluxe.  Certainly in a class all it&#x27;s own.  So, if over-the-top richness is your thing and you don&#x27;t mind the possibility of the product being so thick and luxurious that you might be rinsing a lot of it away, then, as far as what Chaz Dean offers right now, this is certainly all that!  Otherwise, I recommend that you might also want to consider using the Green Tea/Gardenia if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is my favorite scent and it leaves my hair really soft.  I have been using wen for over one year now and I don&#x27;t have any split ends so this is great if you want to keep your hair healthy as it grows out.  I will always be a wen girl.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to shampoo. It does NOT take any longer to use than regular shampoo. Don&#x27;t believe it when you read that you need 10 minutes of massaging it into your scalp or whatever... that&#x27;s just nuts! It rinses just as well as regular shampoo. The scent is the best and it keeps your hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many months and my hair has grown longer than it ever has in my life! It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioner for about 6 years and have always been very happy with the results.  I tried the Wen Sixthirteen on a whim and OMG!  I love it even more than the original Wen products.  I will NEVER go back to regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Thank you Chaz Dean!!!</li>
    <li> WEN SIXTHIRTEEN smells lovely to me, it has given my fine, limp hair more thickness and body after about 6+ months using it  (noticed by hairdresser), and I like that it suds a little more than other WEN cleansing products I&#x27;ve enjoyed trying - which are many.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will likely keep ordering WEN SIXTHIRTEEN.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very conditioning, there&#x27;s no doubt about that. But using it everyday as both a cleaner &amp; conditioner together? It does not work for me. Using it to cleanse the scalp, it&#x27;s just got too much oil in it. I have long hair, colored, layered on the sides and a few bangs. Using this product after a few times made my hair lie too flat on top. It also made my scalp itch a little. Its just too much of a conditioner and not enough of a cleanser. I do not have an excessively oily scalp either. I&#x27;d rather use a good shampoo like Phytodensium or another good professional cleansing shampoo, then use this product as a conditioner from about ear level down to the ends of the hair, it works well for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the WEN products. However, I thought I&#x27;d like this more than I did. Although the thickness of this Six-Thirteen was too thick and required a lot to work into my hair. It had a pleasant vanilla-y kinda medicinal smell. Which I happen to like. But I think I&#x27;d rather stick to the other versions of WEN</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for a couple of years and 613 is even better than the original wen.  Can&#x27;t believe it</li>
    <li> I tried this new Wen &amp; I was so disappointed! My hair felt waxy &amp; the smell. That smell-medicinal &amp; quite unappealing. Plus, my hair was just as frizzy as before I tried this product. Maybe in the fall I will try again but for now, I will keep using  Organix-its working. I&#x27;ve less frizz &amp; my hair feels smooth &amp; smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was  skeptical when I ordered, but was having trouble with my scalp with most products. After about 2 months my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy any more. My hair is much more manageable and feels much thicker. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes a difference in the texture of your hair and a bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on my dry thin hair</li>
    <li> This seems to leave my hair looking greasy. I have shampooed 4 different times and get the same resault every time. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is the first actual Wen product I have used. I have in the past used Ren and Hair One. That said - 613 is very nice, but I don&#x27;t see/feel any difference between using it and the cheapo stuff. It smells good, and is very silky and nice to put in, but after my hair dries it&#x27;s pretty much exactly like it is with the cheaper products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product just twice now and I already see a difference.  Here are a couple of things you might want to know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Read the directions, you need to apply the product to wet hair, then comb thru and clip up.  I keep a plastic clip in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) You may not need to use as much product as they recommend.  I have long hair although not particularly thick. I put in 4 pumps, work thru --then 4 pumps more.  For a total of 8 pumps.  I would say try four pumps at a time and then comb thru after 8 and see if you need more.&lt;br /&gt;3) Yes, its expensive but you are only purchasing one product instead of both a shampoo and conditioner.  I have used many many salon quality products (Matrix Biolage, Sleek, Paul Mitchell, Bed Head) and none of them give me the results that this has in just two uses.&lt;br /&gt;4) Some people like the smell, some don&#x27;t.  What I will tell you is this...the smell (whether you like it or not) is VERY strong in the bottle.  But once it&#x27;s in your hair, it&#x27;s very light.  I don&#x27;t especially love the smell in the bottle (a bit too strong and sweet) but on my hair it&#x27;s HEAVENLY.  Even my man thinks so :)&lt;br /&gt;5) DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THE CHAZ DEAN WEBSITE!!! Last I checked the only option they have is a auto charging auto sending option and those are almost never good in my opionion.&lt;br /&gt;6) I generally wash and let my hair air dry with a little product (in this case -- a dime size amount of this cleansing treatment per the directions).  This particular product makes my hair a little big.  You know what I mean.  So I have to plan to do a quick flat iron (literally five minutes) after my hair dries.  It is much easier to flat iron your hair using this cleanser because its super smooth.  The hair just glides thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and feels like a deep conditioner.  I&#x27;ll definitey be buying more, but from QVC where it is half the price!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST for African American girls with extremely dry course hair trying to grow it long.  LOVE it.  Worth the steep price.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for several years now.  (Usually Fig.)  I have always wanted to try SixThirteen but due to the price, I have not tried it until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  By far the best Wen I have ever used!  Leaves hair feeling very soft, manageable, and smelling awesome.  (Seriously, this is the best smelling Wen ever!)  I am not a fan of the smell of any other regular Wen shampoo (except for his seasonal scents.)  However, this one is great!  It smells almost like clean laundry (fabric softener).  It has a light lemon/vanilla scent that is really hard to explain except to say it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Wen is very pricey and this is no different!  It is by far the most expensive Wen that is offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  I will continue to use and treasure Sixthirteen and will occasionally buy more.  However, due to the price this will not be used everytime I have to shampoo my hair.  I just can&#x27;t afford to use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Wen product.  It is, to me, the most moisturizing of all the rest.  I love the scents of the regular ones, but the formula for this one is much richer.</li>
    <li> This wen is much thicker and moisturizing than the others, yet still cleans hair very well and does not weigh it down or make it greasy like other wen formulas I have tried did. It smells so good too, again much better than the cough medicine smell the other formulas seem to have. The scent on the bottle says lemon grass and vanilla bean and its heavenly. I will definitely keep this as my new cowash.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have wasted at least a few hours of my lifetime watching Wen infomercials on television. Maybe I wanted to believe Alyssa Milano since I was a huge &amp;#34;Who&#x27;s the Boss&amp;#34; fan as a preteen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Aveda and my hair was kind of dry after my 2nd pregnancy. I like the more natural products, so I chose the Six Thirteen formula and it seemed to be the right fit for my hair type....thick, somewhat dry and colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t make it feel much better. It feels &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; when I use it. It smells ok. I like to wash my hair every other day and this makes it too greasy if I wear straight styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using it when I wear my hair curly. That seems to make my curls really pretty with the coating part. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this formula again.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN fig for several years now and never thought I would find anything better.  I tried WEN Sixthirteen and was amazed.  Better smell than the fig and still worked wonderfully for my thick, curly hair.  I could still smell the shampoo in my hair at the end of the next day which was awesome b/c to cut down on dryness and frizziness I can only wash my hair every other day.</li>
    <li> The pump does not work.  I have had to squeeze the product out of the bottle and now all of the print on the bottle is coming off.  Very poor packaging and it makes me wonder if the actual product is truly a Wen product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! This product Is nothing like the origanl Wen cleanser, the origanal Is A much better product. This left my hair knotted and weighed down.</li>
</ol>
