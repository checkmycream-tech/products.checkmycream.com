      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a fair price too.</li>
      <li>Good ingredients.</li>
      <li>not greasy at all, great hold and smells nice.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for my pixie cut!</li>
      <li>Not like the discontinued favorite !</li>
      <li>Pretty good !</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best hair molding gel ever.</li>
      <li>I feel really good about the ingredients, which is the most important thing to me.</li>
      <li>Have used orange peel for years, love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I find myself using By Vilain Gold Digger more often than this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is perfect, though it doesn&#x27;t hold throughout the day and must be re-applied several times.</li>
      <li>For longer hairs that require more wax, I&#x27;d suggest using hair spray at the end.</li>
      <li>My husband and I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and it holds very well.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give off the shine like most waxes do</li>
      <li>Love this molding cream.</li>
      <li>Okay product.</li>
      <li>But the next best thing!</li>
      <li>First of all, I have been using another product, Graham Webb Head Games Messed up Madness Molding Creme 4 Oz, which is excellent, its creamy and leaves my hair feeling pliable, not hard...</li>
      <li>Good product if you&#x27;re looking for a light cream though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up loving Woody&#x27;s Grooming Clay for a stronger hold and natural feel.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, you don&#x27;t need</li>
      <li>Yet it also washes out easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to sculpt hair.</li>
      <li>Overall great product.</li>
      <li>Smells good and leaves hair feeling pretty light and natural.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty strong by itself.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff and it smells good too!</li>
      <li>I have always liked this product and will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>Easy to control depending on how much you apply.</li>
      <li>but this was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I thought I would give this a shot since the price was right..</li>
      <li>The price is right from this seller.</li>
      <li>The end result is a non-greasy, natural looking shine that easily lasts through the work day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer American Crew Fiber over this product and the Everyman Jack Fiber is even better for my hair type.</li>
      <li>This product is slightly lighter and easier to apply, overall a very good product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great - no more summer time frizz!</li>
      <li>who actually likes this stuff has obviously not tried the good stuff, Messed Up</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like american crew fiber but easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>Strong hold, low shine.</li>
      <li>Which means I don&#x27;t like it and don&#x27;t use it much at all.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
      <li>It works as advertised and you don&#x27;t need  much.</li>
      <li>Anybody using the messed up molding creme, do not get fooled, this is NOTHING like that, very subpar.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this on numerous occasions--it&#x27;s a good product that holds without feeling waxy or heavy.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
      <li>I added some organic hair spray to it when I rub my hands together before applying and it helps hold his hair a little better.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t like molding creams</li>
      <li>Smell is nice, subtle.</li>
      <li>It does last all day and you dont need much of it, but for my hair, it makes the texture kind of too choppy and oily feeling not natural which</li>
      <li>I bought this for my two year old.  </li>
      <li>still looks natural.</li>
      <li>Very overpriced for only one tub.</li>
      <li>This product is good but not great for me personally.</li>
      <li>Can get a little oily if you put on too much, so don&#x27;t put on too much.</li>
      <li>Holds hair all day with no shine, washes out easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>This wax is definitely enough to help keep a natural look.</li>
      <li>love it, doesn&#x27;t need much, its pretty thick, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy... unless you&#x27;re dirty and going for that look.</li>

<li> and the hold didn&#x27;t last that long after it</li>
<li> It is very sticky and I had to use quite a bit on my son&#x27;s hair, unlike other reviews where they said they only use a little bit.  </li>
<li> I have only tried it on his hair when it&#x27;s wet</li>
<li> lasts a long time, does exactly what i want (and i have very thick hair).</li>
<li> thought when I combed it after putting it in, it would dry and hold that style, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
<li> but you want to put this on when your hair is almost completely dry.</li>
<li> This product does not really stand out compared to all the other men&#x27;s hairstyling products out there that promise the same effects.</li>
<li> I have very thick Asian hair and a very modest amount (about a jelly bean sized dollop)</li>
<li> Some other reviewers have commented about its inability to dry and hold</li>
<li> Provides the same effect on my thick Asian hair as all of them too.</li>
<li> I do like that it doesn&#x27;t dry stiff or with a wet look.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair thats not very long, molding cream would do that to me</li>
<li> Only complaint, and reason for the 4 stars, is that I couldn&#x27;t just buy 2 units, as there was a $25 minimum purchase needed to place an order, so I had to buy 3 units.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little sticky on your hands.</li>
<li> Not original product.</li>
<li> I would say this is less stiff than Fiber and not as creamy as Sponge Wax.</li>
<li> Firm hold.</li>
<li> It gives texture and shine, with a little hold, without looking greasy or stiff.</li>
<li> This MOP makes my hair Stiff and its not creamy at all, you have to dig into it</li>
<li> The texture in the jar is roughly the thickness of playdough or a very thick toothpaste.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, product that I received is DIFFERENT and  NOT</li>
<li> I usually just do his hair in the morning and let it go.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is the best pomade ever. not sticky. not greasy. all day hold. great smell. i would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This wax is great! I highly recommend trying it. It doesn&#x27;t give off the shine like most waxes do and it&#x27;s pretty strong by itself. For longer hairs that require more wax, I&#x27;d suggest using hair spray at the end. This wax is definitely enough to help keep a natural look.</li>
    <li> ******CONTAINS PARABENS!!!!!*******&lt;br /&gt;The company is called &amp;#34;Modern Organic Products&amp;#34;, but don&#x27;t be misled by the name...they use some organic ingredients, but they are not all organic! For some people that may not matter, but for those of you who care, check the ingredients.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - no more summer time frizz!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have been using another product, Graham Webb Head Games Messed up Madness Molding Creme 4 Oz, which is excellent, its creamy and leaves my hair feeling pliable, not hard...This MOP makes my hair Stiff and its not creamy at all, you have to dig into it loosen it up..&lt;br /&gt;anybody who actually likes this stuff has obviously not tried the good stuff, Messed Up Molding Creme is the best but it has gotten so expensive&lt;br /&gt;that I thought I would give this a shot since the price was right.. but at any price this stuff did not work for me..  Anybody using the messed up molding creme, do not get fooled, this is NOTHING like that, very subpar.</li>
    <li> When i placed my order the Item pictured was a set of two.  By the time only one arrived at my house the product picture had been updated.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I call it a wax, but that may technically not be correct.  The texture in the jar is roughly the thickness of playdough or a very thick toothpaste.  It melts in your hands and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Keeping my hair looking awesome for a couple years now.</li>
    <li> my hubby does his hair in sort of a messy/spikish thing and has been using this for years. it is the best! not greasy at all, great hold and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This product is just like American Crew Fiber or Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax. Same type of product and same finish. Provides the same effect on my thick Asian hair as all of them too. I would say this is less stiff than Fiber and not as creamy as Sponge Wax. This gives my hair a lower-medium hold. Which means I don&#x27;t like it and don&#x27;t use it much at all. I find myself using By Vilain Gold Digger more often than this stuff. Gold Digger provides the same finish and a firmer hold and stands up until the end of the day while this one does not. This product does not really stand out compared to all the other men&#x27;s hairstyling products out there that promise the same effects.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair doesn&#x27;t look stiff and it smells good too! The price is right from this seller. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Very similar to American Crew Fiber. This product is slightly lighter and easier to apply, overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> Easy to sculpt hair. If you like the spiker or got2b gel without the greasy and hard feeling, this product would be prefect for you.</li>
    <li> Great product, great smell. Holds hair all day with no shine, washes out easily and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my two year old.  I have only tried it on his hair when it&#x27;s wet and the hold didn&#x27;t last that long after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;I thought when I combed it after putting it in, it would dry and hold that style, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  It is very sticky and I had to use quite a bit on my son&#x27;s hair, unlike other reviews where they said they only use a little bit.  I do like that it doesn&#x27;t dry stiff or with a wet look.  I added some organic hair spray to it when I rub my hands together before applying and it helps hold his hair a little better.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this on numerous occasions--it&#x27;s a good product that holds without feeling waxy or heavy.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> and this is it. lasts a long time, does exactly what i want (and i have very thick hair). love it.</li>
    <li> Firm hold. Easy to control depending on how much you apply. Can get a little oily if you put on too much, so don&#x27;t put on too much. It&#x27;s called molding cream for a reason - you can mold your hair any way you want.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my pixie cut! It gives texture and shine, with a little hold, without looking greasy or stiff.</li>
    <li> Okay product. It&#x27;s a great product for styling on damp hair... I&#x27;d give it 4 stars for that.  It&#x27;s like american crew fiber but easy to wash out. Don&#x27;t be fooled this is not a moulding cream. It&#x27;s a paste. So it gives a different texture. Not hat I wanted but if i didn&#x27;t care about my hair I&#x27;d use this. Just put it in style it and walk out the door.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Very satisfied with it.  Only complaint, and reason for the 4 stars, is that I couldn&#x27;t just buy 2 units, as there was a $25 minimum purchase needed to place an order, so I had to buy 3 units.  I&#x27;ll use it, but the last time I ordered, a year prior, there was no imposed minimum requirement that I could remember, as I only purchased 2 then.  I may look for another vendor next time, if that minimum requirement is still there.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best hair molding gel ever. It works as advertised and you don&#x27;t need  much. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I wanted an organic cream for my son&#x27;s hair. This is perfect, though it doesn&#x27;t hold throughout the day and must be re-applied several times. I usually just do his hair in the morning and let it go. I feel really good about the ingredients, which is the most important thing to me.</li>
    <li> Great product. It gives a matte finish and malleable hold.</li>
    <li> Pretty good ! Not like the discontinued favorite ! But the next best thing!</li>
    <li> Got the best haircut I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and the barber used this stuff on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, doesn&#x27;t need much, its pretty thick, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy... unless you&#x27;re dirty and going for that look.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product and will continue to buy it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Not original product. Not organic.</li>
    <li> Have used orange peel for years, love it.  Controls style but still looks natural. The jar lasts and lasts, so it&#x27;s a great value too!</li>
    <li> Love this molding cream. Been using it for years.  It&#x27;s a little sticky on your hands. It works perfectly and leaves your hair with an excellent texture.</li>
    <li> Works on hair and maybe even on your hormones with the parabens.  It does the job.  I&#x27;d prefer American Crew Fiber over this product and the Everyman Jack Fiber is even better for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like molding creams but this one has changed my mind about them.  It smells great and it holds very well.  You don&#x27;t need much at all.  I think it is a fair price too.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff for guys. Easy to use, you don&#x27;t need a lot - one of these lasts me almost 6 months. I hope this stuff doesn&#x27;t go away from here because it&#x27;s really hard to find. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on item description and presented photo. Unfortunately, product that I received is DIFFERENT and  NOT ORGANIC! I call it as False Advertising and shame to dishonest company which sells produc that is NOT AS DESCRIBED.</li>
    <li> The description says this item is a two pack, I only received one. Very overpriced for only one tub. My husband and I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Best molding cream &amp; easy to acquire here</li>
    <li> Smells good and leaves hair feeling pretty light and natural. The issue is that I have quite unruly hair and this stuff just doesn&#x27;t have the hold that I need. Good product if you&#x27;re looking for a light cream though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up loving Woody&#x27;s Grooming Clay for a stronger hold and natural feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for probably 10+ years now and have not found anything else that comes close to this in terms of look and hold. Some other reviewers have commented about its inability to dry and hold but you want to put this on when your hair is almost completely dry. I have very thick Asian hair and a very modest amount (about a jelly bean sized dollop) is all I need for my short hair. The end result is a non-greasy, natural looking shine that easily lasts through the work day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. Strong hold, low shine. Yet it also washes out easily. Smell is nice, subtle. Good ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great pricing on these. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> This product is good but not great for me personally. It does last all day and you dont need much of it, but for my hair, it makes the texture kind of too choppy and oily feeling not natural which im trying to achieve. I have thick hair thats not very long, molding cream would do that to me but this was worth a shot. For organics there isnt a vast selection to try. Conclusion is, I would recommend this to people with thinner hair looking for all day shape and control.</li>
