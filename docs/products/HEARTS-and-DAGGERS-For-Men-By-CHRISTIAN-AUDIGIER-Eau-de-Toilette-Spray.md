<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just got this as a replacement and smells as expected :)</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Smells Amazing Women love it! My second favorite cologne my first favorite it Aqua Di Gio Gorgio Armani!! Women absolutely love both of thse cologne !!! Highly Recommend Both!!!</li>
    <li> another stellar fragrance from Christian Audigier, bought 2 others and not disappointed with this 3rd, in fact this is the 2nd bottle of this particular fragrance I bought, as I gifted the 1st one to a friend. of the 3 fragrances I do love Villain the most</li>
    <li> I cant stand ed hardy but their cologne is top notch.</li>
    <li> Cool product, and service.</li>
    <li> This is what my dad loves!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great. You get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance but it is strong so 1 spray will do ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package is a great value but know that it is way too big go in an airplane carry-on.&lt;br /&gt;It is such a big bottle, you will likely need to replace it do to it expiring rather than using it all!</li>
    <li> Great price and was suprised how nice it smelled</li>
    <li> Very happy with this colonge it was the real deal ,   Great price , SMELLS GREAT ! 5 stars ALL THE WAY BABY!</li>
    <li> Great value and smell.</li>
    <li> This was a special request from my teenage grandson.  He really liked it and it made shopping easier when he is so specific.</li>
    <li> I got this recommended to me by a girl i know, smells great. good price for a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;when i wear it people around tell me i smell good and some ask about the name..&lt;br /&gt;It is not the best one I have, but it is definitely very good.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell. I love the packaging that it was shipped in. Very cool looking bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne a while ago. I had about 1/3 left. I liked to keep it in my car. It&#x27;s so good that the person who broke into my car even took it meaning he liked it as well. If I ever find him I&#x27;ll definitely have him submit his own review as well. I&#x27;m sure he would give this cologne a pretty good rating as well</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my fiance, and I am very happy to say he loves it :) So I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance (from fragrancenet.com via amazon) because of mostly positive reviews about the product here on Amazon. It arrived within the stipulated time window and in good condition - both of which were nice.&lt;br /&gt;However, all my preconceived notions and pre-formed respect went out the window with the first spray. It has a pungent, cheap, smell which is nowhere close to what was described by other users. Even when used in minimal amounts, the fragrance still is not pleasing to the senses. I struggle to see how other users rated it so highly. I gave it a one star because I couldn&#x27;t rate it any lower. The only thing positive about this fragrance - in my opinion - is the price................I guess you get what you pay for! I have never rated anything in my life, and the fact that I started with this product should tell other readers how badly I felt after using this product. Maybe it was partly my expectations, but in all honesty, this is not a pleasant fragrance. There are certain people (I believe, teenagers) who will use this and find pleasure with it (especially for the price), but I&#x27;m certainly not one of them. Hopefully, my experience will help other potential buyers think twice. I definitely will be returning mine to [...] from where I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was good.  Deliver was faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much Amazon I love u its perfect I love it</li>
    <li> Awesome smell always get compliments!</li>
    <li> Bought it without smelling it but you can&#x27;t go wrong with Ed Hardy. I think it is my new favorite for him!</li>
    <li> Es la primera vez que utilizo esta marca de fragancia la compre para uso diario la primera aplicaci&amp;oacute;n me pareci&amp;oacute; un olor muy fuerte a madera seca pero en unos minutos su olor se transform&amp;oacute; en un suave olor y mis amigas me comentaban  lo bien de mi fragancia y me cost&amp;oacute; creer pero en la calle otra chica me lo repiti&amp;oacute; y mi esposa al llegar a la casa me coment&amp;oacute; que la colonia era de un olor agradable  la recomiendo por el precio vale la pena no perder&amp;aacute; su dinero en este producto jose manuel abreu puerto la cruz venezuela&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first time I use this brand of fragrance for daily use buy it the first application I found a very strong smell of dry wood, but in a few minutes the smell was transformed into a sweet smell and my friends commented to me how good my fragrance and I could not believe but another girl in the street and I repeated my wife to come home to me that the colony was a pleasant smell recommend it for the price not worth wasting your money on this product&#x27;s port abreu jose manuel cross Venezuela</li>
    <li> It is what it is.  It smells good, kind of sweet.  Seems to last fairly long throughout day.  Have had a few compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s great it smells good I like the bottle  especially all my friends that are guys were asking me what is it where did it and can they put some of mine on all my friends that are girls were saying they loved it that I smelled so good and I love it it smells really good and will buy more of this product</li>
    <li> I have wanted this cologne forever but everywhere I looked it was so expensive. I found it on Amazon for half the price, and it&#x27;s the big bottle and the genuine article. I love the way this cologne smells, more importantly, my wide loves the way it smells on me. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I got this because of all the good ratings, and they are not wrong. Girls fall at my feet and beg me to date them now..I feel like a supermodel. My life has changed for the better because i smell so good now. :)</li>
    <li> Great price. It was a larger bottle than I bought at a store last year, so I&#x27;m very happy! Smells good, it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s cologne, but it works for women too. We&#x27;ve worn it for years!</li>
    <li> My wife recommended that I try this. With all the skull and bones themes designed on the case and bottle I thought this must be for teens. So my wife actually went out and bought home a sample bottle. I was hooked. For this price this is the best cologne I have ever used. My wife uses mine daily. Next time I&#x27;m buying 2. Great balanced scent and very pleasing. I have used it everyday since I received it. Needless to say it did not last long. My main logo is \\&quot;quality at a discount price\\&quot; and this is what you get with this. Do not underestimate this product. Give it a try I think you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents so far! When you go to Macy&#x27;s, they have this at full retail price. Never ever buy it at that price. It is way cheaper on Amazon, or even on other websites. And you get so much for the money! The scent, I absolutely love, as I said. But of course everyone prefers a different scent, so that may vary with the buyer. This in particular is a little fruity, if you like that, and not too musky at all.</li>
    <li> PERFECT EVERY TIME!!!</li>
    <li> Smells fresh and clean with a little touch of musk. Smells like a sweet, shower fresh man :)</li>
    <li> excellent product,received in excellent conditions higly recommended if u want to give TO PURCHASE FOR YOU GO AHEAD ITS A NICE PERFUME, RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> ED HARDY COLOGNES ARE ALL GREAT SO I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS ONE A TRY AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED; IT SMELLS AWESOME AND WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN. PRICE WAS GREAT AND SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>
    <li> This was the year to buy cologne and perfume for my family at very reasonable prices!!  Everyone was happy, even me.</li>
    <li> I am going to buy this cologne again for sure.  I got a lot of compliments from various people when wearing it.  Not appealing style bottle but definantly a great surprise.</li>
    <li> I love the way this cologne smell.Its a gift for Christmas so I hope my son love his gift. And I Love The Size Of The Bottle</li>
    <li> Love it! For men or teens</li>
    <li> Nice product. Smells awesome. I&#x27;ve also received many complements about the smell of this cologne.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting smell</li>
    <li> Can never go wrong with Ed Hardy. Hearts and Daggers would rank 2nd on the Ed Hardy list.  If you can get any Hardy cheap and its not a knock off-  jump on it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good fragrance and smells good, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again. The price is good, but I&#x27;d rather go with Lucky, Mambo, Guess or several other fragrances for the same price.</li>
    <li> I never smelled this before I got it. But I took my chances with its great reviews and great price,Great smell,not overpowering</li>
    <li> Fresh Clean Mellow Scent, Not to strong, I bought this online without smelling it, due to the fact that i&#x27;ve purchased the Women version as a gift and was very surprised of how good it smelled, so i figured that the Male&#x27;s version would be just as good, and it is.</li>
    <li> The brand of spray my husband used for years, (Escada) is no longer available so I was trying to find a fragrance he would like. This smells great and lasts all day. It&#x27;s not too powerful but definitely masculine. I love the smell. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it too.</li>
    <li> This is the first cologne that I&#x27;ve ever purchased without smelling first.  I bought this for my 23 year old nephew as a Christmas present and my selection was based soley on the brand itself and the reviews.  Some of the reviews were critical and these made me leery, but the price seemed right so I took a chance.  I was pleasantly surprised when my nephew put it on yesterday and the scent was light and clean! Just to give you an idea of my personal preferences  I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; scents and one of my favorite male colognes is Voyage by Nautica.  Another reviewer mentioned this as being spicy.  I don&#x27;t have that same impression.  I can&#x27;t attest to the longevity of this fragrance since we left shortly after my nephew applied it.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this for my 42 year old husband either despite the packaging, which does seemed aimed at a younger age group.</li>
    <li> Awesome... Really like it..</li>
    <li> Simply Amazing, love the smell</li>
    <li> Bought for my 14 yr old grandson.  He seemed happy with it.  The item made it for Christmas.  Was new and factory sealed as promised.</li>
    <li> I got this really quick and it smells wonderful. I will be buying this product again! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> This cologne last for about 20 minutes and you got nothing!  Save your money and buy it from Macys..Dillards or other such places</li>
    <li> The smell is out of this world. I&#x27;ve received compliments from a lot of people in regards to the scent. Great buy for the price; you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Great value, good price!</li>
    <li> Hearts and Daggers...great product</li>
    <li> Smells great, lots of cologne. Will last me a long time. Packaged very nicely, and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells great but took more then a week to get and it&#x27;s a cool lookin bottle and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sister for her birthday.  it is her favorite perfume.  she adores it and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> My friend LOVES this scent, and it smells terrific on him.  All of his friends ask him what he&#x27;s wearing and where to get it.  Amazon is my sneaky little secret!  This retails for WAY more than I pay through Amazon!  It&#x27;s worth every penny!  It lasts really well and really helps keep the smell of stale bodies and cigarette smoke at bay.  My friend is a bouncer, and he used to get off work smelling like a sweaty ashtray.  This is a huge improvement.</li>
    <li> It smells great! Ignore the cover and skull designs on the bottle. It is a decent scent for the price. Chics love it and my sister who loves a somewhat masculine scents wears it all the time. It also lasts for quite some time ESP for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my best for daily use is excellent for cool nights which is such describre. no use sending complaints is within the set limits.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I got it at 1/3 of the price of retail store</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for. It smells great and made it to my house very quickly!!!</li>
    <li> Great buy for the holidays for the special someone</li>
    <li> I never smelled this before I got it. But I took my chances with its great reviews and great price. I bought this approximately 4 weeks ago and have received at least one compliment every where I have been since. That&#x27;s a lot of compliments. I am half way through my 1.7oz and am definitely buying the 3.4oz this time.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I found it at a department store for fifteen bucks, in the box. Well worth it! The eighteen dollars here on Amazon is worth it too! Ed Hardy has high quality, name brand scenting. Part of materialism is false; Mark Twain said the other half. &amp;#34;The clothes make the man.&amp;#34; Add a little Ed Hardy instead of Axe, and we&#x27;re rocking our Polo&#x27;s/designer threads!</li>
    <li> Not so much. Cool looking design...but thats where it ends.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Can go wrong with Ed Hardy!</li>
    <li> The scent it puts off does not last and it does not smell like the sample I tried prior to purchasing this cologne.  I am not sure if it is legit but I do know - it was not worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad for his birthday, he says he likes it, but i dont now for sure, He uses it though, i think it smells nice, i would buy it for me</li>
    <li> This is a cologne I have worn regularly for several years now and have been purchasing from Ebay or retail stores. Was a great value on Amazon. Will purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> yess&lt;br /&gt;yrs prodict drew sevaral ccompliments . ..from a diverse group of individuals ...recommended for anyone looking for different fragrances</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this. Got it in the time I was supposed to, very happy!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a father&#x27;s day gift for my husband since he wouldn&#x27;t stop talking about it after he smelled it on a friend of his.He loves it and gets lots of compliments on it.I love the smell on him too. Definitely buying it again!</li>
    <li> Started to wear this cologne 4 years ago and have never been disappointed or lack the compliments from others of how great it is. Not too musky not to light but just right..</li>
    <li> Great price, my 28 year old son loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> A gift, was the perfect scent.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure of this because of the 12 year old outside case but it smells good</li>
    <li> Good cologne. The scent is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem manly enough for me...idk how else to put it. If you&#x27;re into sweet smells then this is for you...If you like more earth and wood smells you probably wouldn&#x27;t enjoy the scent. I still use it here and there. Smells refreshing after a nice shower.</li>
    <li> Smells Great. Thanks... My wife loves it. Love it.  Thanks. ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve liked all the Ed Hardy fragrances I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Great price and unique enough fragrance.  Great price as well</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for,save your self some headaches this is not authentic product no where on bottle is inscripted christian audiglier.I dont know where all the positive reviews are coming from and you cannot return it people wake up,As a loyal and amazon prime member i am apauled.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this colgne alot until while I was un packing it fell out of my bag andf broke all over the floor . I am going to get another bottle but not till the smell in the house is gone .</li>
    <li> Smells awesome!!!!! My fiance loves it. Great price for a lrg bottle!!! I even have the womend version and i always get compliments</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. This stuff firmly states MAN, without yelling it too loudly. It has a touch of the woodsy smell you&#x27;d find in a lot of older colognes while adding a little modern day sweetness to it. Most importantly, my lady loves it, and she isn&#x27;t easily pleased with most fragrances (which I discovered after a day smell testing in the department store).</li>
    <li> It smells very nice but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work like it should. It barely squirts out - the hole isn&#x27;t right or something.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne for men! I recommend smelling it in store first because everyone does have different opinions, however it is cheaper to buy the 3.4 ounce on amazon. Makes a wonderful gift! Although the packaging design makes it look for teenage boys, it definitely does not smell like a typical teenage axe spray. Very nice cologne!</li>
    <li> Great smell,not overpowering. I would definitely buy again. Finally a cologne you don&#x27;t have to pawn the dog to afford. Thank You Amazon. Jon M.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Ed hardy and loves this cologne- was the best investment that I found online from amazon, thank you</li>
    <li> If you are not into spicy colognes then this is not for you. I bought it because of the good reviews, tried it this morning to office, and now I have a headache from it. Screw those 25, 5 star reviews. Not even a single person mentioned it being spicy..... Oh its soooooooo good, compliments upon compliments, girls love it, my dad loves it, my aunt loves it, my finace loves, my second cousin from west virginia loves it, my grandma and my dog loves it, OH SHUT THE HELL UP AND TELL ME WHAT THE DAMN THING SMELLS LIKE and what notes it has. I simply cannot stand spicy colognes. I should have stayed with CK Escape or Lacoste Essential. Don&#x27;t know why I tried this. Last time I am buying a cologne without testing it first.</li>
    <li> Another great colonge by Ed Hardy, masculine fragrance, not overpowering. Smells great.I will buy again.Great price.Fast and secure shipping. Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells great and husband loves it.  He wears it every day.  It is not overpowering and it is perfect for every day wear.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. Had to have it in my collection. It is great, everything came as described. I will enjoy this until it&#x27;s time to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son and he loves it. Found it here for a great price and a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> I gave the cologne to my nieces husband for Christmas, when I asked how he liked it, she replied&amp;#34; He loves it, and smells awesome, he&#x27;s probably getting lucky tonight.I think it is safe to say..It was a HIT..</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday use with a nice light scent that my lady and those around have never complained about, only enjoy.</li>
    <li> it smells great!!!.. i order all my colognes from amazon, this is like my second fav thus far..  the only reason it got the 4 star rating, it fades after a while.. but i wud deffinately buy again..</li>
    <li> Dear reader, if your a fan of a strong yet elegant men&#x27;s cologne, this is for you then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s this spray right here lasts all day long, that&#x27;s the plus side to this.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne and so does my son. It was priced right and I&#x27;m glad. I purchased it I would recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift so I cannot say personally my opinion of the fragrance, however, it is Ed Hardy, you can&#x27;t really go wrong. The design is awesome and my father says he really likes it. (Personal Note: All my other Ed Hardy Colognes are awesome)</li>
    <li> Smells great. Much sweeter than Born Wild which has more of a spice to it and the smell seems much more &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;. H&amp;D is lighter by comparison. Cant beat the price or quick shipping.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> My hubby smells wonderful with this fragrance. It&#x27;s FRESH, it&#x27;s SEXY and I love it. One of my favs now.</li>
    <li> I had try a sample of the product at macy&#x27;s and I fall in love with it at the first time. I have been meaning to buy it for a period of time and finally I purchased it from Amazon. It&#x27;s beyond nice and fresh. My wife loves it!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years and I just love the smell.  I will continue to buy this scent as long as I can.</li>
    <li> Smells great my son loves it.  Great price as well. I am sure we will be buying this fragrance in the future</li>
    <li> fast shipping good price</li>
    <li> Perfectly wrapped with no scratches and I even got a free sample of a calvin klein perfume! Plus 20% discount on my next purchase! Definitely buying all my perfume and cologne from here.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  Very cool packaging.  The price was good too.  My husband wears it every day for me.  He likes scent too.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, numerous comments/compliments whenever I wear this cologne. great scent not too heavy or woodsy as some men&#x27;s colognes can be</li>
    <li> Great Scent! The ladies love it! I highly recomend it if you are looking for a new colgne.Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I tried an oil I  bought on the street back in 2011 with this fragrance. Although I didnt know the name I knew it was an Ed Hardey brand. I checked amazon to find the fragrance by name, using the date fragrance was released. BAM! I was right. Hearts and daggers was it. Love the fragrance. Try it, u may love it as much  as I do.</li>
    <li> Great scent always get compliments on it. Is fresh not overpowering</li>
    <li> Nice scent, my girlfriend enjoyed this.</li>
    <li> To my taste is smell is very strong, and is not like some perfumes that are strong in the beginning, this is strong all the time, while tired ... I do not think I buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Cheaper than in the mall same product</li>
    <li> First of all i love this product. The price is untouchable. The cologne was delivered the next day. I&#x27;ve read where people think these products are fake. They are the real deal. I use to shop excessively at Sax Fifth Ave. For all my items, and believe me these are the real deal, for much less!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon</li>
    <li> this cologne is over rated,it doesn&#x27;t last and it was expensive . maybe if you buy it at a larger retailer, and the shelf life isn&#x27;t old ..that may be a difference</li>
    <li> Smells incredible and it does last unlike many reviews. Simply has an incredible scent.Ladies love it! cant go wrong if you order</li>
    <li> Why pay high prices for this cologne when you get the same thing for half the cost? Very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> I already knew I liked this. I bought a small bottle at Sears in January for $6.00 and got hooked. Well, by about March, my bottle was running dry. Rather than go back to Sears and spend more than is necessary, I looked it up on here and was pleasantly surprised to find such a large bottle at such a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear this, I get the best compliments from my significant other and if they like it, it must be good stuff.</li>
    <li> First saw this item at a department store and when I returned to purchas it for my husband it Wes discontinued. I an happy I found it on Amazon . We both really like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy, in my opinion is the best smelling cologne on the market. Everywhere I go, I receive compliments on how good I smell.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this perfume. I had bought this one before in a local store and cost bout 60 bucks. This perfume stays on and smells great.</li>
    <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
    <li> Nice sweet scent reminded me of candies for men just a little less sweet</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for Saint Valentines day for my husband. He is 45 but trues to look young and prefers sweet aromas,should say unfortunately for me. But this cologne is very elegant and unobtrusive( if I can use such word for perfume). Personally,I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> enjoyed this product, but seems to fade after a few hours and not last like most others fragrances at this level.........</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. I get compliments on it all the time. It was quickly shipped and is in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Hubby loves it &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;this is his second bottle !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like in department stores. You get just what it says.</li>
    <li> My husband likes to douse himself in it.  Really, only a bit is needed and It lasts without being smelly.  People compliment him on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love it! Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; cologne for hot dates with my lady.</li>
    <li> it smells ok but its not the original official I&#x27;ve purchased before at macys. will not purchase any more perfumes from amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product and good service. Good packaging with no damage at all. Will buy it again for my son.  Nice way to get a great price and not go to the store.</li>
    <li> I own many colonge and this was the most cheapest  and greatest  buy ever, smell better than high top name colonges must buy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after reading all the good reviews. I love the scent and hope he wears it all the time.</li>
    <li> My 20 year old son had a bottle of this cologne a year ago, and wanted another. I ordered this one from Amazon, and according to him, it is the real deal and smells great. I would recommend it for the slightly younger set, it is more of a young men&#x27;s scent than a daytime office scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves it! I would highly recommend this to others! Also had great price for quantity and quality!</li>
    <li> Smell great can never go Wong with a sandalwood scent</li>
    <li> Ordered it as a gift for my husband  who is in early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;He liked it and I love it on him&lt;br /&gt;Go for it...............</li>
