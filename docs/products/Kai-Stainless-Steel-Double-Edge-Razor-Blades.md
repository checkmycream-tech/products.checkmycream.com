      <li>I use Israeli Personna Reds as my blade of choice, and these will be on my list when I want a special blade!</li>
      <li>This afternoon I received a brand-new Merkur 37C Slant razor; a wonder in it&#x27;s own right.</li>
      <li>Feathers are supposed to be the sharpest on the market, because of that you can easily cut yourself if your not paying attention.  </li>
      <li>Used in my 1960 F2 Fatboy, #7 setting both WTG/ATG AOS tallow puck soap, AOS fine badger brush.</li>
      <li>but if I had to shave with these the rest of my life, I&#x27;d be fine with that.</li>
      <li>My dad missed the boat on fine shaving and swears by cheap Bics.</li>
      <li>, smooth shave with no razor burn.</li>
      <li>sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good value as far as price is concerned.</li>
      <li>Those five soaps, sourced from exotic locales in Austria, in Maryland, in Ann Arbor, in France, and in Italy, were among the soaps that also are most highly regarded by the on-line shaving communities of Shavenook and Badger &amp; Blade.  </li>
      <li>I clean the blade and put a light oil on the edge.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t cut any better, but  gave a more severe razor burn than normal.  </li>
      <li>At first I had to be very careful with these blades; they are quite aggressive, but I soon learned to use their sharpness for an excellent shave.</li>
      <li>Formerly, I liked all of the top five soaps equally, but they now have a distinct order of priority; and the maxim that “you get what you pay for” has been debunked:  </li>
      <li>If you have a sensitive neck like myself this kind of shaving is not for you.</li>
      <li>Super Badger Shave</li>
      <li>However, there are many, many fine blades that can be purchased for much less.</li>
      <li>They work GREAT and are not so harsh in my slants.</li>
      <li>so far Nothing better than Feather imo.</li>
      <li>Like a rare wine, you sometimes get what you paid for.</li>
      <li>One of the five — the Italian one — became a “formerly favorite” shaving soap, and the longer I shave with KAI blades, others may fall in light of the superiority of others among the remaining soaps.  </li>
      <li>Good blades but not as sharp as feathers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that Kai is right bellow Feathers in sharpness.</li>
      <li>But the results are worth the effort:  the KAI blades shave my beard more closely and more smoothly (on MY face; your experience may vary) than any other double edge razor blade I ever have used, period.  </li>
      <li>Kai razor blade is so sharp that you need only the weight of the razor itself, a very light drag across the face, to get a perfect shave.  </li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s dad is pretty smart!</li>
      <li>Just used em for the first time</li>
      <li>The most similar blade I have found are the Feather blades.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately I thought the shave was good enough and was happy to be saving money vs. buying disposables.</li>
      <li>Overall pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>I have a fairly coarse beard and these blades do a better than average job of giving me a nice close shave.</li>
      <li>Whether or not that is true, what you might lack in sharpness you make up in smoothness resulting in a very sharp and forgiving blade :)</li>
      <li>Been DE shaving for ten years, used mostly cheap store brands and most recently Wilkinson Swords.  </li>
      <li>I was confident in my technique enough that even if they were super sharp I could do fine.  </li>
      <li>These were fine double edge razor blades.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super sharp and leave my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
      <li>Every time I got ready to shave, I had the luxury of choosing among them.  </li>
      <li>Shaves very well.</li>
      <li>To me they seemed much sharper than feathers.</li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>Very durable also they last a full week of shaving.</li>
      <li>That’s a good thing.to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average of my shave experiences is ascending.   </li>
      <li>For half acentury, I had been lathering up daily, using a good badger brush ([[ASIN:B003B3Q0UM</li>
      <li>KAI stainless blades are an order of magnitude sharper than either the Gillette Silver Blue blades or the Polsilver Super Iridium blades.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely buy the bigger box once I run out.</li>
      <li>One thing I like about the Kai razors more than the Feathers are that they come in a simple cardboard box with each blade individually wrapped in paper.</li>
      <li>Super Iridium Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Pack 50 by Polsilver]], both of which are manufactured in the St. Petersburg, Russia, facility in which Procter &amp; Gamble has a majority interest.  </li>
      <li>When I started to shave with the KAIs, I quickly learned that they demand extra care when shaving.  </li>
      <li>Feathers are no where near as comfortable but yield the same shave.  </li>
      <li>I normally use Feather brand blades in my safety razors.</li>
      <li>I use Feather and Wilkenson blades normally.</li>
      <li>Developed a good safe technique and usually got good but not perfect shaves with no irritation or injuries, but there were always a few spots that I never could master with those blades.</li>
      <li>These are perfectly sharp for a strong beard, yet smooth (probably due to the metal thickness).</li>
      <li>For about a year now, I have been using KAI razor blades as my first choice double edge razor blades.  </li>
      <li>The KAI blades are so sharp and smooth that they forced me into analytical distinctions in slickness and protectiveness that I never before had detected among my top five shaving soaps.  </li>
      <li>KAI blades are not only excellent in themselves; they have forced me to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average quality and enjoyment of my shave experiences is ascending.  </li>
      <li>Needed to make some extra passes so got a little more irritation that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>This blade is super sharp.</li>
      <li>I use them with the ambroley butterfly razor with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shave cream.</li>
      <li>The finest of my life so far.  </li>
      <li>My 16 yr old son graduated to kai within 3 months of learning DE shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have course hair and sensitive skin with no irritation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m jealous of him for learning so young.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp razor blades, arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>The Kai wins hands down.  </li>
      <li>My first shave with the very first KAI blade out of the package a year ago forced me to re-evaluate, not only the blades that up to then I had been using, but also my best-of-breed shaving soaps that I had been lathering.  </li>
      <li>The Kai blades last at least 7 days maybe more.</li>
      <li>Clearly Kai are different than other blades in the gauge of steel they use (evident just by looking at the blades).</li>
      <li>have a coarse beard and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>the city of Seki, there lies a spirit called the nokaji (blacksmith), which drives superior craftsmen to put their hearts into every piece of cutlery and cutting tool they create.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Like a rare wine, you sometimes get what you paid for. These were fine double edge razor blades. However, there are many, many fine blades that can be purchased for much less. Two of my favorites, Gillette Silver Blues and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Blacks can be found for around $ 25.00 for 100 blades.</li>
    <li> These blades are great!! Just used em for the first time, smooth shave with no razor burn. Because I have a very thick beard with fairly sensitive skin, I right away chose Feathers as my weapon of choice. Feathers are supposed to be the sharpest on the market, because of that you can easily cut yourself if your not paying attention.  I&#x27;ve heard that Kai is right bellow Feathers in sharpness. Whether or not that is true, what you might lack in sharpness you make up in smoothness resulting in a very sharp and forgiving blade :)</li>
    <li> One thing to keep in mind while reading this review is that I am a girl, so I use these razors to shave my legs and underarms, not my face. I bought these instead of my usual Feather blades and I find that they work equally as well, if not better. They gave a nice, smooth shave, and I had no razor bumps afterwards. Just make sure that you use a light touch and don&#x27;t try to push the razor onto your skin. The blades last me about a month, and I shave my underarms everyday and my legs every three days or so. Either way, they are a lot cheaper than those commercial five blade razors at the supermarket. One thing I like about the Kai razors more than the Feathers are that they come in a simple cardboard box with each blade individually wrapped in paper. The Feather blades come in a plastic box, which I find to be wasteful, and the blades are individually packaged in waxed paper. Since the wax gets on the blade, it makes it rust faster. There is no problem with this with the Kai. Overall pleased with my purchase and I&#x27;ll most likely buy the bigger box once I run out.</li>
    <li> These blades are smooth and sharp, not as sharp as Feathers perhaps but sharper than the average razor blade.  I have a fairly coarse beard and these blades do a better than average job of giving me a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Good blades but not as sharp as feathers. Needed to make some extra passes so got a little more irritation that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I have been trying a number of razor blades. I usually change them every 4 to 5 days. The Kai blades last at least 7 days maybe more. Feather may be sharper---maybe. However, Feather is tough on the skin. Going against the grain with a Feather takes some real skill and skin preparation to avoid cutting yourself. From my experience, I feel the Kai is extremely sharp, provides a much smoother shave than Feather and seems to hold it&#x27;s sharpness longer.</li>
    <li> I expected these to be The Best , according to lot of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;They said better than Feather ; No way  even Astra&#x27;s are better.&lt;br /&gt;Crystal personna Suck&lt;br /&gt;Derby&#x27;s are Terrible&lt;br /&gt;First of all there is no stamp or writing on blade .. So maybe I&#x27;ve been cheated but anyway.  Im gonna buy them again elsewhere to see If there great or not.&lt;br /&gt;But so far Nothing better than Feather imo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used derby blades and found them too dull.  The other extreme was Feather - I loved how smoothly they would glide across my face and ho smooth my skin was afterwards.  But I would invariable bleed.  It&#x27;s not my technique - no other blade I&#x27;ve used, other than Feather, causes me to bleed.  So I tried Kai blades - they are very sharp, and much less aggressive than Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Smoothest closest shave I have ever had. That being said be careful they are the sharpest blades I have ever used. To me they seemed much sharper than feathers. I have course hair and sensitive skin with no irritation. Did get the feeling I really had to bring my A game or it would bite me hard.</li>
    <li> Very sharp razor blades, arrived quickly.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I normally use Feather brand blades in my safety razors. Recently, I went to a slant safety razor and found the Feathers were a bit harsh on my third pass. I would rank them as a 5 on a sharpness scale of 1 to 5. I bought these KAI blades because they are a 4 on the sharpness scale. They work GREAT and are not so harsh in my slants.</li>
    <li> The best razor blades I&#x27;ve tried (so far). They&#x27;re super sharp and leave my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. At first I had to be very careful with these blades; they are quite aggressive, but I soon learned to use their sharpness for an excellent shave. I use them with the ambroley butterfly razor with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandlewood shave cream. Though they aren&#x27;t horribly expensive, they do seem to be the most expensive of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried; I wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, and they last long (I use them for 7 shaves, no problems)</li>
    <li> This blade is super sharp. Shaves very well. Love how smooth it cuts and leaves my skin very smooth. No irritation either.</li>
    <li> I would rate this one of the best on the market.  Very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good value as far as price is concerned. If you have a sensitive neck like myself this kind of shaving is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Quality feels better than feather blade. Sharpness is comparable to feather blade. But much less abrasive than feather blade.</li>
    <li> I spent extra money to try these.  Didn&#x27;t cut any better, but  gave a more severe razor burn than normal.  I&#x27;m sticking with basic merkur blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said,  It&#x27;s all about preference.  You have to try a blade to know how your skin will react.</li>
    <li> I for one, is not a fan of these blades. for me at least, I do not get a close shave. I have tried them three times and the same on all three shaves.</li>
    <li> Been DE shaving for ten years, used mostly cheap store brands and most recently Wilkinson Swords.  Developed a good safe technique and usually got good but not perfect shaves with no irritation or injuries, but there were always a few spots that I never could master with those blades. Unfortunately I thought the shave was good enough and was happy to be saving money vs. buying disposables. Years go by.........Enter the Kai blade...  I bought these thinking I was confident in my technique enough that even if they were super sharp I could do fine.  I was right, these are fine for me and do a superb job with no effort. Finally, those trouble spots are gone and not a hint of the pulling and tugging I&#x27;d get on the less sharp blades I&#x27;ve been using.  Do yourself a favor and try these blades!  Be careful and let the blade do all the work and these will allow you to experience a remarkable shave.  The finest of my life so far.  I have one more brand of blade I&#x27;d like to try... Feathers are on the way but if I had to shave with these the rest of my life, I&#x27;d be fine with that. Turned my F2 Fatboy into a chubby little ninja!!  UPDATE 1 month later: The Kai wins hands down.  Feathers are no where near as comfortable but yield the same shave.  My 16 yr old son graduated to kai within 3 months of learning DE shaving.  (1968 N4 Slim TTO)  I&#x27;m jealous of him for learning so young.  My dad missed the boat on fine shaving and swears by cheap Bics. My son&#x27;s dad is pretty smart! Used in my 1960 F2 Fatboy, #7 setting both WTG/ATG AOS tallow puck soap, AOS fine badger brush. Boiling kettle water for lather and two piece Scuttle. A face like Sunshine  Just remarkable razor blades.  BRAVO!!!</li>
    <li> Kai is a family owned business in Seki City, Japan which has been for 700 years the center of samurai sword-making.&lt;br /&gt;From kitchen knives to combat blades I believe Kai are the best in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not know Kai made razor blades, so when I saw these on Amazon, I snatched them up.  I will never again buy a three-blade Gillette or Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kai razor blade is so sharp that you need only the weight of the razor itself, a very light drag across the face, to get a perfect shave.  Don&#x27;t press this blade against your face as you would a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use I clean the blade and put a light oil on the edge.  A single blade lasts at least a month for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the CEO of Kai (Koji Endo) says:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;In the city of Seki, there lies a spirit called the nokaji (blacksmith), which drives superior craftsmen to put their hearts into every piece of cutlery and cutting tool they create. Indeed, this spirit lies everywhere at the heart of what we do.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dude, this is like a Hattori Hanzo razor blade.</li>
    <li> I do not have a thick beard but these made my face feel very raw and it sucks. I use Feather and Wilkenson blades normally. Bad shave YMMV</li>
    <li> I read that these were a good substitute for Feathers. I did not find that to be the case. The edge is not nearly as sharp, and definitely not smooth. Might work for some gents&#x27; skin, but not mine.</li>
    <li> This afternoon I received a brand-new Merkur 37C Slant razor; a wonder in it&#x27;s own right. In the package was a number of sample blades and included was a single Kai DE blade. Being used to using the 34C HD razor, the Slant wasn&#x27;t as scary as I thought it might be. The Kai blade easily, and without any nicks or weepers, delivered one of the best shaves ever was. I use Israeli Personna Reds as my blade of choice, and these will be on my list when I want a special blade! I give it a 5 star rating...Amazon, here I come!</li>
    <li> For about a year now, I have been using KAI razor blades as my first choice double edge razor blades.  Before that, I had settled into alternating between [[ASIN:B009XHQGY0 25 Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades Made in Russia]] and [[ASIN:B00MCLSFIY Super Iridium Double Edge Razor Blades 50 Pack 50 by Polsilver]], both of which are manufactured in the St. Petersburg, Russia, facility in which Procter &amp; Gamble has a majority interest.  Those two lines of razor blades are not identical, but they are very similar and they are priced similarly, and which between them I chose when I needed to purchase more blades depended upon my mood at the moment of purchase.  They are both excellent blades; I was not dissatisfied with either.  KAI stainless blades are an order of magnitude sharper than either the Gillette Silver Blue blades or the Polsilver Super Iridium blades.  When I started to shave with the KAIs, I quickly learned that they demand extra care when shaving.  A KAI blade can slice off a piece of your face so efficiently that you probably will not feel it, and might not even notice it until the lather turns red; long after I had thought that I had got my shaving technique down pat using other blades, I discovered that I had to refine my technique to use the KAI nlades.  But the results are worth the effort:  the KAI blades shave my beard more closely and more smoothly (on MY face; your experience may vary) than any other double edge razor blade I ever have used, period.  (In addition to the two brands of blades mentioned above, I have at least a five-packs’ — about two dozen shaves’ — experience shaving with Rapira Swedish Supersteel, Gillette Platinum, Astra SP, Supermax, and — very recently — Feather double edge blades.)  My first shave with the very first KAI blade out of the package a year ago forced me to re-evaluate, not only the blades that up to then I had been using, but also my best-of-breed shaving soaps that I had been lathering.  For half acentury, I had been lathering up daily, using a good badger brush ([[ASIN:B003B3Q0UM Super Badger Shave Brush with Lathe Turned Handle (2234) shave brush by Vulfix]]) and a very wide variety of purpose-made shaving soaps, to shave.  Over time, I have tried a few shaving soaps so expensive that I hid the price from my spouse, sourced from places all around the world.  Some were better than others, and some were m-u-c-h better than others, but by 2014, I had winnowed the field and settled into a &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; of five different brands of soaps, all of them excellent.  Every time I got ready to shave, I had the luxury of choosing among them.  The KAI blades are so sharp and smooth that they forced me into analytical distinctions in slickness and protectiveness that I never before had detected among my top five shaving soaps.  Those five soaps, sourced from exotic locales in Austria, in Maryland, in Ann Arbor, in France, and in Italy, were among the soaps that also are most highly regarded by the on-line shaving communities of Shavenook and Badger &amp; Blade.  Formerly, I liked all of the top five soaps equally, but they now have a distinct order of priority; and the maxim that “you get what you pay for” has been debunked:  the priority in performance and the price levels of the soaps are uncorrelated.  One of the five — the Italian one — became a “formerly favorite” shaving soap, and the longer I shave with KAI blades, others may fall in light of the superiority of others among the remaining soaps.  Bottom line:  KAI blades are not only excellent in themselves; they have forced me to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average quality and enjoyment of my shave experiences is ascending.  That’s a good thing.to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average of my shave experiences is ascending.   That’s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I compared these head to head to head with my favorites. Gillette 7&#x27;oclocks greens and feather blades.  These are perfectly sharp for a strong beard, yet smooth (probably due to the metal thickness). Very durable also they last a full week of shaving.</li>
    <li> I used these in my 1947 Gillette Superspeed and they cut like lasers.  The most similar blade I have found are the Feather blades.  Good for nice close shaves they will be repeated.  I received these with a nice assortment of samplers of colognes, lotions, and triple crown soap/shave lotion from Amazon Seller RoyalShave.  So very worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent blades. I thought the feathers were supposed to be the sharpest but found these to be the best out of the 5 brands I&#x27;ve tried. The feathers were definitely sharper than merkurs and wilkinsons, but would give me a lot of razor burn. These kai blades feel just as sharp but give no razor burn. I can shave sloppy and fast with these and never get any knicks, I would go pretty slow and careful with the feathers and still get the occasional knick with them.</li>
    <li> These blades are less aggressive than feather, but still quite sharp. I will probably keep KAI razors in the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin. My go to razors are Astra Superior Platinum and BIC Chrome Platinum.  Astra takes the lead regarding quality for price point.</li>
    <li> These are the best DE blades on the market, period. They are also the most expensive, yet for the improved shave quality and the longer shave life of each blade it is money well spent. The comments about the blades made by the seller were very accurate. Clearly Kai are different than other blades in the gauge of steel they use (evident just by looking at the blades). My preference has been Kai and Feather blades, however while both are very sharp the Kai blades seem more forgiving, and have a consistency over all areas of my face, including the areas which are more difficult due to terrain and whisker thickness. These blades give a very smooth, close, comfortable shave without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize each individual&#x27;s beard, skin, routine and experience may be different but this has been my experience.</li>
