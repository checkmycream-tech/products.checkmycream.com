      <li>Looking for less costly alternatives and seeing the great reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Himalaya!!</li>
      <li>This one was not irritating, has GREAT ingredients, and i really think it is helping with my acne, as well as with red marks.</li>
      <li>, I use this face wash combined with several other items and this is the best my skin has</li>
      <li>My face is left clean, smooth and fresh after use.</li>
      <li>me, this is very effective in combination with other items for my adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the size, price and the fact that it is comparable to much more expensive washes and works even better.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted to try it out first before writing a review.</li>
      <li>I broke out pretty soon after switching.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s acne system for about 6 months, and it works pretty well</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin soft and clean without over drying</li>
      <li>The ingredients are also quite decent!</li>
      <li>I have very oily, large pored skin and this face wash has really helped.  </li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>Well I really like it.</li>
      <li>I feel like it really cleans my face without drying it out.</li>
      <li>It cleanses really well (although I find I need to wash twice to get all the make up off, unless I use jojoba or coconut oil as a pre-wash wich I usualy do anyway), without drying.</li>
      <li>Its doing too much \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; for my taste</li>
      <li>How natural is that right?</li>
      <li>Only product that has cleared up my acne and kept my skin clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>, I have excema and very flaky skin around my nose and eyebrows, within days of using, my face was all clear, something Dr Murad has yet to do for me, who knew.</li>
      <li>If you have normal to oily skin</li>
      <li>Knowing that skin often needs to adjust to new products, I toughed it out to see if I got better results after using it for a little longer.  </li>
      <li>I have had problems with adult acne my whole adult life.</li>
      <li>It is very natural feeling.</li>
      <li>My skin recently broke out in severe acne, and any kind of soap was extremely irritating to my face, even many soap free cleansers i used were very drying and irritating.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, makes just a little lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so great, after a few months of cleaning I only use it maybe once every other day or so.</li>
      <li>I switched to this after using purpose soap for a while as purpose was making my skin too dry and did not seem right for the face.</li>
      <li>No matter what kind of soap I used or vitamins I took, my skin still seemed to break out worse than ever before.</li>
      <li>Anyone with Normal to Oily skin may use this facial wash twice per day.  </li>
      <li>Does not seem to dry my skin, very gentle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin way too much and</li>

<li> There is a slight warming sensation when first used, but my skin has never looked clearer and been less oily.</li>
<li> Keeps me clear (no pimples or black heads).</li>
<li> It is really skinny and its hard to squeeze the soap out.</li>
<li> Last year was a really rough year for my skin.</li>
<li> even a little is enough to wash the face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had prescription face creams, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything at the drugstore with minimal or no</li>
<li> This stuff is one of the very few face washes that cleanses but does not dry out the skin.</li>
<li> and you really don&#x27;t need much to wash your face, but I can no longer use this bc it makes my face so oily :(.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s rather concentrated so you only need a small amount with each cleaning.</li>
<li> It was less oily than before and the redness had gone down substantially.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m having less acne since I started using this.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time since it&#x27;s thick</li>
<li> We have been using this cleanser for a few years now and have no issues whatsoever with it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s now almost a month later, and my skin is worse than it&#x27;s been in a couple of years.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try the foaming wash, because sometimes when i have really painful lesions i don&#x27;t want to rub my face too much...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne on and off for the past 19 years.  </li>
<li> The only thing I wasnt crazy about is the container it comes in.</li>
<li> Most either react horribly to my skin and/or smell really bad, but this one is a keeper!</li>
<li> , however it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
<li> Perhaps I just reacted badly to this product, but I will not continue using it and would not recommend it.</li>

    <li> I love Himalaya and really love this face wash! at first the scent wasn&#x27;t all too pleasant to me, but you get use to it.My skin is clearer while using this product and not as oily during the day. Keeps my skin soft and clean without over drying</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash. I have had acne for years and in the last year or two, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of wrinkles under my eyes too b/c of severe allergies (I&#x27;m only 25). I use Himalaya Turmeric and Neem face wash and Trillium Organics Oil Free Face Scrub with Tea Tree and Witch Hazel and the Himalaya Nourishing Night Cream even during the day and my face hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash, even on its own, is phenomenal. Sometimes I don&#x27;t make it through the whole ritual and my skin still looks great. Try it, you won&#x27;t go anywhere else :)</li>
    <li> Along with the reviews and the ingredients in this product, I was very interested in what it could do for my oily skin and clogged pores. I&#x27;ve had this facial wash for about a month now and I wanted to try it out first before writing a review. I&#x27;m not quite sure whats in this stuff but it strips my skin of my oils, but I know its listed in the description that it cleans out your pores. Its doing too much \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; for my taste but it does leave my skintone looking resilient! I like that its concentrated and you really don&#x27;t need much to wash your face, but I can no longer use this bc it makes my face so oily :(.</li>
    <li> My skin recently broke out in severe acne, and any kind of soap was extremely irritating to my face, even many soap free cleansers i used were very drying and irritating. This one was not irritating, has GREAT ingredients, and i really think it is helping with my acne, as well as with red marks. Plus it&#x27;s a great price! I have been using this product for several months. I&#x27;m going to try the foaming wash, because sometimes when i have really painful lesions i don&#x27;t want to rub my face too much...</li>
    <li> The ENTIRE line of Organique Skin Care by Himalaya Herbal is superb!  This facial wash is non-stripping and leaves the skin feeling fresh and clean - Smells great too!  Anyone with Normal to Oily skin may use this facial wash twice per day.  Follow it up with their Day lotion.  You may wish to try their well formulated facial scrub too.</li>
    <li> If you have normal to oily skin this product is for you. It has a luxurious feel and light refreshing scent. Everyone I know who&#x27;s tried it loves it! Only product that has cleared up my acne and kept my skin clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> We have been using this cleanser for a few years now and have no issues whatsoever with it.  I would recommend it with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have oily/combination skin. This stuff is one of the very few face washes that cleanses but does not dry out the skin. The ingredients are also quite decent! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really love this product! Last year was a really rough year for my skin. No matter what kind of soap I used or vitamins I took, my skin still seemed to break out worse than ever before. In desperation, I went to a health food store and a woman there suggested I try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within days my skin looked better! It was less oily than before and the redness had gone down substantially. It&#x27;s rather concentrated so you only need a small amount with each cleaning. Boy, could I tell a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suggested this product to numerous friends. It&#x27;s so great, after a few months of cleaning I only use it maybe once every other day or so. I will never try another product! I am a customer for life :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this face wash, also love the fact that it is all natural...and I am not putting chemicals on my face. The price is great too! The only thing I wasnt crazy about is the container it comes in. It is really skinny and its hard to squeeze the soap out.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different facial soaps. Most either react horribly to my skin and/or smell really bad, but this one is a keeper! The smell reminds me of an herb garden or potpourri. I feel like it really cleans my face without drying it out. I plan on sticking with this product. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I was using Neutrogena Naturals Face wash and makeup remover, which I loved, until I found out it has Benzyl Alcohol, which is a known irritant and neurotoxin!!! How natural is that right? So I inmediatly started searching for an alternative and this popped up. I decided to try it. Well I really like it. It cleanses really well (although I find I need to wash twice to get all the make up off, unless I use jojoba or coconut oil as a pre-wash wich I usualy do anyway), without drying. My face is left clean, smooth and fresh after use. Keeps me clear (no pimples or black heads). And it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out on my jawline like the Neutrogena sometimes did. It does have a strongh herbal sent. It is not my taste, but it is not bad. I don&#x27;t love it, but I kind of like it. It is very natural feeling. It reminds me I&#x27;m using something good for me, which makes me feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it, and feel great about using something totaly natural and free of carcinogens and neurotoxins. So I&#x27;m sticking with it. The price is not bad either considering the quality and the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Getting into mid thirties also brought on severe acne and made me feel like a teenager again. My husband gifted me the whole himalaya set for my birthday. Among them was the face wash and boy!, was it a life saver. I started using it twice a day instead of soap and I could immediately see a reduction in the acne. Its been a year now and I have not stopped using it. And of course, I am acne free:) I keep telling my husband, this is the most useful gift I have got! Thanks Himalaya!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having less acne since I started using this. It feels anti-inflammatory. It lasts a long time since it&#x27;s thick and you don&#x27;t need to use much. Two bottles might last me a year.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after using purpose soap for a while as purpose was making my skin too dry and did not seem right for the face. I was looking at something organic after using just the Neem face wash from Himalaya given to me by a friend. This works great with acne.org products I use. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin way too much and even a little is enough to wash the face. Price at Amazon is not bad either specially with super saver or prime.</li>
