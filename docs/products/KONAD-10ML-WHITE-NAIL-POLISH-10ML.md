      <li>All in all I am impressed and will be ordering this polish again sometime soon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Konad, so of course it&#x27;s good! ..</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly, great product.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that great</li>
      <li>It came in a great looking package and was a lot bigger that what the picture led me to believe which was a very good thing.</li>
      <li>Beautiful definition in the stamps, and it was super easy to use.</li>
      <li>I really love konad nail polish.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this polish.</li>
      <li>That worked better.</li>
      <li>white konad is the best color for nail plate stamping.  </li>
      <li>Works ok.</li>
      <li>Love Konad.</li>
      <li>so I have to use more and redo my stamps often.  </li>
      <li>Other polishes don&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The thicker polishes work best to the Konad Plates.</li>
      <li>Makes a huge difference when stamping with these polishes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stamped w/it &amp; then w/a detailed nail brush</li>
      <li>I own the black and white polishes and am very impressed with he quality, thickness and pigmentation of the polish.</li>
      <li>I just did my daughter&#x27;s (my 17 year old) nails yesterday with the Konad white, turned out good.  </li>
      <li>the shipping was very fast</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think you have to be married to this product.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s simply just awesome, very high contrast for nail stamping art that I couldn&#x27;t get with a regular white color!</li>
      <li>Much better for stamping than the average polish.</li>
      <li>I do stamping regular polish over gel manicure a lot, with either a gel topcoat or a regular top coat.  </li>
      <li>This stamping nail polish dries really quick it doesn&#x27;t give the extra time to stamp your nails</li>
      <li>Well worth it for white.</li>
      <li>I found that this stamping type KONAD polish does work well, but it does dry really quick.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t care if it loses the shine because I apply gel on top anyway..., but I am just sayin&#x27;...</li>
      <li>Nice thick white stamping polish.</li>
      <li>Can leave a little overlapped dry stamping stuff on the edges that can easily be cleaned off with a brush of nonacetone remover (I use this so it doesn&#x27;t muck up my gel</li>
      <li>Other whites just don&#x27;t seem opaque enough, and seem to stamp less crisp or bold.  </li>
      <li>I used it with a Konad stamp I bought and found it didn&#x27;t really do what I had expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to nail stamping (late, I know), but I&#x27;m having lots of fun with it.</li>
      <li>The polish is not as thick as the original stuff</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m excited to use a color other than black for stamping designs.</li>
      <li>I have found other less expensive polishes to stamp with in other colors( like Sally Hansen Insta-Dry), but this white has, so far, been the best!</li>

<li> This polish works every single time I don&#x27;t have any problem with using those for stamps</li>
<li> I ordered both the black and the white Konad polish.</li>
<li> Same with the black one that I bought from KONAD.</li>
<li> Polish is just like any other albeit a bit thicker.</li>
<li> 4 star item, not 5, not 3, at least for me.</li>
<li> but remember - you can use ANY thick polish for nail stamping.</li>
<li> Frustrating!</li>
<li> but it proved me wrong!</li>

    <li> Works ok. Decided to try reqular white polish. That worked better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping (late, I know), but I&#x27;m having lots of fun with it. I ordered both the black and the white Konad polish. These are the two must-haves for stamping. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Polish is just like any other albeit a bit thicker. I used it with a Konad stamp I bought and found it didn&#x27;t really do what I had expected.</li>
    <li> I own the black and white polishes and am very impressed with he quality, thickness and pigmentation of the polish. I use these for my stamping also from Konad.</li>
    <li> I used this polish it seems to leave a residual .. I am just starting out.. I will give a final 4 star rating</li>
    <li> The polish is not as thick as the original stuff so I have to use more and redo my stamps often.  Frustrating!</li>
    <li> Beautiful definition in the stamps, and it was super easy to use. Much better for stamping than the average polish.

    <li> Love Konad. Makes a huge difference when stamping with these polishes.</li>

    <li> Arrived very quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> This stamping nail polish dries really quick it doesn&#x27;t give the extra time to stamp your nails</li>
    <li> This works just as well as it&#x27;s supposed to but remember - you can use ANY thick polish for nail stamping. We&#x27;ve discovered that! Don&#x27;t think you have to be married to this product. We have a nail salon.</li>
    <li> I really love konad nail polish. I receive tons of compliments on my nail designs. the shipping was very fast and I&#x27;m excited to use a color other than black for stamping designs.</li>
    <li> The best stamping polish</li>
    <li> Seems to be old..., is pretty thick! Same with the black one that I bought from KONAD. I had to add Acetone, I don&#x27;t care if it loses the shine because I apply gel on top anyway..., but I am just sayin&#x27;...</li>
    <li> I do stamping regular polish over gel manicure a lot, with either a gel topcoat or a regular top coat.  I found that this stamping type KONAD polish does work well, but it does dry really quick.  Can leave a little overlapped dry stamping stuff on the edges that can easily be cleaned off with a brush of nonacetone remover (I use this so it doesn&#x27;t muck up my gel manicures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you HAVE to use Konad stamping polishes? NO!  Any thicker polish will do, cheap or expensive. You just have to test it out trial and error.  I just did my daughter&#x27;s (my 17 year old) nails yesterday with the Konad white, turned out good.  BUT.. I could have also gotten the look with another polish.  So don&#x27;t feel like you HAVE to use this.  I included a pic of the manicure I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid 4 star item, not 5, not 3, at least for me.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s simply just awesome, very high contrast for nail stamping art that I couldn&#x27;t get with a regular white color!</li>
    <li> white konad is the best color for nail plate stamping.  I&#x27;ve stamped w/it &amp; then w/a detailed nail brush I add color desired</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Konad, so of course it&#x27;s good! .. I have found other less expensive polishes to stamp with in other colors( like Sally Hansen Insta-Dry), but this white has, so far, been the best! It is my go-to polish when stamping a white image.  Other whites just don&#x27;t seem opaque enough, and seem to stamp less crisp or bold.  The closest inexpensive polish I&#x27;ve found that will &#x27;do the job&#x27; is Spoiled \\&quot;color correction tape\\&quot;.  As I stamp weekly, I will definately end up buying another bottle of the Konad white stamping polish, though.  Well worth it for white.</li>
    <li> If you are a Konad-er then use the best. Other polishes don&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The thicker polishes work best to the Konad Plates.</li>
