### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best purchase ever.</li>
      <li>good to see it was working good.</li>
      <li>The PHI Portable Rechargeable Cordless Hair Straightener works good.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the Rechargeable</li>
      <li>when I first got this straightener I thought it would be perfect because of the size and stuff</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>could close tighter buy otherwise great for summer bangs and keeping them straight in humid weather</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and hold power for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It also looked cheaply glued together.</li>
      <li>The item was cheap and defected.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to start using it</li>
      <li>/&gt;HOWEVER...you would have better luck warming two rocks in the sun and pressing your hair between them if you want it straight.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t have super curly hair to begin</li>
      <li>very small and fits in my purse and is great for touching up my&lt;br</li>
      <li>but once unplugged the low battery light flashes and doesn&#x27;t get hot it only gets warm.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
      <li>I can touch it with my fingers at the hottest point - which takes FOREVER to get hot.  </li>
      <li>I am able to use the cheapest of flat or curling irons to make a difference on my hair and this one won&#x27;t make a dent.  </li>
      <li>The real test will come when I charge it in the car for Bonnaroo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>\\&quot;For a rechargeable flat iron, not bad.</li>
      <li>its like a cheap little toy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m mixed (black/white) and I have very curly hair that has been relaxed.</li>
      <li>Probably should have tested it when I first received it instead of waiting so long to try to use it.</li>
      <li>Battery life is short, but the plates hold your hair and it gets hot enough to straighten it.</li>
      <li>The thing charged right up, turned on and stayed on long enough to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My* search for a decent cordless flat iron continues ...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up as much, not what I expected.</li>
      <li>Everything negative you read about it is true.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The highest setting (allegedly 410 degrees) didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten a single strand of my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Button fell out and Didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge, fell apart. Bad purchase.</li>
    <li> The straightener came with some battery life but the cord wouldn&#x27;t go in properly, so it couldn&#x27;t be charged, which made the product useless. It also looked cheaply glued together. Very questionable whether or not it was a real PHI straightener. I&#x27;m also suspect about the fact that it was reduced from $215 to $26, maybe they knew the product was dysfunctional and they were selling them anyways.</li>
    <li> The PHI Portable Rechargeable Cordless Hair Straightener works good. good to see it was working good. that&#x27;s all i can say.</li>
    <li> I held off on writing this review because I kept hoping this flat iron would improve. It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest setting (allegedly 410 degrees) didn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten a single strand of my hair. Seriously, I separated one strand and tried to straighten it. Nope, still wavy. And I don&#x27;t have super curly hair to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. *My* search for a decent cordless flat iron continues ...</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the Rechargeable straighter.&lt;br /&gt;Its very small and fits in my purse and is great for touching up my&lt;br /&gt;hair at the end of the day when I&#x27;m on the go</li>
    <li> It pulls my hair a little bit.  Charges stays for a long time.  Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;For a rechargeable flat iron, not bad. Battery life is short, but the plates hold your hair and it gets hot enough to straighten it. The real test will come when I charge it in the car for Bonnaroo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quote was from before I used it at Bonnaroo. I did not have a problem with the battery life whatsoever. The thing charged right up, turned on and stayed on long enough to do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...you would have better luck warming two rocks in the sun and pressing your hair between them if you want it straight. I&#x27;m mixed (black/white) and I have very curly hair that has been relaxed. This thing didn&#x27;t to ANYTHING to my hair in the heat and humidity of June in Tennessee. If you need to use it on the go, like, maybe to touch up your bangs after high school gym class or if you need something to sorta straighten kinda wavy hair inside where there is little humidity and the a/c is kickin&#x27;, then yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to straighten your hair while camping, do yourself a favor, get a travel sized, low wattage flat iron, and get one of those jump starter/charger things with an air compressor and plug that guy in to it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even work. Had to send it back to the vendor, disappointing as I was traveling to Europe and didn&#x27;t have time to order a different one.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all.  I can touch it with my fingers at the hottest point - which takes FOREVER to get hot.  I am able to use the cheapest of flat or curling irons to make a difference on my hair and this one won&#x27;t make a dent.  It&#x27;s terrible, and I try really hard to give everything a chance.</li>
    <li> The item was cheap and defected. Everything negative you read about it is true. The power button was a struggle to use and one of the plates would not heat up at all.</li>
    <li> Charges for hrs but once unplugged the low battery light flashes and doesn&#x27;t get hot it only gets warm. This flat iron is a real disappointment</li>
    <li> The straightener would not heat up at all. Always remained lukewarm temperature. All other features were desirable but it just didnt work</li>
    <li> didnt work...had to return it</li>
    <li> I love it! It heats up fast and hold power for a good amount of time. Best purchase ever.(:</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as much, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> could close tighter buy otherwise great for summer bangs and keeping them straight in humid weather</li>
    <li> Poor quality, cheap,very cheap product, it  does not straighten hair, it  worked for one use only , it stoped working, it turns on for 3 seconds and then it turns off.</li>
    <li> Never worked.  I am very disappointed with this product.  I just recently tried to use it.  A waste of money.  Probably should have tested it when I first received it instead of waiting so long to try to use it.</li>
    <li> when I first got this straightener I thought it would be perfect because of the size and stuff but... I WAS WRONG first time I tried charging it, and wait and hour or two I try and turn it on and nothing happens! its like a cheap little toy and it looks like one too I was so excited to start using it but now I&#x27;m so mad and disappointed that it don&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> After charged doesn&#x27;t even last long, heat power is very low.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought it a month before my trek to Europe.  Got here and it didn&#x27;t work.  I should have tested it during the  return date.  Really disappointed</li>
