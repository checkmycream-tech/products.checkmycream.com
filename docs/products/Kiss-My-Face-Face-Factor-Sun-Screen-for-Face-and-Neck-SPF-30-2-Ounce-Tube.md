      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>

      <li>Love, my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>This stuff lasts, goes on well (almost more lotion like), protects.  </li>
      <li>It has a rating of 3 on Skin Deep, which isn&#x27;t the best....</li>
      <li>My Face sunscreens that received a better rating from EWG,  this isn&#x27;t the one you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I even tried it a couple of times a week apart to make sure it was this product.  </li>
      <li>so I was looking for something that made my skin more matte.</li>
      <li>- I still wear an eye-makeup primer on top, and haven&#x27;t had any &amp;#34;creasing&amp;#34; issues.  </li>
      <li>This product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my face as it should, but for someone with an oiler complexion, this would work okay.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>it  feels great, is very moisturizing, has a nice clean smell (no fragrance), and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect consistency, not too dry but not greasy.</li>
      <li>I feel very cool after use.  </li>
      <li>It goes on top of my moisturizer smoothly.</li>
      <li>Absorbs well, scent is not overpowering, and- most importantly of all-</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other lotions, excellent price point, and it&#x27;s a sunblock.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply</li>
      <li>My skin is very fair and pretty sensitive.  </li>
      <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t cause my face to get all oily halfway through the day like my previous product.  </li>
      <li>I love the texture - it feels like a normal, medium-weight, nice face lotion.</li>
      <li>When I apply foundation over it, it doesn&#x27;t ball or pill up, and my makeup goes on smoothly over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great choice for those who feel the same way!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this for the first time recently and was happy to discover that it felt similar to a facial hydrating lotion rather than the usual greasy sunscreen. It was effective as a sunblock.</li>
    <li> I always do my homework before I purchase any product but especially when I am purchasing something that I am going to put on my face.  This product is NOT lightweight and is it NOT for normal/combination skin.  I have normal/combination skin and this sunscreen is heavy and greasy.  Skin care products have gotten too expensive in the past few years and very few of them live up to their promises; I tried this one because of the description and because it was very reasonably priced.  I guess I will go back to the Roc daily moisturizer [[ASIN:B002BWOXYE RoC Multi-Correxion 4-Zone Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, 1.7 Ounce]] that I have been using.  Amazon&#x27;s return policy was exceptional-no complaints there.</li>
    <li> Sunburned and wierd feel when applied. Very dry feeling, not moisturizing</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and I use two moisturizers under make up. This is one of them.  Doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or leave a white cast</li>
    <li> Purchased based on the EWG list, and happy with it.  A little goes a long way, and it blends in well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen &amp; I use it everyday. It has never caused me any issues with my skin - no breakouts or any clogged pores. It seems the ingredients are minimal and organic and I like that a lot. I would give it 5 stars if the price was a bit lower or quantity was a bit higher. I tend to spend a good deal of money on sunscreen - and although I know it is worth it, I know I could get it cheaper elsewhere. But, I like the quality of this product and the Kiss My Face Brand so much that I will stick with it! It is still my favorite!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s very moisturizing with a subtle scent. I sometimes use it in the evening as well when my face feels dry in the winter.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell to this product. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped on time but I did not receive the item listed. I bought kiss my face face and neck factor SPF 30, but I received kiss my face face and neck factor spf 50. I have used the SPF 30 before and I love it! The SPF 50 was irritating to my skin and made me break out! Very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This was a recommendation on a beauty site that said it was good for sensitive skin.  I tried it and it caused irritation and redness, so I will not be using.  I even tried it a couple of times a week apart to make sure it was this product.  Too bad, it got good reviews.</li>
    <li> i like and also use in place of face lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few brands of mineral sunscreens that rate well on the EWG site for safe sunscreens.  This one is perhaps my favorite for face and neck as it blends in just like regular moisturizer.  Very happy with this and will repeat buy!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by beautypedia (love this site) for sensitive skin, however it burned the skin around my eyes. I need to stick to barrier sunscreens only in this area (versus synthetics).</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good for sun protection, but it smells like sunscreen and clogs my pours. I have to rinse my face really well before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> This is a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen.  Works well.  I have sensitive skin and it is great.  I read a recommendation for it and I tried it.  I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some of the other stuff out there.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It feels like a moisturizer rather than a sunscreen.  It does not sting or burn my skin like so many other sunscreens.  It does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy either. I have one complaint and that is that the packaging sucks.  I hate the tube because the mouth opening is way too big and makes it very messy to dispense.  I wish they would put this in a pump bottle instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: While i really liked the feel of this sunscreen I have discovered that it does not offer the level of protection that I really need to prevent sun damage and wrinkles.  I have switched to \\&quot;Eco Logical&#x27;s\\&quot; face sunscreen, as that one does - and feels great too!  I deducted 1 stars from my original 5  Check out the EWG website&#x27;s sunscreen rating guide.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;Besides possessing all the desirable ingredients suggested for maximum sun protection, this formula works well with my skin type (normal).</li>
    <li> Never get sunburnt with this on my face. Also, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> It goes on top of my moisturizer smoothly. I like the feel (not heavy or sticky). The fragrance is minimal so it does not overwhelm. I definitely will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I use it everyday not greasy feeling no white mask.</li>
    <li> This is an effective moisturizer as well as sunscreen without a lot of harmful ingredients.  It is also reasonably priced and I like having it in my subscribe and save line up so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the bottle I received was only half full?</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is perfect. Absorbs well, scent is not overpowering, and- most importantly of all- It leaves no white residue on my face! I am a fairly dark african american and this has been a a long-time problem for me. If you are worried at all about white residue hiding your lovely skin color, don&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Love it! No sticky white face. Smooth and light and dries to a beautiful finish. Found my new go- to facial sunscreen.... Doesn&#x27;t get better than this! And the price......!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive skin. The ingredient says that it contain no alcohol, no fragrance, and contain a lot of natural ingredient, yet it still cause my face and neck to breakout. Once absorbed, it doesn&#x27;t easily wash off and stay very long, so it clogged up my pores and cause acne. I have thin, fair skin that is easily get burned; this product does prevent the burning, but need to be washed off thoroughly once you inside and then reapply again every time you go outside.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my face as it should, but for someone with an oiler complexion, this would work okay.</li>
    <li> This is my go to moisturizer/sun block.</li>
    <li> perfect for everyday use. Not too greasy and rated high on EWG skincare database.</li>
    <li> I feel very cool after use.  I don&#x27;t like it.  I think it is not strong enough to protect sunshine.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. It is a good sunscreen and a good moisturizer. And it is an all natural product. I get this through Subscribe &amp; Save</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started wearing sunblock on my face and neck every day, and threw out the products that contained chemical sunscreens know to be endocrine disrupters.  This product has the perfect amount of non-greasy moisture and no intrusive smells.  My skin is dry and likes a bit of extra moisture, so be cautious if you already have oily skin. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a new standard in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is one of the best i&#x27;ve used and the price is CHEAP! Protects everytime i go for a swim and for me living in this country of Singapore, Sun screens is a must when you go for a swim in the morning/afternoon.</li>
    <li> not greasy nor sticky, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin, doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. my face is sensitive from recent chemical peel and this product does not sting at all and my skin wasn&#x27;t burned so this product protects well, too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen. My skin gets very dry very quickly, and this is one of the few sunscreens in an affordable price range that I can wear comfortably.</li>
    <li> I have brown skin and I&#x27;m very happy with this sun screen A) because it doesn&#x27;t leave nasy chalkly ugly residue and B) it has an acceptable rating from EWG.  -Finally found a product to replace my Neutrogena brand that was full of toxins. Great product.</li>
    <li> love it, only gave it four stars because I have not wore it in the summer yet so not sure how well it works in that aspect</li>
    <li> Definitely not my holy grail of sunscreens but some might really like it. For reference I have sensitive acne prone skin. I love that it&#x27;s really natural and was recommended by Paula of Paula&#x27;s choice but I&#x27;m not *crazy* about it because it still feels and smells like sunscreen...not what I was hoping for on my face as a daily SPF.</li>
    <li> This face lotion isvery nice. It&#x27;s got very natural ingredients and soaks in very good and the price is nice at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I want to be good about wearing sunscreen everyday, but the smell and texture often turns me off. This is a great choice for those who feel the same way! There&#x27;s a very slight scent that goes away quickly. It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t oily. My only wish is that you got more product for your $$.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne-prone skin so what I look for in a sunscreen is (1) it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, (2) doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue, (3) doesn&#x27;t leave my face super shiny, and (4) doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is suffocating underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a male, I like to have my lotion and sunscreen combined in one and I was previous using Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer 15 SPF but I found that using that leaves my skin very shiny/glossy. I have naturally oily skin so I was looking for something that made my skin more matte. I realize that perhaps the best solution is putting on no lotion or sunscreen but that isn&#x27;t an option for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that to say, this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me break out, doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel super thick. However, it does make my skin somewhat shiny, not as shiny as Olay but nonetheless shiny. So this sunscreen is good but I will continue my search.</li>
    <li> I used this product before and loved the consistency and coverage, however,  I think the formula has changed. Immediately after I applied this I developed a rash at my jawline and around my lips. I ordered three tubes and had to throw them all in the garbage.</li>
    <li> A sun screen solution - with no odor - and because my skin is sensitive - needed something for my face that would not break my skin out.  This sun screen works.</li>
    <li> FINALLY!!! I finally found a face sunscreen that I&#x27;m satisfied with! This stuff lasts, goes on well (almost more lotion like), protects.  Even at 30SPF I found I was reapplying just in case and probably didn&#x27;t even really need it.  I returned several kinds to Walmart before researching and trying Kiss My Face.  My skin is very fair and pretty sensitive.  I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.  The only, very slightly, negative, is that the tube wasn&#x27;t very full. On a 11 day vacation I was fearful of running out.  So I might advise to order two, unless it was just a fluke and it was just my tube.  Otherwise, great!!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer/sunscreen!  I highly recommend it!  I give it four stars because for me, it&#x27;s not the suncreen that I will reach for 100% of the time.  It is very moisturizing, not heavy, just very hydrating and I just don&#x27;t need that much hydrating everyday.  I have very sensitive skin that bounces between being very dry to oily in my t-zone.  I swap between this and a lighter moisturizer daily.  This is a staple in my beauty drawer.</li>
    <li> This burned my face.  I use EltaMD chemical sunscreens, but the Kiss My Face burned my face.  I used it on my hands, and it was ok, but smelled funny.  Also, I think it&#x27;s weird that the tube does not come with any seal whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, I ordered it on the Friday and it arrived on Wednesday. I would give 5 stars if the packaging had been better. It is a soft tube with a flip top that can easily get squished in the mail system and the top could flip up and the contents would then seep out. This didn&#x27;t happen luckily, but the tube arrived in just a paper envelope and I think it would be a lot safer in a little box or at least a padded envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cream itself I have yet to try it for long enough to say for sure, but I bought it on the strength of many great reviews on various make-up and skin care sites. I will update when I have used in for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  I used to use Cetaphil facial moisturizer with 50 SPF, but it would leave a white residue on my beige complexion.  I still have some left, but don&#x27;t feel like finishing it after trying Kiss My Face.  Kiss my face goes on smooth and quickly and absorbs without any white residue or film. Cetaphil did not easily absorb in my skin and felt greasy.  So far, kiss my face sunscreen is not greasy and has not caused breakouts either. I also like that it has a score of 1 on EWG (it&#x27;s a low hazard sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I wish it came in a higher SPF.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun protection without clogging pores or causing a greasy feeling.  Sinks right in.  I can wear this under makeup with no problem.  I use it daily.  Staple product in my house!</li>
    <li> Good sunburn protectant, but not sweatproof, be sure to reappy!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this, I&#x27;d heard it wasn&#x27;t great for oily skin. I have to say for me at least it works great.  It&#x27;s really moisturizing without being oily or making me break out.</li>
    <li> Kids like it.  It gets used.  May not be as good a well known brands but hard to set up a test lab to find out.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin where my T-zone is very oily and the rest of my face gets very dry after washing, even with mild soap. A good daily moisturizer is essential for me. This moisturizer is my new favorite! This doesn&#x27;t get greasy on my T-zone at all, even if I accidentally apply a little too much. My skin just feels smoother. I wanted to try it for awhile without makeup to see how my skin reacts, but I&#x27;m confident that makeup can be applied very easily over the top. I&#x27;m also a big fan of how big of a bargain this is! My old favorite was $15 for 1.7 fl. oz. Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> First day to use. Smooth, not greasy feeling. The only thing that makes me uncomfortable is packaging. I wish it had some kind of sealing on the mouth of the tube, then consumers can peel that off. The tube does not have a box, then does not have a seal...Will go back to update after using it to see if it helps. Overall, I like it</li>
    <li> Learned of this product from Beautypedia.com and had to try, as it was the lowest priced moisturizer with SPF with a &#x27;Best&#x27; rating.  I am so glad I did! After years (and years) of loyalty to Oil of Olay Complete I am now a convert and have a new HG daily moisturizer.  Effective, gentle, not too oily, and no white caste.  Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t cause my face to get all oily halfway through the day like my previous product.  Works great under makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a week and love it so far! It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out like Neutrogena sunscreen does, it&#x27;s not too thick, and it doesn&#x27;t look white when applied. I like that it&#x27;s moisturizing since I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Too runny, but I&#x27;ll use all of it.  After it&#x27;s gone I&#x27;ll probably switch brands.</li>
    <li> This is loaded with skin benefiting ingredients. I use this on myself and my kids.  It is excellent for sensitive and acne prone skin. Does not cause breakouts and does not leave a white cast. Great for under makeup too. Complete success!</li>
    <li> Love using this sunscreen !  I would definitely  buy again !</li>
    <li> I did some research before buying this, and I&#x27;m really happy with it. it  feels great, is very moisturizing, has a nice clean smell (no fragrance), and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. It has the safest ingredients for sun protection- zinc oxide, without leaving a white case, contains no irritating fragrance, and is nice and moisturizing. Paula Begoun recommends it, and she points out that it contains skin benefiting anti-oxidants, so I feel even better about using it.</li>
    <li> Long expiration date. Feels good.</li>
    <li> Non greasy excellent coverage. Quality sunscreen. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Blends well, not greasy, not too thick, not perfumey. Not as many chemicals on my skin. I would buy again</li>
    <li> The item I received is not the item pictured.  My tube says with Hydresia on it.  However, it is decent sunblock but no miracle.  I mix it with my moisturizer and apply makeup over it.  My face is never white.  But, for me, like all sunblocks, this one gives me lots of comedones and bumps....</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunscreen after reading the review on the EWG.org website.  What I RECEIVED was an older product that contains octinoxate, and octisalate, both toxic and rated a 6 on a scale of 1-10.  The picture is of a Kiss MY Face sunscreen that is rate a very safe 1.&lt;br /&gt;I have put the exact name of the product that I want, and every time the picture of the front is correct, but the ingredient list is wrong.  I guess I will have to go to the health food store to purchase, so that I can make certain that the ingredients are correct.  Be careful when ordering!</li>
    <li> Fell good. Works under makeup.</li>
    <li> good product. no yucky SPF smell and goes on nice. i put under my makeup</li>
    <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have staying power and must be reapplied often for protection. Too often to be useful for an active day in the sun.</li>
    <li> I wear this sunscreen under my foundation. It is the perfect consistency, not too dry but not greasy. I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> i have been using this for years....it is the only product that I can put on my face and not have my eyes start tearing up.  If they make a stronger than 30 SPF I may buy that one because the determatolgist always advises me to put sunscreen on my face.</li>
    <li> Very nice; moisturizing and effective. It has a rating of 3 on Skin Deep, which isn&#x27;t the best....My only complaint is that I think the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> Feels light and seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is thicker than what I am used to. It does rub in nicely and after a bit I can put my makeup on.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not 100% chemical free, but it blends in well, no oil greasy feel, and I didn&#x27;t get burned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried seeral sunscreens for my face that are well-reviewed by the EWG, and this one has passed my test for wearability. It does not feel heavy or greasy, and I don&#x27;t feel any difference under my makeup compared to a drugstore sunscreen. The white color does not persist, it covers easily and smoothly. Has not irritated my skin. Highly recommend, and I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> Works o.k. but makes my fair skin look ashy even when adding tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!!! It goes on super light and creamy. After a minute or  two it is completely absorbed. Smell is fresh and not strong. Good value as well for a SPF 40 sunscreen that is paraben free. That is hard to find. Thanks Amazon and Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen without all the nasty chemicals and no scent at a much lower price than at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It goes on easily, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin, and the tube is small enough to carry with me all the time.</li>
    <li> Very protective and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I need to wear sunscreen every day since I have very fair skin and, two years ago, had some pre-melanoma moles removed.  I like to use products on my face that are paraben-free, and the last few years I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000Q8R7KW Devita Solar Protective Moisturizer SPF 30+ -- 2.5 fl oz]].  While I like the Devita product, I&#x27;ve noticed that the sunscreen starts to get too chunky about midway through the tube, after which point it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well.  This Kiss My Face sunscreen (like the Devita) has the lowest toxicity rating on the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paula Begoun (the \\&quot;Cosmetics Cop\\&quot;) has also given this product a rating of \\&quot;Best\\&quot; on her website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this sunscreen so far!  It&#x27;s lighter than the Devita one, and sinks in pretty quickly.  When I apply foundation over it, it doesn&#x27;t ball or pill up, and my makeup goes on smoothly over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell, and doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review as I use this more, but, for now, I will say that I really love it!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well, doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue, and is non-greasy to the touch. If you aren&#x27;t overly concerned about the ingredients of your sunscreen, this product works very well, and it&#x27;s rating from the Environmental Working Group for safety is a 3 (moderate). However, if you&#x27;re like me and you are looking for one of the Kiss My Face sunscreens that received a better rating from EWG,  this isn&#x27;t the one you&#x27;re looking for. The first ingredient is octinoxate, which receives a rating of 6 (high concern). If you&#x27;re looking for a very safe sunscreen from Kiss My Face, try their Mineral Lotion formulate, at http://www.amazon.com/Kiss-My-Face-Sunscreen-Hydresia/dp/B006OC431K.</li>
    <li> This is very good value for money. Feels just rich enough for dry skin, without being sticky. It has all the needed ingredients to keep skin healthy and the product is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy, but is absorbed quickly; I apply it on eyelids and under my eyes, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation - I still wear an eye-makeup primer on top, and haven&#x27;t had any &amp;#34;creasing&amp;#34; issues.  Love the fact that it&#x27;s not scented - great product!</li>
    <li> Love, my favorite.  I use as my daytime moisturizer every day.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out like other lotions, excellent price point, and it&#x27;s a sunblock.  Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. This works better than any face sunscreen that I&#x27;ve tried, even the more expensive brands such as DeVita and Elta MD. It says it&#x27;s fragrance-free, but I can detect a slight odor, but it goes away in a few minutes. It may be the aloe or cucumber. Soaks in quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky, no residue. Good ingredients and peptides too. And best of all, it&#x27;s a weightless &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34;. I hate the feel of anything on my face, whether it be moisturizer, make-up or sunscreen. A few minutes after application, the feeling of it being on my skin completely vanishes. I feel this gives very good protection. Plenty of expiration date left when it arrived, about 2-1/2 years. One complaint, no seal on the tube, but since it shipped direct from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller, I feel confident it hasn&#x27;t been used by someone else.</li>
    <li> Gentle and effective. Other sunscreens tend to make my sensitive itchy and reactive- this one does not!</li>
    <li> Stinks like sunscreen all day long.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen was very harsh on my face...after using it 2 days in a row my entire forehead broke out in a rash.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen without parabens. This one is excellent. No scent and goes on very smooth. Not greasy and absorbs really quickly. I like the SPF 30, just right for my face. Wonderful natural ingredients in there. Does not leave your face looking white. It is expensive for a rather small tube but I think it is worth it. Recommend highly and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this lotion after reading EWG&#x27;s data base. Unfortunately, it arrived half empty. The bottle itself doesn&#x27;t look like empty, but if you look at it through the light you&#x27;ll notice that the lotion is in the bottom of the tube.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen rubs in well and protects quite well from the sun. My complaints about it are that it is a bit greasy and can cause breakouts if you use it day after day and have sensitive skin with pores that are easily clogged. Overall a good sunscreen though and one I feel comfortable recommending.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite spf for my face. I like that it rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It does have a hint of beachy sunscreen scent but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I use this as a sunscreen / moisturizer under my makeup on sunny days where I will be outside more. It&#x27;s thick but not greasy and absorbs well. I layer on a primer right after applying this and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday daytime face moisturizer. I love the texture - it feels like a normal, medium-weight, nice face lotion. It is not greasy in the least, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white or grey cast to my naturally tan-colored skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The only time it didn&#x27;t perform well was after a single application for a several-hour, wet boat ride and snorkeling trip - but that was my fault, and not what this product is intended for anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this twice now, and plan to continue using it indefinitely as my daily SPF facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Does not make my ski breakout. Easy to apply</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin a little greasy.</li>
    <li> Great Sunscreen.  Has little to no order, not oily and only needs a small amount to cover your face.  I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily and I had no problems with this at all.</li>
    <li> I like it. it&#x60;s very nice!</li>
    <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks, I got tired of the stickiness/greasiness of Kiss My Face. Kind of itched too. Good enough for neck, arms, etc. Found Elta MD products on Amazon, very expensive but worth every penny. I use them to this day with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I have horrendous skin. No major skin disease or anything, but I&#x27;m pushing 40 and I have regular acne breakouts (almost never completely clear), blotchy redness, sensitive to everything. I&#x27;m a guy so I&#x27;ve never really had the discipline to get it under control, and I don&#x27;t lose sleep over it, but I live in so cal and I&#x27;m out on the water a lot so I need an everyday sunscreen to avoid looking like a catcher&#x27;s mitt. I also want it to be reasonably safe, this gets a 3 from EWG and I can live with that, none of the worst chemicals they warn about. I have tried many sunscreens and the ones I can use on my body either make my face sting all day and turn redder than usual, or get sticky, greasy and uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t even really mind the white washing from some physical sunscreens, but they clump up or get itchy on my face after a little while. This sunscreen does none of that. It is truly the only one I have ever tried that I forget about after I put it on.  It does not clog my pores, and has not caused any breakouts or itching. It seems to work well enough, although I have only been using it for a week. If something goes wrong I will change my review, but to this point, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face and when I do outdoor activities even in the winter.  It goes on smoothly, smells nice and I love that it is &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;</li>
