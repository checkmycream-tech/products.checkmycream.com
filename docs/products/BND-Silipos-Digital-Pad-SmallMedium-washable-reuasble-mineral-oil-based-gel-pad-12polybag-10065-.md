      <li>they are wonderful!  </li>
      <li>These are great.  </li>
      <li>They are great and comfortable to wear....Very happy with product.</li>
      <li>I love them!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now been wearing these pads for about 8 months and, for the most part, they have been a successful option to surgery.</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>He is pretty darned happy.  </li>
      <li>They prevent any rubbing against my hammer toes and are very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear.</li>
      <li>Good, fast service.</li>
      <li>They are easy to pop on and they do the trick</li>
      <li>Thank goodness these easy pads are made for those of us who have toes that are now bent and rub on our shoes..</li>
      <li>Five stars are not enough for happy feet.</li>
      <li>At the time, I was facing the prospect of a knee replacement, so I told him that had to be my primary concern at the time.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and clean.</li>
      <li>I was originally given two of these by my podiatrist at a cost of $5.00 each, and then I found them here for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and really do the job.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t wear them this summer with sandals, but they are great for closed shoes.  </li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m primarily wearing sandals since it is summertime.  </li>
      <li>actually like these BETTER than the one he gave me, because the silicone pad on these is an oval shape whereas the one he gave me was square and much more bulky.</li>
      <li>He LOVES these and said it is so comfortable that he wants to sleep in them so that the sheets don&#x27;t rub on his toes.  </li>
      <li>These helped stop that and keep my feet pretty.</li>
      <li>(They are easily washed by putting in a net bag and tossing the bag in the washer.)</li>
      <li>It is hard to get more important than that.</li>
      <li>how many times depends on how gently or roughly you treat them.</li>
      <li>Works well and there are enough to fit any toe.</li>
      <li>We bought him some microfiber absorbent socks, which helped some, but these absolutely stopped the blisters from forming.  </li>
      <li>These work great if you have a vulnerable area prone to forming corns.  </li>
      <li>just what I needed and wanted, right size for any toe except big one.  </li>
      <li>I can even wear new shoes.</li>
      <li>Make sure that you get the right size, because they are not particularly binding or tight.</li>
      <li>He gave me a toe sleeve (and charged me a ridiculous amount for it) and that helped with the pain, so I came on Amazon to find a more reasonable option than paying him highway robbery for a supply of toe</li>
      <li>Last fall, I went to a podiatrist regarding pain I was having between my last two toes on my right foot.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>was concerned that they would be too tight, but when my shoes are on, I&#x27;m not even aware of them.  </li>

<li> I do a lot of long walking days</li>
<li> You could probably wear them in a dressy sandal with nylon stockings, but certainly not with an open toe sandal and no stockings.</li>
<li> Bought this for someone who has serious hammertoes and whose toes bleed after walking in certain shoes.  </li>
<li> I think I&#x27;m on only my second bag of these pads in 8 months, and still have quite a few never-worn ones in my drawer, so mine have gotten quite a lot of wear!</li>

<li> These are very comfy and I usually wear them to protect my small toe when wearing sandals.  </li>
<li> This size would probably be too small for use on the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> For whatever reason, no matter what shoes I wear, at some point if I&#x27;m on my feet for 6 or more hours I will start to get some annoying rubbing on my toes.  </li>
<li> These are still bulky to a certain degree, but once you learn how to position them, it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
<li> I recei bed immediate relief of pain from the corn on my small toez</li>
<li> If you wear very narrow shoes, this may not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I like product because it provides rapid relief from pressure of hammertoe and makes it easier to walk; eliminates unnecessary pain from toe rubbing on shoe.</li>
<li> I ordered these for my husband, who was having problems with painful blisters after running or playing golf.  </li>

    <li> Product was as decribed</li>
    <li> This was a product I needed and it has worked well.</li>
    <li> Just what my doctor ordered.  I use this on my pinky toe to avoid getting an ingrown toenail.</li>
    <li> Perfect! 12 of pads with gel on inside--just as picture shows. For larger people they might be too small for a big toe. I&#x27;m very happy with them!</li>
    <li> These are great.  They are very comfortable and really do the job.</li>
    <li> I recei bed immediate relief of pain from the corn on my small toez</li>
    <li> I have to have these in order to walk. They have allowed me to forego operation for hammer toe, which is often an unsatisfactory procedure. It is hard to get more important than that.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Good, fast service.</li>
    <li> I like product because it provides rapid relief from pressure of hammertoe and makes it easier to walk; eliminates unnecessary pain from toe rubbing on shoe.</li>
    <li> I wear these almost anytime I wear shoes that cover the tops of my toes. I was starting to get corns on the tops of my toes from walking around in snug, closed-toe shoes. These helped stop that and keep my feet pretty. Love them!</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, no matter what shoes I wear, at some point if I&#x27;m on my feet for 6 or more hours I will start to get some annoying rubbing on my toes.  I do a lot of long walking days so this was curbing my enthusiasm.  I keep a handful with me just in case. They are easy to pop on and they do the trick</li>
    <li> These toe sleeves have been a lifesaver for me. Last fall, I went to a podiatrist regarding pain I was having between my last two toes on my right foot. After doing an x-ray, he informed me that the bones of those two toes were rubbing against one another and it would require surgery to shorten the bone in one of the toes. At the time, I was facing the prospect of a knee replacement, so I told him that had to be my primary concern at the time. He gave me a toe sleeve (and charged me a ridiculous amount for it) and that helped with the pain, so I came on Amazon to find a more reasonable option than paying him highway robbery for a supply of toe sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like these BETTER than the one he gave me, because the silicone pad on these is an oval shape whereas the one he gave me was square and much more bulky. These are still bulky to a certain degree, but once you learn how to position them, it&#x27;s not so bad. I was already wearing wide-width shoes, so the extra bulk of the toe sleeve did not cause a problem. If you wear very narrow shoes, this may not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been wearing these pads for about 8 months and, for the most part, they have been a successful option to surgery. Each pad can be worn a number of times...how many times depends on how gently or roughly you treat them. I think I&#x27;m on only my second bag of these pads in 8 months, and still have quite a few never-worn ones in my drawer, so mine have gotten quite a lot of wear! None of the silicone pads on mine have worn out, but the fabric sleeve can ravel or stretch out if not handled with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change anything, it would be for the silicone pad to be JUST a touch thinner so it wasn&#x27;t so bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included pictures of my foot with the sock on and sock off, both while wearing the toe sleeve.</li>
    <li> I love them! I can wear shoes I haven&#x27;t been able to wear. I can even wear new shoes. No pain!</li>
    <li> just what I needed and wanted, right size for any toe except big one.  well made....comfortable and a big pain saver....</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone who has serious hammertoes and whose toes bleed after walking in certain shoes.

(They are easily washed by putting in a net bag and tossing the bag in the washer.)</li>
    <li> Works well and there are enough to fit any toe. I&#x27;ve not washed them yet but the way they are made looks like they will do well.</li>
    <li> They are great and comfortable to wear....Very happy with product. thank you</li>
    <li> How do you rate a product that finally lets you walk with no pain?  Five stars are not enough for happy feet.</li>
    <li> These are very comfy and I usually wear them to protect my small toe when wearing sandals.  I have also used them to protect my ingrown,big toe.  The only problem is keeping track of them when not being worn,</li>
    <li> I was originally given two of these by my podiatrist at a cost of $5.00 each, and then I found them here for a fraction of the cost.  These work great if you have a vulnerable area prone to forming corns.  I use them on my second toe on each foot, with the gel pad positioned between my big toe and second toe.  I&#x27;ve been wearing them for three months without issue.  This size would probably be too small for use on the big toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that they would be too tight, but when my shoes are on, I&#x27;m not even aware of them.  I won&#x27;t wear them this summer with sandals, but they are great for closed shoes.  You could probably wear them in a dressy sandal with nylon stockings, but certainly not with an open toe sandal and no stockings.</li>
    <li> Right now I&#x27;m primarily wearing sandals since it is summertime.  I did try these on with a pair of my boots an they are wonderful!  They prevent any rubbing against my hammer toes and are very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness these easy pads are made for those of us who have toes that are now bent and rub on our shoes.. They are easy to use and clean.</li>
