      <li>and it smells awesome</li>
      <li>Best with sweaters and hoodies.</li>
      <li>Excellent fragrance.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>Anyway, it still smells great!</li>
      <li>Perhaps the greatest parfum ever created for men.</li>
      <li>very  good</li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>longevity is incredible  10/10..</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>this is a great fragrance</li>
      <li>masterpiece from Guerlain  and a great deal from the beautyencounter.</li>
      <li>A blast from the start then as it wears it transitions into a very warm sensually seductive fragrance that envelopes you.</li>
      <li>The parfum is very good, long-lasting, and has a sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>So much Good review</li>
      <li>Very elegant and distinctive.</li>
      <li>very good clean, non overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>and it is easily in my top 10 list, cheers!</li>
      <li>If you are a fragrance enthusiastic this is a must try.</li>
      <li>LDGE is a wonderful winter frag with great projection and lasting power.  </li>
      <li>Nice bottle though.</li>
      <li>am loving this perfume...</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t buy into the &amp;#34;formal/casual&amp;#34; setting clothes suggestions, ie Bois du Portugal is just fine with a t-shirt and jeans for me.</li>
      <li>No citrus for my nose, but I don&#x27;t find myself longing for many more elements.</li>
      <li>The perfume is authentic and original.&lt;br</li>
      <li>im  enjoying it</li>
      <li>Get many compliments.</li>
      <li>It will not be for everyone, so make sure you purchase a sample.</li>
      <li>more like declarations of desire...</li>
      <li>Ladies love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am telling you about the experience from wearing this outstanding Perfume.</li>
      <li>, this is much better that the EDT version.</li>
      <li>I think many would find it</li>
      <li>Very unique fragrance, to me</li>
      <li>At first it is a rather pepper smell but after it settles on the skin and starts to accumulate your natural oils the smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Between the two, Dior Homme Intense is superior.</li>
      <li>This is a well-documented monster in both projection and longevity, so easy on the trigger.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They say winter, I say cool summer nights :)</li>
      <li>This stuff smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s certainly a fine one, and unique.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and when it arrived I was so excited because of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>a bit cloying-- just too rich.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich and quite interesting, and I would say instantly recognizable.</li>
      <li>Very distinguished :)</li>
      <li>It is surprising that there are any left to sell today.</li>
      <li>In comparison to another vanilla fragrance, Chanel Allure Homme, is a Eau de Toilette, yet its far more potent, great projection and costs less.</li>
      <li>my age but a lot of older women love this on me.</li>
      <li>It smells like a very elegant chocolate mixed with orange, patchouli and some herbal, floral notes.</li>
      <li>Very sophisticated scent, not a Polo, Drakkar type of teen scent.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s so rare</li>
      <li>more of a mature scent.</li>
      <li>A more direct comparison to it is Dior Homme Intense.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s hard to find, this frag is great if you like gourmands (fragrances that remind you of food).</li>
      <li>If you want quality, you have to be willing to pay for it.</li>
      <li>but it is already my favorite along with Terre d&#x60;Hermes Parfum and Vetiver JPG , same quality and not like your &amp;#34;One Million&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>Very generous spice notes!</li>
      <li>First lemon, then chocolate.</li>
      <li>This has that reserved, mature feel, but is a Vanilla, slight cocoa fragrance that has great projection and lasts.</li>
      <li>Yes it is original staff and smells like a mature man should smell</li>
      <li>On the other hand, my own reaction is ambivalent.</li>
      <li>, it worth every penny, highly recommended my me, I have 100plus bottom in my collection</li>
      <li>He loves this fragrance and he&#x27;s very particular about smells.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent fragrance to wear on cold nights in Autumn and Winter.</li>
      <li>Delivery fast.</li>
      <li>Everything I was expecting..the cocoa note really shines through with this</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to cloud it up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re used to the real EDP.</li>
      <li>,  this is 35 and older zone.</li>
      <li>The seller tried to tell me that they are new bottles and sent me a blog post.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Through all of that sexiness, L&#x27;Instant Extreme&#x27;s scent is elegant and refined.</li>
      <li>I had to go through extraordinary measures to get my hands on L&#x27;instant Extreme the first time and at a premium price compared to what I paid here.</li>
      <li>Very complex and rich, and masculine, a true gourmand.</li>
      <li>However, I contacted Guerlain and their website clearly shows the darker bottle being EAU DE PARFUM.</li>
      <li>Long time user of cologne, now using perfume for first time/test</li>
      <li>Smells like an old lady.</li>
      <li>Waited for the cool down and found it to be super mature, no projection and very little staying power.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this is a characteristic of Guerlain EDP&#x27;s, I also have Habit Rouge EDP, and it cost significantly more yet rather tame.</li>
      <li>I really get the dry cocoa as the dominant note, with a sugared coffee grounds back.</li>
      <li>one.im glad I got my hands on a bottle before ther not available anymore.another hard to get bottle to add into my collection,and for a decent price</li>
      <li>The sillage draws attention actually causing heads to turn and move with you; not overpowering, subtle but strong in presence.</li>
      <li>In comparison, Allure Homme is far sweeter and L&#x27;instant Extreme has a initial slight hint of citrus and spice and is more reserved and mature, but I can&#x27;t get over how tame it is in both projection and sillage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just got it! Yes it is original staff and smells like a mature man should smell, it was a blind purchase but it is already my favorite along with Terre d&#x60;Hermes Parfum and Vetiver JPG , same quality and not like your &amp;#34;One Million&amp;#34;  one or something,  this is 35 and older zone.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. Very elegant and distinctive. Spicy, vanilla, cocoa notes that a man can wear confidently for casual or night time black tie affairs. Ladies love it.</li>
    <li> Very good. Long time user of cologne, now using perfume for first time/test</li>
    <li> Highly anticipated fragrance, because of online reviews, impossible to find in retail shops and for those reasons decided on the purchase even though pricey yet not a niche fragrance. Initial impressions are of disappointment. This is the parfum version and yet its not intense, rather tame. In comparison to another vanilla fragrance, Chanel Allure Homme, is a Eau de Toilette, yet its far more potent, great projection and costs less. In comparison, Allure Homme is far sweeter and L&#x27;instant Extreme has a initial slight hint of citrus and spice and is more reserved and mature, but I can&#x27;t get over how tame it is in both projection and sillage. Maybe this is a characteristic of Guerlain EDP&#x27;s, I also have Habit Rouge EDP, and it cost significantly more yet rather tame. A more direct comparison to it is Dior Homme Intense. This has that reserved, mature feel, but is a Vanilla, slight cocoa fragrance that has great projection and lasts. Between the two, Dior Homme Intense is superior.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic. Very sophisticated scent, not a Polo, Drakkar type of teen scent. Very complex and rich, and masculine, a true gourmand. The EdP is the perfect strength, just a spray or two is all you need.</li>
    <li> Wrote this review due to the reactions I received from wearing L&#x27;Instant de Guerlain Extreme...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Instant de Guerlain Extreme WOW. A blast from the start then as it wears it transitions into a very warm sensually seductive fragrance that envelopes you. The sillage draws attention actually causing heads to turn and move with you; not overpowering, subtle but strong in presence. Just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through all of that sexiness, L&#x27;Instant Extreme&#x27;s scent is elegant and refined. It&#x27;s been called a masterpiece, you have to read reviewers that can break down the notes. I am telling you about the experience from wearing this outstanding Perfume. Compliments? more like declarations of desire... The reactions were immediate and DIRECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this perfume... [[ASIN:B001KOTQY6 Guerlain L&#x27;instant De Guerlain Extreme By Guerlain For Men. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5-Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE 9.13.11: This will be my Third back up bottle as this juice is hard to come by. It is surprising that there are any left to sell today. I had to go through extraordinary measures to get my hands on L&#x27;instant Extreme the first time and at a premium price compared to what I paid here.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent fragrance to wear on cold nights in Autumn and Winter. Best with sweaters and hoodies. I really get the dry cocoa as the dominant note, with a sugared coffee grounds back. No citrus for my nose, but I don&#x27;t find myself longing for many more elements. This is a well-documented monster in both projection and longevity, so easy on the trigger. You don&#x27;t need much to cloud it up. I honestly don&#x27;t buy into the &amp;#34;formal/casual&amp;#34; setting clothes suggestions, ie Bois du Portugal is just fine with a t-shirt and jeans for me. As stated before, stick with cooler nights, unless you enjoy awkward stares and olfactory shame.</li>
    <li> LDGE is a wonderful winter frag with great projection and lasting power.  It last at least 20plus hours on my skin and it smells awesome, it worth every penny, highly recommended my me, I have 100plus bottom in my collection and it is easily in my top 10 list, cheers!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. im 25 i don&#x27;t get compliments from girls my age but a lot of older women love this on me.</li>
    <li> this is a great fragrance it&#x27;s a little pricey but is very difficult to get in North America. because it&#x27;s so rare I will go ahead and pay the price</li>
    <li> Perhaps the greatest parfum ever created for men. Well worth the cost. If you want quality, you have to be willing to pay for it. The negative reviews can&#x27;t be legit.</li>
    <li> Great. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for by boyfriend. He loves this fragrance and he&#x27;s very particular about smells. At first it is a rather pepper smell but after it settles on the skin and starts to accumulate your natural oils the smell is wonderful. Very distinguished :)</li>
    <li> Everything I was expecting..the cocoa note really shines through with this one.im glad I got my hands on a bottle before ther not available anymore.another hard to get bottle to add into my collection,and for a decent price..AWESOME!</li>
    <li> So much Good review but this perfume is a let down......after a lot of effort to get this perfume ......it&#x27;s Sucks....waste of money</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and when it arrived I was so excited because of the reviews.  ONE spray and it smelled like a deers foot in a bears ass. Waited for the cool down and found it to be super mature, no projection and very little staying power.  I will wear it, but when its gone, trust me it will be gone forever.</li>
    <li> I love it. Very unique fragrance, to me, this is much better that the EDT version. If you are a fragrance enthusiastic this is a must try. A must have in my collection.</li>
    <li> Looking for a beast of fragrance that can stand up to the Brutal winter days ahead! Give this one a try. It will not be for everyone, so make sure you purchase a sample.</li>
    <li> very  good im  enjoying it</li>
    <li> Very long lasting. Get many compliments. Hard to find. I was at the Guerlain store at EPCOT, and they were out. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottles that arrived were lighter in color (EAU DE TOILETTE) version and were labeled deceivingly. The seller tried to tell me that they are new bottles and sent me a blog post. However, I contacted Guerlain and their website clearly shows the darker bottle being EAU DE PARFUM. I don&#x27;t recommend if you&#x27;re used to the real EDP.</li>
    <li> The parfum is very good, long-lasting, and has a sophisticated scent. Very generous spice notes! Very subtle as it wears, but still noticeable. My bottle did NOT have the black edge as in the picture, which made me questionable. Anyway, it still smells great!</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s hard to find, this frag is great if you like gourmands (fragrances that remind you of food). It smells like a very elegant chocolate mixed with orange, patchouli and some herbal, floral notes. The lasting power on this one is awesome--I&#x27;ve worn it for 12 hours, took a shower and could still faintly smell it on my arm. My only complaint is that it does smell pretty formal and might be hard to pull off with jeans and such (everyday clothes).</li>
    <li> The perfume is authentic and original.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is marvelous 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;The longevity is incredible  10/10..&lt;br /&gt;A masterpiece from Guerlain  and a great deal from the beautyencounter.</li>
    <li> This is probably a love or hate fragrance. On the other hand, my own reaction is ambivalent. It&#x27;s rich and quite interesting, and I would say instantly recognizable. First lemon, then chocolate. You have to like smelling like chocolate all through the long-lasting drydown. I think many would find it a bit cloying-- just too rich. But it&#x27;s certainly a fine one, and unique.</li>
    <li> Less iris, cleaner feel, a little smokier and some star anise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say winter, I say cool summer nights :)</li>
    <li> I do not know if I will ever where this again. Smells like an old lady. Nice bottle though. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Delivery fast. No complaints at all</li>
    <li> very good clean, non overpowering scent. subtle and classy gourmand. smells like something caramelized with hints of chocolate. more of a mature scent. excellent choise.</li>
