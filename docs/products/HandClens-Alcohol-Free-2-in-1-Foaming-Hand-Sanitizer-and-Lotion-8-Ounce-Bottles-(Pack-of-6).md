      <li>So when I needed more and found it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>But I just love it.</li>
      <li>My co-workers love the stuff, too.  </li>
      <li>I also feel it&#x27;s safe to use on kids when they need it.</li>
      <li>I prefer this non-alcoholic sanitizer to the more popular and readily available alcohol based products.</li>
      <li>We love this hand sanitizer.  </li>
      <li>Since it comes in a pack of six, we were able to put a bottle everywhere (bathrooms, baby&#x27;s room, car, etc.).  </li>
      <li>Price is appropriate.</li>
      <li>I have found none better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred the alcohol-based cleaners (Purell), as I feel the fewer chemicals the better.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of hand sanitizer since I&#x27;m always in contact with many people.</li>
      <li>it smells nice, but light.</li>

      <li>Soap and water is still the best...if available!</li>
      <li>HandClens Foaming Hand Sanitizer and lotion is a wonderful alternative to the alcohol sanitizers that so dry my hands.  </li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the alcohol-based stuff and smells great!</li>
      <li>It is foamy when dispensed - it has a pleasant smell - and it is gentle on hands.  </li>

      <li>Glad to have found this available on-line.</li>
      <li>It smells good and is gentle on my hands.</li>
      <li>I liked that it was alcohol free, fragrance free, and color free.  </li>
      <li>I have placed a bottle of this sanitizer in my bathroom and kitchen, so it is always available, as I have just had a kidney transplant and must have very clean hands at all times.  </li>
      <li>We had a bunch of these that we had got for a great price from Big Lots and when we run out we ordered more of them here.</li>
      <li>wanted to like this, but the foam has a really strong fruity scent, like pears.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>Well, the perfume on this is so strong that it gave us headaches.  </li>
      <li>However, it does have a strong fragrance that lingers.</li>
      <li>This is the hands down best one.  </li>
      <li>I first discovered the Hand Clens color-free &amp; fragrance-free product at a local take-out restaurant and was instantly impressed with it.  </li>
      <li>Need to find an odor/perfume free product.</li>
      <li>(he probably gets it free for recommending it).</li>
      <li>I like this alcohol free sanitizer, because it is a lotion too.</li>
      <li>If you have animals, this is a fantastic sanitizer.</li>
      <li>We have been searching for alcohol free hand cleanser at an inexpensive price for quite some time.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic hand cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I read recently (can&#x27;t remember where, although I&#x27;m sure the Google will get you there) that HandClens is the most effective hand sanitizer in existence.  </li>
      <li>We feel more secure using this type of hand cleanser since our 2 yr old prefers to &#x27;wash&#x27; his own hands and is still at the stage of putting things in his mouth he shouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that this is their original product and that they manufacturer both the apple scented and the fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not for sure where I first found this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how best to describe the scent.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands feeling clean and there isn&#x27;t any alcohol smell remains.  </li>
      <li>I like that we can clean away germs.</li>
      <li>Then, recently, I read about this being the most effective sanitizer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any one that is always feeling like they need to clean their hands or has children.</li>
      <li>The tape didn&#x27;t say if it was the bottle that was defective or the contents...isn&#x27;t that special.</li>
      <li>and it makes your skin feel nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>I use this with students and it helps us clean away sneezes and coughs since we don&#x27;t have quick access to soap&amp;water.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, not overpowering apple scent, and each pump goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Though I agree that nothing beats actual hand washing, this is definitely a better-than-nothing solution and probably the best foaming version I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>Love it and recommend highly.</li>
      <li>The active ingredient, benzalkonium chloride, is supposed to be a very effective disinfectant.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and the lotion helps it to not dry out the hands.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t carry it anymore, but it is definitely worth ordering off the Internet.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice product, actually softens hands while you use it.</li>

    <li> I really liked it alot alittle pricey</li>

    <li> I read recently (can&#x27;t remember where, although I&#x27;m sure the Google will get you there) that HandClens is the most effective hand sanitizer in existence.  I&#x27;ve always preferred the alcohol-based cleaners (Purell), as I feel the fewer chemicals the better.  Alcohol is more natural, so I went with Purell and the like.  Since I&#x27;m slightly obsessive about cleanliness/being germ-free, I used plenty (I carry my own Lysol spray &amp; Purell wipes to wipe down cart handles/baskets, for example).     I&#x27;d bought a multi-pack of HandClens before at Costco (a couple of years ago).  I never really took to the foaming action of it, nor was I crazy about the smell.  What put me off it entirely was the use of chemical agents to kill bacteria/viruses.  Then, recently, I read about this being the most effective sanitizer.  It&#x27;s more effective than alcohol-based sanitizers the moment you put it on, and it&#x27;s even more effective with re-use.  Alcohol-based sanitizers become slightly less effective with re-use (something about your skin drying out and that making the sanitizing action less effective).         Well, this stuff is very hard to find now.  Costco doesn&#x27;t sell it (at least not those at which I shop).  Not even Walgreens or CVS have it.  I was pleasantly surprised that Amazon did and that it shipped with Prime (not from a 3rd-party seller).  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This product has seen us through several flu seasons.  I am fond of the fact that it does not dry out your hands and it does not have an overpowering odor.  I am unable to find it locally.</li>
    <li> I first discovered the Hand Clens color-free &amp; fragrance-free product at a local take-out restaurant and was instantly impressed with it.  I liked that it was alcohol free, fragrance free, and color free.  I recently ordered this on Amazon thinking that this would be just like the one in the restaurant but it is not.  When I got it, I was surprised to find that the liquid is a bluish-purple color and smells like apple.  I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that this is their original product and that they manufacturer both the apple scented and the fragrance free.  Personally I want as little chemicals in the products I use on myself and my family so I was very disappointed that no place on the description on Amazon does it state that this product is scented nor does the photo of the product do a good job of indicating that the liquid is colored.  I contacted Amazon about this and they made note but as far as I can tell, they have not updated the web page to indicate that this product is SCENTED.  Buyer beware, otherwise this is a great product if you don&#x27;t mind the scent or color.</li>
    <li> The product was very good, and is just what we looking for.  The only real problem we had was the packinging and shipping of the product itself.    By e-mail I was notified that the product would arrive by usps and it would half to be pick up at the local post office, which was ok.  When I went to the post office to get it the post office said you had better check this package because the cardboard box was all wet.  When I opened the box all of the bottles had  been packed on their sides with a little bit of bubble wrap packed on top of them.  One of the bottles lids had come loose and all of the contents had leaked out into the box.  We checked all of the other bottles and none of the others had leaked out.    This was Handclens Foaming Sanitizer &amp; Loation.  We ordered two cases of 6 to a case.  I wondered why they weren&#x27;t shipped in the orginal cases?      Anyway were out one 8 oz. bottle of this HandsClens Foaming sanitizer &amp; Loation.    I hope you don&#x27;t ship all your products that way.  Very sloppy and poor way of thipping product.    Thank you,  Arvin  Customer Service Rep.  O&#x27;Malley Equipment Co. Inc.  Iola, Kansas 66749</li>
    <li> I had to use this because the alcohol-based hand sanitizer&#x27;s dried out my hands too much. Probably because I live in a very very dry climate. This hand sanitizer is very easy to dispense, has a nice very nice feel to the lotion/sanitizer. Since it has lotion in it, it will actually moisturize my hands. Great buy.</li>
    <li> We have been searching for alcohol free hand cleanser at an inexpensive price for quite some time.  Purchased this product 2 years ago from Costco but unable to find there since.  We feel more secure using this type of hand cleanser since our 2 yr old prefers to &#x27;wash&#x27; his own hands and is still at the stage of putting things in his mouth he shouldn&#x27;t.  Gentle on hands.  Love it and recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Though I agree that nothing beats actual hand washing, this is definitely a better-than-nothing solution and probably the best foaming version I&#x27;ve found. I prefer the foam because I have young kids and it&#x27;s not only a far less messy option than gel or liquid, but it&#x27;s also a good visual indicator of when they&#x27;ve rubbed it in \\&quot;enough\\&quot; to get the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts forever. I keep a bottle in the car, another in the playroom and anywhere else where we don&#x27;t have ready access to a sink but are often doing a lot of touching of public property. Just easy peasy to use and, heck, it may not be a magic bullet, but it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I use Handclens in a nursing home where my wife is.  It beats alcohol base cleaners and the foam cleaners at the nurses desk. Those cleaners leave a sticky residue, whereas handclens leave a nice lotion feel.</li>
    <li> A highly effective, safe, gentle, pleasant smelling sanitizer. Perfect to keep at home, car, work, and school.  This foaming sanitizer is one of, if not the best, sanitizers on the market.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+It works (I think...)&lt;br /&gt;+Doubles as lotion (my hands feel moisturized for a few hours after using it)&lt;br /&gt;+Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;+Foam, so it&#x27;s easier to work into your hands&lt;br /&gt;+Doesn&#x27;t smell like rubbing alcohol or like a lemonade stand exploded on your hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Scent. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but you&#x27;ll be sick of it after a while.</li>
    <li> love that it is not alcohol based so it is safe fro my young children, and doesn&#x27;t dry out our hands, or have that terrible strong smell. it smells nice, but light.</li>
    <li> I found this at [...] about a year ago and really liked it.  They don&#x27;t carry it anymore, but it is definitely worth ordering off the Internet.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like the alcohol-based stuff and smells great!</li>
    <li> We use santizer after picking up the kids from school and before snack.  This is the hands down best one.  It is foamy when dispensed - it has a pleasant smell - and it is gentle on hands.  My kids scream when they have a little cut and have to use the regular gel sanitizer -- it burns.  This one doesn&#x27;t hurt them at all.  Glad to have found this available on-line.</li>
    <li> Better sanitizer than any alcohol product, but will irritate your skin with frequent use. Soap and water is still the best...if available!</li>
    <li> HandClens Foaming Hand Sanitizer and lotion is a wonderful alternative to the alcohol sanitizers that so dry my hands.  I have placed a bottle of this sanitizer in my bathroom and kitchen, so it is always available, as I have just had a kidney transplant and must have very clean hands at all times.  HandClens is much easier to use - via the foaming action - than regular gel sanitizers, and it measures just the right amount each time.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of hand sanitizer since I&#x27;m always in contact with many people. So far, I have yet to become ill (of course, this doesn&#x27;t prove that this product has been working).   The original reason that I got this sanitizer was because the alcohol-based ones cause my hands to dry up severely and then chap. This sanitizer is a lot friendlier on my hands. However, it does have a strong fragrance that lingers. I&#x27;m not sure how best to describe the scent. It&#x27;s maybe equatable to some kind of lavender.   Once I finish these up (which will be a very long time, since they seem to last forever) I want to try a similar one called \\&quot;Hy5.\\&quot;   The active ingredient, benzalkonium chloride, is supposed to be a very effective disinfectant. Supposedly, it can keep \\&quot;killing\\&quot; harmful germs/bacteria for several hours after it has been applied to your hands.</li>
    <li> I rated this product  because it is a very good product,  it is  alchohol free and foaming , I would purchase this product again,</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use alcohol based products because my kids often have small cuts on their hands.  Well, the perfume on this is so strong that it gave us headaches.  Had to stop using it immediately.  Need to find an odor/perfume free product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not for sure where I first found this product. But I just love it. So when I needed more and found it here on Amazon. This is a great product. If you&#x27;re like me and like to have hand sanitizer along and then you use lotion this is for you. I have a bottle in almost every room in my house. I have it in the batroom, kitchen, and my bedroom. My mother (who I take care of) felt left out so now there&#x27;s a bottle in her room. I take this product on vacation with me and most any where I go. It leaves my hands feeling clean and there isn&#x27;t any alcohol smell remains.  I also feel like I just used lotion so I don&#x27;t need to take a bottle of lotion along as well. This is a great product to keep in you car.   I live in NV. which is a dry state and it&#x27;s fantastic in dry area&#x27;s. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works camping.  I&#x27;d recommend this to any one that is always feeling like they need to clean their hands or has children. They will like the foaming action that comes when you pump it onto your/their hands.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for someone who is a real germophobe.  I tried it myself after she opened it and it makes your skin feel nice and soft.  Not like a lot of those alcohol based hands cleansers.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way hands are cleaned, but not overly dry afterwards.  Great product and highly recommended for active households!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hand cleanser.  As a nurse I know the importance of using a non alcohol-based hand cleanser, and this product fits the bill perfectly.  Quickly goes on and dries with your hands feeling nice and well moisturized as opposed to dry and all for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love HandClens!  BUT! I purchased a 6-pack from Amazon in November 2008, for less than nineteen d011ars.  What&#x27;s up with the thirty bucks price tag now?!  Can you say \\&quot;Swine Flu Profiteering\\&quot;?  Amazon, shame on you.</li>
    <li> I have found none better. Others leave my hand dry and hurting. HandClens is trustworthy. I recommend HandClens often. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this with students and it helps us clean away sneezes and coughs since we don&#x27;t have quick access to soap&amp;water.  They like the foamy cleansing.  I like that we can clean away germs.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to keep handy during cold and flu season, and ordered this as it is a foam and not an alcohol based gel. The gels can really dry out your skin if used frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this, but the foam has a really strong fruity scent, like pears. If it were milder, I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much, but I found it irritating to my own nose, and my workplace has a policy against strong perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the germ fighting abilities of this foam, just the nose-hair-curling aroma.</li>
    <li> We love this product!  It smells nice and my grandkids don&#x27;t shy away from it like they do other hand sanitizer because it does not sting if you have a small scratch!  Plus it foams!</li>
    <li> I prefer this non-alcoholic sanitizer to the more popular and readily available alcohol based products.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It is easy on the hands &amp; I can keep it places that I can&#x27;t get to soap &amp; water easily, like next to my computer. I have been using this for several years &amp; have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Smells great, kids love it, wife loves it.  What else can I say?  Great product.</li>
    <li> For those of us who have wicked dry hands that crack, this is the only stuff that you can use to keep them sanitized.  Alcohol based stuff just burns like the dickens.</li>
    <li> We love this hand sanitizer.  We recently had a baby, meaning countless diaper changes and mandatory clean hands.  Being that I have a skin issue from washing my hands too much in the past, I have to be really careful to not let my skin become too dry.  I wash my hands and use lotion every time, but that can still cause irritation.  Alcohol based sanitizers kill my hands... talk about dry skin and cracked cuticles!  This sanitizer allows me to use it often but not sustain any ill repercussions.  It has a pleasant, not overpowering apple scent, and each pump goes a long way.  The foaming action seems productive and feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product since October 2012, and my hands have not suffered for it once.  Since it comes in a pack of six, we were able to put a bottle everywhere (bathrooms, baby&#x27;s room, car, etc.).  Not to mention, my husband came down with the flu the day it arrived and wasted a bottle over the next 3 days managing not to spread his illness to me or the little one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient is Benzalkonium Chloride .13% in case you want to do any research.</li>
    <li> My family insists I buy this because the foam is gentler on the skin and still does a good job cleaning. I agree. Good product.  Price is appropriate.</li>
    <li> The product itself is satisfactory.  However, the service is not satisfactory.  I even tried to send in a message about the condition of the package and the product, but received no response.  The six bottles were inside a plastic bag, which was inside a wet box. When I opened the box, I found that one of the bottles had a loose top, and it had leaked out into the box.  It was completely empty.  So I received only 5 bottles after paying for 6.  I am quite unhappy about not getting what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This sanitizer is amazing!  The smell is mild and somewhat fruity, it comes out as a nice thick foam.  Best of all it kills germs and does not dry out your hands! We have a newborn baby so I purchased several of these to have stationed around the house and one for the car and stroller.</li>
    <li> When it arrived it was taped together with tape that said &amp;#34;DEFECTIVE&amp;#34;. So, no one at work will use it. The tape didn&#x27;t say if it was the bottle that was defective or the contents...isn&#x27;t that special. I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> My use of your product has made a big difference in my hands. They are not cracked, sore, Your product saved me lots of misery.Thank you, Lorayne Dille.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too expensive for every day use. I use it too soon in comparison to other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Sanitizes well. Smells nice. Good plunger. I keep one at every sink and at our baby changing table. My wife also likes it.</li>
    <li> We had a bunch of these that we had got for a great price from Big Lots and when we run out we ordered more of them here. We love this product!</li>
    <li> If you have animals, this is a fantastic sanitizer. Doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands drenched. Not as sticky or stinky as the other sanitizers. I ONLY use this, and I go through a lot of it as a reptile breeder, rescuer, and educator :)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me a couple of years ago. I have hyper-sensitive skin, and I can&#x27;t tolerate perfume odors, either. It was selling in the privately-run pharmacy across the street from my doctor at an outrageous price of $5.99 for the small, purse-sized 1.79 oz bottle. My doctor uses it all the time as soon as he comes into the examining room to see me (he probably gets it free for recommending it). I bought the tiny bottle immediately, I confess, even at that outrageous price. But I fell in love with the stuff. The skin eczema on my hands cleared up within days of using this regularly (I&#x27;m a clean-hands freak and cook all my family&#x27;s meals at home, so I&#x27;m always washing my hands).  I found the product at Amazon for 3.99 for an 8 oz. bottle. On my last family reunion (we always camp where hot water and mild soap are not readily available), my whole family fell in love with the stuff, too. So now I give it away as presents to family members, because they never remember where I told them to buy it! My dad and brother are doctors, and they told me that hospital employees use the product all the time. I noticed that a couple of reviewers here complained about the scent, saying it smelled like apples or perfume, or something. As I said, I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents, but the scent in this product is subtle (smells like peaches to me) and goes away very quickly. It leaves my hands soft and germ-free with no drying, as alcohol-based products do. It is as good as soap and water, without the drying effect they cause. My dermatologist told me that water actually dries the hands, which didn&#x27;t sound right to me, so I went online and checked it out. It turns out that water and soap dry hands out quite badly. My co-workers love the stuff, too.  I&#x27;m an elementary public school librarian and keep a bottle next to me at my desk (you can&#x27;t imagine the germs these kids bring in with them on anything they touch!)  Even our custodian loves the stuff. At my lastvisit to my dermatologist (2 days ago), I told him about the price I was paying for the product at Amazon.  He was amazed (I guess he had never been to Amazon before and seen the great prices that seem to always be available here). So I give this product a 5 star. If they had more stars, it would be a 10.</li>
    <li> I like this hand sanitizer.  It has a nice smell and the lotion helps it to not dry out the hands.  It does take a few extra seconds to dry, compared to the alcohol based ones, but I find it worth it and have also learned to use less and it still covers the hands and does a good job of sanitizing them.</li>
    <li> First tried this product several years ago; what I like about it, it didn&#x27;t make my hands feel dry upon using like other santizers</li>
    <li> I am a clerical administrator in a Texas state prison.  Prisons can be hotbeds of communicable disease, but alcohol is contraband in prisons, as well as glass containers.  I first purchased this product for staff office use and the fact that the liquid is see-through clear makes the wardens &amp; security staff very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product is perfectly safe - the worst hazards being slippery floors and minor eye irritation.  The safety of the product removes any concern that inmate access could utilize it as any kind of harmful substance on another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would alcohol based products be more effective?  I doubt it.  But this is clearly a better-than-nothing alternative.</li>
    <li> I use this ALL the time now that I have a newborn. There is no alcohol and it smells fresh and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dry... LOOOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This the only hand sanitizer I use at home. It smells good and is gentle on my hands. I have used this several times per day for years. It is great hand sanitizer.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Works great for my daughter who has eczema. It doesn&#x27;t dry her hands all that much or make the eczema flair up.</li>
    <li> HandClens hand sanitizer is my favorite because it is so gentle and contains no alcohol - therefore, no stinging and soft hands!!</li>
    <li> I had a job where I would touch really dirty invoices that passed through many hands before landing on my desk, and kept this by me to prevent illnesses. It didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d get sick all the time. Furthermore, the scent was so powerful it was very off-putting. So that made me sick, too. It didn&#x27;t dry my hands, so I appreciated that...but once I went back to Purell I stopped getting sick and I didn&#x27;t feel stalked by the scent. I&#x27;m not usually that sensitive and tend to like perfumes, but I have a real aversion to this product, probably because I associate it with getting ill all the time!</li>
    <li> this item is perfect for our rooms.  we cannot find anything campatible to it in any store.  this item shipped as expected</li>
    <li> I like this alcohol free sanitizer, because it is a lotion too. I also feel it&#x27;s safe to use on kids when they need it. The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I also like the pump mechanism - it&#x27;s tall, so you can get a lot of sanitizer or just a little.</li>
    <li> This is be best alcohol-free soap I have found. We use it at our Substance Abuse Center and get lots of comments about how wonderful it smells.</li>
