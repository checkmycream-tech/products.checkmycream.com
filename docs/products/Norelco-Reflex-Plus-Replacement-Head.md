<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pictures and description were inadaquate.  I had to open the package to actually see what was inside and the blades didn&#x27;t fit my razor.  Since the package was opened and the product was &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; it was not accepted for return.</li>
    <li> I found this product online only, because of the shaver&#x27;s age. My shaver works fine, but the blades were worn out.  After searching to find the right model replacement heads, I searched for the best price, under $20 ppd.  My shaver is running like new again, and my face is as clean as can be. I did check out new shavers but wasn&#x27;t ready to fork out $100+ for the same features I have with the one I have.</li>
    <li> Just as described, fits my husband&#x27;s older razor perfectly.  It is nice to have a replacement part in this throw away world.</li>
    <li> Works great with my shaver.  Good price, good quality.  Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.  Be careful , Norelco makes number of different&lt;br /&gt;shavers and seems like each one requires a different kit...</li>

    <li> Best cost around on Norelco shaver replacments.</li>
    <li> Purchased the incorrect replacement head  it was not worth the expense of returning so I&#x27;ll keep it until I can find a razor it fits.</li>
    <li> Order was received promptly and just what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The blades I selected did not fit properly to my razor, and returns are NOT accept. A warning to all potential purchasers.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS JUST FINE. NO PROBLEM AT ALL. IF THIS SHAVER HOLDS UP, I&#x27;LL GET ANOTHER ONE. WHY BUY ANOTHER COMPLETE SHAVER IF IT ONLY NEEDS A REPLACEMENT HEAD ?</li>
    <li> it came very quickly and was sp easy to put on, took seconds, works great. better than buying a new shaver.hubby happy!!</li>
    <li> I Recieved a open package, with razor heads plastic open. No way I&#x27;m gonna use razors that are not new.</li>
    <li> Not much to say. I bought this as a replacement. Once it was &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; it gave a clean shave with or without face preparation. Easy to install. It came within the allowed time. Recommended by me.</li>
    <li> we tend to forget about our electric razors, because they are so trouble free and dependable,but the rotating blades get dull and it is cheaper to get replacement heads than buying a new razor.</li>

    <li> Usable shaver. Great and close cut. No damage skin.</li>
    <li> Everything I could want and expect from a replacement blade. I would definitely buy again. Works as good as new.</li>
    <li> Amazing to go from a dull electric razor to fresh and sharp, easyto install and to clean well worth the money. I&#x27;m saving lots of money on shaving soap and razor bades, not to mention saving water.</li>

    <li> I did not feel that this razor blade had the great quality that I have experienced in other Philips razor products</li>
