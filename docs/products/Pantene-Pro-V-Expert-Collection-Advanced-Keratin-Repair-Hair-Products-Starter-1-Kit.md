      <li>I seem to have better luck with just using &amp;#34;hair crack&amp;#34; along with volumizing shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works well on my hair, I am able to  my hair without difficulty.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>During that time I tried many products offered by my salon as well as online including Philip B</li>
      <li>love these products.  </li>
      <li>Love it love</li>
      <li>it love it.....</li>
      <li>and I noticed my hair just didn&#x27;t look so healthy.  </li>
      <li>SO GLAD</li>
      <li>but it did look and behave better.  </li>
      <li>I love Pantene products, but these were not my favorite.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s looking more unhealthly &amp; frizzy.  </li>
      <li>It looks so much better than it did before I used</li>
      <li>Will be ordering on Amazon since it is a bit cheaper here when I need more.</li>
      <li>Shame on you, because you shiould know better.</li>
      <li>It works like magic.</li>
      <li>I was amazed since I WAS the girl who went to the salon every 4 weeks, and at times get the $30 condition treatment that seemed to be nice for the day but nothing special afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed the split end step vey easy to use and my hair like the keratin</li>
      <li>I picked up this product after reading so many great reviews about it from people who has similar problems as I do.</li>
      <li>the shampoo was nice and lathery, the conditioner seemed to sink into my hair well, and the balm is softening (for the first hour).</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner are just fine.</li>
      <li>Since my hair is so fine</li>
      <li>Okay this is really an excellent product, BUT these bottles are extremely small.</li>
      <li>After ONE treatment with this stuff my hair looked and felt healthy and strong and it was manageable &amp; easy to style for the first time in over a year.</li>
      <li>made a huge difference in my hair in just one use.  </li>
      <li>These did make my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>makes your hair so smooth</li>
      <li>Oh, and until this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
      <li>I am not covering it with extensions just to give it pass ability and am excited to keep using this product to see what it will continue to do.</li>
      <li>In the shower i noticed less hair falling off when rinsing off the conditioner and immediately after my hair dried i noticed shiny, incredible, soft manageable hair!! :D</li>
      <li>I may actually use the entire bottle and buy more!!!!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this entire of products,</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t had a hair cut in a few years and said that this did a great job on her split ends.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for a week now &amp; can not believe how soft &amp; healthy my hair feels.  </li>
      <li>my hair felt like it had a bit of a \\&quot;coating\\&quot; to it that I was not crazy about</li>
      <li>, My hair felt really soft and healthy</li>
      <li>The products themselves feel smooth &amp; soft , not oily, nice  light fragrance  will buy regular size from now on.</li>
      <li>Our hair is soft and silky and feels so much more healthier even after one use.</li>
      <li>so I google reviews which to my surprise were very positive</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Pantene right?</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised how good it still works (apparently you hair gets used to products and doesn&#x27;t work as well).</li>
      <li>came across this in my local supermarket, and I quickly scanned it and read through reviews on here, convincing myself to buy it.</li>
      <li>I noticed results after first use and my hair felt very soft and strong.</li>
      <li>I am excited to throw out my cabinet full of useless \\&quot;hair remedies\\&quot; &amp; I will be buying the large sizes of all three of these incredible products.    </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly scream salon grade.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re like me and are about to just accept the fact that there is no hope left and no product that can help get you by until your hair grows out just a weeee bit more so you can get it cut.. look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It feels exactly like it does when I leave the salon.  </li>
      <li>No oiliness, heaviness, just light and soft.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Highly recommend, fast, easy and hair is soft with some bounce to it.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!!!</li>
      <li>This stuff pretty much ruined the investment I made in my hair when I splurged for a keratin about 2 months ago.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product if you are at the point where you either will start wearing a wing or cut if all off ( and neither option really appeals to you)!</li>
      <li>If you use the split end fuser on damp hair, make sure to blow dry and brush.</li>
      <li>Although I dont feel that my hair dry faster than before like most people have observed.</li>
      <li>I started researching products that I could buy at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>very sleek.</li>
      <li>I really thought there was just no hope</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found something very affordable that does what it claims and then some.  </li>
      <li>last thing I tried was Tresemme&#x27;s 7 day smooth heat activated stuff.</li>
      <li>But tried it out, just as the instructions said and my hair came out super soft after it was straightened.. I can tell after my hair was drying it was so soft.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy the full size.</li>
      <li>well, silly me, I thought it would work beautifully well on my keratin-treated hair.</li>
      <li>I usually do wash and then twist outs after a nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>Holy Smokes my hair is so so soft immediately after the first use.  </li>
      <li>After going through menopause and experiencing thinning and breakage and dealing with constantly trying to make it look healthy again, I was on the brink of just going with a chin length bob and starting all over.  </li>
      <li>bottom line is I highly recommend this system, for the price it cannot be beat.</li>
      <li>After the wash my hair is all soft and silky and looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent to much money on all different products with many hit and misses ...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had tried another product and was very disappointed with the results.  I don&#x27;t have much money to waste so I put the unsatisfactory products away to use while I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair  needed some serious help, so I spent the money and tried this.  It&#x27;s definitely no miracle cream, and I can&#x27;t say it did away with 2 years of damage on the first application, but I can say after using it five times my hair is very different. It&#x27;s smooth and shiny.  It looks so much better than it did before I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer.  I&#x27;ll stick with this product.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> When I read a product description that&#x27;s called KERATIN hair repair... well, silly me, I thought it would work beautifully well on my keratin-treated hair. BUT------ This shampoo has no less than 4 different kinds of sodium in it!!!! I never even thought to check...but as anyone who has paid a few hundred for a keratin anti-frizz treatment can tell you, SODIUM is a huge no-no when used for months after a keratin treatment. This stuff pretty much ruined the investment I made in my hair when I splurged for a keratin about 2 months ago. I absolutely want my money back for the product . PLUS the cost of getting the keratin treatment itself. Shame on you, because you shiould know better.</li>
    <li> The best part is the split end serum. It works like magic. Shampoo and conditioner are just fine. But i am definately buying the serum again and a definate must for me from now on. I just hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading through reviews of what seems like every product on every website I could find, hoping to get a clear answer from somebody that has hair like me as to whether or not a product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot I bought this around Christmas time when they were on clearance everywhere. I found this stashed in my closet behind a crap load of hair products that never worked. I AM SO GLAD I FOUND THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair; I&#x27;ve got a shoulder length(ish) a-line bob in which about half way up in the front/sides is old damage that I&#x27;m trying to get rid of without having to cut ALL of my hair off. The ends are SO beyond damaged from bleaching my hair (like an idiot) from dark brown to platinum blonde over and over and over. I couldn&#x27;t control the frizz, dryness and damage anymore so about a year ago I attempted to turn it back to dark brown and told myself I wouldn&#x27;t touch my hair again until the old stuff was completely gone. It&#x27;s gone in the back, but my ends on the sides are bad. I mean REALLY BAD. Not only did the dark brown wash away immediately last year, but here I am today and my ends will barely even retain water! I towel dry my hair and the ends are dry and crispy. If you&#x27;re like me and are about to just accept the fact that there is no hope left and no product that can help get you by until your hair grows out just a weeee bit more so you can get it cut.. look no further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have naturally wavy, frizzy, course hair. My hair is actually naturally soft and straight; not thick but not fine and thin. My problem is just the over processed, unbelievably damaged ends that I&#x27;m trying to tame until my next trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I tried was Tresemme&#x27;s 7 day smooth heat activated stuff. I thought that was good.. It made the ends feel soft but not look soft.. that is until I would wake up the next day and it was back to being straw. Oh, and until this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much. I really thought there was just no hope and my only option was to go get it cut. My hair is the softest I can EVER remember it being. The only way you can tell that my ends are damaged now is by how dull and lifeless the COLOR is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the results change, I will update my review. If not, the next time I need to use this I will upload before and after pictures because this is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Product did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> love these products.  made a huge difference in my hair in just one use.  you can actually feel the change in your hair as you wash it..  The products themselves feel smooth &amp; soft , not oily, nice  light fragrance  will buy regular size from now on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Works well. But when I got my shipment the shampoo bottle had the liquid leaking out of it. The bottles are small so I lost a good amount of it already. If it wasn&#x27;t for that it would have 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I blow dry &amp; flat iron my hair every day, and I had been noticing lately it&#x27;s looking more unhealthly &amp; frizzy.  I usually buy Chi products, but the cost was getting out of hand.  I started researching products that I could buy at a reasonable price. Then I found this!! I have been using it for a week now &amp; can not believe how soft &amp; healthy my hair feels.  It feels exactly like it does when I leave the salon.  I am in love!!!  Great product.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product, along with my family. Our hair is soft and silky and feels so much more healthier even after one use. We are definitely sticking with this product for our hair care.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. i had damaged hair for the longest time and i finally used this and they were gone! makes your hair so smooth and i definitly would recomend it!</li>
    <li> Okay this is really an excellent product, BUT these bottles are extremely small. For the amount that I paid for these, I thought they would have been a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent to much money on all different products with many hit and misses ... Then I came across the starter kit I love love love this product! my hair has been given a second chance after my daughter and stress from school and working. My hair became coarse and fell out and very ruff and my curls fell out . thank you Pantene for bring life back into my hair.  ^_^</li>
    <li> African American hair review. Love it love it love it..... feels so good and shampoo a little goes a long way. I usually do wash and then twist outs after a nice shampoo., My hair felt really soft and healthy I enjoyed the split end step vey easy to use and my hair like the keratin so ill continue to use it till it runs out. This is not the straitening system only the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I really thought this would be a waste of money. It&#x27;s Pantene right? Doesn&#x27;t exactly scream salon grade.  The 1st week my split ends were nearly gone and I noticed a DRAMATIC reduction in hair lose.  I once lost handfuls of hair in the shower but not anymore.  Buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry, hands down the most effective product I&#x27;ve EVER used on my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife recently purchased this kit and tried it out.  She hasn&#x27;t had a hair cut in a few years and said that this did a great job on her split ends.  Her hair feels softer and overall just healthier.  It&#x27;s a simply system where you shampoo, condition and then apply their spray to your hair.  Since the product is so inexpensive she said she wasn&#x27;t expecting the good results she received from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I highly recommend this system, for the price it cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Smells great  works just as described ! Considering buying the the large ones , but for now using small amounts</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing the full size, so i gave the starter kit a try...let me tell you i am impressed with these three products! In the shower i noticed less hair falling off when rinsing off the conditioner and immediately after my hair dried i noticed shiny, incredible, soft manageable hair!! :D Will definitely buy the full size.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! Makes my hair soft and smooth and clean. If you use the split end fuser on damp hair, make sure to blow dry and brush. I feel like it would leave your hair limp and oily if you didn&#x27;t blow dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased these based on the &amp;#34;Keratin&amp;#34; name and the great deal! I love Pantene products, but these were not my favorite. Maybe they were too hyped up because of the description and the name. First of all, they smell INCREDIBLE! The size is really great for the price that you pay. These did make my hair smooth and shiny. However, it worked just as good as typical shampoo and conditioner, of other brands does. I have used other Keratin treatments and they completely amazed me. This one did not because it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and moisturized as I expected it to!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! Rating three stars because of the size of the shampoo bottle, 3.9 oz. This is just slightly too large to comply with the TSA liquids rule. I realize this is marketed as trial size, not travel size. Still, seems like a very obvious oversight.</li>
    <li> I picked up this product after reading so many great reviews about it from people who has similar problems as I do. I have thick natural spiral curls, which I have been straightening and dying since I was 14 years old, (7 years.) My hair was dried out from my last highlighting session, so I went on a hunt to find something that would help.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this in my local supermarket, and I quickly scanned it and read through reviews on here, convincing myself to buy it. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;I had some pretty high expectations for this product, and I was severely disappointed. My hair didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; feeling that it was supposed to in the shower, and when I got out and blow dried it, my hair was like straw. I immediately took it back to the store and switched back to my old shampoo and a hydrating  deep conditioner. After one use, the ends of my hair looked so incredibly fried. This product was definitely not for me at all.</li>
    <li> This product isnt the best, but also not the worst. the shampoo was nice and lathery, the conditioner seemed to sink into my hair well, and the balm is softening (for the first hour). I was hoping to see my hair become stronger and reduce split ends but this did not occur. I used everything as instructed and it left my hair very dry and frizzy (it has never been this frizzy before) and split ends can still be seen throughout. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this set again. I seem to have better luck with just using &amp;#34;hair crack&amp;#34; along with volumizing shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra info:  My hair type is thick and wavy. I have highlights and flat iron once a week.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 his product hesitantly. . But tried it out, just as the instructions said and my hair came out super soft after it was straightened.. I can tell after my hair was drying it was so soft. If you don&#x27;t straighten or style your hair, your hair might feel a little awkward or dry if you have African American hair but after you straighten it, you&#x27;ll be pleased..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use a good hair straightener don&#x27;t use the ones from wal mart, look online for some good ones that heat up to 440degrees..</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before going to purchase at my local drugstore.  I have color treated hair with highlights and I flat iron my hair everyday.  I have a short bob that I have been growing out and I noticed my hair just didn&#x27;t look so healthy.  I thought what they put on the box was some gimmick...how can you fix hair in 2 minutes???  Well...it did.  Holy Smokes my hair is so so soft immediately after the first use.  I was amazed since I WAS the girl who went to the salon every 4 weeks, and at times get the $30 condition treatment that seemed to be nice for the day but nothing special afterwards.  It&#x27;s been 2 days and not one frizz, hair is soft and the ends are not frazzled.  It&#x27;s like I got the brazilian hair treatment just without the fuss and cost and toxic fumes.  lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, fast, easy and hair is soft with some bounce to it.  No oiliness, heaviness, just light and soft.  I got the tester package and so happy I did.  Will be ordering on Amazon since it is a bit cheaper here when I need more.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my hair, I am able to  my hair without difficulty. I am very pleased with this entire of products,</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo but the conditioner is disgusting and makes my hair VERY greasy even when I use a dime size amount.</li>
    <li> I saw this at my local Walmart whole looking just for some basic leave in conditioner because my hair was lifeless and so dull on the ends and this was my last ditch effort to avoid chopping off the ombré I did to my hair that dried out the ends so badly. I look up and see this, thought &amp;#34;yeah yeah just another plain old overpriced box of the same old stuff&amp;#34; so I google reviews which to my surprise were very positive so yes I buy it. I LOVE this product. My ends are restored, I NEVER thought this could happen. I&#x27;m so happy I didn&#x27;t give in and trim off my length. I absolutely would say this is essential in my hair care routine from now on so PLEASE Pantene don&#x27;t stop making this! It&#x27;s amazing! Please give it a try you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Smaller bottles allowed me to sample these products.</li>
    <li> I colored my hair a few times in the span of a month (tried ombre and then didn&#x27;t like it so darkened it back) so my hair was pretty brittle and dry. I noticed results after first use and my hair felt very soft and strong. When brushing it, I noticed a lot less split ends breaking off which has been a problem for me. I have been using this for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m surprised how good it still works (apparently you hair gets used to products and doesn&#x27;t work as well). The only thing to note is the shampoo bottle is pretty small compared to everything else.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I had dull , damaged hair. No matter what product I tried, the dullness, the dryness would come back.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product 4-5 times now. I can go without a wash for 2 days. After the wash my hair is all soft and silky and looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;They have this shine which stays till the next wash. I even feel like it has cleaned my scalp.  Although I dont feel that my hair dry faster than before like most people have observed. I would recommend this product to everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Pantene starts something for kids, to treat their hair after say a swim or playing in the playground or all that dryness after a sweaty game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can we use this same product for kids ?</li>
    <li> I am  45 year old with truly abused hair! I bleach and color regularly, blow dry every other day and flat iron every day. My hair had hit bottom with hair loss, dryness, fizziness and breakage, not to mention it felt and looked like straw!!!!! Ewe!!!! Anyway, after trying product after product(which my husband cant understand all the half full hair products in our bathroom) I decided to give this set a go. Wow!!!! What a difference! I have been using for a couple of weeks now and my hair isn&#x27;t at all what it was. I am hardly losing any hair in the shower, my hair is actually shiny (not in that greasy look sort of way) and touchable. I am not covering it with extensions just to give it pass ability and am excited to keep using this product to see what it will continue to do. I may actually use the entire bottle and buy more!!!! I really recommend this product if you are at the point where you either will start wearing a wing or cut if all off ( and neither option really appeals to you)!</li>
    <li> I have very long baby fine highlighted hair that I shampoo, dry and flat iron daily. After going through menopause and experiencing thinning and breakage and dealing with constantly trying to make it look healthy again, I was on the brink of just going with a chin length bob and starting all over.  During that time I tried many products offered by my salon as well as online including Philip B (and yes I actually paid $165 for one tub of his shampoo which did nothing but weight my hair down), Phyto, Moroccan Oil Lite for fine hair, Bumble &amp; Bumble, the Alterna Caviar line, and many other expensive lines only to be disappointed after one or two uses.  On a whim I decided to give Pantene&#x27;s Keratin Repair Kit a try.  The shampoo and conditioner in the shower smelled wonderful and made my hair very easy to detangle.  I could tell a difference immediately in how it felt.  I then tried the leave-in conditioner.  After drying and flat ironing my hair felt like it had a bit of a \\&quot;coating\\&quot; to it that I was not crazy about but it did look and behave better.  The following day I decided to omit the leave-in and VOILA...bouncy, shiny, amazingly healthy feeling hair! Since my hair is so fine I think the leave-in is just too heavy and probably will not use that again, or else just use much less of it. The shampoo and conditioner I won&#x27;t be without from now on. I find that I only need to shampoo every other day now which I&#x27;ve never been able to do before. Today I tried the ampoules from the same line (and expected to have that coated feeling again) and it was not the case at all.  It added even more brilliant shine and movement. It was much easier to flat iron as well. I had zero frizz/flyaways and my ends look like I just had a trim....very sleek. I am just thrilled.  I&#x27;ve found something very affordable that does what it claims and then some.  Thank you Pantene!!!</li>
    <li> I am terrible to my poor super fine hair &amp; over the past few months it has become alarmingly damaged, so much so that a minute under a hair dryer will cause it to split and break off.  I have spent over $100 on random hair repair serums to no avail. After ONE treatment with this stuff my hair looked and felt healthy and strong and it was manageable &amp; easy to style for the first time in over a year. I am excited to throw out my cabinet full of useless \\&quot;hair remedies\\&quot; &amp; I will be buying the large sizes of all three of these incredible products.    Update: Over a year later &amp; after a strict regimen of only shampooing when absolutely necessary, followed by a damp hair treatment of argan oil followed by a dallop of the Pantene Pro-V Expert leave in keratin treatment once my hair is dry, I finally have my old healthy hair back. I am grateful to Pantene for their restorative products.</li>
