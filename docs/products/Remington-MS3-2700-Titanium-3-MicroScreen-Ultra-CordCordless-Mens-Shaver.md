### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Otherwise, it is as advertised and an excellent product.</li>
      <li>and I must say this is not their best product.  </li>
      <li>This unit isn&#x27;t perfect, but nothing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>-Metal discolors my face, whiskers drop all over the place,used 3 months(part time) and had to replace the cutter and foil-a $20.00 hit from Best Buy.</li>
      <li>Hello China &amp; Good luck!!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s shaves great!  </li>
      <li>The Titanium trimmer was perfect for shaving around my go-tee and did a very excellent job.</li>
      <li>my opinion, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
      <li>I have used Remmington shavers for over 30 years and this one is the best.</li>
      <li>remington has been the best.</li>
      <li>Met all my expectations -- it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
      <li>I used razors for a great shave</li>
      <li>Got a great shave until, after 9 months, the batteries would not hold a 4 day charge of morning shaves.</li>
      <li>I have not even changed the blades or screen, and it still does a great job.</li>
      <li>Electric razors were perfect for times when I was in a hurry and wanted a quick shave but electric razors have always been lees than perfect.</li>
      <li>I would be happy to find a good one if they would order it by the end of the week.    </li>
      <li>, they do a good job and have always given me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used Remington shavers for years and loved them...</li>
      <li>This is simply a great shaver and has been perfectly reliable for the almost 5-years that I&#x27;ve owned it, requiring just normal, periodic maintenance.  </li>
      <li>Nice, close shave.  </li>
      <li>Either electric shaving technology has gotten better, or the Remington design is superior to rotary heads, or both,</li>
      <li>No pinching or biting and the side trimmer is really handy.  </li>
      <li>good news is that the battery life is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over the skin as many times as I did with the rotary shaver</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow the instructions</li>
      <li>Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts.</li>
      <li>The shave is comparable,it holds a charge longer,the whiskers do fall out more</li>
      <li>Want to buy mine? :)</li>
      <li>and I know for sure I won&#x27;t bother buying from another manufacturer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short &amp; to the point: this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>On top of a closer shave with the Braun</li>
      <li>and I have enjoyed razor-like closeness since.</li>
      <li>OK-</li>
      <li>This shaver works well except that the screens require changing even more often than every 3 months, as stated by the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3).</li>
      <li>It was great on my sensitive skin making it very easy to shave without any razor burn.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll have good results.</li>
      <li>and you have a clean shaver again!</li>
      <li>The razor seemed to be functioning OK, but the light was on.  </li>
      <li>Well designed, easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>I have owned many electric shavers over the years, some with more success than others.</li>
      <li>Battery has gone, but as most people know rechargeable batteries that last over one year is great.</li>
      <li>Trimmer is well positioned and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The razor works fine, but the battery was delivered defective.  </li>
      <li>Three foil heads shave very quickly and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available.</li>
      <li>The MS3-2700 is a lightweight, ergonomically well designed electric razor that gives a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the indicator light.</li>
      <li>So I bought the cord/cordless version thinking cord operation would be available when needed.  </li>
      <li>After much comparison shopping the best buy was here at Amazon.com, and it was shipped the following day.</li>
      <li>Unique manufacturing error?&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>and it HAS been a long time since I&#x27;ve tried an electric razor, but this thing is GREAT.</li>
      <li>, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil</li>
      <li>I clean it out whenever I recharge it (approx every 2 to 2-1/2 weeks) and change the foil and cutters once per year</li>
      <li>Keep the shaver clean and lubricated</li>
      <li>and I get a much closer shave leaving the skin very smooth.  </li>
      <li>It was hard for me to find a balance between the two for a perfect shave.</li>
      <li>So far I have had three of these razors and have liked all of them</li>
      <li>I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it.</li>
      <li>Its batteries died relatively quickly.  </li>
      <li>The shaver charges quickly and lasts for ages.</li>
      <li>Quickly rechargable.&lt;br /&gt;4) Stylish-looking device and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
      <li>Its battery holds a charge quite well and recharges quickly.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one.</li>
      <li>I did a little research on my own and had never heard of Remington as a reputable razor.</li>
      <li>The $40 Braun gave a much closer and comfortable shave</li>
      <li>Somewhat loud.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is worth your money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy another for sure whenever this one eventually wears out completely.  </li>
      <li>You can go much longer than when the battery light first comes on, without any loss in performance.</li>
      <li>by \\&quot;clean very quickly\\</li>
      <li>If used daily, it cuts pretty well and gives a nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>This shaver does a better job and requires less time because the shaver head covers so much more area with each pass.  </li>
      <li>I clean the unit very quickly after every use and purchase replacement foils when necessary (about every 2 years).  </li>
      <li>Cord/cordless design is very nice -- no more shaver charger setting out all the time.  </li>
      <li>Price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine</li>
      <li>Very pleased with it overall so far!</li>
      <li>the first day I had it</li>
      <li>But for the price I expect it to last more than 2 months.</li>
      <li>However, the low battery indicator is useless---stays on most of the time with no correlation to the status of the battery function.  </li>
      <li>did have the occational nicking issue when I first got the shaver, but I guess I have learned to avoid this.</li>
      <li>but I also have used Braun&#x27;s before and is a superior product although much more expensive.  </li>
      <li>This thing absolutely blew me away the FIRST TIME and every time I&#x27;ve used it since.</li>
      <li>but it took a lot of time to trim around certain areas.</li>
      <li>I suspect a corded only version would work fine.    </li>
      <li>I have a tough beard but this shaver cuts it great.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky.</li>
      <li>the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; low battery light came on.  </li>
      <li>I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product.  </li>
      <li>I now have very itchy skin and hair growing.</li>
      <li>After about 60 seconds of use, the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; low battery light came on.  </li>
      <li>After 3 days of use (with red light on)</li>
      <li>only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I originally had an MS3-1700</li>
      <li>The middle blade falls off on occasion when the cap is removed to clean the blades with the included brush.</li>
      <li>This one only lasts about 1-1/2 shaves before needing a charge and my old would last a week or more!</li>
      <li>this is more of the same old stuff-although the battery does stay alive longer it has earned a 2--otherwise</li>
      <li>years, I&#x27;ve used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;ve stuck it out.</li>
      <li>so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning.</li>

    <li> Nice, close shave.  Well designed, easy to handle.  Three foil heads shave very quickly and smoothly.  Trimmer is well positioned and easy to use.  Cord/cordless design is very nice -- no more shaver charger setting out all the time.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I owned a Braun shaver prior to this one, but thought that I would give Remington a try. The $40 Braun gave a much closer and comfortable shave then my \\&quot;now for sale\\&quot; MS3-2700. On top of a closer shave with the Braun I was not forced to replace the foil after 4 months of use. Try it if you want, but I would not recommend this product. Want to buy mine? :)</li>
    <li> The razor works fine, but the battery was delivered defective.  Out of the box I charged it up.  After about 60 seconds of use, the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; low battery light came on.  The razor seemed to be functioning OK, but the light was on.  After 3 days of use (with red light on) I charged it overnight, and again after about 60 seconds of use the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; low battery light came on.  The motor also seems to lose some of its hum when this happens.  Battery was defective out of the box.  Now I am faced with hassle of trying to get warranty service to replace the battery.  Wish I had bought a different product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For years, I&#x27;ve used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I&#x27;ll drop it otherwise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s.</li>
    <li> When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit. &lt;br /&gt;The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself! &lt;br /&gt;Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one. &lt;br /&gt;As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either. &lt;br /&gt;The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable. &lt;br /&gt;All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used. &lt;br /&gt;This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available. &lt;br /&gt;The Remington shaver really needs to have it&#x27;s cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)! &lt;br /&gt;I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last.</li>
    <li> Hello. I&#x27;m seventeen and reaching the age where I need a razor. I&#x27;ve tried disposable razors but don&#x27;t like the itchiness left to the skin. I mentioned in passing to my parents that I would like an electric razor. I would be happy to find a good one if they would order it by the end of the week.    The next day, my mom told me not to worry; she had just ordered one.    [...]I look at it and immediately frown. I did a little research on my own and had never heard of Remington as a reputable razor. I heard of Norelco, Braun, and Panasonic and had been hoping for one of those. So I grudgingly take it, and try to shave. I have relatively smooth skin with small hair \\&quot;patches\\&quot;. I tried shaving for 25 minutes to no avail. I now have very itchy skin and hair growing. I&#x27;m back to using disposables until I get a new razor. I can&#x27;t return it because my mom threw out the receipt and packing stuff.     [...]</li>
    <li> The shaver came within the time frame promised and it provides a close shave, but after using it for a few weeks now I&#x27;ve noticed the battery life is a lot worse than my last Remington MS3. This one only lasts about 1-1/2 shaves before needing a charge and my old would last a week or more! I&#x27;m not sure if it sat on the shelf too long before selling, the battery in the new shavers are weaker than the old, or perhaps infant mortality of the battery (i.e. bad batch of batteries?). Not very happy with this shaver...</li>
    <li> This shaver works well except that the screens require changing even more often than every 3 months, as stated by the manufacturer.  Since these are pretty expensive to replace, you wind up spending as much as needed to get a new shaver every year.  Not for me, I&#x27;m looking for a new model...</li>
    <li> Although it gives a close shave, it requires alot of time and effort.   I had to go over my face several times.  Also it is very noisy and the foils are very fragile and clumsy. Lastly, the trimmings come out of the foil and creates a huge mess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for about 3 months now (have used electric shavers for 20+ years - Remington and Braun), so here are my thoughts.  If used daily, it cuts pretty well and gives a nice close shave.  If I skip a day, it doesn&#x27;t cut all the whiskers, and I have to use the trimmer.  If I skip 2 days, forget it.  It probably cuts about half of the whiskers without using the trimmer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This shaver is noisier than the 2 Braun shavers I had before.  Enough so that it bothers me when the shaver is under my sideburns.  And as others have noted, the shaver tends to kick out the whisker cuttings and leaves a mess on the countertop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The good news is that the battery life is pretty good.  I&#x27;m getting 2+ weeks on a charge.  You can go much longer than when the battery light first comes on, without any loss in performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll go back to Braun when this shaver dies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3&#x27;s for a few years. They&#x27;ve just been had inexpensively here and there so that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;ve stuck it out. But in all honesty, these seem to cost me more than I&#x27;ve thought in the past. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I&#x27;ve noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I&#x27;m a patient person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the weakness: the foils are like paper, and flake holes in them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I&#x27;d rashed up my neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I&#x27;d bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new unit was the trick. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, now just three months later, the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled with these things. My patience is now out and I&#x27;m headed back to an old faithful: Braun.</li>
    <li> ed600 said \\&quot;This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using nothing but my Remington ms3 2700 every day for SEVEN years.  I clean the unit very quickly after every use and purchase replacement foils when necessary (about every 2 years).  I just bought my second Remington ms3 2700 after an internal plastic part broke due to rigorous cleaning.  This unit isn&#x27;t perfect, but nothing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And by \\&quot;clean very quickly\\&quot; I mean that I open the top and let the little hairs fall out.)</li>
    <li> The MS3-2700 is a lightweight, ergonomically well designed electric razor that gives a close, comfortable shave.  It lacks some of the bells and whistles (that really are not necessary) on the more expensive models, but serves its basic purpose very well.  The trimmer works well, too.  Its battery holds a charge quite well and recharges quickly.  After much comparison shopping the best buy was here at Amazon.com, and it was shipped the following day.</li>
    <li> I have used Remmington shavers for over 30 years and this one is the best. It has an annoying characteristic, however, of showing the red charge light being on even when there are 4-5 more shaves left. Otherwise, it is as advertised and an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the years, some with more success than others. Remingtons&#x27; products have always rated highly with me, so when it came time to buy a new shaver Remington was on my list. I purchased this shaver two weeks ago and I have enjoyed razor-like closeness since. The shaver charges quickly and lasts for ages. The de-luxe carry pouch is just a PVC zipper bag, but who cares? The shaver is a quality product with a fast powerful motor and feels solid and well made. Like a Mercedes, you know it will just keep on working as expected for years. Being washable, there are no worries about cleaning, just squirt some liqid soap over the foils, turn on for a few seconds then rinse and dry and you have a clean shaver again! I keep coming back to Remington simply because the other makes I have tried just don&#x27;t come close and I know for sure I won&#x27;t bother buying from another manufacturer, there&#x27;s just no point!</li>
    <li> Shaver generally shaves well.  However, the low battery indicator is useless---stays on most of the time with no correlation to the status of the battery function.  Also the removal/replacement of the shaver head is not smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 6 months now and here is what I&#x27;ve learned....  It takes a long time to shave with this thing, it takes several passes over your face... let me repeat that... SEVERAL.  It&#x27;s nicked me before but I&#x27;ve learned to avoid that.  The worst part about this is that when you shave, your freshly cut stubble collects all over the OUTSIDE of the razor and then places it in places like under your nose as you furiously shave.  It&#x27;s annoying to say the least.</li>
    <li> OK- I have been stung again-Had a Remington when I was 18-didn&#x27;t know anything-Got another one when I was 35-- hated it-then got a Panasonic and loved it-Went back to Remington and I am back where I started-Metal discolors my face, whiskers drop all over the place,used 3 months(part time) and had to replace the cutter and foil-a $20.00 hit from Best Buy. No help from the Customer Service group- So bottom line- find another brand this is more of the same old stuff-although the battery does stay alive longer it has earned a 2--otherwise I would have rated it a 1.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, by the end of February the screen had visible holes in it and drew blood.  The shaving took forever.  But for the price I expect it to last more than 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Remington shaver.  The first one I bought was battery only.  Its batteries died relatively quickly.  I took it apart and wired directly from the rectifier to the motor, but it runs very slowly when shaving, and hardly at all with the trimmer engaged.    So I bought the cord/cordless version thinking cord operation would be available when needed.  Once I got it and read the manual, I noted that battery lifespan would be degraded if you operate corded.  So I operated it on battery until fully discharged.  Still, the batteries degraded rapidly - after a few months its less than a minute.    I suspect a corded only version would work fine.    One of the 2 razors had its trimmer pop upwards and outwards at an odd angle **the first day I had it** upon pressing of the activation button.  It popped back in but periodically did that throughout its life.  I developed the habit of putting my finger over the foil, sticking out over where the trimmer would be so it couldn&#x27;t do this.    Oh, and the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on at all, which allows the foil to get damaged.  Hardly any razors I&#x27;ve had over my adult life have a decent cap that doesn&#x27;t fall off if you put it pretty much anywhere it&#x27;ll be touched by anything.    I do like the shave it gave and the trimmer works well enough.    I compare it to numerous Braun razors I&#x27;ve had over the years: batteries are fine (several years), but they don&#x27;t tend to shave my particular face as well.    So: good shave, terrible battery life, mediocre quality.    &#x3D;VK</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for 6 years now and regular razors at the same time. It was hard for me to find a balance between the two for a perfect shave. I used razors for a great shave but it took a lot of time to trim around certain areas. Electric razors were perfect for times when I was in a hurry and wanted a quick shave but electric razors have always been lees than perfect. I&#x27;ve always had problems with electric shavers causing burns on my neck and being difficult to shave around my go-tee. This new Titanium shaver has been a miracle. It brings together the perfection of a razor and the ease of use of an electric razor.  It was great on my sensitive skin making it very easy to shave without any razor burn. The Titanium trimmer was perfect for shaving around my go-tee and did a very excellent job. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on other shavers including expensive wet/dry shavers in my time but I&#x27;ve finally found the one I always wish that they were going to invent. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for several weeks now. I usually let me facial hair grow a little, so I shave every 3rd or even 4th day - that way I use both components of the shaver the so-called trimmer as well as the triple blades. So, here are my comments on its performance (not necessarily in the order of importance):&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVE&lt;br /&gt;1) Very minor skin irritation, if any at all.&lt;br /&gt;2) Shaving closeness very good, but a few strokes are necessary to achieve smoothness (as is the case with every shaver).&lt;br /&gt;3) Quickly rechargable.&lt;br /&gt;4) Stylish-looking device and accessories.&lt;br /&gt;5) Trimming works well, followed with triple blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;6) Comes with a storage case/travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;br /&gt;1) The middle blade falls off on occasion when the cap is removed to clean the blades with the included brush. Unique manufacturing error?&lt;br /&gt;2) Somewhat loud.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is worth your money. To date, I have not regretted buying it and I hope that I won&#x27;t for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have had mine about 3 years now. I have not even changed the blades or screen, and it still does a great job. I am about to have to get another one because the charge only last one day now. Went from 5 days to 1 day over night. Battery has gone, but as most people know rechargeable batteries that last over one year is great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I did have the occational nicking issue when I first got the shaver, but I guess I have learned to avoid this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other shavers I have had: Braun, Panasonic, Remington. remington has been the best.</li>
    <li> I used Remington shavers for years and loved them...but this one does NOT live up to the past quality!  Within a month or two the screens were already dulling to the point where I had to shave multiple times just to get a reasonable shave.  I tried returning the product to Remington, but they blew me off big time.  Save your money...buy another brand!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Met all my expectations -- it&#x27;s a great shaver. Price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This is simply a great shaver and has been perfectly reliable for the almost 5-years that I&#x27;ve owned it, requiring just normal, periodic maintenance.  I&#x27;ve traveled all over the world with this thing and it&#x27;s shaves great!  No pinching or biting and the side trimmer is really handy.  I clean it out whenever I recharge it (approx every 2 to 2-1/2 weeks) and change the foil and cutters once per year (Approx $14 on Amazon).  Additionally, like all rechargeable products, you should NEVER recharge the battery until it&#x27;s fully or almost fully discharged and since I&#x27;ve done this since I bought it almost 5-years ago, it continues its reliable service.  I&#x27;d buy another for sure whenever this one eventually wears out completely.  After all, nothing lasts forever.</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco rotary shaver for the last 10 years or so I decided to try the Remington Microscreen MS3-2700.  This shaver does a better job and requires less time because the shaver head covers so much more area with each pass.  I don&#x27;t have to go over the skin as many times as I did with the rotary shaver and I get a much closer shave leaving the skin very smooth.  I have a tough beard but this shaver cuts it great.  I should have bought it years ago.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so far so I don&#x27;t know how long a battery charge will last.</li>
    <li> I purchased the MS3-2700 shaver and after 3 mo&#x27;s the microscreen developed a small hole and cut my face.  I have been trying to replace the SP-93 screen and blades, but have been unable to find a store that carries them.  I e-mailed remington twice and explained my problem but did not even receive a courtest reply. Most retailers including Walmart, Target, etc seem to be oblivious to the fact that they should be stocking the replacement parts.</li>
    <li> I was never an electric shaver type-of-guy, having a heavy five-o&#x27;clock shadow. I tried a Norelco shaver (rotary heads) some years ago and it just didn&#x27;t cut close enough. Either electric shaving technology has gotten better, or the Remington design is superior to rotary heads, or both, because the Remington gives me a close shave without the chafing and burning I got with using razors every day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that I originally had an MS3-1700 but I accidentally dropped it. It fell from the counter top in the bathroom to the hard tile floor and it was dead. It should be rugged enough to survive a drop like that; sooner or later it will happen to anyone who owns one. I bought the MS3-2700 as its replacement. I will be very careful with this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Remington&#x27;s before and I must say this is not their best product.  It can be found cheaper if you must have it but I also have used Braun&#x27;s before and is a superior product although much more expensive.  I have tried many different methods of shaving but this razor still burns my face everyday no matter what i do.  I have not had any problem with battery charge as some have talked about.</li>
    <li> So far I have had three of these razors and have liked all of them that&#x27;s why I have ordered another one, they do a good job and have always given me a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other razors in the past but none of them have been as good as the Remington MS3 razor.</li>
    <li> Got a great shave until, after 9 months, the batteries would not hold a 4 day charge of morning shaves. Tried to take it apart to replace the rechargeable batteres. Forget the screws- it&#x27;s all glued together and is meant to be thrown away, I guess. Hello China &amp; Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short &amp; to the point: this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I have a thick, heavy beard that grows long quickly AND I have sensitive skin. I am recovering from surgery and needed a shaver that gave me a decent shave without a long adjustment period (because I am unable to manipulate a blade-type razor). This thing absolutely blew me away the FIRST TIME and every time I&#x27;ve used it since. I am 42 yrs. old and couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a shave like this. It could be the era I grew up in and it HAS been a long time since I&#x27;ve tried an electric razor, but this thing is GREAT. Make sure you follow the instructions and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ll have good results. &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;1. Keep the shaver clean and lubricated (it doesn&#x27;t hurt to do the same with your face and neck). &lt;br /&gt;2. Use the trimmer for longer beard hairs (face &amp; neck); pull your skin flat and use a semi-circular stroke. DO NOT press down harder to get hairs that prove difficult to trim or shave; rather, use the method stated previously. &lt;br /&gt;And, oh yeah: I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the indicator light. I haven&#x27;t noticed it and it doesn&#x27;t affect functioality. &lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> I have had three Remington shavers and they perform great, but poor battery life is the achilles heel of the product.  With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months.  After that, it&#x27;s time to either ship it to an &#x27;authorized repair site&#x27; and incur a big fee or plunk down more cash for a new one.  &lt;br /&gt;By the way, the battery bypass cord is useless if the battery dies.  It can&#x27;t bypass without some sustainable life in the battery so the shaver is dead when the battery goes.  Not exactly what I&#x27;d call consumer friendly engineering.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell much,if any,difference between my Braun Activator and &lt;br /&gt;my Remington MS3-2700! The shave is comparable,it holds a charge longer,the whiskers do fall out more and,it is noisier. BUT,it cost half as much! I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see how it does with the white whiskers (I&#x27;m 65) or,foil longevity. When my white whiskers get 1/8\\&quot; long,nothing but a blade cuts them. I had to go with the Activator over the Syncro to solve this. Very pleased with it overall so far!</li>
