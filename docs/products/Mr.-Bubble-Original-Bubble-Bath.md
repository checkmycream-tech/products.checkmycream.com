      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>we had the powder and it worked a lot better than this.</li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>Overall... very happy.</li>
      <li>I note that the manufacturer no longer advertises this outstanding quality, but I&#x27;m still a customer because of the no-bath-tub-ring properties, even though my son is now 30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Mr.</li>
      <li>I have read some reviews where people have not been satisfied</li>
      <li>They claim that Mr. Bubble is a safe tested prodect</li>
      <li>Though that that was one of the more hilarious bath times.</li>
      <li>Cheaper and Better</li>
      <li>and I love the smell and feel of these bubbles.</li>
      <li>I love Mr.Bubble, and my kids do to, but I will never buy online again</li>
      <li>satisfied , i will buy this again.</li>
      <li>We love it.</li>
      <li>Cute bottle</li>
      <li>I used to love this stuff as a kid it smelled stronger too</li>
      <li>We put about 4 or 5 capfulls of Mr. Bubble and our son goes to town on enjoying them with his toys in the bathtub.</li>
      <li>Great product in the past and great product for this generation</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much liquid to get a good bubble bath going.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and it makes great bubbles that last the entirety of bath time.</li>
      <li>I could say how many bath times it&#x27;s good for, but my 3 year old emptied 1/2 of it in the tub at once when I let him pour it in himself.</li>
      <li>I was super excited to see Mr.Bubble because I remember it from bath times from my childhood, the reason I loved bubble baths in the first place!</li>
      <li>Although Amazon claims full responsibility for packaging and shipping, Amazon should heed their customers&#x27; feedback (there are too many of us who have had this problem to be a fluke).</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution makes bubbles just fine, but it iritates our childs eyes very quickly and we had to stop using this product and instead move to a tear free product.</li>
      <li>No matter what anyone says, this is the best bubble bath EVER (hands down)!</li>
      <li>The package says tear free, but irritates our sons eyes.</li>
      <li>The package terms it as tear free and this is accurate.</li>
      <li>Kids love making bubble beards and all of the fun hair styles.</li>
      <li>Have always loved these bubbles, now my 6 year old loves them.</li>
      <li>Thanks Mr. Bubble!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s primary purpose which is to make bathing fun and bubbly!</li>
      <li>fl oz Original Bubble Bath]]</li>
      <li>You can’t also beat the fragrance that is in Mr. Bubble Original Bath.</li>
      <li>-- I had another bottle of Mr. Bubble and both it and the bottles that I got from Amazon said \\&quot;original bubble bath\\&quot; on them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was excited to find Mr. Bubble online in the large 36-oz size and that shipping was free if I ordered four or more.</li>
      <li>I use it because it keeps the bathtub clean with no scrubbing.  </li>
      <li>It also smells really good; brings back childhood memories.</li>
      <li>This product really makes me enjoy taking bathes!</li>
      <li>I love it because it&#x27;s a classic</li>
      <li>But love the classic smell</li>
      <li>I love the classic Mr Bubble scent and since then I have taken about 6 bubble baths with it.</li>
      <li>Mister bubble was always a favorite bath soap to me many years back.</li>
      <li>I have to admit, this stuff makes far more bubbles than the cheap knock-offs.</li>
      <li>It seems like it should be easy to find, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  </li>
      <li>Love the sensitive version!</li>
      <li>the bubbles work fine, but you have to use so much of the liquid</li>
      <li>It sure makes a lot of bubbles, not much of a scent, but grandkids don&#x27;t mine, they just love bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.</li>
      <li>I love everything, from the smell, to how soft it makes my skin feels after the bath to all the bubbles.</li>
      <li>It’s a fun way of getting rid of the dirt.</li>
      <li>No one wants to get ready to bathe and find that they&#x27;re out of Mr. Bubble!!!</li>
      <li>smells awesome , do a lot of bubbles, different than other products that&#x27;s just liquid</li>
      <li>The price was right</li>
      <li>My son likes it and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to get some suds going.</li>
      <li>Honestly if I knew thew main ingredient was water I may have got a different brand...  </li>
      <li>, therefore I ordered for her and find myself enjoying same.</li>
      <li>My son loves bubble baths so of course Mr. Bubble was my first choice to use.</li>
      <li>Obviously, one or more of the bottles had leaked.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find this in a larger package size, also.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Buy Mr Bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought several themed types of bubble for movies and TV shows. I was disapointed in the quality with them, they weren&#x27;t very bubbely. In my book Mr Bubbles is the standard of bubbles, and I am not going to waste my time buying other brands any more.</li>
    <li> We put about 4 or 5 capfulls of Mr. Bubble and our son goes to town on enjoying them with his toys in the bathtub. I just wish I would have waited to buy something else somewhere for cheaper. I found different bubble baths at Ross that were also 36 oz but were only $5, well something around there it wasn&#x27;t much, definitely no $13!</li>
    <li> I started purchasing Mr. Bubble when my son was a toddler, nearly 30 years ago.  Mr. Bubble produces a nice mass of long-lasting bubbles with little product. But the best feature about Mr. Bubble is that it does not leave a bath-tub ring! Perhaps it is the combination of the Dove bar soap I use and Mr. Bubble, but I have never had to scrub a scummy bath-tub ring. I note that the manufacturer no longer advertises this outstanding quality, but I&#x27;m still a customer because of the no-bath-tub-ring properties, even though my son is now 30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to find Mr. Bubble online in the large 36-oz size and that shipping was free if I ordered four or more. Mr. Bubble is becoming more difficult to locate in my area and seldom do I find the lager bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mr. Bubble was delivered by UPS, I was handed a slimy, soapy cardboard box. Obviously, one or more of the bottles had leaked. Upon opening the package, I saw what the problem was: only unsuitable air-filled bags \\&quot;protected\\&quot; the four heavy bottles from bouncing around or keeping them upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the reviews under the the Village Company, manufacturer of Mr. Bubble, the packaging issues seem to have escalated during August. Although Amazon claims full responsibility for packaging and shipping, Amazon should heed their customers&#x27; feedback (there are too many of us who have had this problem to be a fluke). There are no complaints about the product, only the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is time to reorder, I will definitely check the reviews to see if the packaging has improved before making another purchase.</li>
    <li> the bubbles work fine, but you have to use so much of the liquid and it&#x27;s so watery. I&#x27;d say save your money and get a different brand, water it down yourself and consider a standard 12 oz bottle of less expensive bubble bath as  36 oz.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good product for my kids for Christmas. Got it today was SOOOO disappointed. maybe it was just my package, but there was no seal around the top (to prevent from opening) no seal inside (to prevent from spilling) no packaging like packing peanuts etc. and worst, it was leaking. I am SO dissappointed with it, I couldn&#x27;t believe it, the box was dented also, looks like UPS just threw it around and The Village Company doesn&#x27;t care about packaging and keeping their stuff safe! I love Mr.Bubble, and my kids do to, but I will never buy online again (the only reason I did, was because I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE!) Don&#x27;t order this stuff, look in stores, it&#x27;s probably cheaper somewhere else too.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time and as listed. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> It arrived with soap all over the inside of the box, but they took it back (after I cleaned it up and wrapped it in plastic.) Otherwise, I am sure the Mr. Bubble would have been a great, quality product as always. :)</li>
    <li> It works like I remember it working when I was a kid, but it takes a TON of stuff to do it.  It usually runs out really quickly, so it&#x27;s a treat. I use regular baby wash to give the kids bubbles usually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased these brand of bubble for my 4yr old at Walmart for the low cost. They satisfy our needs.</li>
    <li> Others reported leaking bottles, so I was somewhat concerned but ordered anyway since I knew that Amazon would stand behind it.  The package arrived in great shape, and there was no leakage whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I have had a lot of problem finding inexpensive bubble bath for the past couple of years.  I used to buy it from the grocery store and all discount stores, but none of them seem to carry it anymore.  One thing I did notice -- I had another bottle of Mr. Bubble and both it and the bottles that I got from Amazon said \\&quot;original bubble bath\\&quot; on them.  They are not the same product.  I noticed that they smelled different, and the product from Amazon seemed a little thinner.  The product from Amazon foamed a little more and held the bubbles longer than the product from the other bottle.  It is typical for the bubbles in bubble bath to disappear when soap is introduced into the bath water, and I don&#x27;t care about the bubbles.  I use it because it keeps the bathtub clean with no scrubbing.  The price is good, and the product does what it is supposed to do, so I am giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> For some reason I have the hardest time finding bubble bath that actually produces bubbles. This does! And its a good price. The only things that could improve this bubble bath is if it came in a \\&quot;night time\\&quot; smell.. something that would calm the child and if it had some sort of measuring cup built in... my son likes to pour his own but it comes out way to fast for that. Overall... very happy. I&#x27;ll be getting this again!</li>
    <li> I bought Mr. Bubble bubble bath for my grandchildren .  It made loads of long lasting bubbles with just a small amount of Mr. Bubble.  They loved it and had a great time playing in the tub!  It made much longer lasting bubbles than the product I used before!  [[ASIN:B002FCH4B4 Mr. Bubble 36 fl oz Original Bubble Bath]]</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this bubble bath.  It is really gentle for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and he loves all the bubbles it makes.  Great product.</li>
    <li> After comparing this to J&amp;J baby bubble bath &amp; wash I can definitely tell this Mr. Bubble is watered down. After working in the grocery industry as a buyer, I know the simplest way for manufacturers to make more money is to dilute the product down.  This is so bad it&#x27;s nearly unusable.  Do not try compare this to J&amp;J! Night and day difference.  Mr. Bubble is basically water, J&amp;J is like half water / half soap.. it&#x27;s super thick.  My recommendation - skip Mr. Bubble and get something that actually produces bubbles.</li>
    <li> This is the only bubble bath that I know that actually bubbles daughter loved it... I will definitely buy again...</li>
    <li> Unless your kid decides to dump the whole jug into the tub at once (personal experience) this should last for a good long time! It doesn&#x27;t take much liquid to get a good bubble bath going. (Just FYI, the whole jug at once makes for a tough - but sort of fun - mess to clean up)</li>
    <li> Our son loves bubble baths and this does the trick.  I have read some reviews where people have not been satisfied w/ the amount of bubbles.  We have not experienced that issue.  We have found you need to move the water around and create the bubbles.  If you rely on the agitation of the water from the spout, you will be disappointed in the intensity/amount of bubbles - which is the one down side, you need to put some elbow grease into the making of the bubbles.  Like the soft scent.</li>
    <li> Have tried more expensive, spa-type stuff and always come back to Mr Bubbles!  Cheaper and Better</li>
    <li> Wanted to get some bubble bath for my son and also wanted the convenience of Prime, and look what I found but Mr. Bubble! Still gets the bath tub VERY bubbly just like I remember as a kid growing up.</li>
    <li> This is not a tear free bubble bath and we found out the hard way. The package says tear free, but irritates our sons eyes. We&#x27;ve had no issues with other bubble baths except this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution makes bubbles just fine, but it iritates our childs eyes very quickly and we had to stop using this product and instead move to a tear free product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product causes irritation in private areas due to the chemicals in it. I have three bottles that we cannot use.</li>
    <li> The bottle leaked.  And, the company knew it would happen, this is why it was put in a plastic bag, inside the box.  At least 1/3 of the product spilled out of the container (if not more).  Nothing else in the box was ruined but that isn&#x27;t the point.</li>
    <li> This is a great hypoallergenic product although my son still cries if you pour water over his head as if it burns his eyes. Maybe he&#x27;s just dramatic. It&#x27;s about twice the price as at the grocery store, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used it before but it is actually good stuff. My son likes it and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to get some suds going. He plays in the tub for a while and gets clean at the same time. Once his cousin saw it he wanted to use it too. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like Mr. Bubble?</li>
    <li> I dont know what happened I used to love this stuff as a kid it smelled stronger too, I went to the store to get BB last night this is all they had, my only choice, so I got it. I ran it under the water and put a ton in but there were very few bubbles, I dont have hard water so I can&#x27;t fiqure out what went wrong here, I added more 3x but no real bubbles to write home about. I wanted big bubbles and to get lost in them but it wasn&#x27;t happening.</li>
    <li> Though I would love to only review this item by the bubbles themselves but as I learned when i was was little and still have an issue with now when I am 24y old I have allergies to soaps, lotions, and dyes that cause rashes and urinary tract infections. They claim that Mr. Bubble is a safe tested prodect but like when I was little I STILL have allergic reactions to this product. For that reason I fear ever letting my son anywhere near it.</li>
    <li> Bought out of a need to find some bubble bath for kids, our 11/2 year old. Mr Bubble has been really good especially since the suds hold up for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble finding bubble bath locally.  It seems like it should be easy to find, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  The volume of bubble bath you get for the price makes this a great value.  I love it because it&#x27;s a classic and my daughter loves it too.  The bubbles develop quickly and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult who enjoys the occasional bubble bath every once in awhile so when looking for bubble bath products here on Amazon I was super excited to see Mr.Bubble because I remember it from bath times from my childhood, the reason I loved bubble baths in the first place! But unfortunately Mr.Bubbles did not live up to expectations this time. I poured at least two cups worth into my bath and received minimal bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a lot of bubbles go ahead and use more than half the bottle, thats what I did eventually. I finally got the bubble bath I wanted but in my opinion the amount of bubbles was not worth the price, I thought the bottle would last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> When it comes to bubble baths you cannot go wrong with Mr. Bubble. As an adult I was trying to find the adult bubble bath stuff and they all just suck.  Mr. Bubble still is the best there is and the price is way better than anything else you can buy!</li>
    <li> I do not like the liquid .I remember when i was a kid in the 70s we had the powder and it worked a lot better than this.You have to use way to much of this.The powder did not take much and the bubbles were bigger and better.Just like everything else today they do not make things the way they use to.BRING BACK THE POWDER MR.BUBBLE</li>
    <li> The idea of bubble bath is that it makes bubbles.  This product barely does that and the bubbles it makes fade away very quickly.  Cute bottle and it&#x27;s gentle enough for a child, but my experience was that it doesn&#x27;t fill it&#x27;s primary purpose which is to make bathing fun and bubbly!</li>
    <li> warning label about the risk of irritation to the skin and urinary tract from prolonged exposure - saw this label on Mr bubble. I bought this for someone who wanted very bubbly baths.I didn&#x27;t let them use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Mr. Bubble. It rocks.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could say how many bath times it&#x27;s good for, but my 3 year old emptied 1/2 of it in the tub at once when I let him pour it in himself. Though that that was one of the more hilarious bath times.</li>
    <li> great price. lots of bubbles. love the smell</li>
    <li> My husband knows I love bubble baths and for Christmas he bought me this! He had no clue it was my favorite bubble bath as a child and I was ecstatic with joy! I love the classic Mr Bubble scent and since then I have taken about 6 bubble baths with it. I love it!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter recently gave birth and reminisced about Mr Bubble, therefore I ordered for her and find myself enjoying same. Anyone wanting a bubbly bath and soft buy it.</li>
    <li> Just a nice addition to my grandkids bath.  The price was right and so I purchased the item.  It sure makes a lot of bubbles, not much of a scent, but grandkids don&#x27;t mine, they just love bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.</li>
    <li> Finally getting to use bubbles that are not &#x27;baby bubbles&#x27; and really like the ol tried and true Mister Bubble.  We alternate (and sometimes mix) between bubbles, water tint, and sometimes lights out glow stick baths. Kids love making bubble beards and all of the fun hair styles.</li>
    <li> Lots of bubbles. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The bubbles last long and they don&#x27;t cause any my little girls and female problems that bubbles can sometimes due.</li>
    <li> Purchased three bottles - one for each tub and a spare! I gave it as a gift to my four year old for Valentine&#x27;s Day, so it did double-duty.</li>
    <li> Have always loved these bubbles, now my 6 year old loves them. I bought them here they were a great price. These bubbles smell good and are for everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around for decades and give you lots of bubbles.  What&#x27;s not to like!  Bubbles, bubbles and more bubbles.</li>
    <li> I love Mr.Bubbles bubble bath. Its always nice to come home and take a relaxing bubble bath and I love the smell and feel of these bubbles. It definetly makes the perfect bath.</li>
    <li> My son loves bubble baths so of course Mr. Bubble was my first choice to use. Great product in the past and great product for this generation</li>
    <li> Mister bubble was always a favorite bath soap to me many years back. Twenty years later I gave it a try again and found it much less potent. At the given amount of two ounces... It is ok but a squirt of hair soap practicly makes the same amount. Honestly if I knew thew main ingredient was water I may have got a different brand...  But love the classic smell</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me? You need a review for Mr. Bubble? This stuff is Mr. Bubble! It has its rep already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice big suds that last and make us and our son laugh. We can use it to make hats on his head or a beard and mustache. Or you can just let them lie on top of the water without playing with them, but that would be boring.</li>
    <li> Love the sensitive version! Gotta love Mr. Bubbles! This works great and is a bath of fun! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> What can you really say about this? It&#x27;s bubble bath. The same one I used growing up. We love it.</li>
    <li> very good product. smells awesome , do a lot of bubbles, different than other products that&#x27;s just liquid .&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied , i will buy this again.</li>
    <li> My kid loves this product!!! The pediatrician recommended this product during one of our visits there. My kid has a sensitive skin and it was a hurdle trying to get a sensitive bathing product and it was driving me nuts. I didn’t hesitate buying this product as I had also used it as a kid and shower time was always enjoyable. You can’t also beat the fragrance that is in Mr. Bubble Original Bath. It is also made in USA meaning that quality is guaranteed. There are people who have complained that the product is watered and that you have to use a sizable amount of the product to get the bubbles but we have not had this issue and can’t comment on that. But you have to stir up the water to get the bubbles. I also use this product from time to time as it’s a good reminder of the past. I also like the way it leaves the skin feeling. There are themed bubble products but I believe Mr. Bubble is the yardstick. I have used a lot of products but Mr. Bubble clearly stands out. The company that makes this thing has been around for over 30 years and that should tell you something. You actually don’t need a review to know that Mr. Bubble works. The bubbles also don’t make the eyes itchy. The package terms it as tear free and this is accurate. The product also arrived on time but not in a so good shape. The bottle was in a plastic bag implying that the company knew that the product would leak. There was minimal spilling and I hope that this will be rectified before my next purchase. There are knock offs out there but none of them live long enough to tell their sorry story. This is the best bubble soap out there and I would vouch for Mr. Bubble anytime. Old is truly gold.  To all the parents out there who have a hard time trying to get their kids to take baths should try this product and shower time will become exciting. It’s a fun way of getting rid of the dirt. The bubble baths are now a bonding moment for us as we can use the bubbles to create varying shapes and also talk. It’s always a hahaha moment for us and we now all look forward to bathing time. Thanks Mr. Bubble!!!talk. It’s always a hahaha moment for us and we now all look forward to bathing time. Thanks Mr. Bubble!!!</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with classic bubble bath? Every kid loves these, it&#x27;s a proven fact.</li>
    <li> To this day, I cannot live without my Mr.Bubble bubble bath. No matter what anyone says, this is the best bubble bath EVER (hands down)! I love everything, from the smell, to how soft it makes my skin feels after the bath to all the bubbles. Every time I take a bath with Mr.Bubble, I feel like a kid again. This product really makes me enjoy taking bathes! Yipppppy!</li>
    <li> Great buy, I just wish it had come with a pump/spout thing. But I can find one of those at a beauty supply.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this stuff makes far more bubbles than the cheap knock-offs. And the bubbles stick around in the tub longer. It also smells really good; brings back childhood memories.</li>
    <li> We have well water, not sure if that makes a difference but you have to put quite a bit of this in the tub to make a lot of bubbles.</li>
    <li> I just plain love this stuff. Smells great, helps get you clean. Absolutely love this product. Great fun. I was pleased to find this in a larger package size, also. No one wants to get ready to bathe and find that they&#x27;re out of Mr. Bubble!!!</li>
    <li> Just like being a kid again with Mr. Bubbles in the bath tub!  It is so nice to know that brands from when were kids are still around and still a quality product!</li>
    <li> My son loves taking bubble baths... without Mr.Bubble it would be a struggle to try and get him in the tub.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and it makes great bubbles that last the entirety of bath time. My daughter has somewhat sensitive skin and this does not affect her at all. Definitely will buy again!</li>
    <li> Still the best and definitely affordable like this. Tip for any who want more bubbles and the spout isn&#x27;t doing it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a power wisk and run it in the tub for a minute while filling the tub. Lots more bubbles and they will last longer.</li>
    <li> Mr Bubbles. Classic Bubble bath from your childhood.  Silly fun, bubbles for a bubble bath, what else could you want from bubble bath?</li>
