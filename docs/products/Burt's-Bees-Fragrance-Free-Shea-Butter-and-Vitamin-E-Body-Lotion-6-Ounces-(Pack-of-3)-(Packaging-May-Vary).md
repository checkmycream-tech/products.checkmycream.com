      <li>That is fine, not every moisturizer is for every skin type.  </li>
      <li>I like this light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>so at the end of the day it&#x27;s important that I moisturize my legs.</li>
      <li>I have the 24 hour moisture fragrance free shea butter and vitamin E lotion</li>
      <li>Very hydrating and been using it for years, and plan for many more</li>
      <li>The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
      <li>but they actually look pretty good now!  </li>
      <li>Not bad, just what you would expect from a fragrance free product.</li>
      <li>your want a lotion with a lasting pleasant fragrance you probably won&#x27;t care for this.</li>
      <li>I have it at work and by my bed for times that I want my lotion to soak in quickly.  </li>
      <li>It soaks quickly into my skin and does not leave a film of grease/lotion or any smell.</li>
      <li>You see, he was a lot more environmentally concerned that most commercial companies and therefore produced a purer line of goods.</li>
      <li>This rich lotion, which is the consistency of a cream, is wonderful for dry skin in wintertime or dry weather in any season.  </li>
      <li>A worth while product</li>
      <li>I thought to myself that this was something worth trying.  </li>
      <li>Mostly a beeswaxy natural smell.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion because it goes on silky smooth, has lots of natural ingredients and none that irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>It has had an amazing effect on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>And only after a few days...to say I&#x27;m impressed would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels better than I can remember (and in the dead of winter!)...very pleased.  </li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are all good, even though old Burt sold out to a commercial conglomerate, but I cannot give this lotion a five star rating that I would have given it if it still belonged to Burt.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and consider myself a big fan and happy to be their customer.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is very nice, if you can get past the smell.</li>
      <li>Not greasy, no fake scent,  just smooth young lookiing skin for hours.  </li>
      <li>After so many years of using moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t work or made the dryness worse this is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Even this discounted 3 pack is around 1 dollar an ounce and lets face it 6oz goes pretty fast when you are using it from head to toe.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, quality product in mint condition.</li>
      <li>The cream really protects my hands from the cold/dry weather and absorbs well.  </li>
      <li>it is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend all products!</li>
      <li>Not only has the itchiness stopped but my skin looks smooth and has a pleasing sheen to it.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin feeling nice all day and keeps it from feeling dried out.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it takes a lot of work to spread it out on my skin and I have to work quickly because it absorbs FAST.  </li>
      <li>I tried some other brands that were highly recommended by my doctor but they all left my skin feeling dry and incredibly itchy when I took my stockings off.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is my new BFF!</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>We originally had babyganics, but it didn&#x27;t keep her skin from getting dry and flaky.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin soft and smooth for a long time.</li>
      <li>After a few days we both developed reactions although mine was more severe.</li>
      <li>My dried heels became instantly much better than when I was using major lotion products on the market like Neut######.  </li>
      <li>so it just smells like the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Although my skin is sensitive and allergic, I haven&#x27;t got any problem so far.  </li>
      <li>Its natural barrier keep the tattoo moist, and the chamomile, St. Johns Wort, had a soothing factor.</li>
      <li>And being all natural was prime for this use.</li>
      <li>If you leave it in one place too long it will absorb too much there and leave that part of your skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love that this has hardly any smell!</li>
      <li>Then it would spread to my other dry zones which is pretty much my whole body at this</li>
      <li>if I don&#x27;t put this on at night before bed, the whole next day my hands are really dry.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees usually makes good products which is why I went with their lotion, but good heavens it smells awful.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Every year I try several different moisturizers with little success.  </li>
      <li>I will not use it at all, and I am pretty upset I just wasted the money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read all of the reviews that mentioned the awful smell of this product before purchasing. Since I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, and it claims to be &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, I thought it couldn&#x27;t be that bad. However, it really is a weird smell, sort of like plastic. I tried using it once or twice, and it&#x27;s possible being pregnant made it worse, but I ended up purchasing the shea butter lotion from another brand and throwing this away. The lotion itself is very nice, if you can get past the smell.</li>
    <li> Best lotion and no smell!</li>
    <li> I have the 24 hour moisture fragrance free shea butter and vitamin E lotion and I love it! It keeps my skin soft and smooth for a long time. Which is saying a lot, I have dry skin and keratosis pilaris(chicken skin) on my arms. The beeswax, olive oil, etc in this lotion creates a protective barrier to keep the moisture in without creating a sticky, thick texture like things with petroleum jelly do. I used it for a new tattoo and it works wonderful. Its natural barrier keep the tattoo moist, and the chamomile, St. Johns Wort, had a soothing factor. And being all natural was prime for this use. This has unfair bad reviews because people have allergic reactions. If you have a bad reaction to bee stings or beeswax products, you shouldn&#x27;t use something with beeswax in it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this lotion has a GREAT smell, it has no added fragrance (another plus for a new tattoo) so it just smells like the natural ingredients. Mostly a beeswaxy natural smell. Not bad, just what you would expect from a fragrance free product.</li>
    <li> This rich lotion, which is the consistency of a cream, is wonderful for dry skin in wintertime or dry weather in any season.  Also good for swimmers.  I exercise all year in a pool and depend on this product to keep my skin supple.  Burt&#x27;s Bees products are all good, even though old Burt sold out to a commercial conglomerate, but I cannot give this lotion a five star rating that I would have given it if it still belonged to Burt.  You see, he was a lot more environmentally concerned that most commercial companies and therefore produced a purer line of goods.</li>
    <li> Every winter I go through the same thing.  It starts on my calves.  They get so dry that I itch them (even in my sleep) and they inevitably get bloody and scabbed up (I know, it is gross).  Then it would spread to my other dry zones which is pretty much my whole body at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year I try several different moisturizers with little success.  In particular I find that the average lotion quits working after just a few hours and my skin begins to get dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, on a whim, I picked up the Bert&#x27;s Bees chapstick at a local pharmacy.  I really liked it so I thought \\&quot;let me try their moisturizer\\&quot;.  Then I saw this one which says it lasts 24 hours.  I thought to myself that this was something worth trying.  Frankly I don&#x27;t know how they do it but this lotion truly does last up to 24 hours...even on very very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days of use the red blotchyness on my skin (my hands and arms in particular) has receded.  The scabs (from the scratching) are all healing and I don&#x27;t have that \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling to my skin anymore.  After so many years of using moisturizers that either didn&#x27;t work or made the dryness worse this is amazing.  Not only has the itchiness stopped but my skin looks smooth and has a pleasing sheen to it.  I never ever thought the back of my hands would look like anything other than a troll monster from under a bridge but they actually look pretty good now!  And only after a few days...to say I&#x27;m impressed would be an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as with all things it isn&#x27;t all good.  The smell of the lotion is not great.  It is by no means bad but at least to me it smells a little odd.  Also, it is expensive.  Even this discounted 3 pack is around 1 dollar an ounce and lets face it 6oz goes pretty fast when you are using it from head to toe.  Lastly, it takes a lot of work to spread it out on my skin and I have to work quickly because it absorbs FAST.  If you leave it in one place too long it will absorb too much there and leave that part of your skin feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that I don&#x27;t think this lotion is for everyone.  IF you have really bad dry skin I cannot recommend it highly enough.  If you have normal skin you may find the smell a little off-putting, the cost too high, and difficult to spread it evenly.  That is fine, not every moisturizer is for every skin type.  But seriously, if you have really bad dry skin and have \\&quot;tried everything\\&quot; not so fast--try this product.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did, click add to cart and get it done.  My skin feels better than I can remember (and in the dead of winter!)...very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m doing something I have never done before in my hundreds of amazon reviews over about 11 years (because I think it is usually a silly thing to do).  I&#x27;m awarding an unofficial 10 stars for this product.rt of your skin feeling greasy.  Having said all that I don&#x27;t think this lotion is for everyone.

I&#x27;m awarding an unofficial 10 stars for this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  No scent and it is very moisturizing.  Plus not a bunch of horrible chemicals.  I use this on my childrend and myself.</li>
    <li> Reasons for five stars? The cream really protects my hands from the cold/dry weather and absorbs well.  This product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens (which are pretty bad for you apparently) or fragrances. The company also doesn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance free cream ever. Lush and thick. Very hydrating and been using it for years, and plan for many more</li>
    <li> it stunk so bad had to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;and its tacky on the body and hands</li>
    <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s chap stick all of the time without any issues so my wife and I wanted to try their lotion. After a few days we both developed reactions although mine was more severe. I would get red bumpy rashes where the lotion was used which itched like crazy. To relieve the itch I had to use Cortisone cream for a few days and completely stop using the lotion. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it that has caused such a reaction as neither of us are allergic to other lotions. I&#x27;ve used Curel, Aveeno, Lubiderm and Jerkens without any issues. I found through web searching that some people seem to have similar experiences.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, not too fragrant.  Works into skin well and does not leave a greasy feeling.  Helps with moisturizing, too.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion.  It is more creamy texture than liquid.  It is not too sticky or too watery.  I like this light fragrance.  After starting to use this product, my dry skin became smoother.  My dried heels became instantly much better than when I was using major lotion products on the market like Neut######.  Although my skin is sensitive and allergic, I haven&#x27;t got any problem so far.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is my new BFF! It has had an amazing effect on my dry skin. I highly recommend all products!</li>
    <li> Reduced scaling on legs over night. Best price for 3 tubes I&#x27;ve found. 10 times better price than drug store</li>
    <li> This is NOT fragrance free, and it STINKS!!!! The smell was so bad it actually made my stomach turn. I am hoping I just got a bad batch or something, because the smell is really bad. I will not use it at all, and I am pretty upset I just wasted the money. Burt&#x27;s Bees usually makes good products which is why I went with their lotion, but good heavens it smells awful. Really disappointing!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of its list of high-quality ingredients. It soaks quickly into my skin and does not leave a film of grease/lotion or any smell. Really nice!</li>
    <li> For me it rubs in easily and isn&#x27;t greasy.The scent of this fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;If your want a lotion with a lasting pleasant fragrance you probably won&#x27;t care for this.</li>
    <li> The only thing that will actually keep my hands from chapping during the winter.  It doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel, just right.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it goes on silky smooth, has lots of natural ingredients and none that irritate sensitive skin.  I like it as a conventional body lotion and especially like it for putting a thin anti-chapping film on my hands followed by an imperfect cold water rinse that thins the film even more.  I recommend it for those who need a neat body lotion or way to get water to bead up on their hands without using heavy creams.</li>
    <li> Love that this has hardly any smell! Great moisturizer and the ingredients are almost all natural</li>
    <li> The baby is like this</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, helps with all sorts of things. I mixed lavender with mine for a break out problem on my arm. Plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin looking and feeling teriffic for hours.  Not greasy, no fake scent,  just smooth young lookiing skin for hours.  A worth while product</li>
    <li> Just enough fragrance.  Not greasy feeling.  Keeps my skin feeling nice all day and keeps it from feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> I have to wear compression stockings so at the end of the day it&#x27;s important that I moisturize my legs. I tried some other brands that were highly recommended by my doctor but they all left my skin feeling dry and incredibly itchy when I took my stockings off. Burt&#x27;s Bees Body Lotion is the one brand I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have that problem. It is such a relief not to want to go crazy scratching my legs. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gotta love the tanned leather smell 😷😷 ugh it&#x27;s awful.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products and consider myself a big fan and happy to be their customer. However I had an allergic reaction to this product as well. And I&#x27;ve never had an issue with any of their products before or any other lotion. Within 2 days of consecutive use I itch terribly and the first time it happened I didn&#x27;t know what I was allergic to do I stopped everything and no Lotion for a week. When I started back with it, the second day I started the itching again :( I looked on their website and it doesn&#x27;t look like they are selling it anymore, but it&#x27;s still on the shelves at Target last time I looked. This one is not a keeper despite that it did hold the moisture for 24 hours and it smelled good and had a rich texture... Ugh</li>
    <li> I use this on my baby girl, once a day after bathtime. She had really dry skin this winter as we kept our house a bit warmer.  We originally had babyganics, but it didn&#x27;t keep her skin from getting dry and flaky.  This is the best -for both of us!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My skin looks so good.  Being able to order online is wonderful!  Considering that the product is being delivered direct to my home with no search being done by me is great!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, far better than most of the high-end competition.... and fragrance free!</li>
    <li> very nice deal, but you can get better at the drug store. Never the less, great product, items came on time, and I am happy!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, quality product in mint condition. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I am using Burt&#x27;s Bees because it doesn&#x27;t have all those harmful chemicals that other lotions have.  I would recommend this and all Burt&#x27;s products to anyone who is trying to stay away from those chemicals.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this fragrance free lotion does have a strange plasticky smell to it - and does not absorb well, leaving a sticky film behind when absorbed.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> suggested. and it is really a good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It doesn&#x27;t smell funny, it rubs in quickly, and works great.  I have it at work and by my bed for times that I want my lotion to soak in quickly.  if I don&#x27;t put this on at night before bed, the whole next day my hands are really dry.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  use it all the time.  doesn&#x27;t smell too girlie, my husband uses it too.  highly recommend.</li>
</ol>
