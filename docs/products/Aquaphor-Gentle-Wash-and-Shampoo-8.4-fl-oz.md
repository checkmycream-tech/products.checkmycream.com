      <li>I don&#x27;t even have to rinse my daughters after a bath, but it still delivers a great clean!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best for sensitive skin..!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my son after the fallout with Johnson&#x27;s and because we love the Aquaphor gel.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried the Cali product because her skin is much better already with the Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>By the time it would get better, it was time for another bath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>With the help of a dermatologist  we identified one or more of the chemicals used in this &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; body wash as his eczema trigger.  </li>
      <li>I love to bath my baby with this.</li>
      <li>Great product if you are dealing with eczema, our sons itching was really soothed by this soap.</li>
      <li>I was becoming so discouraged that each time it was almost healed</li>
      <li>save yourself the hassle of the greasy creams and just buy non toxic, chemical free skin products</li>
      <li>It has no scent or color, which is good for sensitive skin or allergies.  </li>
      <li>so I thought this would be good for her sensitive skin ...</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a wash for your precious baby please do a search first for the ingredient Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
      <li>We switched to the Vanicream body cleanser and body lotion, which is worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>I like it better than most of the organic or natural baby washes.  </li>
      <li>My daughter, as most three year olds do I&#x27;m sure, hates getting soapy water anywhere near her face.  </li>
      <li>And her skin feels great, even during the dry winter months.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and clean!</li>
      <li>It lathers very well and cleans my toddler from top to bottom.  </li>
      <li>Overall this is a good buy.</li>
      <li>It clears skin irritations quickly.</li>
      <li>The two products combined have relieved his mild eczema problem without having to use the Rx cream from his pediatrician.</li>
      <li>It is so mild</li>
      <li>I needed something gentle, fragrance free, and tear free.</li>
      <li>I wish someone had taken the time to write about it and saved myself and my little one a great deal of pain and discomfort.</li>
      <li>They have sensitive skin and break out and get dry skin even from the best rated products for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>we noticed no change, and no other benefit that our cheaper (and better smelling) baby soap offered.</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin.</li>
      <li>Very responsible seller.</li>
      <li>(I know it&#x27;s not completely chemical-free, but better than J&amp;J</li>
      <li>It even has a really good lather with just a small amount of wash.</li>
      <li>After bathing my baby I lightly pat him dry and quickly put the Aveeno unscented baby lotion on his damp skin to seal in the moisture.</li>
      <li>and  our pediatrician recommended this after we had been using another extremely gentle product with no reprieve.</li>
      <li>B0027WIJD4 Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Shampoo, 8.4 oz.]]I&#x27;ve used Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Shampoo since my son was born.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash after my baby started breaking out with eczema on his knees and elbows.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and we were really worried.</li>
      <li>It smells very medicinal or like alcohol to me.  </li>
      <li>This was very soothing.</li>
      <li>This wash is so gentle that she grabs and uses it herself, including cleaning her face.  </li>
      <li>I needed a very gentle shampoo for a scalp issue I had developed at 67.</li>
      <li>My son has mild to moderate eczema.  </li>
      <li>It also left my son&#x27;s skin soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Just noticed brownish flakes on my daughter&#x27;s scalp, classic cradle cap.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>this was highly recommended, so we thought we&#x27;d try it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for babies.</li>
      <li>We tried this product with high hopes but was met with dissappointment.</li>
      <li>It keeps his hair squeaky clean and the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have many allergies and have trouble with soaps.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for new born babies as well as toddlers.</li>
      <li>Our New born was alergic to almost all shampoos.</li>
      <li>Our baby got his baby smooth skin back only after a week of using this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo for parents of children with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>She has very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve decided to try this product.</li>
      <li>Not for sensitive skin babies at all!</li>
      <li>The pattern has now become clear.</li>
      <li>I would much rather treat it without drugs whenever possible.</li>
      <li>I have been on an elimination diet as I am still breastfeeding for 6 weeks, eliminating the most common foods that cause eczema - wheat, eggs, dairy etc.</li>
      <li>it would flare up again even if I did not eat anything that was on the most common allergy list.</li>
      <li>I use both Aquaphor soap and moisturizer cream for my baby and so far it has shown its charm.</li>
      <li>Eczema runs in our family and did not skip our almost one year old daughter.</li>
      <li>His face was particularly sensitive to this wash too.  </li>
      <li>we purchased this to try to rid our 2 yr old of eczema on his legs...</li>
      <li>How does Eucerin justify using such an ingredient in a baby product and call it &#x27;Gentle&#x27;.     </li>
      <li>After trying several brands on my new born, he still had eczema..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
      <li>Every time I use Aquaphor Gentle Wash - for dry sensitive skin the next morning</li>
      <li>I use it everyday in his bath, and every other day to wash his hair, and I never had any more problems with his skin.  </li>
      <li>If you are still looking at your options, I suggest using Cetaphil facial moisturizer for all skin types (the cloudy solution, not the clear one. )</li>
      <li>Cetaphil is the only cleanser that actually works on my family&#x27;s skin, it also leaves you very soft.</li>
      <li>We received several different brands of natural baby skin products when our daughter was born, but all of them made her develop patches of eczema.</li>
      <li>Her skin is still on the sensitive and dry side but nothing in comparison to J&amp;J.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Our little one when he was born was highly sensitive and developed skin rash all over his face and body which made him look almost like an aligator.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent purchase. Very responsible seller. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Eczema runs in our family and did not skip our almost one year old daughter. We tried this product with high hopes but was met with dissappointment. This product tends to dry your skin out, it made our baby&#x27;s legs flaky and ashy .  If you are still looking at your options, I suggest using Cetaphil facial moisturizer for all skin types (the cloudy solution, not the clear one. ) on your child&#x27;s body. Once they get enough hair that Cetaphil tends to weigh it down, you can use the Aquaphor Baby wash on the head . Cetaphil is the only cleanser that actually works on my family&#x27;s skin, it also leaves you very soft.</li>
    <li> After months of agony trying to figure out what caused my babies severe eczema I found the reason. I have been on an elimination diet as I am still breastfeeding for 6 weeks, eliminating the most common foods that cause eczema - wheat, eggs, dairy etc. I was becoming so discouraged that each time it was almost healed it would flare up again even if I did not eat anything that was on the most common allergy list. Two weeks ago I started adding another section in my diary of what products I use on my baby. Because of his eczema I only wash him with Aquaphor Gentle wash only when he had a very dirty diaper. The pattern has now become clear. Every time I use Aquaphor Gentle Wash - for dry sensitive skin the next morning he looks as if he has third degree burns.    I have now researched the ingredients of this wash and found alarming information on one of the ingredients - Sodium Laureth Sulfate.      How does Eucerin justify using such an ingredient in a baby product and call it &#x27;Gentle&#x27;.     If you are looking for a wash for your precious baby please do a search first for the ingredient Sodium Laureth Sulfate. I wish someone had taken the time to write about it and saved myself and my little one a great deal of pain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> I have many allergies and have trouble with soaps. I was concerned about bathing my infant -- both for my skin and his in case he shares some of my allergies. This shampoo/body wash has worked out so well we haven&#x27;t bothered trying anything else. It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin. There isn&#x27;t alot of smell either, which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> We received several different brands of natural baby skin products when our daughter was born, but all of them made her develop patches of eczema. Our pediatrician told us to get something unscented, and we searched Amazon and found this product. After using this product for a couple of weeks, the eczema went away and it has never returned. Also, a little goes a long way so it is a great value. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After trying several brands on my new born, he still had eczema..and we were really worried. Our pediatrician then suggested we try Aquaphor and volla! It worked! I use both Aquaphor soap and moisturizer cream for my baby and so far it has shown its charm. I would highly recommend this product for babies.</li>
    <li> Before I had my baby girl, I bought a big bottle of J&amp;J. By the way, this is also what they were using at the hospital I delivered at.&lt;br /&gt;My baby was having small red bumps all over after each bath. By the time it would get better, it was time for another bath.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy another brand of baby wash (I want shampoo and wash in one product for convenience) and bought this and Cali Baby (wanted to do trial and error). I haven&#x27;t yet tried the Cali product because her skin is much better already with the Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;She doesn&#x27;t have the red bumps anymore. Her skin is still on the sensitive and dry side but nothing in comparison to J&amp;J.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Av**no Eczema cream now.&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I ask for a product recommendation to my pediatricians (diaper rash cream, wash,...), Aquaphor is the answer I am given every time.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and clean!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son after the fallout with Johnson&#x27;s and because we love the Aquaphor gel.  The product works well but I don&#x27;t like the scent at all.  It smells very medicinal or like alcohol to me.  I will continue to use the bottle I have but will look for something else when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I love to bath my baby with this.It&#x27;s the best for sensitive skin..!! The only drawback is that the bottle is not so big..!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash after my baby started breaking out with eczema on his knees and elbows. I needed something gentle, fragrance free, and tear free. This baby wash was just the ticket. It even has a really good lather with just a small amount of wash. After bathing my baby I lightly pat him dry and quickly put the Aveeno unscented baby lotion on his damp skin to seal in the moisture. The two products combined have relieved his mild eczema problem without having to use the Rx cream from his pediatrician. I would much rather treat it without drugs whenever possible. Overall I would recommend this to other parents!</li>
    <li> Just excellent, 100% recomended.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema so I thought this would be good for her sensitive skin ... wrong!  It gave her a horrible rash on her torso, arms and legs, she even woke up in the middle of the night because she was itching so badly.  I tried it myself the next day (I do not have eczema) and my legs were itching 10min after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was rated 2 on the cosmetics database.  It lathers very well and cleans my toddler from top to bottom.  The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t smell like chamomile to me.  It actually smells medicinal from the bottle but once you apply it to hair/body it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  Overall this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> My sons dermatologist recommend this for his shampoo instead of using johnsons which.is harsh. I live in a small town in michigans u.p. Nobody has this products within a 200 mile radius from here. It was cheap and works great!</li>
    <li> Started using this product about a week ago after learning about the chemicals in J&amp;J baby shampoo. The smell is terrible, but I could have overlooked that if it had worked well on my 12 month-old..  Just noticed brownish flakes on my daughter&#x27;s scalp, classic cradle cap.  She&#x27;s had dry skin on her scalp when using J&amp;J, but never quite like this.  I&#x27;m going to try Aveno (I know it&#x27;s not completely chemical-free, but better than J&amp;J shampoo)......and if that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll probably call her pediatrician for a recommendation.</li>
    <li> This wash worked wonders for my 3 children. My infant had a little cradle cap and this got rid of it in 1 wash. It clears skin irritations quickly.</li>
    <li> My 17 month old has very bad eczema and  our pediatrician recommended this after we had been using another extremely gentle product with no reprieve. It is great! It&#x27;s extremely gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry out his skin.</li>
    <li> My son has mild to moderate eczema.  With the help of a dermatologist  we identified one or more of the chemicals used in this &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; body wash as his eczema trigger.  His face was particularly sensitive to this wash too.  I never applied it directly to his face, but just the suds washing down his face from his hair for a few seconds was enough to cause a flare. Once we stopped using it, his eczema disappeared.  We switched to the Vanicream body cleanser and body lotion, which is worth every penny!  Not for sensitive skin babies at all!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist! I needed a very gentle shampoo for a scalp issue I had developed at 67. This was very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my son&#x27;s scalp.  We have used other &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; shampoos in the past, but he always ends up with a dry, itchy scalp.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t give him that problem.  It keeps his hair squeaky clean and the bottle lasts a long time.  I highly recommend this shampoo for parents of children with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> works excellent on my daughter</li>
    <li> It is so mild I don&#x27;t even have to rinse my daughters after a bath, but it still delivers a great clean!  They have sensitive skin and break out and get dry skin even from the best rated products for sensitive skin.  But not with this amazing product!!!  Thank you Amazon for supplying!!!!</li>
    <li> So good for my baby !!!! She has very sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve decided to try this product. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This works great on my daughters cradle cap. Other shampoos were too drying. It has no scent or color, which is good for sensitive skin or allergies.  It&#x27;s also really good for tattoos.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my baby and it works well. There is no allergy issues. The product quantity is generous for the price. I recommend this product for new born babies as well as toddlers.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0027WIJD4 Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Shampoo, 8.4 oz.]]I&#x27;ve used Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Shampoo since my son was born.  It was recommended by my physician - all the Aquaphor products were - as his skin was sensitive and he had a small amount of baby eczema at the time.  Since then, I&#x27;ve continued to use the product.  It smells great, makes lots of bubbles for his bath, and never bothers his skin.  I like it better than most of the organic or natural baby washes.  I use it everyday in his bath, and every other day to wash his hair, and I never had any more problems with his skin.  Also - you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.  Just the smallest amount creates enough bubbles and soap for his bath, so the product lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> we purchased this to try to rid our 2 yr old of eczema on his legs...this was highly recommended, so we thought we&#x27;d try it. waste of money, as it did nothing to help. we noticed no change, and no other benefit that our cheaper (and better smelling) baby soap offered. would not purchase again. changing his diet and cutting out all skin products that have chemicals in them got rid of his eczema in one week. (all regular laundry detergent, regular baby soaps and shampoos, etc - all contain vast numbers of chemicals...even those marketed for babies, and even those, believe it or not, marketed to help improve eczema!). we researched it quite a bit and went to everything organic and non toxic, and it cleared up in a week. save yourself the hassle of the greasy creams and just buy non toxic, chemical free skin products</li>
    <li> We have tried just about everything for our sons eczema and This has been the best product for him, we have been using for almost 3 years</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter due to the doctor recommending me this for her since she has exzema. I found that she would still be itching after taking her a bath with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from our pediatrician. My son had a few eczema patches and this wash really help with them. It also left my son&#x27;s skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m actually thinking about using it myself.</li>
    <li> My child had lots of issues with dry skin and redness with baby soaps, oils. I switched to aquaphor after talking to her pediatrician. Her rash cleared in few days and no more issues with her skin.</li>
    <li> Great product if you are dealing with eczema, our sons itching was really soothed by this soap. The redness was improved as well</li>
    <li> I saw this was suggested on the eczema association website so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I saw a difference immunity sins skin in a week!</li>
    <li> Our little one when he was born was highly sensitive and developed skin rash all over his face and body which made him look almost like an aligator. We discovered he had Eczema. After going through number of natural, sensitive and very expensive products. We were recommended Aquaphor from a friend. Our baby got his baby smooth skin back only after a week of using this. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter, as most three year olds do I&#x27;m sure, hates getting soapy water anywhere near her face.  This wash is so gentle that she grabs and uses it herself, including cleaning her face.  And her skin feels great, even during the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Our New born was alergic to almost all shampoos. This was the only one that worked. we have been using this for the last 16 months..</li>
