<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am 75 years (young) two years ago I had a Kidney Transplant prior to that I had other medical conditions requiring a lot of medications.  Over the years I have been dealing with thinning skin, blood and aging spots caused by by these medications.  As most seniors will attest these conditions can  occur by simply bumping items.  Unfortunately, in my case the Sun caused a tattoo affect on several body areas and are difficult to cover up.  Your product (medium) was exactly what I needed.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and take off, does not stain, and works Excellent.  I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products but was not completely satisfied.  I am a volunteer with several organizations and being able to make a pleasant appearance works wonders!</li>
    <li> not happy with the color.emailed the company for help and never received an answer.good thing the product was cheap. i was going to purchase a deeper color but decided not to buy the product.</li>
    <li> I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars (but wasn&#x27;t given that optionI). I liked it better than Sally Hansen spray-on, which always looks rather &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34;.  The medium color matched my skin tone very well and looked natural.  It must be used with some type of moisturizer to spread it on evenly.  It didn&#x27;t completely cover my spider veins or brown spots, but was better than nothing at all.  Unfortunately, it does rub off on clothing, despite waiting 20 minutes or more, which was disappointing.  You must be very careful when pulling on pants not to rub against it.  Also, the sponge applicator tore off almost immediately.  It&#x27;s much easier to just squeeze out the product on your hands and smooth it on.  Until something better comes along, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that the medium was too dark.  But, once I put it on and smoothed it out, it was awesome.  I truly LUV this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have had blood clots that have pretty much destroyed my calves and ankles, it has good coverage and I spray a shine afterwards because the cover is very dry looking.  The only thing is that it does come off on my clothing and anything else I rest my legs on.  But, couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Stay away from this brand (much as I loved Ms. Rivers). It is not smudge- or waterproof, not even remotely. I put on the thinnest layer, waited 30 minutes, put on a skirt, and had to throw the skirt in the wash because the product rubbed off on everything, including chairs.</li>
    <li> The color was to bright for me than I worder a tan color</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims to. However, the attached sponge applicator broke off on the first use. That turned out to be a happy accident. I used a new cellulose sponge - I dampened it and applied the cover with that. It made the application much easier and quicker. I intend to break the sponges off the other 2 tubes I bought when the time comes. The product gives good cover up and does not rub off as far as I can tell. It will even last through a shower or two if you don&#x27;t scrub it off. Since I underwent chemotherapy 10 years ago, the hair never grew back on my legs, so I don&#x27;t need to shave them. If you need to shave  your legs, I Imagine the cover up will come off much more quickly. I think I would need a cream to get it off my legs. If you&#x27;re not getting good coverage, try using a dampened cellulose sponge. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> It works great. It is a very thick coverage and can get on your clothes but not to worry comes right off once it&#x27;s on though doesn&#x27;t come off till uou use soap and water and that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
    <li> I use this product because if helps me cover many spider veins that are prominent on my feet.  I can&#x27;t wear sandles or go without hosiery - I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> I like the look the product gives your legs but it is really way to thick to spread.  The little sponge is already gone  So I put a moisturizer on first then before that absorbs I put the Right to bare legs on and it spreads smoother.  good product but needs more spreadability</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how many compliments I have received on this leg makeup. Everyone tells me it is so natural and cannot even tell I have it on. I have very unattrative coloring, veiny white legs.</li>
    <li> Wanted a little more color than the medium provides. Will try the darker shade.</li>
    <li> This product is terrific. It smoothes out my legs and stays on until you want it off. Even in and out of the water.  put it on, wait for it to set up, and you don&#x27;t have to think about it until you take it off.</li>
    <li> Mix this with lotion for most natural result.</li>
    <li> This product is great to cover up those small veins and create an even color.  I use this product instead of panty hose in the summer when I wear skirts and dresses at the Kingdom Hall.  It is important to use lotion first. Then I apply the product with my hands not the sponge applicator. I remove the product with a wet washcloth when I get home. Just as easy as taking off panty hose.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great product--delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> There were no instructions that came with my order on how to apply so I looked at the reviews, which were helpful. I put lotion on first then put product in my hands and smoothed it on. I didn&#x27;t use the sponge applicator. The cream looks dark when you squirt it out but it&#x27;s not all that dark when you put it on. I have medium. It does not cover everything but my legs did look smoother. I went to bed right after application and it did not rub off on my sheets. It was still there when I woke up. It just gave my legs an all over smoother look.</li>
    <li> sponge tip does not work good but like the coverage</li>
    <li> It was pretty dark when i put it on. I am tan but this tan is ment for someone who is already very dark.</li>
    <li> This product works well and is easy to apply. Would like to have darker shades for summer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every type of cover up including some of the expensive $40 a small bottle high end cover ups, the Joan Rivers line covers so well, it&#x27;s like your airbrushed / wearing panty hoes. I give it 4 stars, short of 1 because you do have to let this product set, otherwise it will come off easily on clothing etc.</li>
    <li> Joan Rivers (bless her soul) has saved many older women&#x27; problem.  Our legs develop veins and unsighltly sun spots  as we age.  Without this product I wouldn&#x27;t be able to &amp;#34;bare my legs&amp;#34;....My thanks goes to Joan Rivers and her innovative naming of the product.  It is a lifesavor. It applies  better with a moisturizer beforehand and it stays on all week provided I don&#x27;t soap my legs in the shower.  Unlike the tanning products that tend to make the dark spots even darker,  this product covers them and evenly smooths the color across the legs.</li>
    <li> Way too light. Legs look better without it.</li>
    <li> This product would be awesome IF it did not rub off on your clothes - returned it after one use</li>
    <li> product seemed like it might cover ok, but was way to light. I ordered medium and it looked almost white on my legs. Ugh. What a waste and I have 3 of them trying for a bargain. That sure didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leg make up I cant find it in stores but good amazon has it the joan rivers leg make up covers every flaw like spider vains bruises I mean it covers everything and makes your legs look great!!!! I will purchase more!!!</li>
    <li> Great comb with &amp;#34;Joan Rivers Right to Bare Legs Moisturizer&amp;#34; :)! Covers great! But you MUST MUST MUST use a moisturizer. Any kind will work. :) And wait 10 minutes before clothes!</li>
    <li> This cover up is really great, looks natural and stays on. My legs look really great because of this product.</li>
    <li> Too thick to remove from tube.  To think and draggy to apply.</li>
    <li> Not very helpful to cover up. The ads were a little decieving on how it covers up any marks or scars.</li>
    <li> Have used for years! Cover up all the nasty things.meven use on my arms. Then put tanner on over it next day. Can&#x27;t be beat!!</li>
    <li> This covered my legs beautifully. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and it stayed on all day. It&#x27;s perfect for the hot days of summer. I will keep this product on hand.</li>
    <li> I bought a tube of this from a retail store and I used it today for first time. I immediately ordered 3 more tubes from amazon. I put it on at 11 am and it was still good at 8pm. Didn&#x27;t come off on my clothes. Love it!</li>
    <li> At first I did not like the product because it was so thick and gummy.  But then I realized I did not use enough lotion to smooth it out.  Once I found the right combination, I have had numerous comments on how good my legs looked...even and smooth.  Another GREAT tip....after applying the make-up, I wait about 10 minutes and use a &amp;#34;setting powder&amp;#34; applying with a large make-up brush.  It is a white powder called Dermablend setting powder. I had purchased it years ago to use with another leg make-up that i tried, and did not like it...but using the powder with this produced worked wonders.  Yes, the make up does rub off, probably because I use more lotion underneath, but I simply wash my clothing and it comes out easily.  It is worth the effort to have the opportunity to continue to wear dresses and shorter pants.</li>
    <li> I am going to Spain in September and want to wear skirts to stay cool.  I have a lot of spider veins and a couple of purple spots about pencil-eraser size.  Being a redhead, my legs are very fair so I chose the \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it was not delivered when promised - it was only a day late, but, still...The color wasn&#x27;t too bad - a little darker than I am, but I always expect that.  Surprisingly, even the tone was pretty good - BUT - it doesn&#x27;t cover a thing.  And it looks like chalk.  Even after trying to apply it in layers.  How can something this thick provide no coverage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it even if you pay 99 cents for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I will be shopping for some really light-weight pants for my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried the product over Vitabath body moisturizer which is completely non-greasy and the results were as I described above.  I decided to give it one more go using the very greasy Nivea body lotion - now the product worked much, much better and didn&#x27;t rub off even with the greasy lotion underneath.  The coverage is still not 100%, but it does look pretty natural - and I was able to just camouflage the bad spots without applying to the entire leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve revised my rating to 3 stars from 1.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for bruising on arms  I&#x27;m told skin thinning , haven&#x27;t used on legs yet ,but I&#x27;m really happy with it!!!</li>
    <li> the product works like it should</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work not happy</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the leg make-up and have ordered it twice and share it with my friends. We all think it is the&lt;br /&gt;best we have used before ordering the Joan River&#x27;s product.  We will order again this Spring.</li>
    <li> The color is very orange-tan and must be used on the entire leg because it cannot be blended on smaller trouble areas without being  noticeable.  Not a good product for me as I only want it for my ankle area.  Looked ridiculous when I applied it there - like I had an orange sock on!</li>
    <li> Had to return. Rather difficult to spread.</li>
    <li> Terrible  very thick and cakey</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Joan Rivers Right to Bare legs product. I ordered knowing it wouldn&#x27;t be a perfect fix, but it sure beats thousands on vein therapy. I use with the moisturizer and you Need to prime with it so that the product flows smoothly and blends flawlessly. Looks natural when you don&#x27;t put too much which is why you use the moisturizer. I am no longer self-concious about my ugly veins and some blue still shows, BUT you have to look close to notice. It makes you look like you have been in the sun  and that&#x27;s what you notice instead. Color is natural and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Covers great but does rub off on fabrics.  I would give it a five star rating if that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month and am very happy with the results.  My skin is very pale and veiny with a few scars, so I did not wear dresses and now I can, so this makes me feel good.  I remove the sponge because I like rubbing the product on with my hands, then smooth the product evenly over my skin.  The first few times I used the product, I noticed that it dried fast, looked thick, caked and obvious, even though my legs were clean and moisturized when I applied it.  To counteract this and achieve a thinner coat and more natural look, I rub about four or five drops of oil into my palms, then I squeeze out a blob of product and rub my hands together, then I apply to my legs, smoothing it on evenly, starting on the lower leg.  I then repeat the process and do the other leg.  The result is really good and looks very natural, though it takes longer to dry and for the oil to soak into the skin.  It does rub off slightly but is easily washed off fabric with soap and water.  The affect lasts for days, unless I remove the product with soap and water.  Usually, I will touch up after a shower and do this for 2 to 3 days, then I wash the stuff off and give my skin a break and wear long dresses or pants for a few days.  My legs are still not perfect but they look good and it is so nice to have a choice of what to wear and to even go swimming.  I should also mention that I initially bought the lightest color, but this was too pale and I like the medium tone as it looks like a light tan, not too dark.</li>
    <li> The applicator sponge does not last long at all, but if you moisturize and apply with hands, it goes on fairly easy and the coverage is great.</li>
    <li> Good when mixed with other products</li>
    <li> does not work at all. need to get a refund since it does not do what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
    <li> Great product. Had my friends order also.  Please keep this product on the market.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product, particularly since I had high hopes for it.  I applied moisturizer before using it and still found it vrry thick and difficult to spread on my legs.  It also did not cover blemishes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited about 30 minutes before testing to see if this would rub off on clothing - and it did.  I was glad I tested first because it would have come off all over my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up washing it all off before I got dressed and I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> I triple love this product. It does what it says, gives you the perfect legs you had as a teenager. I have many spider veins and scars, this covered everthing! You must do two things to have it work. Dampen the applicator, whether it be your hands, sponge or what comes on it, then apply like you would liquid foundation. I found it easiest with squeezing it through the applicator, then with damp hands, just coated my legs. Fast and easy. You MUST wait a good 10 minutes to dress. I wore this all day in a waterpark and not once did it degrade in anyway. The only way you can remove it is with soap and water. I took it to Cancun, and the first time I applied way too much and the humidity there just didn&#x27;t allow it to ever completely dry. So if you live in extreme humidity, apply lightly and see if it dries better. I live in California, so it is perfect here. Never any problems, dries well and you can do whatever you want an it stays put. It&#x27;s magic in a tube for me! I am a very pale white, I do use a self tanner which lightly darkens my skin for a light natural tan. I ordered the Medium, and it&#x27;s a little lighter than my tan is, so you may want to go on the darker colors if you have a deep tan or darker skin. It is lighter than the samples show. It gives a beautiful, natural glow to your skin, and you have those perfect legs back!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover like it said it would.  Had to use a lot and it still didn&#x27;t cover an imperfection on my leg.  Wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on this again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Great Product!  This product is easier to apply and blend than the spray-on product by Sally Hansen.  And no clogged nozzle, making you waste half a can because you can&#x27;t get it to spray. It covers well, and lasts well.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely awesome. I used to use a self tanner on my legs, but it did nothing to cover up the veins, scars, and imperfections.The sponge applicator on the tube did not work so well for me, so I mix it with a bit of body lotion and it goes on like a charm. My 75-year-old mother uses it on her forearms and hands because she bruises so easily. It has become a summer wardrobe basic!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have red/purple colored veins on upper thigh area that I used this product on and it covered very well. You may still see them a little bit but it&#x27;s a dramatic difference to me. I ordered the medium color and I am fair to medium color skin ( I live in Florida so it&#x27;s almost impossible not to have some sort of a tan living here).I am happy with this product and will continue ordering it.Thank you Joan Rivers!</li>
    <li> I suppose I ordered the wrong color but thought medium would be what I needed.  It looks pink on my legs, especially in the sun.  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Heard about it from a friend.  Use it on arms for sun damaged spots.  Dries and does not rub off without soap and water.</li>
    <li> Does not do anything for my legs but make them look as though they have a pasty film on them.  I think it would help to have more differentiation in shades.</li>
    <li> Good coverage but looks too much like make-up or wearing hose.&lt;br /&gt;If used just for covering spots it&#x27;s too obvious.</li>
    <li> This cover up is AMAZING.  I have to take a med and I can use this on my arms to cover up the bruises....I have bought it for any friend that has bruises from meds. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> it left streak marks everywhere!</li>
    <li> Great coverage and natural-looking! Perfect for any season and it won&#x27;t rub off on your clothes once its dry.</li>
    <li> only used once. make sure your skin is well hydrated.</li>
    <li> Wears off on clothing. Covers well, though</li>
    <li> This producct covered the worse vericose veins and splotchy areas. It lasts for days, but washes off easy.  Thanks for the freedom to feel at ease in shorts again.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I let it dry about 1/2 hour and it came off all over the inside of my clothes. It took some work to even get it removed. The second time, I let it dry almost 4 hours before getting dressed and again, it came off all over my clothes. This time I had on crops and crossed my legs and it was all over the front of my pants - I was so embarrassed! Won&#x27;t use it again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was well satisfied with the results after applying it. It covers the awful blue blotches in my feet that have developed over the years, so I can continue wearing sandals.</li>
    <li> This covers incredibly well. I even used it to cover a tattoo for a photo shoot.  It stays on forever. Here is the down side: I hate the sponge application. I actually tore that thing off and just squeezed it out of the tube. It smells funny until it is dry and it is difficult to remove. You will need to use makeup remover. I can say I have sensitive skin and I had no problems.</li>
    <li> THIS ISNT EVEN CLOSE TO THE COLOR IT SAYS ITS SUPPOSED TO BE! ITS A VERY PAIL UGLY COLOR AND SAYS MED COLOR WHICH IS THE COLOR I AM IM NOT HAPPY IV SPENT MONEY ON THIS ITEM AND GOTTA BE STUCK WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tons of scars and veins, not to mention pasty skin tone so I haven&#x27;t worn a dress for years.  My lifestyle changed and it became important for me to  show up in a dress once in a while.  I decided to look into Joan Rivers leg makeup after I saw her ad on TV. She said it would not rub off and it doesn&#x27;t if you follow the directions.  I&#x27;ve  used it on cruises lately and it even stays on in the pool.  Of course if you really soap it down and scrub the makeup will come off but I&#x27;ve showered for 2-3 days and only had to do slight touch ups.  I would have given it 5 stars but the drawback is that the finish is less than natural - looks a little like I am wearing hose but compared to how I look without it - I am very satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;*Note-Save time and energy-wear surgical gloves while applying so you do not get it under your nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage. I use my own damp sponges asxthe sponges on the dispenser broke easily. Have to be quick in applying it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product.  Too much time to put it on and then to wash it off.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It covers but impossible to keep from streaking. It also rubs off on clothes even after hours of applying . I never opened the other two tubes</li>
    <li> Great...just be sure to use very sparingly</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, at the top of the winners list!</li>
    <li> The applicator only lasted for 1 use. I read previous reviews of others who had the same issue. I was very careful with applicator, but on 2nd use it began to fall apart.  By 3rd use, the applicator sponge was unusable.</li>
    <li> Covered all my veins, no need for nylons! I stopped wearing capris because of my horribe varicose veins, this product covered them and stayed on all day!</li>
    <li> not orange! good coverage</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s chalky and Cakey on dry skin (apply moisturizer with it) and doesn&#x27;t blend as well as Dermablend!</li>
    <li> Another product I very disappointed in. It does not dry in the instructed ten minutes or for that matter any amount of time. The color rubs off. In addition the stated color is not the shade it should have been. Will never purchase again. Now I am stuck with three the tubes ji can not use.</li>
    <li> my spider veins were still obvious</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be returning this order.  It didn&#x27;t cover at all.  After applying it was like a transparent wash over my legs.  A HUGE disappointment.</li>
    <li> natural looking with a full coverage dries to a natural feel.</li>
    <li> Nah! I&#x27;d pass. Really thick and hard to manage. Gets on your clothes.</li>
    <li> i have spider viens and wanted co cover them, it did not do the job, i was dissapointed, have used better products</li>
    <li> I love this cover up.  Since I discover this cream I do not use stockings. This cream make your legs look perfect and as long as you let it dry, it won&#x27;t stain your clothes. I use it with any body cream. It doesn&#x27;t have to be the one they sell, any one will work. I also have a spray that set it up so it does not stain my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;My legs have a little bit of an uneven color but with this cover up they look perfectly even. I love it!</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described and with the perfect tone for my skin.  I was skeptical but couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> States that it wouldn&#x27;t rub off onto clothing,  it did. Totally did not like this product.</li>
    <li> I would have given this a five except for the fact that it does come off on your clothes.  However, I really do like the coverup for my legs and will continue to use it.  It washes off easy with soap and water.  I had started wearing nylons to cover my legs and am glad to have something that looks good so I can stop wearing the nylons.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Just as described.  Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> This product is not nearly as advertised.  It is difficult to apply without streaking, takes a long time to get it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;, and even though it is let dry before dressing, it rubs off on anything it comes in contact with...bottom of capris, skirts etc.</li>
    <li> Tried this to avoid nylons in summer and it works well.  Must be applied over well-moisturized skin.  The sponge loosened after 3 uses and fell off after 6 but I&#x27;ve found I get more even coverage applying with moisturized hands anyway so not a real problem.  It still feels a bit tacky after drying but doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes, chairs, etc.  Medium is on the pink/cool side but not unacceptably so.  It&#x27;s not full coverage make up like Coverfx but nylons wouldn&#x27;t be either and I like the more natural effect.  Much more comfortable and cheaper than nylons, which I always seem to get a run in the second time I wear them.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Sooo nice to wear shorts and dresses again,and it won&#x27;t rub off clothes.</li>
    <li> Paid less for three than I paid for one in the past.  Tremendous value and good product comparable to Dermablend.. You may have to combine shades depending on your skin color.</li>
    <li> Works great! You just have to keep experimenting to the the application down right. Best for me is to put moisturizing lotion on one leg at a time, put the product in Palm of hand with a dime size dab of lotion, rub hands together and mix well, then apply to legs. This keeps the product from drying on your skin too fast and helps to spread it better. I don&#x27;t care for the sponge applicator. Love the product.</li>
    <li> I like the cover up effect, however it is messy on counter tops and hands and hard to clean up.</li>
    <li> Very dark. Hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Much lighter than advertise and rubs off on furniture hours after application</li>
    <li> The product is too dry, it&#x27;s not easy to work with and dries too quickly.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Convers pretty well.  Im going to buy the tan one tho next time.  Im Hispanic with olive skin tone so I would prefer the tan one. But so far I love it since I have spider veins. My self esteem has gone up thanks to this product!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover my veins very disappointed. And the sponge fell off after first use.</li>
    <li> Way to dark and I am not a very light skinned person and I ordered the medium and tan to try and they were both too dark, it didnt really cover much of anything up for me that Iooked natural</li>
    <li> I received this product within a couple of days. I have used this product before and love it....it covers and blends very well.</li>
    <li> Messy to apply, but stays on very well!  Color looks realistic (especially medium) &amp; the price is excellent..overall I would rare thus a grata find at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> True to the reviews.  Works very well and great for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This was definitely NOT what is considered Medium in color. It is much, much lighter than my normal skin color!! Would return if I just knew what to do!! Cannot use it!</li>
