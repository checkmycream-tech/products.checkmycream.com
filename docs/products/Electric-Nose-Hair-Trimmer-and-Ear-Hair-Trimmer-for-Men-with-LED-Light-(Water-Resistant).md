    <li> So far so good.  The nose hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to pull my husbands hairs, and also works well in the ear.  I really like the wider side burn trimmer for getting those long hairs that seems to appear out of nowhere on his neck.  I can get those off of him without any pulling or pain.  We have had it for a couple of months and everything is fine so far.</li>
