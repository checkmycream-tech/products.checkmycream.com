      <li>Instructions say to clean this thing when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>When comparing the price to other 100+ dollar shavers, this one seem to have worked as good as those (or may be better).</li>

      <li>Maybe Im just not doing it right....  </li>
      <li>Sure it can last a week, but really the only good shave you&#x27;ll get is if it&#x27;s literally be 10 seconds off the charger.</li>
      <li>They are easy to read and understand and sufficiently clear even for a non techno junky like myself.</li>
      <li>I have purchased three of these razors for my two grandsons &amp;amp; a friend &amp;amp; they all like them very much.  </li>
      <li>This is my first electric shaver...</li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first electric  </li>
      <li>charged the shaver for 24 hours before using it as recommended in the instructions, and here in a \\&quot;flashback\\&quot; are the details of my first shave.</li>
      <li>you are using electric razor for the first time</li>
      <li>When I first received the shaver, it didnt work...</li>
      <li>Without extremely careful charging habits, NiCad batteries will steadily lose their charge causing them to die more often and require more frequent charging.    </li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>(it is very noisey compared with the Norelco) and didn&#x27;t seem to shave as close.  </li>
      <li>I never had much luck with rotary style shavers.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You can hear the noice in the whole house, not just &lt;br /&gt;in</li>
      <li>Rechargeable battery really holds the charge well  </li>
      <li>Extremely close shave (1000 times better than Mach Turbo)</li>
      <li>For a total of less than $30 (including free Super Saver Shipping), I figured this was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I will highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>It is only useful for charging the battery.  </li>
      <li>Means the charging cord is very light and small.  </li>
      <li>The next higher level will run on the cord (MS 300?).&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t nearly get close enough and you never have an actual clean shaven look.</li>
      <li>If you want to wake someone early in the morning, just turn on this device &lt;br</li>
      <li>Boy was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>* use in case of emergency,make loud noice to threaten someone &lt;br</li>
      <li>noice is so loud that it sounds like earthquake.  </li>
      <li>Every last one I used tugged so sharply at the hairs on my face that they left my lovely mug burned and bumpy.</li>
      <li>The razor is barely noticeable against my skin.</li>
      <li>Barely tickles.</li>
      <li>This design decision ruins the unit and it&#x27;s really the only reason I&#x27;m now shopping for a new one.</li>
      <li>This was my first foil shaver, all my previous electric razors had been rotaries.  </li>

<li> This razor isnt bad for the price, but that doesnt mean that it does a great job either.  </li>

<li> At first I was not happy</li>
<li> Because this shaver can&#x27;t run off the power cord, it&#x27;s left me high and dry on multiple occasions, dying half-way through a shave and unable to continue even when plugged in.  </li>
<li> I like this style of razor because it is small enough to manuver around your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading</li>

<li> The only negative is that it operates only from DC power not AC.</li>

<li> The shave was never as close as I wanted it, and the blades were outrageously expensive, as much as $20 for 8 blades!</li>
<li> a few times now I&#x27;ve had to leave the house partially shaven.  </li>
<li> Overall I am pretty disappointed with it.</li>
<li> Used this razor for a few years.  </li>

<li> It always leaves random hairs all around and doesnt get nearly as close as I would like it to.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year or so and don&#x27;t have any trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
<li> As with all other electric razors, the blades soon become dull and the razor becomes an electric face massager.    </li>
<li> I will never go back to rotary after this, they always pulled painfully at my hairs if they were any longer than tiny stubble.  </li>
<li> I feel lazy to apply shaving gell every time &lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great razor, and great price considering the market.&lt;br /&gt;Please consider the following things&lt;br /&gt;1) The razor will not run on the power cord.  It is only useful for charging the battery.  The razor will only run on the battery.  The next higher level will run on the cord (MS 300?).&lt;br /&gt;2) The replacement screens are expensive.  This is not unusual for a replacement screen/blade, but please consider this cost before buying an electric,&lt;br /&gt;3) It is pretty cheap for the performance.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year or so and don&#x27;t have any trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;4) Battery life is fantastic.  It lasts weeks before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;5) I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard.  It may not work for those who do.  I like this style of razor because it is small enough to manuver around your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over five years and it still works great!  The only negative is that it operates only from DC power not AC.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver about 3 1/2 weeks ago...When I first received the shaver, it didnt work...It wouldnt cut on...So I charged it for 19 hrs and it still didnt come on...I sent it back the next day...Its been about 3 weeks and I still havent heard any word from discount jungle...Im still waiting on my replacement product to arrive....I figured it didnt take them long to receive my money so it shouldnt take them long to send me my product...</li>
    <li> The razor is a total disaster. The motor works but the vibration is so severe that it hurts your head. &lt;br /&gt;The noice is so loud that it sounds like earthquake.  &lt;br /&gt;You can hear the noice in the whole house, not just &lt;br /&gt;in one room.  &lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs won&#x27;t help. &lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy, takes time to get used to it but a great buy for the money. Just as expected. Strong Motor and excellent results. Really like it. I would recommend it anytime.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a horrible device, sounds like a lawn moover &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However I found few use for this device: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* If you want to wake someone early in the morning, just turn on this device &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* rotate it, trun it on and use it as a vibrater, your girl friend may love it &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* use in case of emergency,make loud noice to threaten someone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;* the trimmer could be used as butter slizer</li>
    <li> This product has two huge issues in my opinion...    1) The shave: It doesn&#x27;t nearly get close enough and you never have an actual clean shaven look. Also you have to go over the same place again and again to get it to shave off the hair properly.    2) The battery: Sure it can last a week, but really the only good shave you&#x27;ll get is if it&#x27;s literally be 10 seconds off the charger. To make matters worse you can&#x27;t leave it plugged in and shave.     This product main redeeming aspect is that it has an excellent trimmer for thick beards and and sideburns.    Overall I am pretty disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> I bought the same razor 5 or 6 years ago and the battery finally ran out. I had a gift card so I splurged and bought a $75.00 Braun electric razor. What a mistake. It appeared to be under powered and it took forever to shave. Since I spent the money I used the razor for over a month until I couldn&#x27;t take the long shave time anymore. I went to Amazon and purchased the same Remington MS-2 that I had before. I paid about $26.00 and have been satisfied since. Expensive is not always better, this cheap razor is the best..</li>
    <li> Tried a triple-head.  Lousy shave.  The charger in this model is in the body of the razor.  Means the charging cord is very light and small.  Don&#x27;t buy the newest model...the charger is external.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of these razors for my two grandsons &amp;amp; a friend &amp;amp; they all like them very much.  Good buy for a good razor!  I found the same model at a web site for $ 90.00!</li>
    <li> Noisy but strong. It missed some longer hairs, otherwise it is a perfect shaver.</li>
    <li> The last time I tried an electric shaver was about 15 years ago. Every last one I used tugged so sharply at the hairs on my face that they left my lovely mug burned and bumpy. I&#x27;d been using a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo for years and was never 100% happy with it. The shave was never as close as I wanted it, and the blades were outrageously expensive, as much as $20 for 8 blades! Not to mention the $5 for Neutrogena&#x27;s Razor Defense to soothe my skin after shaving with a blade. So when I saw this shaver at Amazon for $16 I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I also ordered a set of replacement foils and cutters for it in the event that I liked the razor and found them sold out when the time came to replace them. Finally, I bought Remington&#x27;s Face Saver stick to go along with it. For a total of less than $30 (including free Super Saver Shipping), I figured this was worth a shot. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For a change, I read the instructions immediately. They are easy to read and understand and sufficiently clear even for a non techno junky like myself. They not only give you technical information on the product, but give recommendations on how to keep the shaver working properly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I charged the shaver for 24 hours before using it as recommended in the instructions, and here in a \\&quot;flashback\\&quot; are the details of my first shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- This Face Saver stuff smells like talcum powder. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- The razor is barely noticeable against my skin. Barely tickles. But hair is disappearing from my face. I like this.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Missed a spot. Remember to use both foils against your skin like the instructions say.  There. Got it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Hey, my face is clean. And I don&#x27;t need any lotion. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Instructions say to clean this thing when you&#x27;re done. That was quick! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Bite me, Gillette! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All jokes aside, I have rarely been happier with a $30 purchase. I highly recommend the Face Saver as it seems to make the shave super smooth. This is the kind of product I will recommend to friends. It now sits charging in my desk at work. It holds a charge well, too, by the way. I&#x27;ll walk in tomorrow morning and shave in about 3 minutes. And you won&#x27;t be able to see the aftermath on my face!</li>
    <li> Preface:    This was my first foil shaver, all my previous electric razors had been rotaries.  I will never go back to rotary after this, they always pulled painfully at my hairs if they were any longer than tiny stubble.  This provides just as close a shave as a rotary and has never caused me the slightest bit of pain.      Pros:    + Solid performance and workmanship.  Mechanically reliable.  + Provides a close shave for an electric.    + Pop up trimmer works extremely well in combination with the dual foils to very quickly cut tough neck and chin hairs.  The trimmer takes the large pieces, the foils take the small.  The combination is very effective.      Cons:  -  No battery level indicator.  This wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal except...  -  The product CANNOT run on the power cord alone.  To make matters worse...  -  Battery power can run out very suddenly.  -  NiCad batteries are drastically inferior to NiMH batteries.  Without extremely careful charging habits, NiCad batteries will steadily lose their charge causing them to die more often and require more frequent charging.    Summary:  Because this shaver can&#x27;t run off the power cord, it&#x27;s left me high and dry on multiple occasions, dying half-way through a shave and unable to continue even when plugged in.  There has been a few times now I&#x27;ve had to leave the house partially shaven.  This design decision ruins the unit and it&#x27;s really the only reason I&#x27;m now shopping for a new one.</li>
    <li> I will highly recommend this product to anyone. When comparing the price to other 100+ dollar shavers, this one seem to have worked as good as those (or may be better). I will never buy those 100+ dollar shavers. Performance is great. Also the attached automatic trimmer works great.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver...All these years I have been using Gillette Senser, Senser Excell, Turbo gizmo etc etc...Quite frankly I think Gillette has reached its limit...from two blades to three to vibrators in shaver etc etc....But the end result was  &lt;br /&gt;1. There was still some hair left untouched under the chin and neck area  &lt;br /&gt;2. I feel lazy to apply shaving gell every time &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since this was my first electric  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on it... when I saw this on Amazon for 20 bucks, I just brought it and I am glad that I did &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Coming to shaver ....it does a very good job...here is what makes it so good &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;+ Extremely close shave (1000 times better than Mach Turbo) &lt;br /&gt;+ Rechargeable battery really holds the charge well  &lt;br /&gt;+ Cleaning is easy (i say fairly easy but not too easy) &lt;br /&gt;+ Rugged like a stone &lt;br /&gt;+ Trimmer works great &lt;br /&gt;+ Simple to use no fancy LCP screens to watch  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I didnt like &lt;br /&gt;+ when I try to open the protective cover it some times opens the screen (annoying but you can live with it) &lt;br /&gt;+ little bulky for shaving on upper lip moustache ( this is really annoying but again for 20 bucks u can live with it) &lt;br /&gt;+ noisy ( my friend uses braun and that was very silent (but its 100+ bucks) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Suggestions: &lt;br /&gt;If you are using electric razor for the first time do follow the instructions in the product manual...I made my mistake of not reading and ended up with whole bunch of microcuts  (damn that hurt real bad for a couple of days) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My conclusion  &lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s a great buy for a great price  I am and not going back to Gillette again</li>
    <li> Granted I don&#x27;t use it all the time....I just have to say that I&#x27;ve had my MS2-200 since around 1995 or so. Its served me well. I never had much luck with rotary style shavers. I do have to replace the foils and cutters from time to time, but its well worth it. Disposable blades cost a fortune. After 15 years the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long, but it never really leaves the bathroom anyhow. I love this razor and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco which is great, but I bought this shaver as an inexpensive electric shaver to take on camping trips.  At first I was not happy (it is very noisey compared with the Norelco) and didn&#x27;t seem to shave as close.  But once my facial skin adjusted to this shaver it does an very good job, not quite as close as the Norelco, but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Go for it!</li>
    <li> My father, an older gentleman, loved it.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This razor isnt bad for the price, but that doesnt mean that it does a great job either.  I&#x27;m 17 and I got this razor last christmas. It always leaves random hairs all around and doesnt get nearly as close as I would like it to. Its also kind of a pain to clean every time, but its 20$.  Maybe Im just not doing it right....  but I dont think so.   &lt;br /&gt;It is definately a cheaper razor and I would say splurge and get a nicer one.  Think about it...  how much more is it really going to cost you.  Some things are cheap for a reason...</li>
    <li> Used this razor for a few years.  I was never a big fan of the microscreen razors--the screens are rather fragile (I have had to replace several over the years).    As with all other electric razors, the blades soon become dull and the razor becomes an electric face massager.    Have switched to a wet-dry razor.  The &#x27;wet&#x27; shave is closer, quicker and more pleasant.</li>
    <li> This razor isn&#x27;t the best nor does it have any fancy stuff.  But it gives  a close shave and the battery lasts for ever.</li>
