<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product, feels nice on face</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very creamy and great for anyone with dry skin.  I could also see using it after a day of flying because I feel like my skin is dried out after being on an airplane.  I have only used it at night but I think it might be a little too heavy for some as a day cream, especially in summer.  I live in the mid-west and I could definitely see this being a staple in my skincare regime in the winter.  The smell is very mild which I like.  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF will keep it from being my go to daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It comes in a pretty big bottle, with a huge looking pump, but don’t worry a ton doesn’t come out when you pump it! I’ve been using it in the morning and night after I wash my face, it’s very moisturizing but nothing too exciting. I like the pump since it keeps dirt out of the container though.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I Received my Vitamin C Lotion today and decided to try it right away. I was impressed with the pump on the bottle for easy acess and it fits in my purse so I can take it with me. The cream is thick and goes on great! It&#x27;s not to thin or runny and it soaks in quickly and my hands feel soft for a good while. It does not feel runny or clumpy.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion--wish the container was bigger, but it is lasting longer than I expected, and I use it twice a day. --I&#x27;ll be staying in stock. I read that mixing Retinol, Vitamin C, and Hyaluronic Acid Serum can reverse sun damage---and by-golly it actually has turned this 55 year old sun abused skin around! I put the serums on and let them dry--then put this product on top.  I then either put on a bit make-up if headed out--if staying home, I just leave my face alone-until I wash again and repeat all the steps before retiring for the night.  I have never been a skin rej. type person---but at this age-I have too.  I can not believe the difference that all serums I use have totally changed my sun-damaged skins texture.  I am a red-head that tans. and I love the sun.  I know it is really terrible for anyone&#x27;s skin--face in particular-but a little color sure does hide a multitude of sins--well flaws.... I highly recommend this lotion.  Great, fast shipping.  Thank you for a great product.:0  As I stated earlier---I will make sure to keep this exact brand on hand year round.  Please don&#x27;t raise the price for good reviews;0  This is better than the high dollar department store lotions (in my humble opinion)</li>
    <li> This is some EXCEPTIONAL lotion, I&#x27;m impressed. I expect it to be a staple in my grooming regimen going forward. I do have an issue with the packaging however - it&#x27;s in a fully sealed bottle, and there is no way to get to the &amp;#34;dregs&amp;#34; left in the bottom when the lotion gets too low to pump. I abhor wasting products, and there&#x27;s no avoiding it in this form of packaging.</li>
    <li> I just started using this lotion for my dry face like two days ago and love it! I use it after I dab on some orange blossom toner (from fox brim as well) all over my face. After rubbing on the moisturizer my skin looks vibrant and smooth , I can&#x27;t get enough so I use it twice a day :)</li>
    <li> The pump inside broke after several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda give me greasy face after application as well.</li>
    <li> I do like this cream, however be warned it does not have sun protection.  I would recommend a natural sun protection or use of sun screen with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for extremely dry skin. My daughter used to have eczema when she was younger. She doesn&#x27;t have it quite as much anymore but still has extremely dry patches of skin. I purchased this for her because of the all ingredients that it contains. She doesn&#x27;t use it on her face but on her body, especially arms and legs. By itself, it&#x27;s wonderful, but when she uses it with a combination of her other skin therapy lotions, it works great. It keeps her skin hydrated and looking fresh. It&#x27;s anti-oxidant and helps for every day radicals caused by the sun. It keeps her skin light and fresh, lessens dark spots she may get from being exposed to the sun too much. The reason why she uses it in conjunction with her other lotion is because she doesn&#x27;t want to use it up too fast. I believe, if used everyday, this bottle would last her about a month. I purchase this item at a promotional value to product test. Vitamin C has always been one of my favorite ingredient in keeping skin healthy and fresh. I highly recommend this lotion, not just for a facial moisturizer, but also as skin therapy for your body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude. With hella acne. thought maybe I can combat the acne by moisturizing my skin before my body does it for me. Feels good in my hands very light. should be good. kinda mad that its only 1.7 fl oz but hey that must be a good thing right?  Update:   HOLY CRAP THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. I work long days in the sun and mess with engines and tractors. Anything that you shouldn&#x27;t expose your skin to I do. So acne is a difficult battle for me. this in combination with epiduo for me at least is incredible. my skin isnt oily, I rarely get break outs now, and my face has never felt so light. I would the rest of this stuff known to exist if I could because its just that great. If  you have any trouble with oily or dry skin, this is the franks hot sauce of lotion. no gimmicks, no bull. Plus they have very courteous personnel as well so yeah.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that Vitamin C keeps your body healthy, and I honestly feel like this keeps my skin healthy too! It&#x27;s so soft and moisturizing without being greasy. It feels great all day. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to try this out! Foxbrim never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, smooth, soft, great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really know what results I will get, but love the way my skin feels after applying it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty small but I like this product</li>
    <li> With soothing Aloe, effective restorative agents can work to strengthen skin elasticity and promote cell turnover. All for your healthiest skin yet! Vitamin C Lotion helps to create healthy hydrated skin that radiates.  It also helps to refine and even skin texture.  Helps to give you your best skin yet!  When you have dark spots and discolorations on your otherwise beautiful skin this helps lighten them.  Some of the key Ingredients include:&lt;br /&gt; + Vitamin C (15%)&lt;br /&gt; + Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt; + MSM&lt;br /&gt; + Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt; + Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt; + Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Very nice, not heavy or greasy. Feels very light on my face!</li>
    <li> Wife really loves this stuff. Only issue is the price. It would be great if it was a little more affordable, especially now that she is in love with it...</li>
    <li> I purchased both the FoxBrim Vitamin C Lotion and the Foxbrim Ultra Lift Lotion through Amazon and they arrived very quickly and were packaged very well.  I&#x27;ve only been using them for a few days so it&#x27;s a little too early to see results. However both lotions have a very nice consistency and a pleasant, but not overpowering scent.  I like the way they both absorb into the skin and how hydrated my face and neck feel after application.  I would probably purchase these again as they seem to be good value for money.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Left my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer. No heavy cream or heavy, overpowering perfumy smell!</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and have barely started using moisturizer (I have no wrinkles but a few fine lines now).  The ones I used before this were creams and kind of made my face really shiny.  I like this lotion as it is not as rich and seems to be rapidly absorbed.  My make up looks good after using this, and that&#x27;s never happened with using other moisturizers.  I feel like I&#x27;m putting beneficial stuff on my face but the previous side effects from other lotions are virtually gone.</li>
    <li> I am one of those consumers who grabs up anything I can if it means that it will help me fight the aging process.  The first way to fight aging skin (other than drinking plenty of water) is to keep your skin moisturized.  I live in Las Vegas, NV so with all this dry air, I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for the next best lotion.  Well, I finally found a product that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, the first thing I fell in love with was the packaging of the lotion.  The pump is easy to use and dispenses just the right amount.  The bottle fits comfortably in your hand and once the lotion is put on the skin, it does not feel greasy or smell bad.  It actually has a very light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C is all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;The key ingredients in this product are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Vitamin C (15%)&lt;br /&gt;+ Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt;+ MSM&lt;br /&gt;+ Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;+ Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even though I used this mostly on my face, it can be used on your entire body.  It leaves your skin very smooth and supple.  I have finally found a product that works well to moisturize my skin and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Is doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> Great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C lotion works quite well to not only moisturize my face, but also in reducing my fine lines. I was quite surprised to see fairly rapid results (over the course of a few weeks). Additionally, this lotion did not irritate my very sensitive skin. I am allergic to all manner of additives and preservatives, but this product never irritated my skin. It isn&#x27;t the slightest bit greasy, either, so it&#x27;ll probably work well for those with combination skin, and normal skin, too (my skin is dry). It takes only a small amount of lotion to cover my entire face and neck, so this lotion should last several months. There is virtually no odor, so those with health issues triggered by strong odors needn&#x27;t worry. The tiny bit of odor (not perfume- it&#x27;s an all-natural smell) dissipates very rapidly, leaving no smell at behind. I&#x27;m quite pleased with the result of this moisturizer. While I did receive a sample of this and/or other products for review purposes from Tomoson, the opinion expressed is my own. I would never recommend a product I did not use myself.</li>
    <li> only been a few days but so far so good. my skin looks and feels great night and day, great stuff.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received the FoxBrim Vitamin C Lotion as the FoxBrim brand has been one of my favorites to review.  The lotion came in a neat and clean looking pump that allowed just the right amount of lotion to dispense.  It was white and creamy with a fresh scent.  I had just use a face mask and my skin was feeling tight and dry, so it was the perfect opportunity to try the lotion.  The lotion went on smoothly and had a cool feeling.  This might have been due to the fact that I had just washed my face with warm water.  It made my face feel smooth and finished, almost like a protective covering.  The first two ingredients are herbal infusions and aloe vera so I felt comfortable in using the cream on my face and around my mouth and eyes.  I also used the lotion on my rough elbow and chapped hands.  The only negative is that it comes in a small pump.  I would definitely recommend this product as FoxBrim does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Made me break out pretty badly, Im considering a return.</li>
    <li> Every aspect of the product is as advertized. I am a 65 year old male with drying out skin and therefore was looking for a product to moisten and soften my face skin. This is the product.</li>
    <li> Pros: lightweight, non-greasy, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: TINY BOTTLE!!! Not very moisturizing for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike everyone else who has reviewed this product, I did NOT receive a free bottle of it for a review, haha. I am hoping someone out there will find the opinion of an actual customer somewhat helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this product is definitely the most useful for oily or normal skin. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way it could provide enough moisture for actually dry skin, and even combination skin may not find it moisturizing enough for dry patches. But if you are looking for a lightweight, non-greasy formula for the right skin type, this lotion is a great option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a little pump bottle that surprisingly dispenses almost the perfect amount to cover your face and even your upper neck. It also has a little plastic insert you can put back into the mouth of the pump to prevent the lotion from building up/drying out there. I&#x27;m not really convinced you need it if you lose the lotion every day, but it&#x27;s there if you need it and want to take the time to pop it in and off every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this lotion in the morning, giving it a minute or two to sink in before putting on makeup. It felt great on most of my skin, which tends to be on the oilier side. It sunk in quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me greasy or shiny looking at all, which I loved! However, I did have a few dry patches on my chin and nose from trying to treat some obnoxious breakouts, and it didn&#x27;t seem to help them out at all. I had to use a more hydrating lotion on those areas to prevent my makeup from looking flaky and patchy, which was obnoxious. Minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the natural ingredients in this product. I am trying to do my best to fill my home with more natural products (within reason) and like to support companies trying to provide them . However, I did not realize when I bought this that it only contained 1.7 ounces of product. Using only one pump a day in the morning, it lasted me almost exactly one month. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but there is no way I can afford to pay $20 a month for lotion, despite the pros. Minus another star. If it were more affordable, I might consider making this a regular part of my beauty routine, but alas--I have diapers to pay for.</li>
    <li> Recently I was sent a complimentary order of Foxbrim’s Vitamin C Daily Moisturizing Lotion to give a try.  I received it along with their Ultra Lift Treatment to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, upon immediate comparison, I do not see a whole lot of difference between the Ultra Lift Treatment and the Vitamin C lotion other than the scent {and between the two, I prefer the smell from the Ultra Lift Treatment}.  The packaging is similar, the consistency of the product is similar, and you are meant to use it in the same manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that is just as a comparison to the products upon immediate use.  If you look at the ingredient list, and what each of those ingredients is meant to do, they are quite different and I would actually {probably} be better off using the Vitamin C lotion going forward even though I prefer the scent of the Ultra Lift Treatment more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using the Vitamin C lotion, I would be {hopefully} working towards reducing the formation of wrinkles.  Once those wrinkles set in, however, I would want to switch over to the Ultra Lift Treatment to {hopefully} reduce their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have only been using these products for about a month, I cannot speak to their impact over a long period of time.  But, after doing some research on the impacts of the products’ key ingredients, I suspect that in using them consistently over time it will certainly be beneficial to the appearance of my skin.  And if I am not having a negative reaction to the product, it certainly cannot be hurting anything to use it, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have oily skin and neither of the moisturizers I tried from Foxbrim made me more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;....they both did a great job sinking into my skin and leaving it feeling moisturized {in a good way}.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion With Aloe Vera MSM + Jojoba Oil comes in a 1.7 oz pump bottle that helps in the aid of discoloration and reducing spots. The lotion is made of natural products and is a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the first time that I have used a vitamin c lotion and am very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for the last two weeks. I use one pump every morning after I wash my face and wipe the excess on the back of my hands. It&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer that quickly absorbs into my skin and keeps it moist all day long without leaving a greasy feeling. I love how soft my skin feels and looks more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that Foxbrim offers a 90 day money back guarantee if you are not 100% satisfied with their product. This way you can try their product and if you don&#x27;t get the desired results you can return it, no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Usually lotions leave my face oily and in the end break me out. This one doesnt leave it oily or break me out. It has a nice smell to it. Also it leaves your face nice looking. Now my face is nice and smooth with no more dry skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Very nice</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my skin. Smells great!</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying I have extremely sensitive skin… I&#x27;m 27 years old and I still break out like crazy depending on the time of the month or if something looks at my face wrong… lol&lt;br /&gt;This product does not break me out in fact I&#x27;ve noticed that the breakouts that I had are clearing up!!! I&#x27;m also using it with the foxbrim hyaluronic acid vitamin C + E MSM 1fl. Oz.&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face or showering I use witch hazel for an astringent then I do the foxbrim hyaluronic acid vitamin C + E MSM 1fl. Oz try to let it air dry then apply the vitamin C lotion to face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have only been able to use clean&amp;clear dual action moisturizer and then do my make up. that was the only thing that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t break me out. now I found this and I am in love!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a return customer!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful creamy lotion that absorbed quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft. I use it after cleansing and before putting on makeup. After about a week my skin feels better already.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer and it does make wrinkles less noticeable after just a few days, not a miracle but noticeable. I can&#x27;t use anything involving peels or acids, I have extremely sensitive 50+ year old skin and eyes and I especially liked this product because I had no skin or eye irritation at all, even when I used it on my eyelids! I will buy this again, great affordable price and really good product. Glad I found this! Yes, you should try it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best! smells great! I imediatelly noticed results! Definitely would recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Best facial moisturizer!!! I use different face lotions for sensitive skin, and thought I was hydrated, but using this just one time, there was such a difference!! Works wonderful! And no breaking out from it. I put it on in the am and before bed..just started using it, so will see if results show in a month of use....</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion for the purposes of review. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten from the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion. During the winter months, my skin gets super dry- which means I end up looking much older than I really am. However, with the Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion, that is no longer a problem. I simply put this on my face and my chest (and I&#x27;ve even used it as a hand cream during the day at home)- after I take a shower in the evenings and voila- moisturized skin! It feels absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to add to or even change their current moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The lotion is easily absorbed by my skin, and it is absolutely NOT GREASY!!! I love it a lot!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product morning and night for about a week now and so far I really like it. It goes on very smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave my face greasy or oily. I apply it under my makeup in the morning and I have noticed my foundation going on much smoother. I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Not a big user of &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; products, but this is a truly wonderful moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week so far &amp; love it. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s got aloe too. Great for cell repair.</li>
    <li> Does not clog pores.  Lightens and brightest your face.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t notice a smell when using it. I would consider this to be a medium consistency lotion, that can be used daily. My skin felt smooth and moisturized all day after using this Vitamin C Lotion. I received this product complimentary for testing/review purposes, but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good products.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and did not make my skin feel greasy</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. It can get acne easily if I put on the wrong substance. I am very selective and picky about my lotions and pretty much everything and anything that goes on my face (I don&#x27;t wear any makeup). But this lotion has healed flaking, dry, and red skin and is making my skin softer than ever. I absolutely love this lotion and would recommend.</li>
    <li> 2 weeks later I noticed nuttin different. I like the way it soaks into the skin and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t bad. It has a neutral lotion smell. It&#x27;s not too thick or thin. However, it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. I thought it did but that was my mistake. Nothing wrong with the product but I won&#x27;t by again for myself.</li>
    <li> I like to use this over my vitamin c serum to provide added moisture for my super dry skin. I am not sure it does anything for fine lines but I do feel it helps me heal my skin faster. ( I have a habbit of picking and popping) It seems to be good for reducing KP and acne. The two (serum and this) are enough moisture but it did take my skin about a week to adjust.  My biggest gripe with this is the bottle isnt as advertised its in a black bottle and the issue here for me is that there is no way of knowing if I am nearly running out or not. So planning ahead is more of a guessing game. I think I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> smooth but dry and breakout I want refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a week ago and have been using it twice daily.  The lotion has a very light scent, goes on smoothly and is not greasy in any way.  My skin has felt softer and I believe that I have seen a decrease in some of the fine lines on my face, at least a softening in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package from Foxbrim I was delighted at the minimalistic packaging and packing slip.  They certainly hold true to their &amp;#34;green philosophy&amp;#34;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have had no breakouts since using this product.  I would highly recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! A little about myself, i obly cleanse my skin and put moisturiser and that&#x27;s about it. This is by far the best moisturiser i have used. I&#x27;ve ised olay and it felt greasy and palmers cocoa butter one made my skin breakout and really flaky and dry that my husband asked me what is happening to my skin. I reas the reviews for this product and decided to try it. Best decision ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this for a week and what a difference my skin felt and looked like I was ten years younger!! The texture was unlike never before my skin looked smooth and soft especially when i touch it. It&#x27;s winter time right now and my skin is usually very dry but this product changed the game for me. And the best thing is some of my dark spots have lightened and my entire face is brighter. I bought an in home microdermabrasion kit and i have not used it till now as this product is really working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on buying this moisturiser and will try other foxbrim products as well. What a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my skin but I feel like it leaves it too oily.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! I like the pump a lot since you won&#x27;t end up wasting any by getting too much and it&#x27;ll help once you get close to being out of the lotion. There is a smell to it but it&#x27;s not strong or a bad smell. The smell does go away once it&#x27;s absorbed. And it does absorb really well! It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and leaves your skin very smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this lotion hasn&#x27;t caused me to have any problems with my sensitivity or with any kind of break outs. I would definitely recommend this Vitamin C Lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. Very easy to use. I love the pump bottle. It gives out the perfect amount of lotion. This lotion has great natural ingredients which leave my skin feeling soft. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all which I like. Also it is fragrance free which is a huge plus for me. Definitely will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C moisturizer works great. It is rich in ingredients. It is very light on the skin. Doesnot leave greasy effect on the face. It gives the skin youthful and radiant effect. It tighten your skin and improves the texture. I apply this lotion daily in the morning after cleansing my face. The lotion comes in a easy to pump bottle. It gives you the control on how much product you want to use. I put a little bit on palm of my hand and apply with my finger tips on my face. I have noticed a big difference in my skin. I can see my skin has a glow, flawless and soft. You can say it is 2-in1 lotion. It not only moisturize your skin but also the Vitamin C improves your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was pretty fast. I am satisfied with this Vitamin C lotion. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in return of an unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! It leaves my skin so smooth and refreshed. I also notice that my thin lines are disappearing. I would recommend it to all my friend!!!!</li>
    <li> Love that this product is virtually fragrance free. Feels great on my skin too!</li>
    <li> this is like silk for your face. its so good and soaks nicely into your skin with no greasy or stickiness. BEST EVER!!!</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. It seems creamier than things I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my face soft all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for @ a month and my face is hydrated but it isn&#x27;t exactly what I need for my completion.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product. we need a body lotion</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it&#x27;s natural it has vitamin C, aloe, jojoba oil and it&#x27;s smells like a cream nothing like heavy perfume. No animal tested. Made in USA which is so hard to fine as you know. And last but not least pumping future is the best because you getting as much as you want and you don&#x27;t touch the rest of the bottle to germinate them whatever in your hands. I really like it best. So smooth and reach cream but it doesn&#x27;t stay oilly to bother you.</li>
    <li> First of all - it showed up on time - that&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Second the description is fantastic! I didn&#x27;t have to google anything for meanings or ingredient data. FABU!!!&lt;br /&gt;now the product itself - I&#x27;ve been using foe almost a whole week both morning and night - my face is clearer, smoother, and the best part???? The circles under my eyes are lighter!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would most certainly by it again (and plan on it) I love how light ir is and once its dry (like two minutes tops) you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing it!&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully with makeup too ^^&lt;br /&gt;I fully approve this product and highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I tried Foxbrim and have decided this is my new favorite.  I have been using this product for 4 days and with our -0 degrees outside I was having trouble finding a good moisturizer.  I love this product so much I&#x27;m ordering more so I don&#x27;t run out.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy and yet my skin is soft and I&#x27;m not waking up with the &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; feeling as in the past.  Also very impressed with the ingredients and cost.  Great product and price.  My only disappointment is Foxbrim doesn&#x27;t make a moisturizer with SPF.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Lotion was delivered in sealed, protectively packaged, and as described on product page.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this moisturizer in a promotion for testing and review.  This is a lightweight and healthy&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer and hydrates dry skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> Feels nice makes my arms look better</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I was hoping it would help with my acne but I am not sure if it is working. It does leaves the skin super soft and smooth though.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and smooth after applied. I feel hydrated so much !</li>
    <li> Light! Makes my face smooth and especially non-greasy. I can already tell a difference on my face: wrinkles less noticeable. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. Contains really nice ingredients like Vitamin C, aloe vera, jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I have always bought the vitamin c serums but I have never had it in a lotion form so I wanted to try this cream.  I have other foxbrim products in the past and have had good experiences. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all or turn my face and neck red so I&#x27;m pretty happy about not having a reaction. I received this to test and give my honest opinion. I have really greasy skin and by the end of the day my forehead and nose are usually pretty shiny.  I put this on in the morning and it absorbs well and didn&#x27;t make my skin at all greasy.  People that have dry facial skin might not like this because it does soak in and is a little dry at first. It does moisturize, just not as much as someone with dry skin would want. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have much in the way of perfume as it smells like some of the vitamin c serums I have used in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t have a negative smell, in my opinion, it just has a scent of whatever is in the moisturizer. The ingredients are fairly straightforward and I didn&#x27;t have an issue with most ingredients except for the Phenoxyethanol.  This is a paraben alternative for a preservative.  The jury is still out on this one but it is found in many cosmetics that state they are paraben free.  It&#x27;s basically phenol that is treated with ethylene oxide.  You should take your time and review this preservative as it has been linked to reproductive issues but is supposed to be safe under 1%.  The bottle lists it at almost the end of the ingredient list which means it is less than most ingredients in this moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t list the percentage that is in the bottle. Do your research and make your own conclusions.  Overall, I give this 4 stars because I like how it works on my face but it loses a star for using Phenoxyethanol.</li>
    <li> This really changed the texture of my skin---much softer and more supple.  I also feel like it is evening out the tone as well.  Great find!</li>
    <li> I had extremely dry skin and I even had damages because of the dryness. Usually after applying other creams the damaged parts of my face were burning so much that sometimes I couldn&#x27;t even tolerate it. But this lotion is very good. I apply it to my face usually twice a day and it works great. My skin became smooth and healthy.  No more irritation. I would recommend it to anyone who has dry\damaged and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the lotion. Will be buying it again</li>
    <li> One of my main complaints about make up is the fact that it felt like I was always wearing some sort of mask. I was turned off to everything that most women apply to their faces, including moisturizer. Every drug store brand I&#x27;ve tried (Ponds, Oil of Olay, Aveeno, etc) always seemed to leave my face feeling like I was wearing make up -- heavy, greasy, un-natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally stomached spending over 10 bucks on moisturizer, I turned to Amazon to figure out what other people were using that they liked so much. Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C lotion was one of the highest rated moisturizers within a decent price range, and I can see why. Within a couple minutes the greasy feeling from the lotion is gone, leaving my face feeling completely natural. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few weeks now and I can say that it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out, or leave behind any build up. My only very slight complaint is that due to my combination skin, my nose tends to get (VERY SLIGHTLY) oily by the end of the day while using this lotion, but so far its the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> First off vitamin C is amazing for your skin. This lotion works beautifully. It is not greasy and goes on smooth it has kind of a medium texture and is non irritant. I love using it since it makes my skin feel smooth and makes it dewy and supple. It doesnt really have a scent to it. I thought it would smell like oranges which would have been awsome but it is fine. Overall the product is great.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer, after a couple of weeks using it the difference is very noticeable. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Vitamin c does so much good for your skin! My face feels and looks great!!! Definitely worth purchasing!!!</li>
    <li> This has made my skin feel smoother and look healthier. It has also helped with my dry skin on my forehead. It&#x27;s been 8 days so far but I noticed better skin in 3 days. I use it after showering. I recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> This left my skin feeling nice and soft. And it was light and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free from Foxbrim to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really picky about my facial moisturizers because I have sensitive and combination skin. I really liked this Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion because it went on very lightweight, blended into the skin leaving it feeling moisturized but no reaction to my sensitive skin. Often products will leave a burning sensation to my skin, or be heavy and make my skin feel grimy, dirty and greasy immediately after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I’ve only been using it for a few weeks I haven’t seen any of the benefits that its description talks about, but I really like it anyways. I’m hoping with longer use I will see some of the promoted benefits, but even if I don’t it is a great moisturizer. I am thinking about adding it into my rotation with my regular moisturizer. Buy that once, buy this once, and repeat. It is a bit more expensive for a smaller size but it’s not often I find a moisturizer I like and I would like to see what longer exposure to it would do VS my national brand and if the price difference between the two is worth it. Being a smaller sized bottle I did think I would run out quickly, but the bottle is still going strong and doesn’t feel like I’ve even used much of it yet. I need very little to spread over my entire face.</li>
    <li> not good my skin got really dry and all my face turned red ? i don&#x27;t know if it has to many products that makes it strong for sensitive skin , got an allergic reaction by the 2 day!!</li>
    <li> I have really dry and sensitive skin and I got this in hopes it would not make me break out but within about 3 days of using it I broke out pretty bad. Would not suggest for very sensitive skin types</li>
    <li> I love anything with jojoba oil in it. So far I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Reat product. I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. Came in packaged nicely as promised and with Prime i got it right away.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product specifically because of the amazing list of ingredients. I I have dry, sensitive skin so it is hard to find a moisturizer that adequately hydrates without irritating my face.  I was really hopeful that this moisturizer would work, especially because it is so highly rated. Unfortunately, my experience has not been so pleasant. Although the product does leave my face feeling really soft, the feeling does not last. I find myself continuously having to reapply the moisturizer though-out the day( 5-6 times) because my face gets dry again rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, after a couple of days I started breaking out on my cheeks, which from past experience with other products I know to be from irritation. This was my red flag and I immediately discontinued usage. After a couple of days the bumps on my cheeks subsided. I am really disappointed because I absolutely love the ingredients. I think this product would be a better fit for someone with oily skin but not for those with dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion . I needed something to help my dry skin on my face , but as a long time acne sufferer I am always hesitant to try different things . Well I tried it and I will never go back to anything else ever !! I put it on daily morning and night after my normal acne regimen and I am yet to have a breakout or dry skin !! Definetly worth buying and so resonibly priced !!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome!! you have to try it when cleaning face in the morning what the damn face apply over face this stuff really works awesome I give it a 5 stars and also tell my friends about it they buy it as well from Amazon</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin.  I&#x27;m in my 30s and still get pimples.  Needed something that moisturized well but didn&#x27;t break me out.  Works great.  Has a weird smell to it but I&#x27;m fine with it because I don&#x27;t want the fragrance additives that other brands stick in theirs.  A little goes a long way and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have spf in it because my primer and foundation do, and I can use this at night.</li>
    <li> I have used vitamin c lotion in the past and it brightens and faded my acne scars! I am excited to try this brand!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of my favs. Will be keeping it as a staple!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It feels great and non greasy on my face. I can tell it&#x27;s been absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;** I received the product with a discount and to provide a honest feedback</li>
    <li> I have been extremely happy with Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C facial lotion. This lotion was wonderful! It leaves my skin looking and feeling both soft and hydrated. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and am interested in trying the other products as well.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and did not make my skin feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. It has great natural ingredients, after one month I have noticed a reduction in fine lines</li>
    <li> I do not think I got a new item. I opened the lid and found that the cream is all over the top before I started using it. I was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> seems to be a pretty good product.  Too soon to really tell for sure.  also, I am one of those people that uses a few products at a time which seems to give me good results.  I bought the night cream too and it feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was truly amazing, the very first product i have used that hasnt made my skin break out and it didnt make it oily either ... very impressed</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this product a little time to see how it worked given my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoy this product, my skin feels softer and more elastic and it has never irritated my face. I thought this lotion would be to light to combat the drying effects of this harsh winter, but I&#x27;m happy I was wrong- I feel like I could wear this year round.</li>
    <li> Very nice, unscented lotion. My skin is very soft after using it. I like that it completely soaks into my skin (and quickly). It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy afterward either.  Because it has Vitamin C in it, I use it more as a skin &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; to even out my skin tone. For people with very dry skin, they may want to use a more emollient moisturizer over the Foxbrim lotion while enjoying the benefits of the Vitamin C underneath.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Customer Service is about the same.</li>
    <li> Since I live in Hawaii and am exposed to the sun every day, I am always searching for a great lotion. So when I was offered this Vitamin C Lotion from Foxbrim for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it so I definitely ordered a jar to try. I&#x27;ve been using it for the last week or two and I have actually been using it on my legs and shoulders where I&#x27;ve been getting extra sun from being at the beach all day. I absolutely love the results!!! My skin is super soft and definitely moisturized. If you are looking for a great lotion for your skin, I suggest trying this Vitamin C Lotion from Foxbrim for your skin.</li>
    <li> I typically have a hard time finding a face moisturizer, but this one is excellent. Non greasy and feels light. Stays hydrated all day and drys quickly so I am able to apply makeup. Would order again!  Love the pump dispenser too</li>
    <li> I love anything from Foxbrim. I also love this vitamin C lotion. I ran out a couple days before I got this so my skin was very happy to have its moisture back. Seriously one of the best lotions. I&#x27;ll definitely return for more!</li>
    <li> Arrived almost quicker than I could order it.  The lotion is light, but really rejuvenates even really dry skin. It soaks up really quickly and leaves no oily residue on your face.  It is a winner for both morning and night.  Best of all, this lotion has all natural products and only gives your skin good nutrients rather than harsh chemicals.  I review a lot of Foxbrim product on promotional including this one and I&#x27;m always left satisfied with their products.</li>
    <li> I received this after spending the day on the beach and getting a sun burn and drying out my skin. My skin drank this up! Lovely slip and absorption. Not overly perfumed. I will definitely be purchasing this again! 👍🏼</li>
    <li> I have been using Foxbrim&#x27;s orange blossom water toner and peptide complex moisturizer and have been really impressed with how moisturizing and gentle the products are on my skin.  I just purchased the Vitamin C lotion and it is just as wonderful. I am looking forward to trying more of the products.</li>
    <li> Love this company and all of it&#x27;s products.  This lotion feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s Foxbrim, I buy it! I love this brand. This lotion is particularly nice due to its small size...just slip it into your purse and have comfortable and moisturizes skin all day! Not greasy AT ALL, and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Okay product. Was expecting better results.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have a dry skin and this vitamin c lotion helps me a lot to keep my skin soft. Thank you for the seller for giving Me discount for the product recommended</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I need to be very careful about what products I use on my face. If I don&#x27;t, then I end up with rashes or hives! As a result, I have only been able to use very few products. It was with some trepidation that I purchased this lotion. I noticed that my skin was starting to attain that dull, lifeless look one gets as one ages. My usual product is great for moisturizing, but clearly something more was needed. I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Lotion for nearly a month now. No bumps, rashes, or hives. As a matter of fact, my skin is staring to regain that youthful appearance that I thought lost. It is more apparent when I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror. The discolorations are diminishing and my face has taken on a &#x27;glow.&#x27; I really like this product. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and clearly works.</li>
    <li> I really like the Foxbrim products!  Everything they make has quality ingredients and little to no fragrance.  This has to be my favorite product I&#x27;ve tried yet though.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and after the first time my skin looked awesome! Radiant, dewey, so soft… and not the least bit greasy. I have combination skin, and this lotion works perfectly with it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great everyday moisturizer, this would be a fantastic option!</li>
    <li> Pretty good for my oily skin it was not oily at all. Need to reorder.</li>
    <li> This product contains amazing antioxidants properties. I thas vitamin C, Green tea, jojoba oil, shea butter, pathenol and msn. Your skin needs these ingredients to remain healthy and youthful looking. I wont keep this review too long since that tends to bore some people, but what makes this lotion special? A lot of moisturizers leave your skin feeling oily, greasy and heavy. Which can cause your make up to slip and slide, leave your pillow sheets greasy. This lotion will not do that. At all. It absorbs quickly into your skin, it leaves it feeling incredibly hydrated and glowy and healthy looking. I am constantly on the look out for moisturizers like this one. Definitely made it to my few favorites.  Also, these lotion bottles come with a lot of product 3.4 ounces will last you a very long time! A little goes a long way. This is my honest opinion about receiving this product. Hope it helps xoxo</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Leaves skin feeling fantastic :)</li>
    <li> Completely moisturizes skin. Feels great on face. Smells wonderful. Make sure to rub in all the way otherwise it will feel heavy on skin and feel smothering. Received this product for review.</li>
    <li> I like the lotion, it has a neutral smell. It goes on lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. The only con of this product is that you need quite a lot of pumps to cover your whole face. So, you will have to continuously have to keep buying this to stay stocked. It soaks into skin very quickly, leaving a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion . I needed something to help my dry skin on my hands I wear leather gloves at work and they dry out and crack all the time  I am always trying different things . Well I tried it and I will never go back to anything else ever !! I put it on daily morning and night after my normal acne regimen and I am yet to have a breakout or dry skin !! Definetly worth buying and so resonibly priced !!!</li>
    <li> I made the right decision in ordering this lotion instead of another brand. I have been using it for about a week now, once in the morning and before I go to bed. I can already see a healthier complexion and my face is so soft. I ordered two bottles and I&#x27;m glad I did! Will reorder when I&#x27;m empty! Try it and you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> FOXBRIM has been one of my favorite lotions that I&#x27;ve tried lately I have some issues with my skin. I think I&#x27;m getting middle aged acne. So far, all of the FOXBRIM products have worked wonders on my dry cheeks and tiny bumps I&#x27;m getting here and there.. One of the reasons I like this brand, so far, are the ingredients are mostly items I can find in my home or at the store. A lot of them have no chemicals, like the Dead Sea Mud Mask. I really enjoy that product. It leaves my skin really soft and smooth and as soon as I dry off I put this one to hold in the moisture and protect my skin from free radicals throughout the day. If your looking for a new product to use and you value natural products, I would recommend giving the products this company makes. I haven&#x27;t been let down yet.  DISCLAIMER :  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you&#x27;ve  most likely already read it. What I will try to do is tell you what I see, smell, hear, what happens and what my opinion is as well as I can. In order to try to make easier for you to decide if this is the product is suitable for the job you need it to do or for what you&#x27;re wanting to give someone. I have the money to buy the things I really need. However, there are times when I have had difficult time reading or watching a no nonsense plain laymen&#x27;s description. As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes that I receive before I purchase the items I use and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.  I have no connection to this seller or this company who makes this product and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. I haven&#x27;t been offered anything in return and at times I give no feedback. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item. I&#x27;m  rarely going to give a perfectly polished review. I have dyslexia and very often I don&#x27;t spell check. But I will do my best to describe this item and my thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> I have used this at night for a couple of weeks now.  I like the effect it has on my skin.  I do not break out with it.</li>
    <li> Eversince my dermatologist recommend Vit. C  for a healthier and glowing skin, I&#x27;d been trying different products for my face. This one is my favorites. I always bring this also in my bag . I recommend this to my friends and they even see the result of applying Vit.C on your face. this product works and I love it.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!!</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Products continue to amaze me. I got this along with the serum to try at discount for truthful review. And I truthfully love the cooperation, their products  are high-quality and have shown a difference in my face and just a week of use. Normally even expensive products make my face dryer and break out. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve seen change  That I&#x27;m proud of. Now that I know of their products when I run out I will be going back to buy more. The company also is incredible, they have email me  to make sure that I am content, and are willinng to do what it takes to make me that way. Fortunately didn&#x27;t have to do anything. I mean it when I say all products from other companies seem to cause the opposite reaction of what I was buying it for. With foxbrim they&#x27;ve all been improvements in my face. My husband even noticed right away and started using some! I truly recommend  this company&#x27;s products for people who have tried other things and not had success. I stand by my word and it means a lot to me to speak the truth so just know regardless of the discount, I am telling you my personal, Real Experience.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a night light-weight lotion.  I have been using it nightly.  It absorbs well while nourishing the skin.  I only wish it had sun protection in it then I would use it during the day too!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin so soft!!!</li>
    <li> This moisturize is fantastic. Not a heavy moisturizer that leaves you with breakouts the next day. Absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling soft.  I have several other Foxbrim products and am always pleased with the quality of their products.</li>
    <li> I received my Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion complimentary from ilovetoreview.com. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 10 days now and I&#x27;m in love! The lotion goes on very light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It also rubs in and is absorbed really quickly. I love the feel and look of my skin since starting this lotion. I use it in the morning after washing my face. I notice my makeup goes on smoother and my face just looks fresher and more radiant. I would definitely recommend Foxbrim Vitamin C lotion to my friends and family. I also really like the convenient pump that it comes in. I can pump out just the right amount.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C-  you hear so much about how good it is for your face.  This is an exceptional cream, very moisturizing, lovely light scent, my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> The product is working as expected. My skin looks brighter with fewer blemishes. I like that it absorbs quickly without leaving greasy residue. Perfect cream for the summer.</li>
    <li> Nice light but rich moisturizer, great for sensitive skin.  Would be great if they would keep this version, but also offer one with sunscreen for those of us that need protection.  They may not want to add ingredients that are not natural, but most dermatologists recommend wearing sunscreen daily to reduce risk of skin cancer.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found, and I noticed a positive change in my skin, which is very sensitive and prone to outbreaks.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive facial skin. I used this lotion as a moisturizer and in hopes of seeing some lessening of age issues (dull skin, wrinkles, sun spots) from the Vit C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked amazingly at keeping my skin hydrated and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or reactions, there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable difference on the aging front -- hey, I know I&#x27;m looking for a miracle here: this lotion for 30 days to fix 51 yrs of use! -- maybe I need to use it for several YEARS to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit thick / heavy (for my oil-prone skin) this summer in the tropics where I live, so I&#x27;ll use it in the winter months after the air dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with it as a general moisturizer overall.</li>
    <li> Using on extremely sensitive skin with dryness and damage from BP cream, and am very happy with this lotion. Soothed my dry spots on contact and left skin very soft. Did not cause breakouts, which is REALLY saying something, because my skin breaks out if someone so much as sneezes from two blocks away. Will be very interested to try more from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I have never tried any products by Foxbrim. After using this product I am tempted to buy their eye cream.  The past week I have been applying this before bed right after washing my face.  The smell is soft and pleasant and it feels light - not greasy or thick.  I have had some issues the past few months with dry almost flaky skin in my T-zone area and have tried a few intense night creams in coordination with my daily moisturizer- to no avail.  This Vitamin C lotion has given me an answer to my problem and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Works good doesn&#x27;t feel to oily like other lotions</li>
    <li> I have very mild eczema on my face and was looking for a new moisturizer to try out.  This one simply did not work.  I&#x27;ve used several other natural products that were effective, but after reading all the rave reviews, I was curious to see what all the buzz is about.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t even smell like vitamins.  It smells like a basic hand lotion.  I did some quick research on the company and didn&#x27;t find much history.  After trying this lotion and seeing the price fluctuate all the way up to $20, I&#x27;m left wondering if all these reviews are legitimate.  I&#x27;m not saying they aren&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m going to steer clear of their products for now.</li>
    <li> I really like this product . Non greasy but I feel like I have to use more to get the results I like . Pretty good product</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Does not irritate the eyes, which is a problem I have with many other moisturizing lotions.</li>
    <li> As a product tester I compare dozens of skin care products, and I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations from fragrance to long-term results. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Very faint, lotiony&lt;br /&gt;~ Color and texture: White, medium to thick lotion&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Smooth and thick, spreads nicely&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Moister, cool, not oily or sticky&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Fine for all. Not sure I would use it on an oily face.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 1.7oz white plastic pump bottle. Pump offers reasonably good control.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Dry skin looks moistened.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Definitely better than using an ordinary lotion without active ingredients. MSM, vitamin C, and vitamin B5 are good things to have. The moisturizing oils are palm oil, safflower oil, shea butter, and jojoba oil. The formula isn&#x27;t anything to write home about but it&#x27;s good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Other notes: This listing on amazon is for 3.4oz; I got half that, a 1.7oz container. At 1.7oz this is priced like a treatment cream that should have a lot more in terms of active ingredients, but it&#x27;s more like a moisture lotion with a few extras. If I&#x27;d actually gotten the amount advertised, I would consider this a four-star product because the price would be more in line with what you get. Instead, it&#x27;s a poor value and false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

    <li> It feels great on my skin!!  The lotion won&#x27;t make your skin oily but i moisturizes very well.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this brand/company. Their other products are made of real natural ingredients so I trust any other product they produce. It&#x27;s all about trusting what they&#x27;re putting in it and what you&#x27;re putting into your skin. Great lotion!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for one week now and like it alot. My face feels great and applying it makes my make up routine easier.  Your vface will feel and look better almost right away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion only a few days so it is a bit early to see the full results however, what I see so far is amazing! My skin is glowing, looks nourished, plump and an obvious reduction in my pores. I am using this lotion in conjunction with a Foxbrim serum which I believe it boosting the process. This combination will bring out your best face yet and erase years!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!! I have very sensitive skin and this is the first and only product that makes my face baby smooth and clear! This product totally delivers proven results! They have gained a life long customer in me! I&#x27;ve already recommended it to folks I know. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great lotion and feels so good on hands.  Love the container and the pump.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great. I noticed a difference the first time I used it. It&#x27;s so much better at fixing my dry skin than the Olay moisturizer I was using. Bonus: it&#x27;s actually making my skin clearer as well. The lotion goes on smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance. So glad I tried this stuff.</li>
    <li> My skin is the worst type: oily and shiny, yet extremely acne prone with many painful dry patches. For a long time I used a lotion meant for eliminating acne but found that it peeled off shortly after applying it and never truly moisturized my skin. I tried this lotion in hopes it would moisturize deeply without causing breakouts, and it definitely met my needs. I apply it before bed and wake with soft, bright skin, and I use it under foundation which appears to remain smoother throughout the day (instead of getting patchy like with my old moisturizer). As long as I am consistent (applying day and night everyday), this lotion keeps my skin soft and I have not broken out from it yet.</li>
    <li> Feels really nice on my face, just what i was looking for!  And the customer service is great -- shipped very quickly and seller followed up to make sure I was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Just ok, made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> It feels very nourishing and appears to have made my skin less red after a couple of weeks .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to own a lotion with vitamin c added to it instead of a Serum or gel. It makes your skin feel so moisturized and soft, and even improves the color by brightening it. A little definitely goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moistuizer for 3 days, and I love it. I have tried many different types of lotions, oil, cream, for my oily/ dry skin (weird right) and could not find anything that worked for both oily and dry. This does!!!! I also have red splotches due to an autoimmune disorder and this moisturizer has already started to even at my skin tone. I am looking forward to purchasing other foxbrim products.</li>
    <li> This is the first moisturizer that actually helps my dry skin. No more flaking when I put my BB cream on. Prior to using this moisturizer combined with Foxbrim&#x27;s Ultra Lift Night Cream &amp; Treatment and their Radiance Eye Cream, when I applied any brand of foundation or BB cream, there were patches of flaking skin. I&#x27;ve found the right moisturizing combo for me here in arid Arizona.</li>
    <li> This product is helping to make my skin feel and look smoother.  My skin is &#x27;brighter&#x27; healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several products by Foxbrim and they have all been nice. The Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion is a true winner, though, bringing a feeling of luxury and richness to skin with the use of this mild, silky lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispensed via a nice pump bottle, a generous and adequate portion is provided for application to one&#x27;s face, neck, and chest. It glides on and is absorbed quickly. I really like the feel of this lotion either without makeup or with makeup applied after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is encouraging to see that Foxbrim is using natural and organic ingredients to create this lovely lotion. It is my understanding that much of what is applied to our skin is absorbed into our body&#x27;s system. We certainly don&#x27;t want anything but good ingredients to be rubbed on our skin - our body&#x27;s largest organ. (check out the list of ingredients below)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has indicated that this product is good not just for our face but all over or body. While certainly affordable for a face, neck, and chest, it would, however, be rather pricey to use full body. But I have applied it to my hands and arms and it feels absolutely lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for review but only endorse those which I use and can wholeheartedly endorse.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, because it also really brightens dull skin. It is very smooth and soothing when applied. I like this serum and the way it moisturizes, is wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. It has helped acne scars and breakouts as well as some fine lines. This stuff is fantastic. Recommended</li>
    <li> My face feels so smooth</li>
    <li> This is a really wonderful product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my skin is just glowing! I have received numerous comments on how my skin is glowing and how good it looks. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from this product alone, as I use plenty of other fabulous products on my skin. However....I do feel the difference in my skin after using this product. My skin is so extremely soft and supple every day. It is not a greasy product, and it dries well. I am so happy with this purchase that I decided to order it again, in the 3.4oz size. I am super excited to see what will happen with my skin as time goes on. I am 42 and people would never guess that I&#x27;m older than 28-30. I hear this all the time and it is such a nice complement to know that I take care of my skin and people notice. Thank you for making such a fantastic product. Also, one more quick note....I have suffered with acne most of my life, and I have had no breakouts at all since using this. In fact, my skin is clearer! I am one happy customer!</li>
    <li> I really really wanted to like this product. I received an email from the owner of this company and at the time, a few days after starting to use this, I had to tell him the same thing as now. I don&#x27;t know that I can really fault the moisturizer, it&#x27;s prob. very good since it has so many good reviews. However, it did not work for me. Every time I&#x27;ve used it I have broken out. But I think it&#x27;s more of my skin not liking lotions or creams. I have to use oils or serum. I&#x27;m going to keep it though and use on my hands and other parts. The shipping was quick and the customer service is great!</li>
    <li> I have used it daily and feel clean when applied to my face!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and my skin feels so good.</li>
    <li> Another great item from Foxbrim.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that many of the ingredients are organic, and I also love the dispenser on this item, as it makes it really easy to just get a little bit every time.&lt;br /&gt;This item has no real scent, other then the ingredients. This is nice for scent sensitive people, but the ingredients do have a smell, and while not unpleasant in any way, I wouldn&#x27;t mind a light citrus scent instead.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion absorbs pretty quickly, and the ingredient smell goes away even quicker.&lt;br /&gt;With the drier weather lately, this lotion was great. For me, it might be a little too moisturizing for spring and fall, when my skin isn&#x27;t dry at all- but it will be a great addition to my routine in summer and fall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discount on this item for a fair review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Although I like that I was adding a lightweight natural moisturizer with skin repairing vitamin C to my face,&lt;br /&gt;this particular one is not for me. At first when I put this on, it does absorb quickly and my pores did shrink&lt;br /&gt;some for a little bit, but my face felt on the tight side. Then as the day went on it felt more hydrated and&lt;br /&gt;when I was busy moving, my face got to shiny for my liking. I think skin type, the weather, and activity has&lt;br /&gt;a lot to do with how a product works for you. My combo skin is a mix of normal, easily gets oily and a super&lt;br /&gt;dry feeling unless moisturized good, it has been really humid here and I have had busy summer activities.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim does have wonderful products with natural ingredients I think I just have to find the right ones for me.&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and testing purposes. No compensation for a&lt;br /&gt;positive review was provided. All of my reviews are honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experiences.</li>
    <li> Good price and product. A little of the cream had squeezed out into the lid during delivery, but not enough to complain about really.</li>
    <li> The lotion is white color, non greasy, not too light and not too thick, smells good lightly scented, nice packaging, fast shipping. Give it a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I have very dry skin and other lotions would still leave my face dry after applying, but this one does not. It keeps my skin nice and moisturized all day. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and just ordered two more bottles. The company is excellent as well. The first bottle I received had cracked under the cover and they promptly sent me a new bottle.</li>
    <li> love this lotion leaves my skin super soft .......its great for hand to</li>
    <li> Put on my face every night. Definitely feeling softer!</li>
    <li> I like this lotion, but my skin is very sensitive and has gotten a lot of blackheads lately. I don&#x27;t know if it was the lotions fault,  but I am going to try a new one just in case. Also, even when I use it I still get dry spots.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product very much!  My skin feels much more moist and smoother and I’m referring it to my hubby!  Foxbrim has excellent follow-up as well... I didn&#x27;t have any questions but am positive they would be very helpful if I did.</li>
    <li> But on the greasy side, I have combination skin makes my face look and feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product. Noticeable difference in smoothness on my face.</li>
    <li> The lotion is good (or seems to be so far) however the packaging is sealed so that, when the product gets low, there will still be some left behind that will be inaccessible. I wish there was a better package for this so that I could know I wasn&#x27;t wasting any of the lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion works just ok my skin when I put it on it feels great but like a hour or two later my skin feels dry again I just think that my skin is just supper dry.</li>
    <li> good product makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, feels like silk, and moisturized my extremely sensitive-dry skin without any issues. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This lotion is quite amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have acne scars and acne. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and noticed that it has helped lighten the stubborn acne scars on my face. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer and is a little thick so you don&#x27;t need to use that much of the product at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I tested this product along with a vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve been using to see if it&#x27;ll break me out. Unfortunately, it did give me small pimples around my forehead and cheeks. It must be because the lotion is pretty thick or that it doesn&#x27;t have any acne-fighting agent in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, when I do use it with both my vitamin c serum and acne cream, it works wonderfully and the acne is not a problem</li>
    <li> horrible. broke my sensitive facial skin out EVERYWHERE. I only used it for 2 days. I have no idea what&#x27;s in it to cause that but I will never use on my face again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a reduced rate to give it an honest opinion. May I truly say that this is the BEST face lotion that I have EVER used. My hubby says that I always buy way too many beauty products. I have a smell and feel thing. You know the heightened nose that can smell something a mile away; well that&#x27;s me. I have used a lot of products that smell way too much or the odor is overbearing. This has a nice light smell and the product is not too thick or too thin. It glides nicely and as soon as I run out I will be buying more. I&#x27;m certain this will be my go to face cream for years to come. Thanking you for the opportunity to try an amazing product that I absolutely love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but a little too thick for my liking.</li>
    <li> I used to use cetaphil as a moisturizer and this is sooooo much better! It also feel less greasy!</li>
    <li> Love this!! Is light and moisturizing. Makes skin feel healthy and refreshed!</li>
    <li> love this lotion!  I got it for review</li>
    <li> I just received this product in the mail today and could not wait to try it! I have always have difficulties finding a moisturizer I felt good about due to having combination skin. Some areas of my face are prone to hormonal acne and other areas are dry and red. I have literally tried everything from Proactive (which I found to be way too harsh) to just straight coconut oil (which still made my face feel oily). I&#x27;ve tried numerous regimens over the last few months and have spent countless amounts of money on various different products trying to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I can honestly say, even though it hasn&#x27;t even been a day, that I know this product is going to work. I applied it after showering and using my Nuxe face wash and cannot believe how soft my face feels, the best part is it doesn&#x27;t even feel remotely oily or greasy. I definitely recommend this!!!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is so much healthier using this product. It has calmed my adult acne breakouts and hydrated. I no longer have flaky red skin. It&#x27;s mild and non sented too.</li>
    <li> This lotion helps calm down my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m happy to have found it and will order it again. It&#x27;s not greasy feeling at all and doesn&#x27;t have the stinging that another similar lotion has.</li>
    <li> Love it! The lotion is light and not greasy. I can wear it alone or under cc cream.</li>
    <li> Amazing value for an amazing product. Ive been looking for a mosturizer that contains these ingredients and came across Foxbrim. I was amazed by the price. I&#x27;ve used it now for the last week and it keeps my face well lubricated and quenched without a film or an unnatural feeling. It&#x27;s not tacky or sticky the cream has a great consistency and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m excited to try all their products and at this price how can you not.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed a a difference in the scars on my face. Like most people, I&#x27;ve had my bouts with acne, that have left their marks. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cream to help reduce the redness in these marks and this product seems to help with that. I had previously been using anti-aging products or wrinkle creams on them but they weren&#x27;t working. I feel that the concentrated vitamin C in this lotion was what made the difference! I can almost go without make up....almost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I have tried many (way too many!!) creams and lotions, even made my own concoctions with essential oils but still had not found the perfect cream for my 63 year sensitive face and slightly oily face without ending up with too much peeling or clogged pores. I don&#x27;t want anything greasy and I only use a translucent powder &amp; blush as makeup.  I tried this Foxbrim C lotion - along with their toner - and am really impressed with how smooth my face feels. I mix it with a little Retin A - which seems very compatible together. Yes, I like this cream/toner combination and will buy more. It&#x27;s such a great feeling to find something that actually feels good, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and is reasonably priced after so many years of research and spending so much money on products that just didn&#x27;t work with my skin.  Thanks Foxbrim!!</li>
    <li> This smells Sooooo good! Personally, I&#x27;ve been using this at night, and I put it every where! Before I get in bed, I put it on my face, my neck, my chest, and the back of my hands, and it is even smoothing out my hands! Overnight! So falling asleep, I am smelling fresh oranges! Oranges, it is so awesome! Foxbrim sent me this for testing purposes and a review on my blog, and I had to come on here and say how much I love this Vitamin C Cream by Foxbrim! It seriously is some amazing stuff, you have to try it!</li>
    <li> I am 36 years old with sensitive combination skin. I have long been looking for a lotion that would leave my skin feeling refreshed, not provoke breakouts, and not cause any reaction. I&#x27;ve felt I should be able to find something under $20 that I would love...here it is! My skin seems younger. It feels amazing--not greasy but refreshed. No reactions or breakouts.  LOVE, love, love</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion, it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I have also noticed some fading of facial discolorations. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell  results wise but I like the texture of the lotion .</li>
    <li> nice and smooth not greasy</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It makes my face feel so soft, smooth, and fresh. I also like the fact that I can wear this lotion under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I was so enthusiastic in trying this product, l put it on my face right after it arrived. A small rash appeared, l wrote to Foxbrim who had earlier emailed, thanking me for the purchase. Troy told me l should use cleanser and toner before applying this. After doing what he suggested, l have no more rashes and within couple of days&#x27; use, there is some improvement to my summer sun damaged skin. This vitamin C is white, does not stain my clothes. It is odorless too. One squeeze of the pump is enough to cover my entire face. Best thing is it rubs on smoothly on my skin and does not feel oily yet it allows me the ease to gently massage my face. I am so satisfied that l placed an order of Foxbrim night cream. Bravo! Keep up the good work keeping women beautiful!</li>
    <li> Pretty much what i expected. It really leaves a clean soft feel to the skin. Instead of a greasy scented cream, like most moisturizers, its simple light and refreshing. 😄 P.S. sometimes after i apply i don&#x27;t want to put makeup on!</li>
    <li> I love this~ Before sleep, after shower, and before applying BB, I pump just a pea sized amount of product from the tip of my fingers and dot the six corners of my face (forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin). Afterwards, I just pat the product around until it covers the whole face. A pea sized amount must seem very small, but a little really goes a long way! My face is a dry type so this is amazing for me! I&#x27;ve tried many, but they seem to be oily and just make my skin really oily instead of hydrating it. This product does it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update&lt;br /&gt;I kept my past review for reference. I&#x27;ve used foxbrim for upto 1 week then spots, pimples and zits began to show. As my previous review says, I was hoping the foxbrim did not cause it, because I looooooved the moisturizing power it gave. I don&#x27;t know if it was either foxbrim or the new BBcream I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped foxbrim for about two weeks until the zits and pimples died down, while still wearing the new BB I was trying. In those two weeks my face was not getting worse with the BB so my guess was it couldn&#x27;t be it. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face. So I decided to try foxbrim again, thinking the zits and pimples were just from &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;After trying foxbrim again, within a week the pimps came again ㅠㅠ This time I was starting to think that it&#x27;s the fox&#x27;s fault. But still, I didn&#x27;t want it to be true because it makes your skin so soft and moisturized! So I decided to take another two weeks off of the foxbrim until the pimps calm down.&lt;br /&gt;~sigh. So after about two weeks I tried it again, and then they started to show up again. I was getting tired and finally told myself to lay off the fox (even though I really didn&#x27;t want to &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;)&lt;br /&gt;As I much as it can make my skin supple and super soft, I didn&#x27;t wanna bother with the bumps all the time. However, everyone is a little different. I&#x27;m guess I&#x27;m just a little unlucky to have this product troll me, but it might totally work for you! It&#x27;s a wonderful product. Although, it gave me unfortunate side effectsly work for you! It&#x27;s a wonderful product. Although, it gave me unfortunate side effects</li>
    <li> I feel my skin soft, smooth and refresh&#x27; fron the very first use.I would recommend this product to any body</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people with combination skin, and have struggled for years to find the right regimen for myself and am still changing it up as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to say is, using only oil-free products will make your skin worse, especially if you use acne medication that removes all the oil from your skin. This will lead to so many white-heads....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has jojoba oil but does not leave your skin greasy at all. I always wait 2 weeks before deciding on a product, since your skin overturns every 2-3 weeks. A little bit goes far, but I generally apply a generous amount of it every night. Because of the oil (good oils!) it may feel like you only need a little, but it&#x27;s actually very light so do apply generously. With just little I had dry-spots on my face. With a lot at first it may feel like too much but if you keep massaging it in, it gets absorbed completely without stickiness or greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sticking with this for sure,</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. (Oily and dry) This lotion is the best. It keeps my skin hydrated all day and doesn&#x27;t leave shine. I&#x27;m almost 30 and starting to get those dreaded lines under my eyes. This product plus hyaluronic serum has almost completely erased those lines. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> A little heavy for my liking, but is a good moisturizer when a little water is spritzed over face after application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a month and it is doing exactly what it claims. My skin was in pretty rough shape from neglect and The Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion has softened my skin and loosened impurities. It is lightweight and sinks right in. I think it might be helping with hyperpigmentation but I need more time to tell. I use a sodiumPCA spray on my bare clean skin before applying the lotion which helps with hydration.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and will purchase it again. I will also be trying other Foxbrim products.</li>
    <li> This is very moisturizing even during cold winter days. It has helped my skin become less dry from the cold weather and it&#x27;s not greasy at all so you feel like your skin has just the right amount of hydration, It has a pump which I always love because it&#x27;s easier to get the product and less of a mess. This product is great because you can use for your face and body so bringing this when you travel makes a two in one product. This is a great moisturizer for everyone to try out.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the vitamin c lotion long enough to rate it, but it does go on smooth and creamy.  My order was fulfilled promptly : )</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin. Soft and clear. My skin inflammation has gone away and I have more of a glow! All Foxbrim products are amazing.</li>
    <li> If you dont like it the first time of application just return it. I kept it to see any improvement but its whatever. Don&#x27;t like it all!!!  and i always invest in great skin care. Just gave a try to a product like this to see if it was worth it but not at all.</li>
    <li> I love Foxbrim products.  I trust them with my skin!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I have not had any luck with natural moisturizers until now. This one has been a different experience for me. I&#x27;m almost finished with the first bottle and have not had any problems with breakouts or rashes. I love that it&#x27;s unscented too. Scent is totally unnecessary and always seems to be a problem. I even use this under my eyes and there is no irritation at all. The little pump dispenser is wonderful. It&#x27;s possible to control exact amounts so there isn&#x27;t any waste. I have been able to use it under makeup without creating any problems with application or coverage. My search is over.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ~~ Does exactly as it says in listing ~~ I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to try Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C Lotion. I use the lotion as a moisturizer, although it has other uses (helps with skin discoloration). I like the consistency of the product, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either (a light scent). The lotion is not too creamy or liquidy. It&#x27;s perfect for keeping my skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C Lotion. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin with a touch of eczema. This lotion made my skin noticeably softer after first use. I experienced no irritation! This lotion is not greasy at all. My skin is noticeably more moisturized and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle is great too. It is easy to use and gets every last bit of lotion out of the bottle. I like the minimal packaging design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate that Foxbrim uses eco-conscious ingredients as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I used to use a $40 moisturizer but that was getting to expensive so I found this stuff. It&#x27;s much more reasonably priced and my face is so smooth and it isn&#x27;t dry at all. I work at a pool so the chlorine kills my skin, but this works wonders for me!</li>
    <li> This lotion is a bit thick for me.  It doesn&#x27;t glide easily across my skin, even when used with toner.  I prefer a lighter lotion, this is more like cream.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I would defiantly buy again. Ive been using this for about three weeks now and have noticed a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s smoother and some of my old scars have faded.</li>
    <li> I have had great luck with the quality of the Foxbrim brand...this is a truly moisturizing light cream and Vitamin C is great for skin care.  It is new to me at the moment, but it&#x27;s a winner already as I have goofy sensitive skin.  No bad reactions! Super great for me.  It arrived promptly and safely from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as always.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Use it as directed but no results.</li>
    <li> This is about as good as anything else I have used.  Nothing noticeably different but I do feel better knowing I am not putting harsh chemicals on my face.  Not sure if it is worth the price for the small amount you get but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this moisturizer - it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or shine afterwards.</li>
    <li> Not bad as a lotion, but so far haven&#x27;t seen any of the claimed effects. Gives my skin a nice youthful appearance for a short time. Good for a general moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Its feel weird giving this product two stars when others seem to be loving it...However I gave this product a month of use, and it did merely nothing for my light/moderate acne scars and my active acne. I found the lotion to be greasy, and oily. I wouldn&#x27;t apply this product in the morning without wearing makeup over it, because of the shine it gives off. The reason its getting two stars instead of one is because this lotion does resolve dryness from what I&#x27;ve seen, but nothing extra. On that note, for this price, and the 1.7 bottle, I recommend trying cheaper moisturizers before this one. I had high hopes with this product due to the great reviews, but sadly I will not be buying anymore of there products. What a shame!</li>
    <li> I use this on tip of the hyaluronic acid serum daily.  it works great.</li>
    <li> this lotion is so creamie it feel so good on your face and you can tell the different in about three week and it goes on go good and it makes your face feel great and look good i wil buy this again</li>
    <li> Definitely like this lotion.  I love that there is no scent as most have distinct smells and aggravates my sinuses... this doesn&#x27;t and it works wonderfully.  I love it and I see ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel silky smooth after only three weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really smooth and very light. Can&#x27;t really see any change in my skin but it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it is problem with my face or the cream, but every time I use it, I feel that my face lost the freshness and become oily look. Hope they made a cream that sinks more into the skin and leave skin just moist, instead of oily look. Working wise I didn&#x27;t see a much change.</li>
    <li> Wow! this product is amazing. I use it as a moisturizer/primer before my makeup and my make up lasted all day. No product has been able to do that for me this far. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> love the feeling of it super moisturizing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different products from this manufacturer, and all have proven effective. This Vitamin C lotion is good to use after their serum...try both, they work!</li>
    <li> The shipping was SUPER fast. It came in about 3 days. I have only used this once because it just arrived today but I love it so far. I like the way it feels when it goes on. It&#x27;s not too heavy. It&#x27;s perfect and makes your skin super soft. I love that it has all natural ingredients as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, this has to be the best natural lotion that I&#x27;ve tried that feels so smooth and creamy that really moisturizes my face just like or better than other non natural lotions, it really does leave your skin very soft and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this product complimentary of Foxbrim, all my thoughts and opinions are that of my own.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! The best face lotion I have ever used- and I am a face product junkie as a 30 year old woman I have been noticing a lot more dark circles and general sensitivity to my skin...but this product is like a breath of fresh air! leaves my skin feeling refreshed and bright without being greasy. I have used this product only 2 weeks but I definitely notice an overall brightening of my dark circles and skin. It doesent lighten the skin..or remove acne scars ..but it definitely nourishes the skin and makes it feel young and soft again.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to help with acne scars. It was very moisturizing and didn&#x27;t leave a film and made my skin feel smooth. I would have been very satisfied with this product if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey for the amount. The bottle lasted me 2.5 weeks, and that is just one use a day on my face only. Not a lot of product here. Although I did enjoy the way it made my skin feel it did not help with my acne scarring even a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that many of the positive reviews on this item are fake due to the high amount of people receiving the product for free.. which I did not.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great pricing!</li>
    <li> Mom loves this stuff. Says she doesn&#x27;t know how she survived before without it. Says it goes on smooth and rich and feels so good</li>
    <li> I like that it feels light weight but not light enough that you don&#x27;t feel like you have to put on moisturizer. You just need to put a small size onto your hand and it covers your face. I also like that it is not greasy. It goes on smooth and it feels weightless. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using a couple of Foxbrim products so I don&#x27;t know if they are all working together but I feel like I am seeing less wrinkles on my forehead. Less wrinkles is always a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it is environmentally conscious. It isn&#x27;t tested on animals and the bottle can be recycled. I love that! I don&#x27;t get why Olay Regenerist can&#x27;t come in a recyclable bottle like Foxbrim does!</li>
    <li> This is really helping me to remove some dark spots on my skin. Exfoliate, tone &amp; apply this next. Very recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days and honestly I got pimples in my face that I didn&#x27;t have before. I&#x27;m still trying to use it for a few more days maybe my skin needs to get use to the new product but for sure I&#x27;m not trying more than a couple of days because I&#x27;m afraid this can get worse. Whatever happens I&#x27;ll be back to post.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion is a hydrating facial moisturizer that uses essential vitamins in restorative skin care. With daily use, my skin was more moisturized and youthful feeling then before. I really loved how it felt so light weight on my skin and it also didn’t leave my foundation feeling heavy. I have a oily t-zone, so it’s hard for me to find a moisturizer that will balance out my skins natural oils without it making my skin break out. I have been using this moisturizer for a few days now and I’ve noticed a huge difference on the elasticity on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key ingredients in Foxbrim’s Vitamin C Lotion are Vitamin C (15%), Aloe Vera, MSM, Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil and Green Tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is formulated for all skin types so you can use it without worrying that your skin will breakout. This antioxidant blend fights sun spots and discoloration on your skin, as well as reduces wrinkle formation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim offers it’s customers a risk free money back guarantee. If you are unsatisfied with your products results, Foxbrim will provide you with a full refund. What have you got to lose?</li>
    <li> Omgoodness. Is that me or Peter pan in the mirror!</li>
    <li> The pump on the bottle makes it easy to get exactly the right amount of lotion for each application. The bottle says it can be used as all-over moisturizer and I did try it once on my body, but will continue to use it on my face only.</li>
    <li> As a person with oily skin is hard to find a product that hydrates without making my face excessively oily. I finally found a product that does this without leaving my face with an oily feel,best thing about it that it hydrates my skin for almost the whole whole day which is pretty good for a lighweight moisturiser . Also the customer service from this company is amazing. I got my package stolen when i purchase this and they send me a replacement bottle free off charge. While i haven&#x27;t use this bottle long enough to see the results from the vitamin c and other ingredients,  this lotion has  no irritant ingredients and is fragrance free.  so the only thing this lotion can do, is make my skin  feel and look feel better with all the beneficial  ingredients it contains.products  with fragrance are horrible, if  you use products with fragrance youre causing more damage to your skin than you are helping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how confident this company is with there money back guarantee, that really tells me something about this company and there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thoughts this is a great lightweight moisturizer and i&#x27;m happy i purchase it. I recommend anybody looking for a product like this to give this a shot. Fragrance free and not one ingredient is a irritant,the worse it can do is make your skin look a little better with all the beneficial ingredients it contains.</li>
    <li> I tried the cream and started breaking out around the chin and nose.&lt;br /&gt;This EXPENSIVE cream is nothing special and I returned it!</li>
    <li> Terrific lotion - loved how it made my skin feel</li>
    <li> Foxbrim has done it again! This time they&#x27;ve created a lightweight moisturizer that can be used both on the face *and* on the body. It is safe for use on all skin types, but especially tolerable for sensitive skin that is easily irritated by additives and more aggressive ingredients. This Vitamin C Moisturizer is natural and organic, providing great antioxidant protection and increased cell turnover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C&#x27;s greatest strength, when used topically and on a routine basis, is its ability to lighten pigmentation and fade dark spots. While treating the discoloration in the skin, it also prevents wrinkle production.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Foxbrim&#x27;s Vitamin C formula has 8-fold antioxidant protection. The Aloe makes your skin soft, smooth and is my #1 favorite ingredient to hydrate the skin without clogging pores. What adds that lovely and healthy glow is the addition of MSM. Jojoba oil is great for evening out skin tone. I could go onp but the best way to truly discover all of the amazing benefits is to try the cream out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle arrived containing 1.7 oz/ 50 ml, in a white plastic bottle. The directions say to use a dime sized amount and gently massage the moisturizer into the skin until absorbed. Once it has dissipated, you can apply your SPF and make up in the AM for a smooth palate or drift off to sleep in the PM.</li>
    <li> Fantastic moisturizer. Love the fact that you can use it on the face and on the body. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very smooth, absorb quickly, like it</li>
    <li> Love it! I have sensitive, dry skin and most facial lotions seem to evaporate soon after applying but with this my skin feels hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to review this product free of charge in exchange of my honest opinion. The product goes on smooth and without any odor, it makes your skin feel the same way --- soft and smooth. It feels like a heavy rich cream but once it’s on, its well absorb into the skin and it adds moisture your face. A nice characteristic is that it doesn’t overwhelm your skin. I like the lotion’s natural ingredients: it has aloe, jojoba oil, vitamin C, palm oil, sunflower oil, and shea butter, I think that’s what makes this product rich but lightweight at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I’ve used several lotions that seem like a great match for my skin, but once used them, my skin doesn’t feel right. This product is different and I would recommend the product to anyone that has dry skin, or need to hydrate their skin back to good healthy moisture.  Also remember that the product comes with a 100% full refund.</li>
    <li> AS a senior citizen, I need all the help I can find for &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; skin.  I can already see improvement after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face very soft. Definitely will buy again when I run out. Great product</li>
    <li> Horrible! I bought this based on reviews and it&#x27;s horrible. Made my skin so much worse. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works great, non-greasy</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the look and feel of my skin after using this moisturizer. My skin is hydrated and refreshed. Very absorbing and lightweight cream that&#x27;s perfect for day pr night.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim has such an amazing line of products that I&#x27;m in love with. Which is why I was thrilled to have the opportunity to test out the Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion. I just love the way this lotion feels. The naturalness, the vitamin C and the lightweight texture that moisturizes my skin. Even while it tackles the tuff tasks like lightening the dark spots under my eyes and just evening out my skin tone. Your skin is so worth the ingredients!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is a great thing for your skin and Foxbrim has combined that with Jojoba, Shea Butter, Aloe and Green Tea which are all great skincare ingredients to create a great lotion to help moisturize and repair your skin.  I have tested several Foxbrim products and I have become quite a fan and would definitely try and recommend any of their skincare products to anyone.  One of the best things about the company is that they are cruelty-free and all are made in the USA :)  They are always natural and organic so I always know I am getting the highest quality available.  Plus Foxbrim always offers their FULL money-back guarantee.  They ship quickly and are nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion comes in a 1.7 oz bottle with a pump on top so that you can get whatever amount you want, but it takes very little to get the job done.  This bottle will last you at least a few months if you use the recommended dime-size amount every day.  I have very complex skin - my face is oily on the top and yet very dry on my chin and neck area.  But this worked for both places and it is not oily.  It is a nice lightweight creamy lotion and absorbs quickly but leaves your skin feeling so soft and fresh.  I have tried almost every lotion on the market and this is the best moisturizing lotion yet for me.  Try it and see what you think :)  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Good facial moisturizer &amp; all natural too.</li>
    <li> Only been using this about a week but I am noticing my skin is repairing itself and it feels hydrated, I really like this stuff but there is not very much lotion in that little bitty half bottle</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement with any dark spots but it&#x27;s an overall good moisturizer. I use it every morning before I apply my makeup. It&#x27;s lightweight and not oily at all. I like that it keeps my have feeling hydrated and soft. I would&#x27;ve loved to see more a dramatic difference with the spots on my face but maybe that&#x27;ll just come with more usage.</li>
    <li> This lotion left my skin feeling great, smooth and it is lightweight so I don&#x27;t feel like my face is weighed down with a greasy moisturizer. The smell is not the best though. I thought it would smell a little bit better, but a few minutes after application I don&#x27;t notice the smell anymore.</li>
    <li> We had the chance to review Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion for free, The review is our own opinion. My wife and I have both gotten hooked on all these Vitamin C products that we have been able to use and review. This one was a little different, but the results were the same. My feet are rough from all the hard work I do. I decided to try this product on my feet. I put the Vitamin C lotion on my feet before I go to bed. After a few days, I noticed the roughness is replaced with much softer, normal feeling feet. It works great. Now I have a product that I can use to keep the roughness off my feet. It also makes it so those areas on my feet no longer itch. If you have read any of my reviews, you know I love Foxbrim product.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s fragrance-free and that it contains ingredients you don&#x27;t usually find in other moisturizers, like Vitamin C and Jojoba Oil. Not only am I using it but my husband too. My hands felt softer and smoother after the application and it&#x27;s not greasy like other lotions. I love that it&#x27;s not &#x27;thick&#x27; so it doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks after the application on hands and face. With new products we test it first on our arms to see and gladly, no rashes! :) I hope it comes in bigger and more affordable bottle.</li>
    <li> I LOVED the review you just left us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! My mother in law is now officially hooked this goes on nicely and firms. Defiantly a good serum to have in your facial products. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> excellent -  hydrating. light  - skin feels and looks better</li>
    <li> Really like this lotion makes my face feel really smoothed  just don&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I received this lotion and have been using it for the past week or so. It certainly has a different feel to it. Once it is applied to the skin it soon soaks in and leaves your skin feeling as if you had no lotion on. It does not leave a greasy/lotion feeling to it like most lotions do. With that being said. I don&#x27;t have any negative thoughts about it, I am not use to applying lotion without the end result leaving your skin/face with a texture that something is on there.</li>
    <li> i like this product, my skin was getting smooth and looking young. i love it</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing.  I add frankincense essential oil to this lotion.</li>
    <li> It was a light scent. A little bit goes a long way. It spreads evenly and doesn&#x27;t dry too fast that your skin feels uneven. But it does absorb and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and greasy.</li>
    <li> it works well for my skin and last for long time</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  A little goes aomg way.  However. I do have dry skin and use this occasionally but since I have dry skin I&#x27;m saving it for summer.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different items this one seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of any product I have bought, ever. I felt like I needed to write one about this product because of how amazing it is. I&#x27;ve been using it as a day and night moisturizer for two days now and my acne scars are less visible and I wake up with a glowing face. I have been using natural and organic products for a while, I was using Christina&#x27;s organic moisturizer which I also got off of Amazon .. which worked really well but after a few purchases I wanted to try something different. So based on good reviews I bought this one and honestly I will be buy it again and again. It looks great under makeup, it does not make your face oily.. It&#x27;s perfect consistency. I am so happy to have found this product and highly recommend it to anyone who has dry skin with any type of scarring. I am 26 years old and my skin looks more radiant, refreshened and moisturized in using this product in just 2 days. I want to thank all of the reviewers who take time to write reviews because I rely upon them for purchasing anything makeup or face related. Try this product !!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, works great for my dry skin and not greasy, the only thing is that it runs out in 3 weeks with everyday use.  wish they had a bigger size</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for its simplicity and effectiveness!  I wear a lot of make up during the day, so at night when all the junk is washed off, I love spreading this natural face moisturizer all over.  It&#x27;s clean, has no irritating perfumey smell, and feels great on your skin.  With the incredibly reasonable price tag, you don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; it, you can be generous and apply to your neck and the back of your hands too.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and I have had acne issues after giving birth to my 2nd daughter 9 years ago. I started using this moisturizer 2 months ago. It&#x27;s thick but not greasy. It feels really nice on my face and neck. I didn&#x27;t think much about it at first. I wash my face every morning in the shower with Ceravi Foaming facial cleanser and a Dermabrush facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, I just started to notice how smooth my face feels. No new breakouts. The acne has not disappeared completely but I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have any new pimples or bumps. I COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Vit C lotions, and found them to be similar. Except when trying this one, I would give it an edge over the others. Light, creamy, and not overly greasy this Vit C Lotion feels great going on, and actually makes my face feel baby smooth. A must to add to your skin care collection!</li>
    <li> I rate this one of the best creams I have applied to my skin .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t greasy straight off, but is not too matte that my oil glands overcompensate by going into overdrive, which leaves me greasy enough to fry an egg on my forehead. This Vitamin C Lotion is perfect! It has a wonderfully soft texture that glides on my skin, superb absorption, leaving my face moisturized but not overly. I LOVE it! Seller is GREAT, too!</li>
    <li> Really love this product,, it comes quick wrapped and sealed pretty secure... nice texture... it doesn&#x27;t have an orange scent like some reviews i&#x27;ve read but the smell isn&#x27;t bad... absorbs fast... i got it to kind of get a summer glow,, brighter skin,, i do think that it&#x27;s making it look younger, my skin feels softer so good product...</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion. Absorbs nicely, no over  powering smells and it leaves my face beautifully mosturized with a dewey glow. Ive only been using this for a few days so i cant wait to see the long term effects :)</li>
    <li> Foxbrim sent me this lotion to review for my blog GlamRiver.  I am a huge fan of all things Foxbrim so when they sent me this lotion to test out I was pretty happy!  This is the first Vitamin C lotion I have tried, you usually see Vitamin C in serum form.  So far, I really love this lotion.  It&#x27;s lightweight and works perfectly under makeup.  In the few weeks that I have been using it, it has helped lighten a few of my spots plus I have also noticed some improvement on my fine lines!&lt;br /&gt;As usual, Foxbrim does not disappoint!! :)  Another great product!</li>
    <li> This works very well. As I age my skin gets dry and this handles it. It is not greasy, a little goes a long way. The product is packaged very well. It is a good product, I am quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a healthy, radiant shine&lt;br /&gt;-I use it exclusively for my face and it is one of the better moisturizers I have used&lt;br /&gt;-6/10 for oiliness&lt;br /&gt;-Wakes me up in the morning after face washing or a shower&lt;br /&gt;-Easy applicator&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your face moisturized for the whole day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-A little oily, may not be good for people who are prone to acne</li>
    <li> This really is an amazing lotion that makes my skin feel so amazing while also being so good for my skin since its infused with so many vitamins and nutrients! It had a delightful scent and an incredible texture. I would definitely reccomend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I really love the lotion, it feels good on my face, gives my skin a little glow.  4 stars only because I wish it was in a jar, so much is wasted in pump containers.  I will buy again, it is a nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. For the price, this is a steal.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion feels fresh</li>
    <li> 1) Great for combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Friendly ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Extra nice dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Can be a bit too thick on extra hot days.&lt;br /&gt;On these days, I add a splash of water and that does the trick.</li>
    <li> Small amount for the &#x27;Sale&#x27; price. Nice lotion. Left my face shiney.</li>
    <li> I have to say I saw this on amazon with all its five stars and I was skeptical. I thought this company was either paying people for their five star reviews or they had people leaving fake reviews who never even bought it. Well people this is the real deal and has performed a miracle on my skin! I am a real person and you can see all my reviews and determine that for yourself! I have suffered from acne my whole life! I have used everything for acne! I am like a lab rat who has been through all the cosmetic and skincare packages and all the latest raves. You name it and I have tried it! from all natural remedies to everything you can buy at a drug store, salon, and the internet. After years of trial and error I found the best cleanser which is Nippon Kodo Deitanseki Soap it keeps my acne to a minimal I feel it clean my skin like nothing I have ever used. However, it did dry my skin out pretty bad (you can buy Nippon here on amazon). With that being said I had been using a oil free moisturizer which was working alright for me. Did it stop my acne? No, but it did rehydrate my dry skin after a couple applications. Its not like I needed a moisturizer I figured my acne was the best it was gonna get. Then I was talking to a friend who spends thousands of dollars on skincare and cosmetics. He buys the top of the line like La Mer. What&#x27;s La Mer well a moisturizer from them for a 16.9 oz is $2k. Yes two thousand dollars for a moisturizer!? the smallest bottle is .5oz and is $80?!?!  He told me that the most important part of skin care is the moisturizer  (Note he does not suffer from acne) This whole time I figured it was the cleanser since I suffer from acne I assumed he was wrong. Everyone has a different skin types right? Over my course of acne products I have found that the best things for myself is organic or all natural things because mother nature knows best and it does not have any of the crazy chemicals in it that damage your skin and health in the long run. I saw this moisturizer and said its all natural and all the ingredients are supposedly good for acne so why not give it a try since the moisturizer I had been using was not all natural. I thought it was gonna be waste. I have been using this for little under a month. I put it on my face in one application and my face feels like its been rejuvenated and hydrated! and the best part is it has made my acne (combined with Nippon soap) non existent. I have complete clear skin in the first time in my entire life!!!! You think that&#x27;s the best part? on top of that It has faded my Acne Scars on my cheeks!!?! I thought my scars would never go away! I&#x27;ve read that to heal scars takes months upon months. I did not expect to see results let alone results within a month! This stuff is a miracle! It has done what I thought was impossible and has made me confident in my skin again and changed my life! I hope Foxbrim never changes the ingredients or hikes the price up cause I will buy this for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE--&lt;br /&gt;2/8/2016&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to leave an update and say I continue to use this product. Also wanted to leave some more advice.&lt;br /&gt;1. I found another product that GUARANTEES AN ACNE FREE LIFE it is Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar! I drank that twice a day (dilute it in water with two teaspoons per glass of water) I kept that up for about two months and the results were amazing!! My skin was perfect! I had 100% no breakouts no cystic acne nothing! Not to mention I felt overall in better health! I had a good clean energy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The key to this product as with any other product is it must be used consistently!! If I skip one night and do not wash my face with my  Nippon Kodo Deitanseki Soap and do not put this Foxbrim Vit. C Lotion on I will have a breakout!! It will creep up on me within the next three days of skipping my regimen. You are probably wondering why I only used Braggs AV for two months. I got lazy and stopped taking my Braggs and then stopped washing my face consistently and I started to breakout again. I am human forgive me. Like I said Consistency is the key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Drink lots of water to stay hydrated it will benefit your skin and health (try to stay away from tap water and used filtered water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. HAIR PRODUCTS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON ACNE!! (I know you are annoyed with my all caps and horrible grammar) I don&#x27;t care how many times I read online that hair products do not effect your acne. That is a complete utter lie. Most likely an marketing scheme to make people buy any hair product even if they have acne prone skin. I have been using Pomade for my hair Uppercut Pomade which has a great hold on my hair for that comb over look or slick back with my undercut. I thought at last I found a hair product that works for my cowlick that is right on my forehead. Then reality kicks in and I have horrible cystic acne breakouts off and on when I use this product. I use a lot close to my forehead to tame my cowlick and all the frizz. So obviously this might not be the case with you and your own personal hair products. I just wanted to point out to everyone that if you suffer from acne you need to be conscience with what product you are using in your hair (I love uppercut and still use it but I am in the search of a new organic pomade which I have found to no avail! I will update when I found one that works for acne prone skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading everyone I will update if need be in the future!hing my face consistently and I started to breakout again.

    <li> I loved this lotion it made my hands feel so soft and smooth and it was not greasy like many other lotion brands just a small amount goes a long way and I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone the shipping and the company were great too! If you want a great lotion that actually works and helps your skin stay soft and not dry out I would suggest you give this product a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quality product. The ingredients list consists of some great stuff, and I like the addition of MSM (sulfur) which is not a thing too many companies are doing right now. My face feels fairly hydrated with use, and the product has a pleasant creamy smooth consistency. The scent is very minimal, which is ideal for men who don&#x27;t want to smell like perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with the product would be the expensive price for what you get (very small bottle). I would definitely only recommend it for use on your face, unless you like spending tons of cash.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the feel of this lotion. I think it&#x27;s working great. I&#x27;ve had friends comment about my skin so seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. I apply it at night and my skin feel soft and supple in the morning. Does not feel greasy or sticky; perfect texture. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are smaller too, which makes my skin look radiant. Absolutely love this product...</li>
    <li> excellent product! super moisturizing and not oily. I use it twice a day and have been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the results of this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I  have been using this product for about five days so It is difficult to give a total review on this lotion... However so far I like the feel of it on my skin and my face feels more hydrated than other lotions I have used...I liked how Foxbrim responded to  me in a short  period of time to make sure I received my product and explained the ingredients and how to use it.... The company seems very proud of what they produce....I feel good about using this lotion. and believe me I have had a lot of experience purchasing moisturizers and spending significant amounts of money... ..I didn&#x27;t get  any reaction and my skin feels soft and healthy already... Everyones skin is different with different needs but I would say to try it.. It is definitely worth the price.  Also Amazon is great and  I think they are  exceptional  in giving small businesses the opportunity to introduce their products to the public..and for us  to try them.</li>
    <li> Recently switched to a more natural face regimen and this fits in perfectly. Am loving it so far been a good run no breakouts in past week which I attribute to the vitamin and oil regime versus chemical agents for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> After 3 week+ of using this product.. I would say it works wonderful on and for my skin type (sensative) another plus its not sweet at all.. Only gripe i have is that is not offer in a larger size..</li>
    <li> Nice and light, it absorbs fast and seems to be helping me receive those &amp;#34;you look about 27 or 28&amp;#34; comments from younger women still...so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a win.</li>
    <li> Noticed a big difference on my face and neck, will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love this for my super sensitive skin and hyper pigmentation. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked with very dry skin.  I have very dry skin from a medicine I&#x27;m taking and this has done the trick.</li>
    <li> This item had rave reviews so I decided to give it a try. This has been a very difficult winter for the skin...extremely cold temps and drying heat...Nevertheless, after using this item 2 times a day for several weeks now, I see none of the results that others spoke of in their reviews. It is a light weight cream with a pleasant feel and smell. It absorbs well with no greasy residue but the results were not evident on my skin.</li>
    <li> It appears to be ok, but I need a little more time to give a true evaluation, but I will give it a 4 star, because I have seen some improvement on my skin.</li>
    <li> Nice texture, but not the right ingredients for my skin.  I have some red spots and it didn&#x27;t help at all.  Otherwise my skin is pretty normal.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Vitamin C Lotion is a super moisturizer that combines Vitamin C, Aloe Vera, MSM, Shea Butter, Jojoba Oil, and Green Tea to help heal and rebuild your skin while evening out skin tone.  I was really excited to try it out. Most lotions I use my skin feels oily after using it later on in the day. I use it on my face and it felt refreshed. I loved how instead of my skin feeling dry it felt soft all day long. My face feels smooth  soft and moist day lonh. I put the lotion on every morning and night for a week.  I also placed some lotion on my three year olds face for the past few days I noticed the acne on her face cleared up. I am definitey going to recommend this lotion. I really love this lotion. Its a fantastic buy.  I recently receieved this lotion from Foxbrim for free for my unbiased opinion. I can honestly say this as far is a great lotion to purchase. I also loved the fact this product is not tested on animals. I am a big animal lover and its hard to find a lotion not tested on animals</li>
    <li> My skin became so oily, irritated and developed acne and some red patches; had stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Skin is soft and feels great.</li>
    <li> All of Foxbrim&#x27;s products are fantastic and this is no exception. I received a reviewer promo for this and adore it; it is gentle and my complexion looks brighter when I use it. Used in conjunction with the serum it is very effective for brightening and moisturising.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion for the face. This lotion is wonderful and it doesn’t have a smell to it. It comes in a pump bottle and it even has a small tab at the opening. I like this extra small tab because I feel that it is more sanitary. The lotion applies on easily and it is convenient to take on the go. However, this lotion does take about a min or so to fully absorb into the skin. This lotion leaves my skin feeling moisturized in the morning. This lotion contains Vitamin C, green tea, and more beneficial ingredients for the skin. I have normal skin and this lotion doesn’t bother it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC: I was sent this Face Lotion through Tomoson. All reviews are written with 100% honesty from my own perspective. #foxbrim</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use this product on more then just my face, I use on my arms, hands, legs and feet. It&#x27;s very lightweight and moisturizer very well and does not dry out like other lotions and you don&#x27;t need a lot. I need for the company to make a bigger bottle!!!!  Great lotion for the summer too and doesn&#x27;t smell.  This will be my best friend for the summer!  Thank you for a great product to try for free from the company</li>
    <li> Incredible Product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now and my skin has never looked better. My skin is clearer and brighter, and my pores are far less visible. I use it in the morning and evening, it is incredibly smooth and absorbs quickly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful skin. I&#x27;m so impressed with this brand I just ordered the eye cream!</li>
    <li> Thisi s a very nice lotion. I really like Foxbrim! It&#x27;s a great company. This lotion is very smooth.</li>
    <li> did not realize such a small bottle...not enough to last long enough to see if there is a difference</li>
    <li> Good product will buy again</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic! It leaves my skin feeling so soft! I like to use some on my hands too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several days now and have been very pleased.  I have sensitive skin and so far no breakouts.  The lotion absorbs quickly and feels lightweight.  It&#x27;s not oily at all which is exactly what I need living in a humid climate.  Looking forward to trying other Foxbrim products!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a slight citrus undertone to it.  It feels great on my face.  I have sensitive skin and it did not bother my skin at all.  I wish this had a built in sunscreen, but if I put it on under my makeup then I am covered.  It was not greasy feeling at all.  I really like this product.  Just note that the bottle seems quite small, but since you only use a little bit at a time, it should last awhile.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a week, started to get redness and some breakouts which never happened with my other facial lotion.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and one can apply makeup not long after using. The company which makes this, too, really does back up its product.</li>
    <li> When I had the option to try out Foxbrim skincare products in return for a product review I first looked into the products themselves.   The ingredients are wonderful and, most important for me, the products are cruelty free, so I decided to give them a try.   The Vitamin C lotion has lovely aloe and jojoba oil along with lots of other natural products to nourish the skin.   A small amount goes a very long way.  The lotion is very gentle on the skin and absorbs quickly leaving no greasy residue just soft moisturized skin.   I use it along with the Orange Blossom Water Toner and the Hyaluronic Acid and I can honestly say my skin is softer, and brighter and the little white bumps I had are gone.   I am very pleased with the products and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I love how this lotion feels. It isn&#x27;t greasy on the skin and is definitely taking care of my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin during the fall and winter months, so I couldn’t have received this lotion at a better time. I love the bottle the lotion comes in with it’s easy push down button. There is not an over powering smell with the lotion either, which is absolutely perfect for someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the lotion every single day as part of a regimen for a few days now and I can already see results. My skin stays smooth all day long without it being oily or dry at the end of the night!! I was EXTREMELY impressed due to the fact that I work in a factory that gets cold and the air is very dry inside. I definitely plan on keeping this lotion in my regimen since the results are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to anyone that suffers from dry skin or anyone that just wants to treat their skin to an amazing lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Foxbrim products because none of their products that I have tried has ever disappointed me. I use their Vitamin C Facial Moisturizer in conjunction with another serum and it has truly worked wonders on my irritated and dry skin. This product has truly been a life saver, specially here in Texas where there’s little to no humidity. It’s perfect for protecting, pampering and keeping your skin/face beautiful and well hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> The total BOMB! My skin feels fresh and hydrated. I love this product and will come back for more TYVM!!!</li>
    <li> Works very well with the ultra lift. Good result and been using it and the ultra lift for a month now. Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> Havent used it but a few times. Softens skin. No irritation. Will update soon.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic. I am trying to figure out how I can acquire a large enough amount to use as a body lotion. It is truly a wonderful product and lives up to the manufacture&#x27;s claims.</li>
    <li> Feels really good on my skin and keeps it moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels so good on your face.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, based on the ingredients and the reviews. It didn&#x27;t deliver for me. I have extremely sensitive skin, and this product freaked my skin right out. Broke me out pretty bad, and even stung when I put it on. Which I thought was really strange, because most lotions do not sting my skin...</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer - goes on easily and isn&#x27;t the least bit greasy.</li>
    <li> This is an antiahing lotion with all the great ingredients that help fight aging. I have been using it on my hands and decolte, and I like how my skin absorbs the product. It does not include any perfume or questionable ingredients such as parabens. I like the fact that the major ingredient is vitamin C. %15 is a pretty good amount of vitamin C for a lotion. There are other natural ingredients such as MSM, green tea, and jojoba oil in this product. I hope it fades a couple of dark spots on my hands and chest. I use it twice a day, in the morning and afternoon. This frequency is sufficient to keep my skin moist all day.  Note: The product is provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> best lotion ever, and at a great price. i have dry skin and a few fine lines and cannot live without this lotion. my skin is clear, tight, smooth and even!</li>
    <li> Love it. My face gets super dry when I switch lotions (sensitive skin). But I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and my face is really soft and supple, possibly younger looking, we will see. Its a thicker lotion but it goes on light.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s so refreshing and makes my skin feel great</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION!!  IT GOES ON SMOOTH AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE MY SKIN FEELING GREASY.  I USE IT UNDER MY MAKEUP AND BEFORE I GO TO BED.  I CAN ALREADY SEE MY FINE LINES GOING AWAY.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Will never use another face lotion</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on light and non greasy, works well under makeup</li>
    <li> LOVE it!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
</ol>
