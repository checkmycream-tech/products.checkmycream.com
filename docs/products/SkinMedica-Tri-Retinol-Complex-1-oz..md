      <li>retinol is a strong cream if used straight.  </li>
      <li>This is the best Retinol available, it isn&#x27;t harsh, like Obagi, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but applied nightly, I can see the difference this makes in my complexion - have been using Skin Medica&#x27;s products for years and wouldn&#x27;t try anything else, even as a free sample.</li>

      <li>First-</li>
      <li>am sure my 75 year-old-skin would have double the aging issues that I experience now&lt;</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It really does what it claims to do.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how much my skin has improved using this product once daily at night.&lt;br /&gt;It has radically diminished a large pore that I was concerned about.</li>
      <li>old.</li>
      <li>really good looking FAKE Counterfeits.</li>

<li> On my first and only application I broke out with a serious rash that a week later I am still dealing with.  </li>

<li> I have used this a long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dermotologist recomended this product to me and I bought it from her about four months ago, and liked it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it emptied out in record time.  So, I unscrewed the top and to my dismay (and shock) there is a FAKE BOTTOM about 1/4 down in the bottle.  The tube to the top is less then an inch, because there is no product anywhere except in the very top.  RIP OFF!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should not be selling a product like this.  Buyer Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. 1/25/14:  I rated this only 1 star because I was so upset about being conned.  Still, the real project is worth 5 stars and is excellent.  Even though the product I was sent deserves no stars, this  is still a review for the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product, so I am going to up my rating to 3 stars.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I wanted to remove a negative reveiw I originally wrote about this seller, but I can&#x27;t seem to find my original review. Anyway, while it took multiple tries on my part to get the seller to take care of sending me the wrong product, this seller did finally come through. I now have the retinol complex. I love this product. I doesn&#x27;t burn my face, yet my friends and family are telling me my skin looks better.</li>
    <li> This product was not 1.0 grade retinol, but 0.65. Returned item.</li>
    <li> Concerned that the products are old seem to have a yellow color to them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last year. It works well on my skin and improve the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle and I use it every evening on my face. I am 60 and find that my face skin seems to be drying out, and in using this creamy Retinal my face feels even and smooth. (I used to have T-zone oily skin). I am very satisfied using this and when I run out I notice my face dries out right away. Highly recommend, very nice product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  A significant difference in my skin after using on a regular basis.  Wonderful in conjunction with other Skin Medica products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Retin A. My face feels plumper when I use it and so on. I have used Proactiv before, and felt that the Repairing Lotion (Step 3 in the 3 part kit) works better than this product. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.</li>
    <li> Love it love it and love it ! Great texture on the face and neck. I truly see a big difference in the tone of the face and neck. Great stuff !</li>
    <li> To expensive to continue use. There are other products with growth factors now.</li>
    <li> The Skinmedica Retinol complex is fantastic. Worth every penny and would highly recommend it. Product arrived at my front door within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time.  Helps keeps the fine lines a little less noticeable. And that&#x27;s the way it is.</li>
    <li> This is the best Retinol available, it isn&#x27;t harsh, like Obagi, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but applied nightly, I can see the difference this makes in my complexion - have been using Skin Medica&#x27;s products for years and wouldn&#x27;t try anything else, even as a free sample.</li>
    <li> retinol is a strong cream if used straight.  it causes redness and once i even had dark lines on my neck as a result.  i have discovered that skinmedica&#x27;s retinol complex is gentle yet effective.  retinol is one of the musts for aging skin.</li>
    <li> good product  good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the sun a lot! Got this product from a medical spa and LOVE it.  Skin looks great!  Their tip - either store upside down or before using turn upside down and tap it a few times to your palm to get it to flow well.</li>
    <li> Terrific product  Use with Skin Medica serum</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> This is another product that was recommended by my plastic surgeon. My skin looks great. Use at bed time. Put over your tns complex.</li>
    <li> The pump is not efficient enough to pump out a usable quantity of cream... very frustrating and time consuming :(</li>
    <li> This stuff works! Use it 1-2 times a week at first just to get used to it. It helps with wrinkles and with clogged pores. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is excellent skin care! It was recommended to me by a skin specialist- and she was 100% correct in her assessment. It rejuvenates, moisturizes and creates a smooth, silky skin texture.</li>
    <li> DID  NOT receive the right product. I got 1% strength and ordered the .65. There is a very big difference in the strengths, even though same manufacturer and product line.</li>
    <li> As in my last review of this same product, I am hooked on it.  Best skin product yet.  Since I buy it every few months along with other products of Skinmedica, I would rather not have to review the product after each buy.</li>
    <li> This product is gentle enought to use daily and still offer great results.  My skin looks amazing with no irriations.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> No allergic reaction, no drying out, skin pores get smaller and skin appears smoother, like a 29 yr. old. I have used many retinols but this one agrees with my skin and I like it</li>
    <li> Retinol is a scientifically proven product to keep wrinkled skin at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Skinmedica is the finest source of cosmetic care I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure my 75 year-old-skin would have double the aging issues that I experience now&lt;br /&gt;if I were not a daily user of Skinmedica products!</li>
    <li> Ignoring the Reviewer who cried &amp;#34;counterfeit!&amp;#34; I ordered this product and then the same from Skinmedica directly.  The bottles ARE completely different!  The Amazon version has a metal base and two pin holes in the bottom, as well as a smaller diameter, shorter height and skewed text on the label.  Buyer Beware!  Either Skinmedica manufactures two types of bottles (one professional and one sloppy) or....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since my dermatologist recommended it to me.  I use it only at night with other topical gels.  And  there are different topical gels I use in the morning.</li>
    <li> Buy this and look younger.....I promise</li>
    <li> Too few ounces for my skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Skinmedica Tri Retinol is a DISCONTINUED product and is being shipped as Retinol Complex.  On my first and only application I broke out with a serious rash that a week later I am still dealing with.  I have used other retinol products with no reaction.</li>
    <li> Love this product...seems to strengthen skin, help clear skin, help with fine lines, &amp; does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this a long time. Mit was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really does what it claims to do. It is less irritating than many retinol prducts out there. I went to my plastic surgeon last week, for a procedure, and she said my complexsion was great, the lines around my chin, mouth, and eyes had deminished about 50 to 60%. This purchase was my second.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much my skin has improved using this product once daily at night.&lt;br /&gt;It has radically diminished a large pore that I was concerned about. It has begun&lt;br /&gt;to fade my brown spots which I&#x27;ve had no success doing with any other product I have&lt;br /&gt;used over the past few years. Even 2 deep lines between my brows have softened. All&lt;br /&gt;this in just two weeks! That amazes me. This is also the only product with retinal&lt;br /&gt;that I have ever used and not been irritated by.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Feels awesome on my skin and smells good.  Skinmedica is a great line of products.  I would recommend this line to anyone who has normal to dry skin.</li>
    <li> First- The ingredients are not listed on the carton/box it came in despite, it saying on the bottle/product to look on carton for ingredients.  Weird to receive a high quality product without ingredients anywhere on product or box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second- When I went to the Skinmedica website the bottle used for both of they&#x27;re Retinol Complex do not have a metal bottom like the one in this picture or the one sent to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third- I broke out after using this product for only 2 nights which is odd since i never break out from retinol or tretinoin for that matter and face was perfectly clear prior to using the retinol complex purchased from Savon Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only used twice been in cabinet since, but will be going in the trash. Disappointing, goes to show be careful where you purchase the products from because they can be really good looking FAKE Counterfeits.</li>
