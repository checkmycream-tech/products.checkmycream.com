      <li>I love Dermorganic shampoo &amp; conditioning masque</li>
      <li>I really love this shaping spray.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This hair spray is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I can build up with the Dermorganic spray but it doesn&#x27;t increase hold, just adds more oil.</li>
      <li>This spray is nice and light and blends well yet still holds a style without overkill.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t find a hair spray that like better.</li>
      <li>I live in rainy washington and have had great luck with this spray not being sticky or pasty by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It isnt super strong holding but works good to keep the fly aways back and in place.</li>
      <li>Looks natural and smells great.</li>
      <li>I got this for the organic quality first and was please to find that it has a nice scent and pretty good hold.</li>
      <li>Waiting for the more enviromentally friendly pump version.</li>
      <li>Brushes out easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy to comb through.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have offensive or strong odor.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that never holds.  </li>
      <li>When it came I was thrilled to find it exactly as I wanted, the original product (not a knock off as I had feared).  </li>
      <li>Great product overall.</li>
      <li>The spray has fantastic hold without being sticky.  </li>
      <li>It dries almost immediately and the hold is super strong.</li>
      <li>Ulta is where I found it originally, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s performance is challenged in our hot humid Florida summers but does better than anything else I have tried and does brush thru as it claims.  </li>
      <li>Gives an awesome volume and doesn&#x27;t leave residue unless used too excessively.</li>
      <li>This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used so far, It holds my slick back hairstyle perfectly and it&#x27;s made from organic and natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I use this lightly on my fine, straight hair before using a curling iron.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s really only good for straight styling for me).</li>
      <li>I like my hairspray to be versatile by giving me strong hold when I need it and gentle shaping when I don&#x27;t, depending on how much you need to use for the task.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, short hair.</li>
      <li>It goes on dry, yet holds and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this at a discount store on a whim.  </li>
      <li>Obviously they all love</li>
      <li>The best hairspray for difficult hair.</li>
      <li>stage\\&quot; first ever pony-tail.</li>
      <li>I was nervous about ordering this product at first.  </li>
      <li>Quick dry and also light</li>
      <li>Mid day you can easily run a brush through your hair and respray if needed.</li>
      <li>However, when I wear my hair down and don&#x27;t really need hold, this spray is great for smoothing my hair and adding a nice sheen without looking greasy (although my hair is much less likely to hold a curl or wave when I use this spray</li>
      <li>Holds hair very well</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is natural, organic AND you can actually breathe after you spray your hair</li>
      <li>I started with their shampoo and conditioner and was so pleased I decided to eliminate all of my other hair products and replace them with Dermorganic versions.</li>
      <li>great spray  - better than other dry sprays that are more expensive.</li>
      <li>Just a light spray, let it dry and then use my curling iron.  </li>
      <li>This works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, which I love.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, and will buy again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It seems like every week there is a different shampoo in our shower, sitting closely to the newest conditioner, next to a new beauty soap, by the latest feminine razor, and close to this week&#x27;s preferred shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it holds and it does not have a harsh odor</li>
      <li>I love it and by ordering by subscription, I can keep it on hand without having to search for a store that carries it...and it costs less!</li>
      <li>This is really nice as it has a soft hold and doesn&#x27;t give hair that hard shell like a football helmet feel.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve noticed because of the long name, possibly because of the bright green can, most definitely because my wife sent me to the local drug store where I had to pay $19.95 for this product.  </li>
      <li>weight hair feel very natural .</li>
      <li>Soft to touch on my hair and non-damaging!  </li>
      <li>Very soft, not stiff at all.</li>
      <li>Your hair stays soft.</li>
      <li>I did not think it possible to be the same item I was looking for at such a discounted price than I originally paid in a brick and mortar.  </li>
      <li>A few quick puffs of Dermorganic and</li>
      <li>I only use organic, natural products whenever</li>
      <li>I doubt its any better or worse than Aquanet</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this because I switched up my hair care products after learning of the negative health effects of the toxic ingredients most conventional hairspray products have in them.</li>
      <li>Provides a soft, but long lasting hold, even in humidity.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this spray tends to make my hair too oily &amp; offers hardly any hold even when just pulling my hair back into a ponytail - pieces fall out and little baby hairs peek out in no time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Argon oil in the spray that holds, yet not sticky. Great product. It was shown as a prime shipment, but too over a week to receive.</li>
    <li> Addicted on it! It does not only hold your hair, but also makes it look healthier! All ingredients are organic. I think everyone should buy 3 at once because you won&#x27;t survive without it. I buy travel sides one if I have to travel.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used so far, It holds my slick back hairstyle perfectly and it&#x27;s made from organic and natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this because I switched up my hair care products after learning of the negative health effects of the toxic ingredients most conventional hairspray products have in them.</li>
    <li> Holds hair very well and it&#x27;s safe to use! I usually spray it twice on each section for maximum hold. It doesn&#x27;t leave behind any visible residue either.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, short hair. This works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, which I love. It is hard to find. Ulta is where I found it originally, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore. THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON! It&#x27;s my go-to for products!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;ve seen more than my share of beauty products go through our home. My wife and two daughters see to that.  It seems like every week there is a different shampoo in our shower, sitting closely to the newest conditioner, next to a new beauty soap, by the latest feminine razor, and close to this week&#x27;s preferred shaving cream.  I can&#x27;t even begin to comment on all the makeup and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one thing I&#x27;ve noticed in the past several weeks is the constant use of this Dermoganic Fast Dry Shaping Spray Plus Hold.  Maybe I&#x27;ve noticed because of the long name, possibly because of the bright green can, most definitely because my wife sent me to the local drug store where I had to pay $19.95 for this product.  Obviously they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally didn&#x27;t understand the magic until my wife used it on my \\&quot;ugly stage\\&quot; first ever pony-tail. Lots of wispy blond hair, but not all of it is long enough to gather properly yet. A few quick puffs of Dermorganic and suddenly I look like Norman Bates mother in Psycho. Just in time for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself $5.00 and buy it here.</li>
    <li> I only use organic, natural products whenever I can and I LOVE this product and more specifically the brand. I started with their shampoo and conditioner and was so pleased I decided to eliminate all of my other hair products and replace them with Dermorganic versions. This spray is nice and light and blends well yet still holds a style without overkill. Looks natural and smells great. Check out all of their other products - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve used.  This holds your hair all day without being stiff or sticky.  Doesn&#x27;t have offensive or strong odor.  Brushes out easily.  Would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> It works. It smells good. I doubt its any better or worse than Aquanet but I&#x27;m a sucker for anything &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; in the title and this company was smart enough to put it in their name.</li>
    <li> great spray  - better than other dry sprays that are more expensive.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love, Love. This is great stuff! Very soft, not stiff at all. Mid day you can easily run a brush through your hair and respray if needed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get over the smell...</li>
    <li> I first bought this at a discount store on a whim.  This spray is excellent!  It holds hair without being crunchy or flakey.  It has a pleasant smell too.  This will forever be my go to spray.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair spray plus its organic! Holds hair instantly and when you brush it of with your hand or brush its gone!</li>
    <li> The best hairspray for difficult hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this shaping spray.  I use this lightly on my fine, straight hair before using a curling iron.  Just a light spray, let it dry and then use my curling iron.  It&#x27;s excellent at helping my hair hold a curl.</li>
    <li> This brand is a joke... Not one organic ingredient on any product of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff sucks, just like every other product this brand has.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really loving this hairspray.  I had been using a discontinued Tigi aerosol hairspray that smells amazing, holds great but leaves SO many flakes.  This one has a wonderful hold and doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue.  Great product overall.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this as a styling spray (not a hairspray).  I love it and by ordering by subscription, I can keep it on hand without having to search for a store that carries it...and it costs less!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Wonderful comb-through hold without the crunch or product buildup.  Soft to touch on my hair and non-damaging!  I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Gives an awesome volume and doesn&#x27;t leave residue unless used too excessively. I&#x27;ll use this product as long as they are in the market.</li>
    <li> Great hairspray but this co way over prices it....</li>
    <li> I got this to go with my collection of dermorganic products. I love the way it holds and it does not have a harsh odor</li>
    <li> This is really nice as it has a soft hold and doesn&#x27;t give hair that hard shell like a football helmet feel. I dries instantly as they claim as well.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that never holds.  This product works for me.  I live in rainy washington and have had great luck with this spray not being sticky or pasty by the end of the day.</li>

    <li> Arrived very quickly and is always a great product.  x x x x x x x x x x x</li>

    <li> Best hair spray!!  Also, it is odorless.</li>
    <li> Have been using a lot of hair spray before ,I feel this brand is the best . Quick dry and also light weight hair feel very natural . But not easy to find them.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair spray I use. Your hair stays soft. It is the best hair spray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t find a hair spray that like better. Provides a soft, but long lasting hold, even in humidity. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve inhaled a bunch of toxic chemicals if I accidentally inhale some. My only complaint is you have to apply two or three coats if it&#x27;s humid.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about ordering this product at first.  I did not think it possible to be the same item I was looking for at such a discounted price than I originally paid in a brick and mortar.  When it came I was thrilled to find it exactly as I wanted, the original product (not a knock off as I had feared).  I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> I now have the spray gel, shaping spray as well as this hairspray..  I love the fact that this is natural, organic AND you can actually breathe after you spray your hair</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  It works great.  It&#x27;s performance is challenged in our hot humid Florida summers but does better than anything else I have tried and does brush thru as it claims.  I only left off the 5th star because it is an aerosol.  Waiting for the more enviromentally friendly pump version.</li>
    <li> I got this for the organic quality first and was please to find that it has a nice scent and pretty good hold. It isnt super strong holding but works good to keep the fly aways back and in place.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has great hold, but not too sticky...it also does not dry out my hair like a lot of the other aerosol hair sprays I&#x27;ve tried. And its ORGANIC!</li>
    <li> This hair spray is fantastic!  It goes on dry, yet holds and leaves a nice shine.  Love the smell too!!  And it&#x27;s organic!!  Highly recommend, and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love Dermorganic shampoo &amp; conditioning masque so I was eager to try their hairspray when my Pureology hairspray ran out. I have fine hair and this spray tends to make my hair too oily &amp; offers hardly any hold even when just pulling my hair back into a ponytail - pieces fall out and little baby hairs peek out in no time. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with Pureology. However, when I wear my hair down and don&#x27;t really need hold, this spray is great for smoothing my hair and adding a nice sheen without looking greasy (although my hair is much less likely to hold a curl or wave when I use this spray so it&#x27;s really only good for straight styling for me). I like my hairspray to be versatile by giving me strong hold when I need it and gentle shaping when I don&#x27;t, depending on how much you need to use for the task. I can build up with the Dermorganic spray but it doesn&#x27;t increase hold, just adds more oil. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Every time I used hairspray, of any kind, I would end up with noticeable flakes! I was always so embarrassed but there are days you need to use it. This hairspray is so flexible I can run my fingers through my hair without it flaking or getting it out of shape. It&#x27;s not tacky nor stiff. I absolutely love it!  The only one I will ever use!</li>
    <li> It dries almost immediately and the hold is super strong. Fewer harmful chemicals than most hair sprays too.</li>
