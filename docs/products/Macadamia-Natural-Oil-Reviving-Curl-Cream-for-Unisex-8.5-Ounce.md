      <li>Absolutely dissapointed in this product!!!!</li>
      <li>This is the most important step.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hair every other day or every 2 days to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair is wavy  with medium and fine textures running through it</li>
      <li>It has made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.  </li>
      <li>they are simply fantastic.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>works great on my dry hair.</li>
      <li>I was all excited to try this product because I love the hair masque so much.</li>
      <li>I tried this as a sample with the whole line from a salon, shampoo, moisture rinse, leave in cream, and curl reviving cream, and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair look better.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, as I love the spray oil.</li>
      <li>but I need too many pumps turning into too much product on my hair,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely will be order more:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work great for those with thick, curly hair</li>
      <li>product shipped quickly and was packaged well....</li>
      <li>My hair likes very much Macadamia products!</li>
      <li>Everything in this line is pretty much to moisturize and make your hair healthy and</li>
      <li>This product, that I use in combination with a conditioner of the same brand, is magic !</li>
      <li>and I really need something to control those fine hairs that create an Einstein halo when I diffuse my hair.</li>
      <li>The scent was nice, like the rest of these products, but the rest of the experience left something to be desired.  </li>
      <li>I also use Macadamia brand conditioner and leave-in creme, and I&#x27;m slightly surprised that they don&#x27;t smell the same; but they all have a GREAT smell.   </li>
      <li>She wears her hair naturally and this keeps her looking fabulous!</li>
      <li>I have short wavy hair and it mosturizes it perfectly without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything special .</li>
      <li>so I find this works best on wet hair then let dry.</li>
      <li>and it didnt really leave my hair soft and the volume was huge!</li>
      <li>Smells like a cleaner, not bad but odd, you need a LOT of product to get a nice curl.</li>
      <li>The smell is very intense and yes oil based.</li>
      <li>first and then applying this product over</li>
      <li>silky smooth, soft &amp; bouncy curls.</li>
      <li>and it brings out my curls without that sticky crisp feeling.  </li>
      <li>It was the first time to try it ...</li>
      <li>hair will not get better from one day to the next.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft, and is a light product, best for fine, thin, not so dry types of hair, then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I found my local Tj Maxx carries the macadamia line and most of the products</li>
      <li>But I would say check at a Tj Maxx or Marshalls first.</li>
      <li>this curl cream works great on damp hair if you dry with diffuser or let air dry.</li>
      <li>I only use about 4  pumps of this and it makes my hair look so different, I love it!</li>
      <li>Your hair ends up a little sticky but looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Does not do much for frizz protection.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very manageable without taking the curl out.</li>
      <li>and this really helped during the summer when I wanted to just wash and go.</li>
      <li>It did not help manage my wavy/curly hair&#x27;s frizz much at all.  </li>
      <li>The product was packaged to prevent damage and arrived on time and was reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Since i have very curly hair</li>
      <li>Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair with some odd ringlets here and there, a bit like beachy waves but more curly.</li>
      <li>I have thick wavy hair and this product was very sticky, making it feel rubbery without nice curl definition.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend the brands conditioning masque for use in the shower instead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this product almost a year ago and like most product junkies, forgot I had it. This weekend I reached for it &amp; glad I did.  Like most reviews have already stated, a little bit of this product goes a long way.  I use the LOC method: liquid, oil &amp; creme for the best curl results; this product was my \\&quot;oil\\&quot;.  Applied to the ends of my two strand twist (3B hair) resulted in long lasting, soft, bouncy curls that stood up to sun and wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creamy, lightly scented product is thick and feels slick when applied to damp/wet hair.  Naturally, it takes a little longer for my hair to dry compared to other oils I&#x27;ve used, but not greasy at all.  My curls are actually shiny and very well defined; no frizzies to speak of.  Second day hair was equally awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid considerably more as I purchased at Ulta but I don&#x27;t feel too bad considering my results.  Going forward I will purchase this product again and will probably snatch up a few other products in the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for dry hair, especially on the ends.</li>
    <li> Smells like a cleaner, not bad but odd, you need a LOT of product to get a nice curl. It leaves hair soft, and is a light product, best for fine, thin, not so dry types of hair, then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely dissapointed in this product!!!! I&#x27;ve used the line for years but never the curling lotion. I dried my hair up and made it crunchy which I hate and my curls weren&#x27;t bouncy or even curled at that . I&#x27;ve had better days with not putting anything in it or using an everyday product. So upset overall and ill probably give it away to a friend whose had better results!</li>
    <li> My hair curls beautifully. That is, if I have some sort of product in it; otherwise it poofs out and I look like one of those hooded lizards. This being the case, I have tried LOTS of curling products. Cremes, mousse, gel, etc. This is by far THE BEST product I&#x27;ve used.   The smell is fantastic; faintly citrusy, but not overpowering. I also use Macadamia brand conditioner and leave-in creme, and I&#x27;m slightly surprised that they don&#x27;t smell the same; but they all have a GREAT smell.   The creme itself isn&#x27;t overly sticky when you put it on, and it won&#x27;t leave your neck and shoulders sticky if you have long hair like mine. I have mid-back length hair, and it only takes about a quarter-sized amount to work well, so you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of this stuff.   Of course, the whole reason to buy this product is what it actually does to your hair. The curls that this produces are well-defined, but soft. Unless you accidentally use too much or don&#x27;t work it in well enough, there&#x27;s no crunchiness like there is with a lot of other products. It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair look like it&#x27;s soaking wet the whole day. This creme seriously made me feel like I had movie star hair, and it only took a couple seconds to work the creme in and let it air dry.  Definitely give this product a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  If you find my review helpful, please let Amazon know below!</li>
    <li> Definitely enhance my curls!</li>
    <li> Works ok. If I use on wet hair &amp; don&#x27;t blow dry after (let air dry), then it gets crunchy. Smells ok. Works ok. Since it&#x27;s not great, won&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not anything great.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, as I love the spray oil. This product left my hair very sticky and stiff. My curl were still frizzy, only now parts of them were weighed down by this product.  The scent was nice, like the rest of these products, but the rest of the experience left something to be desired.  I have naturally curly hair, and I have tried just about every product on the market.  Won&#x27;t be trying this one again!</li>
    <li> I was all excited to try this product because I love the hair masque so much. The reviews were great so I gave it a go. What a waste. My curls were crunchy, brittle, and yucky. Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For great curls try Batia &amp; Aleeza Mineral Gel. Amazing stuff. And lasts a lifetime.</li>
    <li> This product had great reviews, so I thought I would try it.  It did not help manage my wavy/curly hair&#x27;s frizz much at all.  It did not make my hair look horrible-  better than if I had not used any hair product, but not better than others that I have used in the past.  I will go back to buying my regular product-  TIGI Bedhead Foxy Curls.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It says in the instructions to use it after shampooing and all so after the shower. I had the idea that it was meant for hold but I was mistaken.Everything in this line is pretty much to moisturize and make your hair healthy and IT WORKS. I used it a few times by itself on my wet hair to style it and it didnt really leave my hair soft and the volume was huge! I didnt use enough product so I didnt get good results. After that I tried using it with the [[ASIN:B002WTC384 Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In Cream, 10 ounces Bottle]] first and then applying this product over and I LOVED the results. My hair was soft and shiny and I finally understood how curly hair could be managable. I use the Macadamia products together except for shampoo and conditioner. I wash my hair every other day or every 2 days to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;I use the products in this order:[[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jar]],[[ASIN:B002NV21DS MACADAMIA OIL by Macadamia Natural Oil: HEALING OIL TREATMENT 4.2 OZ]],[[ASIN:B002WTC384 Macadamia Oil Nourishing Leave-In Cream, 10 ounces Bottle]],[[ASIN:B005HJ4474 Natural Oil Reviving Curl Cream 8.5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I love this product when using it with other Macadamia Natural Oil Products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have TYPE 3B curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Your hair will not get better from one day to the next. Patience is the key and it&#x27;s not just about what you put in it but what you put in your body as well.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product was very sticky, making it feel rubbery without nice curl definition. Didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
    <li> I use this after washing my hair with the macadamia shampoo and using the leave-in cream.  I normally twist my hair and this curl cream assist in keeping my hair twisted.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product it does make your hair curly. I am all natural so I find this works best on wet hair then let dry. Shipment took about a week.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product</li>
    <li> I like that it does not have as many chemicals but I need too many pumps turning into too much product on my hair, although I liked it I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or sticky. The scent is fresh and clean! The product was packaged to prevent damage and arrived on time and was reasonably priced. I would recommend this product to family and friends</li>
    <li> This is my go-to curl cream. It leaves my hair feeling and looking natural. Unfortunately, after washing my hair (multiple times), my hair still feels oily. I&#x27;ve enlisted the help of a clarifying shampoo which seems to help. Given my frizzy hair, though, this product is worth the extra steps.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this stuff.  it works phenominally on her curly hair</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.  Better than any leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> use this daily, I have natural curly hair. works great on my dry hair. always hydrate. I have always been happy with the&lt;br /&gt;Macadamia hair care products</li>
    <li> Such a great product! Disappointing that they have discontinued it... Hopefully Macadamia will reconsider. I bought 4 bottles to hold me over...</li>
    <li> I love macadamia products but this one didn&#x27;t do much for my thick curls. I gave it to my sister. It worked well for her!</li>
    <li> I have long wavy to curly blonde unruly hair. I tried this as a sample with the whole line from a salon, shampoo, moisture rinse, leave in cream, and curl reviving cream, and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair look better.  This is the most important step.  Your hair ends up a little sticky but looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great in my hair.</li>
    <li> As a newbie to natural hair I like this product. It has lasting moisturizing effects. The curls that are created are great. Does not do much for frizz protection.</li>
    <li> i love all of macadamia oil&#x27;s products. they are simply fantastic. this curl cream works great on damp hair if you dry with diffuser or let air dry. silky smooth, soft &amp; bouncy curls. perfect.</li>
    <li> I used to use mousse and hairspray for my wavy/loosely curly hair. But my hairdresser used this on me and it worked just as well, without leaving a build-up residue over time. It&#x27;s kind of like leave-in conditioner, but a lighter formula. It smells wonderful. It gives my curls a softer natural look, not &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; like some gels and mousses can look if you don&#x27;t scrunch them out. My friend with tightly curly hair said it didn&#x27;t work for her though.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this product .... It was the first time to try it ... Didn&#x27;t really seem to do anything special .,, and I don&#x27;t care for the way it smells ..,, seller was great got everything on time . Will use again</li>
    <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
    <li> Macadamia products are awesome! My hair is very wild, dry, and curly. I usually have to use tons of hair gel to get it in to place, but with this cream my hair looks natural-wavy and it doesn&#x27;t get frizzy.</li>
    <li> I researched and researched looking for a curl cream. Pantene used to make one that was very thick and worked to control my hair but they changed the formula. Thought I would give this a try. I would say it has the consistency of a runny, milky, gel or lotion. I&#x27;m tired of companies that advertise their product as a cream when it&#x27;s really just a glorified, liquidy, gel. My hair is wavy  with medium and fine textures running through it and I really need something to control those fine hairs that create an Einstein halo when I diffuse my hair. This did nothing for frizziness for me. In fact I think it made it worse.  The product might work better if one can let their hair dry naturally, but my hair takes about 5 hours to dry. I also ended up with a bit of flakiness. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have short wavy hair and it mosturizes it perfectly without weighing it down. I just spread it through my hair after showering and towel-drying my hair and then let my hair air dry! Love it!</li>
    <li> It was not the same product that I&#x27;d used in the sample packets.  It had an odd after application odor when my hair was exposed to the sun or heat.  P U!</li>
    <li> I like it but I hate the smell. It did help me with my curls... I have 3c curls if you don&#x27;t mind the smell. You  can  also layer it under something else that smells better I would say go for it as that&#x27;s what I did. But I would say check at a Tj Maxx or Marshalls first. I found my local Tj Maxx carries the macadamia line and most of the products are cheaper than what you&#x27;d find online the cost will be a little better as it is kind of expensive here.</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my friend and she loved it. so im going to order it too for myself and try it out</li>
    <li> My hair likes very much Macadamia products! Since i have very curly hair i decided to try this lotion and i love the way it defines my curls, and protecs my hair, i use it every day! It also has UV proteccion!</li>
    <li> This product is great for natural curls - maintains the frizz and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard like many other products, but it is heavy in the hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have naturally curly hair and this really helped during the summer when I wanted to just wash and go. If you have curly hair this is a must buy. I always get my hair done at a Dominican salon in brooklyn and have seen these products for sell in there.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has a nice scent and it brings out my curls without that sticky crisp feeling.  I&#x27;ll definitely will be order more:)</li>
    <li> This stuff works great under the right circumstances -- giving your hair good body and curl. It&#x27;s a bit pricy for my taste (which is why I docked one star), but worth the extra money if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> I like it, makes my hair look almost like I have Gel on and love the smell of it :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to try because I heard good things about it but it was horrible for my hair, it slumped down my curls and made my hair look extremely dry</li>
    <li> I was looking for more of a milk for my curls. This is really thick &amp; leaves hair crunchy. I would highly recommend the brands conditioning masque for use in the shower instead.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff. She wears her hair naturally and this keeps her looking fabulous! I try to keep her in stock as she uses it daily.</li>
    <li> This product, that I use in combination with a conditioner of the same brand, is magic ! I have very long, very dry curly hair. I only use about 4  pumps of this and it makes my hair look so different, I love it!</li>
    <li> I bouught this for my sister and she said that this product keeps her hair soft and curls in tacts.</li>
    <li> that is very good in my damaged hair</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair so soft while still holding my curls.  It&#x27;s almost like the hold of a gel but without looking wet or feeling crunchy!  I have naturally curly hair that can get very frizzy by the end of the day...this products keeps the curls minus the friz!</li>
    <li> I just put a little on and my hair just curls up.  Best product I have found for my wavy hair</li>
    <li> product shipped quickly and was packaged well....however I was looking for a curl cream that was not sticky and this was not it...it does help shape curls and control frizz, however it is sticky and makes hair tangle badly if you sleep with it on</li>
    <li> The smell is very intense and yes oil based. It left my curls stiff. This product is not for me.</li>
    <li> I use it as a hair tamer in the mornings as well as after washing.  Makes my hair very manageable without taking the curl out.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.  I used it on permed hair and there are no frizzes and he smell is lovely!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair with some odd ringlets here and there, a bit like beachy waves but more curly. My hair is also a bit thin which is probably why this product did not work well for me, even when I used the smallest amount I still didn&#x27;t like the greasy look and feel that it had left. I&#x27;m sure it would work great for those with thick, curly hair but unfortunately it just wasn&#x27;t for me :( will not be repurchasing and I don&#x27;t recommend it to those who have hair like mine, you&#x27;re better off with a lighter product.</li>
    <li> The Product was old no scent and did not work, VEERY DISAPPOINTED bad product 😠</li>
