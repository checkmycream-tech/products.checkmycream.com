      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
      <li>You can have a slight sheen with a touch of color or pile it on for a more intense glossy look.</li>
      <li>the smell/taste is pretty gross though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be clear, the colors included are:</li>
      <li>Unopened lip gloss only stays good for approximately three years (depending on the ingredients.)</li>
      <li>It also goes on really slick and smooth, and stays put, lasting a while.  </li>
      <li>I personally tend to gravitate toward glosses that are more sheer and can be worn casually, and this set really fits the bill!</li>

<li> This product does not last long.</li>
<li> does not last long.  </li>
<li> This lipgloss doesn&#x27;t dry your lips</li>
<li> found that its dry and no more applicable and if  fortunately as the applicator come out with some dried product it looks like tooth paste,useles dont buy from this seller and when i wrote the review they are sending me e mails ,why i am not satisfied with this as they have sold thousands,so</li>
<li> I was not able to use this product since the product is 4 years old.</li>
<li> i far prefer my Victorias Secret glosses, they last at last two hours longer, and are cheaper.</li>
<li> Products received were those listed but seems the tubes were all almost halfway empty..</li>
<li> Like another reviewer pointed out, this lipgloss is not really for plumpling up your lips.</li>
<li> not much  color once on lips.</li>
<li> Smashbox lip gloss is expensive and there are a lot of them in the box, with a good color selection (nothing weird or orangey).</li>
<li> No funny tastes or smells.</li>
<li> Not a lot of pigment in these, waste of money.</li>
<li> there isn&#x27;t one in the bunch I wouldn&#x27;t wear and usually in sets like this</li>
<li> there is at least one dud in the bunch.</li>
<li> and i believe it was a fake product or whatever.i</li>
<li> I still am, just disappointed that the product was not as described.</li>

    <li> this was third class product and i believe it was a fake product or whatever.i found that its dry and no more applicable and if  fortunately as the applicator come out with some dried product it looks like tooth paste,useles dont buy from this seller and when i wrote the review they are sending me e mails ,why i am not satisfied with this as they have sold thousands,so the answer is what i feel is what i write,</li>
    <li> does not last long.  not much  color once on lips.</li>
    <li> This product was from 2010. I was not able to use this product since the product is 4 years old. Unopened lip gloss only stays good for approximately three years (depending on the ingredients.) However this reseller did refund me and I appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the color, baby pout, which the description states the package has. I was informed that the baby pout color was discontinued, so when I found a package with it in it, I immediately purchased it. I&#x27;m upset that the color baby pout is not in this package. But I do not have the desire to send the package back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, the colors included are: Pout, luster, tease, candy, aura and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my boss will appreciate this, however, the idea was to have the baby pout color. She cannot find it anywhere and I was excited to give her this. I still am, just disappointed that the product was not as described. I&#x27;m sure she will still use these colors. Just, bummed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Reasonably priced. Would Definately purchase again.</li>
    <li> Products received were those listed but seems the tubes were all almost halfway empty..</li>
    <li> This product does not last long. I like the colors tho.</li>
    <li> The product colors were nice but the sticks to apply three of them broke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super bummed by the quality...nothing like their eyeshadow. i far prefer my Victorias Secret glosses, they last at last two hours longer, and are cheaper.</li>
    <li> Really LOVE the colors --- the smell/taste is pretty gross though.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss set is the bees knees! Definitely a great value for this price! All the colors are really pretty...there isn&#x27;t one in the bunch I wouldn&#x27;t wear and usually in sets like this there is at least one dud in the bunch. Not with this set though! Smashbox&#x27;s lip glosses wear really well and don&#x27;t feel sticky. The color is also buildable. You can have a slight sheen with a touch of color or pile it on for a more intense glossy look. I personally tend to gravitate toward glosses that are more sheer and can be worn casually, and this set really fits the bill!</li>
    <li> smashbox is the best! all thanks to my sister who got me started! I had to buy this pack! its great</li>
    <li> I love Smashbox! Great colors and very nourishing! This lipgloss doesn&#x27;t dry your lips nd isn&#x27;t sticky. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Even though this lip gloss collection was from last holiday season, its still a good deal, and the packaging was never opened before. Smashbox lip gloss is expensive and there are a lot of them in the box, with a good color selection (nothing weird or orangey). I am getting a lot of wear out of them. good value!</li>
    <li> These glosses are all beautiful colors and they are not sticky.  They have almost no color when you put them on.  They do last for about two hours and they are moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is the best lipgloss EVER! I want ten of these sets, there is a color for every occasion! No funny tastes or smells. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
    <li> Beautiful shades.  Stays on very well.  I only use lip gloss and not lipstick so this was a great purchase for me.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; as well as the description suggested.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer pointed out, this lipgloss is not really for plumpling up your lips. But I love snashbox and their brilliant colors. It also goes on really slick and smooth, and stays put, lasting a while.  Thank you Santa...  These were my favorite stocking stuffer this tear!</li>
    <li> I like it ....good product</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great packaging. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good! nice colors! Smell a litle bit sweet. There was a gift, thank you))</li>
    <li> All the colors look the same on.  Not a lot of pigment in these, waste of money.</li>
