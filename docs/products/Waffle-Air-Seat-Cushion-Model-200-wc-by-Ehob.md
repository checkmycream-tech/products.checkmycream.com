      <li>The cushion is very light weight and easy to move from chair to chair</li>
      <li>This product papered to be good at first.</li>
      <li>so I was very happy with how long the 1st one lasted.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to pay $10 a month to keep her comfortable in her very well used wheelchair.</li>

      <li>it was and how comfortable.  </li>
      <li>worked great to China &amp; back 2 times</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as this Ehob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Made my husband comfortable when nothing else would.</li>
      <li>Comfortable for patient.</li>
      <li>But so far so good.</li>
      <li>It is easily cleaned and fairly durable but don&#x27;t expect it to last indefinitely.  </li>
      <li>Not too helpful for unique pain issue</li>
      <li>The doctor prescribed a cushion identical to this one to help more evenly distribute his weight across his &amp;#34;sitter.&amp;#34;  He used it so much that it eventually wore out (</li>
      <li>/&gt;You do have to adjust the air (like blowing up a beach ball) to get just the right amount of &amp;#34;cushy&amp;#34; that you need to feel comfortable.</li>
      <li>Other than great purchase.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly just when I needed it.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and big and he could not be happier!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cushions and finally we have one that really helps!!!</li>
      <li>and I would also test them for leaks right away.  </li>
      <li>Not as large as the hospital size, but fits the bill!</li>
      <li>It helps greatly to reduce my back pain and allows me to sit properly on my car.</li>
      <li>they LOVE it and it helps prevent back and hip pain for them.</li>
      <li>When I first saw it, I had doubts.  </li>
      <li>I first saw it being used at the hospital while my dad was in.</li>
      <li>The Ehob Waffle Air Seat Cushion first relieved the pain and then allowed the sore to heal with supplemental medications.  </li>
      <li>There was just enough air in it when it arrived and did not need to add any more.  </li>
      <li>He said this helps so much, and now everyone at dialysis wants one!</li>
      <li>Item came quickly, and seems to be helping my 94 year old mother.</li>
      <li>However, this is the 3rd one we&#x27;ve had as it breaks easily and does not repair well.</li>
      <li>This has really helped my handicapped brother with pressure sores.</li>
      <li>Doctor recommended, and she says it really helps.</li>
      <li>The cushion suits my purpose very well, and was shipped on time</li>
      <li>I am very overweight</li>
      <li>Arrived very promptly</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t sat so comfortably since the 1980s when I had 3 tailbone surgeries &amp; then a recent rectal surgery.  </li>
      <li>She uses it in her chair lift and fits very well.  </li>
      <li>I gave this cushion one star because that the lowest rating this format will allow;  I would give it a much lower rating if allowed.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than other cushion.</li>
      <li>My husband even swiped it a couple of times and we both felt that it made the seemingly endless sitting more bearable.  </li>
      <li>It makes long rides comfortable.</li>
      <li>It was the only cushion (out of the many styles we tried) that actually kept him from getting sore!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Could be a little more durable.</li>
      <li>She likes it a lot, but felt it needed to be inflated a little more than the instructions said.</li>
      <li>It is a great idea but flawed.</li>
      <li>but I think the cost would only be worth it for someone who is in chair bound and in it all day.</li>
      <li>I have used this product extensively at work (A major healthcare center) and I must say I was surprised who effective</li>
      <li>The first cushion I bought lasted about a year, this is the 2nd purchase.</li>
      <li>This is the only seat cushion I can use that is not uncomfortable after a period of using it.</li>
      <li>This is the only cushion that I&#x27;ve found that helps relieve the pressure on the tissues under the two large bones in my seat, when I sit.</li>
      <li>It was also delivered usps on Sunday which surprised me.  </li>
      <li>but I imagine it cost so much because it is a piece of medical equipment.  </li>
      <li>Has really helped my pressure sore to not develop into an open sore!</li>
      <li>I have a friend that sits a lot and developed some sort of bed sores on his &amp;#34;sitter.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this cushion to anyone with mild back discomfort resulting from sciatica or general back stiffness.  </li>
      <li>but only if they are filled  properly, which they typically are from the factory, but when I got the one through Amazon, it was completely deflated/flat.  </li>
      <li>The Roho pads are really engineered well and would last for quite a long time</li>
      <li>Due to several surgeries I have had to spend a lot of time sitting (and sleeping) in a recliner, and these cushions are a real derrier saver.</li>
      <li>I am only in my early 40&#x27;s, but already have issues with my back... especially when sitting for extended periods of time.  </li>
      <li>Loses air quickly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ordered for my mother, works well like it is suppose to.  There was just enough air in it when it arrived and did not need to add any more.  She uses it in her chair lift and fits very well.  I would recommend it for anyone who need an air cushion.  Arrived very promptly</li>
    <li> The cushion is very light weight and easy to move from chair to chair</li>
    <li> these cushions work great especially if you are at a job where you need to sit all day, for that matter they would be great for the elderly who are confined to a chair. Very comfortable !!!</li>
    <li> Works well to distribute weight. However, this is the 3rd one we&#x27;ve had as it breaks easily and does not repair well.</li>
    <li> This works so much better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I actually brought this on ehob&#x27;s website. I ordered the bed overlay and seemed to work well so I ordered the chair overlay the next month. During the 4th month of having the bed overlay it punctured and the chair followed. After calling customer service, I was told there is only a 3 month warranty and I may have mis-used the product. My grandma is 90 y/o and 80 lbs and I&#x27;m a physical therapist who spent time transferring patients. This product should have held up. Due to the bad quality and bad customer service I gave this the lowest rating possible.</li>
    <li> I like the product. But the pump came from a different supplier then the waffle seat so I could not pump up the waffle seat for several days while I waited for the pump to be delivered. I would think that the pump and the waffle seat be sold togeyther as a unit.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for someone who sits all day long. they LOVE it and it helps prevent back and hip pain for them. great product--hospital grade.</li>
    <li> Met my every expectation.</li>
    <li> Works well and is well made.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband he doesn&#x27;t like it but I love it and sit on it all the time in my work room.</li>
    <li> Item came quickly, and seems to be helping my 94 year old mother.</li>
    <li> Seems a little flimsy.  Does not come inflated, so I am not sure I have too little or too much air.  But so far so good.</li>
    <li> It helps greatly to reduce my back pain and allows me to sit properly on my car.</li>
    <li> I gave this cushion one star because that the lowest rating this format will allow;  I would give it a much lower rating if allowed. This is a extremely overprice cushion manufactured from thin, cheap vinyl that I expect to last a very short period of time. The cushion was not inflated when delivered and proved to be a challenge to inflate. Surprise, Surprise, you can also purchase very expensive overpriced  pump ( cost more then cushion ) that is a companion to this cushion marketed by the same manufacture. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this overpriced junk</li>
    <li> Gift.  Hope it works well for her.  Have not blown up yet.</li>
    <li> My father in-law suffers from sciatic pain and he is in love with this pillow, one of his christmas presents this year.  He has been using this cushion everyday since christmas and has given away the other orthopedic cushions he had been using previously.</li>
    <li> I put this on the seat of my car. It makes long rides comfortable. I won&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly just when I needed it. Totally satisfied</li>
    <li> Used daily. My aunt loves it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these and I do recommend them. I am very overweight &amp; I sit in a task/secretarial chair for about 18 hrs a day. The first cushion I bought lasted about a year, this is the 2nd purchase. I went to the their website and the cushion is only designed to last 2 or 3 months so I was very happy with how long the 1st one lasted. However, because the product description here on Amazon doesn&#x27;t mention the expected life-span I am holding back 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase another make &amp; model that cost $135 and it isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as this Ehob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  DO NOT OVER FILL this cushion. Follow the directions and under fill it. When you get your weight on it it will do the job and lift you off the seat and cushion your bum.</li>
    <li> I am only in my early 40&#x27;s, but already have issues with my back... especially when sitting for extended periods of time.  A friend, who is a nurse, loaned me her waffle cushion for a plane trip and I felt that it made quite a difference as airplane seats can be brutal.  I have since used it on a 14 hour road trip to AZ.  My husband even swiped it a couple of times and we both felt that it made the seemingly endless sitting more bearable.  I would recommend this cushion to anyone with mild back discomfort resulting from sciatica or general back stiffness.  This one is a good size too.</li>
    <li> My husband is unable to walk and relies on his wheel chairs and sitting all the time has become a pain in the .... for him. I&#x27;ve tried many cushions and finally we have one that really helps!!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with cushion. Comfortable for patient. Great item for the price.</li>
    <li> I had 3 of them and all of them punctured less than 4 months.</li>
    <li> When I was ill I was positioned in a way that lead to a bed sore.  The Ehob Waffle Air Seat Cushion first relieved the pain and then allowed the sore to heal with supplemental medications.  Now I use them as a preventative measure.  They must be covered with a pillowcase or they cause one to perspire.</li>
    <li> This product works well. The problem is that it fails quickly. I purchased this in April 2015 and as I write this review in August 2015 the product no longer holds air (it deflates) and is no longer under warranty. Ii has not been abused and has no punctures, it simply stopped holding air. It is a great idea but flawed.</li>
    <li> father was in need of this product l was glad to get it for him</li>
    <li> Sprang a leak after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Hubby used this in his recliner after open heart surgery. It was the only cushion (out of the many styles we tried) that actually kept him from getting sore!</li>
    <li> good product- worked as the way it was deswigned</li>
    <li> This product papered to be good at first. After mom using it a couple weeks or went flat and would not hold air.  Second one she had.</li>
    <li> Great item. Could be a little more durable. This is second one I&#x27;ve bought. Other than great purchase. Go asu.</li>
    <li> Dr.. recommended it.  The plastic is a little stiff, but it worked for me. I will definitely keep it &amp; not return.</li>
    <li> I am sorry they only last about three months then more air and in about six months maybe a hole ends their life</li>
    <li> This is the only cushion that I&#x27;ve found that helps relieve the pressure on the tissues under the two large bones in my seat, when I sit. I don&#x27;t use a wheel chair.  I place the cushion on my sofa to sit on while I read.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my grandma who has been experiencing pain from sitting constantly while recovering from a recent illness and it gave her instant relief! Very pleased and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This has really helped my handicapped brother with pressure sores. Allows air to go under. I recommend it. I first saw it being used at the hospital while my dad was in. I wrote down the name and went on my ole reliable Amazon to see if they had it. It came out less money because I have the Prime. No shipping cost, unlike the company that sells them.</li>
    <li> Not as large as the hospital size, but fits the bill!</li>
    <li> I like  it a lt. It is very comfortable in my  wheelchair. It is so much better than other cushion. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Due to several surgeries I have had to spend a lot of time sitting (and sleeping) in a recliner, and these cushions are a real derrier saver.</li>
    <li> This was for my mother who has spine problems. Doctor recommended, and she says it really helps. My only complaint is that it seems very expensive for what it is, but this one was much less expensive than others offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my second one, so they must work. The trick to these is getting  your cheek bones aligned with the openings. If you can accomplish that it makes a big difference. I find the air cushion more comfortable than gel or foam. They&#x27;re light weight, foldable and easy to carry under your arm.  The biggest problems are getting the correct  air volume and curved back chairs at restaurants. Also, I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to get the stem down after inflating.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it when he sits on his scooter to help cushion the seat.  He has been treated for a wound and this helps to get some of the pressure off when he sits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says it is much more comfortable using the waffle cushion.  Seems to be working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are pleased with the purchase.  We would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Over priced for a flimsy piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by the doctor for my wheelchair bound roommate. It has been a godsend for her. We have not had the air leak problem some have mentioned after we pushed the air stem into the receptacle for it. I guess that locks it somehow. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who gets pressure pain from sitting.</li>
    <li> This is the only seat cushion I can use that is not uncomfortable after a period of using it. Even though it does spring a leak every few months, I never get pressure sores while using it. I&#x27;ve bought three other cushions paying more for them than this type and all of them failed in the comfort department.</li>
    <li> works just great for what I bought it for</li>
    <li> Bought 3, two ok, one of them started leaking after forty five days!</li>
    <li> This air cushion is GREAT!  My  husband had surgery and has to sit a lot.  He was sitting on pillows but not very comfortable.  I checked a few stores in my area but couldn&#x27;t find anything I thought he would like.  I am very satisfied.  It was also delivered usps on Sunday which surprised me.  Thought I&#x27;d have to wait for Monday.  I also have Amazon Prime and very satisfied. He has had it almost a week now and is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not too helpful for unique pain issue I have&lt;br /&gt;But like that its foldable.  May come in handy in some  situations. Still deciding&lt;br /&gt;Thx!</li>
    <li> my wife does everything from her wheelchair and she loves the comfort of this pad,but it only lasted a few months before it sprung a leak. she loved it so much she insisted that i order another one. I&#x27;m happy to pay $10 a month to keep her comfortable in her very well used wheelchair.</li>
    <li> The cushion arrived deflated and was virtually impossible to inflate and hold the pressure -- the valve did not seal properly even after I called the EHOB service department and spoke to a representative to learn how to do it.  It still didn&#x27;t hold its air.</li>
    <li> Loses air quickly.  It&#x27;s a pain to constantly have to refill this because the nozzle is difficult to open and then is almost impossible to put back in flush.</li>
    <li> I thought it came with a pump.</li>
    <li> Made my husband comfortable when nothing else would. He used it all the time. He had bone cancer so his pain was terrible but this cushion allowed him to be able to sit without extreme pain. Prevented breakdown of his coccyx.</li>
    <li> I have used this product extensively at work (A major healthcare center) and I must say I was surprised who effective it was and how comfortable.  Pressure ulcers are partially caused by direct pressure from a bony prominence which decreased circulation and eventually the tissue dies.  Another and often over looked cause is shearing forces.  This cushion is not fully inflated so it helps to eliminate sliding on the pad (not sure if this was part of the designers intent).  It is easily cleaned and fairly durable but don&#x27;t expect it to last indefinitely.  Having said all this the person sitting, as with any pad, must shift weight every so often to prevent ulcers.  So don&#x27;t think you can place someone in a chair for several hours and forget them.  This would be great for wheel chair or regular chair use.&lt;br /&gt;  Compared to the Roho pads this is very reasonable, but I would like to see it less expensive but I imagine it cost so much because it is a piece of medical equipment.  The Roho pads are really engineered well and would last for quite a long time but I think the cost would only be worth it for someone who is in chair bound and in it all day.</li>
    <li> I have two of these, one I purchased here via Amazon and one I got from the manufacturer directly.&lt;br /&gt;I was warned by my doctor that these work great but only if they are filled  properly, which they typically are from the factory, but when I got the one through Amazon, it was completely deflated/flat.  I talked to the manufacturer and they sent me one that was properly inflated.  I kept the original one thinking it would be handy, but it has a leak somewhere.  The one from the factory has been great, I would recommend it to anyone stuck in a hospital bed, wheelchair, etc., without any hesitation.  But be warned, these should come inflated and I would also test them for leaks right away.  Submerge it in water and squeeze it a bit, if you see bubbles coming up you know you have a leak and you can return it to the vendor for a good one.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and my grandfather loves it! Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
    <li> The cushion is a saving grace for a long time sitting, Prevents a sore bottom. Adds comfort to the tail bone and shifting.</li>
    <li> If you do a lot of sitting this is for you!  I have a friend that sits a lot and developed some sort of bed sores on his &amp;#34;sitter.&amp;#34;  The doctor prescribed a cushion identical to this one to help more evenly distribute his weight across his &amp;#34;sitter.&amp;#34;  He used it so much that it eventually wore out (one of the heat pressed seams around a hole cracked and leaked air).  He was thrilled to get a replacement for it.  While using this cushion his sores went away, so he stopped using it and they returned.  Now he wont&#x27; go anywhere without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to adjust the air (like blowing up a beach ball) to get just the right amount of &amp;#34;cushy&amp;#34; that you need to feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> My husband used one while in a rehabilitation facility and he like it a lot..  He was to be getting out soon so we ordered one for use afterwards. Unfortunately, he passed away before he had a chance to use it.  I was going to return it but then figured I would sell it with his wheelchair so I did not return it.</li>
    <li> Serves my purpose but slides out of my chair with me on it. Could use something to keep it in my chair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, who is confined to a wheelchair.  She likes it a lot, but felt it needed to be inflated a little more than the instructions said. That may cause a problem for heavier individuals.  She said it relieves the pressure at the base of her spine, which has been a real problem.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister that is in a nursing home, she had one earlier the hospital gave her and it started leaking air.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Shipped quickly. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I got this for my father who gets dialysis 3 times a week. He has to sit for 4 1/2 hours each time so he gets sore. He said this helps so much, and now everyone at dialysis wants one! It&#x27;s nice and big and he could not be happier!</li>
    <li> My dad loves this.  When I first saw it, I had doubts.  Once inflated (easy), and used, he had nothing but praise for it.</li>
    <li> kinda spending and nothing fancy like ad said..found 1 for half the money and my dad likes that one bettr</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t sat so comfortably since the 1980s when I had 3 tailbone surgeries &amp; then a recent rectal surgery.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Seat cushion arrived on time.  Was as expected.  Arrived inflated, as it should have been.  I have ordered these seat cushions for my mother previously.  They do what they are made to do, add a layer of air to the seat so she is not sitting on such a &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; surface on wheelchairs or regular chairs.</li>
    <li> The cushion suits my purpose very well, and was shipped on time</li>
    <li> Works well but air seems to leak out.  I have to pump it up a little bit every 3-4 days.  Very good for bed sores on the butt.</li>
    <li> Has really helped my pressure sore to not develop into an open sore!</li>
    <li> I wish it could be repaired. This is my third purchase.  It is good as it does what is supposed to do . I also wish it was easier to find a cover</li>
    <li> worked great to China &amp; back 2 times</li>
    <li> Had one before.  Didn&#x27;t hold air anymore after about a year.  Was satisfied and ordered another.</li>
