### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It seems to be a wonderful face cream, but I didn&#x27;t order it.</li>
      <li>evened my tone out- very happy</li>
      <li>The texture feels great against cleansed skin.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my skin.  </li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good filler before make-up &amp; a nice heavy-duty face cream for bed time or under make-up for good coverage.</li>
      <li>This gives my always shiny face a nice matt look, which lasts fairly well.</li>
      <li>Amazing how it makes your skin looks airbrushed.</li>
      <li>It was a nice primer for my foundation, and lasted all day through sweat and summer weather.</li>
      <li>Nice since it&#x27;s also a moisturizer</li>
      <li>my face looks very smooth.  </li>
      <li>Texture feels nice putting on, but I did not notice any blurring of fine lines as promised</li>
      <li>LOVE.</li>
      <li>An ok moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t begin to hide wrinkles like Revitalift Miracle Blur.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this any Miracle blur</li>
      <li>I hope it keeps working, I feel better about my looks.</li>
      <li>This is great product for older skin.  </li>
      <li>Exceptionally easy way to look better without foundation.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for people who don&#x27;t want to spent time each morning with foundation.</li>
      <li>Thankfully ordered it with Amazon prime so that was easy to do.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to forget moisture.  </li>
      <li>I got it for a super cheap price, which was a great way for me to test it out without spending too much.</li>
      <li>Feels light and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have used the red tube moisture blur which is great</li>
      <li>&amp;#34; but this is a pretty good product for those of us that cannot see doing a whole lot of costly cosmetic procedures.  </li>
      <li>i have been using the miracle blur for 15 months and it does wonder this one doesn&#x27;t erase lines like the original does</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find this at Amazon at the reduced price.  </li>
      <li>when I read the ingredients I knew I would not be able to use it because it contains soy and wheat, both ingredients that I am highly allergic to so had to return it.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about this product...</li>
      <li>Other L&#x27;oreal blur formulations work better blur-wise, but this one feels much better.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry and sensitive skin, and this was definitely better for people who break out easily/develop rashes with most skin-care products.</li>
      <li>The effect only lasts an hour or so, but it&#x27;s easy to reapply.</li>
      <li>I have large pores but using this product</li>
      <li>This product really did make smaller the appearance of my pores and filled out my lines.  </li>
      <li>Just smooth it gently onto your face and your face is instantly smoother.</li>
      <li>It really does help give you a smoother appearance.  </li>
      <li>Really think it makes a difference in blurring imperfections.</li>
      <li>The whole Blur line is.&lt;br /&gt;However....this doesn&#x27;t have anti-aging goodies.</li>
      <li>Hides things, live it!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in the winter.</li>
      <li>It does both the job of leaving my skin soft and moisturized as well as creating the &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; effect.</li>
      <li>My skin remains soft throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Wow, was really surprised how greasy this moisturizer is.  </li>

<li> It can be used alone or layer it with other products.</li>
<li> Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t contain  a sunscreen.</li>
<li> Blurs wrinkles and uneven skin with minimal effort.  </li>
<li> I received 2 for less than the price I would have paid for one in the store.  </li>
<li> All it did was waste my money and leave my face greasy.</li>
<li> I am not sure yet.  </li>
<li> Horrible, didn&#x27;t fill in my pores at all!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazon needs to list the ingredients for this product. I ordered it and when I read the ingredients I knew I would not be able to use it because it contains soy and wheat, both ingredients that I am highly allergic to so had to return it. Thankfully ordered it with Amazon prime so that was easy to do.</li>
    <li> Hides things, live it!</li>
    <li> Other L&#x27;oreal blur formulations work better blur-wise, but this one feels much better.</li>
    <li> This is great product for older skin.  It really does help give you a smoother appearance.  I have used the red tube moisture blur which is great but I prefer this for the moisturizing texture.  I also find that it blends easier than the red tube.</li>
    <li> Amazing how it makes your skin looks airbrushed. The effect only lasts an hour or so, but it&#x27;s easy to reapply. Wish it had SPF.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference. did moisturize though.</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular Revitalift Blur. This is a moisturizing version that I wanted to try since dry skin is an issue for me. This is great. It does both the job of leaving my skin soft and moisturized as well as creating the &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; effect. The only down side is that the regular product includes sunscreen and this does not.</li>
    <li> i have been using the miracle blur for 15 months and it does wonder this one doesn&#x27;t erase lines like the original does but it does work at smoothing out your makeup</li>
    <li> This gives my always shiny face a nice matt look, which lasts fairly well. I got it for a super cheap price, which was a great way for me to test it out without spending too much. I will definitely buy it again. Only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t contain  a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I am not sure yet.  I have only used it once.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift &amp;#34; Moisture Blur&amp;#34; Instant Skin Smoother &amp; Moisturizer lives up to it&#x27;s name. The texture feels great against cleansed skin. Just smooth it gently onto your face and your face is instantly smoother. It can be used alone or layer it with other products.</li>
    <li> Nice since it&#x27;s also a moisturizer</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Revitalift Moisture Blur,&lt;br /&gt;With all the different layers to put on a face, it&#x27;s easy to forget moisture.  This is terrific stuff. The whole Blur line is.&lt;br /&gt;However....this doesn&#x27;t have anti-aging goodies. You still need Revitalift.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good filler before make-up &amp; a nice heavy-duty face cream for bed time or under make-up for good coverage.</li>
    <li> Obviously &amp;#34;time marches on and eventually it marches across our faces...&amp;#34; but this is a pretty good product for those of us that cannot see doing a whole lot of costly cosmetic procedures.  I have dry, sensitive skin and have used a lot of lotions and potions before this that just didn&#x27;t do anything for me except break me out or dry me out.  This product really did make smaller the appearance of my pores and filled out my lines.  I have only used it for one week and have noticed a difference.  The first two days I dried out a little, but then the benefits could be seen. I hope it keeps working, I feel better about my looks.</li>
    <li> Texture feels nice putting on, but I did not notice any blurring of fine lines as promised</li>
    <li> Did not do a thing and when I put makeup on, the product peeled off.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure it actually BLURs my issues but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for my skin.  I&#x27;ve had eczema all my life and have had to be extremely picky with lotions, etc.  I have no irritation from this and I like how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> I love this any Miracle blur</li>
    <li> Really think it makes a difference in blurring imperfections.</li>
    <li> Exceptionally easy way to look better without foundation.  Blurs wrinkles and uneven skin with minimal effort.  Feels light and not greasy.  Perfect for people who don&#x27;t want to spent time each morning with foundation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and got Revitalift day cream, anti wrinkle and skin firming. It seems to be a wonderful face cream, but I didn&#x27;t order it.</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry and sensitive skin, and this was definitely better for people who break out easily/develop rashes with most skin-care products. It was a nice primer for my foundation, and lasted all day through sweat and summer weather.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product...it acts a bit like a make up primer but the makeup gets muddy over it.</li>
    <li> evened my tone out- very happy</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff in the winter. My skin gets so dry and this just transforms it. LOVE.</li>
    <li> Wow, was really surprised how greasy this moisturizer is.  Will see if it improves the look of my skin, but, would likely not reorder because it took too long to absorb and dry on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find this item on sale at local stores.  I was so excited to find this at Amazon at the reduced price.  I received 2 for less than the price I would have paid for one in the store.  I love this product.  My skin remains soft throughout the day.  I have large pores but using this product my face looks very smooth.  I also have cystic acne and this product does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> An ok moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t begin to hide wrinkles like Revitalift Miracle Blur.</li>
    <li> Horrible, didn&#x27;t fill in my pores at all! All it did was waste my money and leave my face greasy.</li>
