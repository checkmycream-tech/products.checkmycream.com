<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works but not for any great length of time if you have really bad cracked hills. You will tire before you get rid of the cracked hills. Once you get them down to a manageable condition these rollers will help keep them that way. Go get a sanding block and some sandpaper to go in it and get the cracked hills down to what you want. Just a suggestion.</li>
    <li> I ordered with pedi cure as a group deal but they way too small. Live &amp; learn, READ BEFORE BUY/</li>
    <li> They work amazing, very glad I purchased these, my feet look amazing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the callus remover I bought - so they are useless.</li>
    <li> Great refill&lt;br /&gt;alot cheaper and the super course grit makes them last longer</li>
    <li> works well and a good value</li>
    <li> Does the job and easy-to-use and easy to handle</li>
    <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-pedi Refill and the result were great.</li>
    <li> Great for heel calluses</li>
    <li> Works great!!best price ever!!</li>
    <li> So easy to put in and this really works</li>
    <li> Was happy to find this product AND to find it so reasonable on Amazon. It works great!</li>
    <li> Do not really FIT  my pedi device&lt;br /&gt;Usable though and DO remove callus well</li>
    <li> I purchased these for x-tra Emjoil-Pedi refills. They are wonderful last quite a while, just rinse with water to clean. I recommend purchasing the super coarse if your spouse uses it,</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> they work well I&#x27;m surprised</li>
    <li> I use these with the electric Emjoi.  They grind away coarser calluses.  You do need the finer ones after using these to make the skin smoother but these cut down on the time you need to sand away the buildup.  I like them.</li>
    <li> These work really well.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful!!!!!.Great for pedicures during the winter months when your feet suffer from extreme dryness..The results were amazing. I passed some on to family members and they could not believe the results..I will be buying more in a few months.</li>
    <li> They work well, but I see almost no difference between the blue and green ones.</li>
    <li> All perfect replacements for your micro-pedi</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I needed</li>
    <li> Works great with Emjoi Callus Remover</li>
    <li> Great product. Very long lasting and not too abrasive but enough more so than the Extra Coarse for those &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; spots.</li>
    <li> It works vary gently. Make sure you don&#x27;t push too hard. It can be a little coarser too.</li>
    <li> what can I say.  It goes round and round and does its job</li>
    <li> I am happy with them. I continue will buy them</li>
    <li> these things really work well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Any roller should have an indication on whether it is time to change it or not. The customer is guessing whether the roller is still good or it needs to be replace.  It is also confusing, too man different rollers available and customer is having difficulty on what is the right roller to choose from.</li>
    <li> Happy to find the refills on line as they don&#x27;t seem to be available in stores that carry the original product.  They fit the micro-pedi and provide a better result than the roller that came with the original one.</li>
    <li> Worked so much better for me than the ones that came with the unit. My feet are very slender and I get a deep callous on the ball of my feet. This helps take them down to soft skin. I&#x27;m almost 57 so I have lots of dry areas. This rejuvenate my feet so they look young again.</li>
    <li> Love my Emjoi and these refills were a good price.</li>
    <li> These are good, and they WORK!</li>
    <li> works well, ordered more</li>
    <li> They work real well on my wife&#x27;s feet. And believe me she has rough feet! Also nicely priced.</li>
    <li> works like a charm. the only reason I will get a pedicure is for them to paint my nails</li>
    <li> Works great. Good addition to their default roller.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product. It did not work!</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It arrived as the seller described it</li>
    <li> Wrong refill for what I bought</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I ORDERED AND RECEIVED JUST FINE.</li>
    <li> I have a disability in left foot. I must use micro - pedi several times weekly to control itching from nerve damage. These rollers just take care of business! They get feet &#x27;done&#x27; in no time and in fact I no longer have to apply lotion afterwards because these rollers leave my ultra sensitive feet feeling smooth as a baby! I will definitely be re - ordering when need arises. Do not hesitate to use these. I have had this three months and use no less then three times week as my symptoms dictate.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Love the Emjoi product these go with.  I have great feet.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> Not good enough for my feet</li>
    <li> refills work well and are nice to have on hand</li>
    <li> Very good, I recommend it</li>
    <li> Another great refill for my Emoji Micro Pedi!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Not as good as original rollers</li>
    <li> The rollers would depend on how thick your calluses are and how often you use it.  they are a nice product .</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use them - they don&#x27;t do a thing for your feet.</li>
    <li> Excellent service, item as described, works perfect!</li>
    <li> The refills didn&#x27;t give me the results j was looking for.  I should have purchased the coarser ones.</li>
    <li> If you bought this machine, make sure you buy one of this which will remove dead skin like butter, remember to soak your feet for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> These are great you have to try this for really dry feet.</li>
    <li> Great product. Even my boyfriend loves me to take care of his calluses now. No chance of cuts or pain. Just a smooth rolling to get rid of dead calluses.</li>
    <li> I buy these quite often for my daughter, they work well, and she uses them weekly</li>
    <li> These rollers are perfect and at a much better price than what there sold for at the Emjoi site..&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with the price and got them super quick..</li>
    <li> I love my Mirco-Pedi and the refills are great.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  The super coarse rollers make sort work of the callused areas and leave the skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered Emjoi along with these rollers and ended up liking these compare to the other brand that came with Emjoi. I plan to order more of these. My daughter is loving it as well.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to try these out. Worked great. When they wear out, I will order, again</li>
    <li> These are great and were the same as the original I got with the Emjoi when I first purchased it.  I went and got a pedicure last week and they commented on how nice  my feet are, and it is thanks to the Emjoi and the Super Corse rollers.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This item is a great refill.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my feet feel</li>
    <li> They work very well between pedicures.</li>
    <li> product fits the  callus remover. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> These super coarse refills are great for my feet, and my feet stay smooth and soft Thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> Did not arrive in 2 days, not sure why it was on Prime, but the product itself is good</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for my sander. LOL. I have tried several others and they all took a lot longer to sand down my feet than these.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found these</li>
    <li> These refills do not fit the Personal Pedi The Original Foot Callus Remover as implied on the listing. They are now useless to me as I cannot return them as the return period has expired.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Did what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi - these rollers are great for someone who has very thick callus buildup.  I found that I prefer the Extra Coarse.</li>
    <li> Love our Micro-Pedi and the rollers. greatest thing in the world for removing callous.</li>
    <li> Received the Micro-Pedi as a gift. The Coarse rollers are better for my problem calluses.</li>
    <li> These work well for aprox 5 uses before they lack the roughness.  So if you plan on using your Emjoi on fairly regular basis--stock up on these</li>
    <li> I got these for my Emoji Micro-Pedi and they work great.</li>
    <li> great price fast shipping thank you</li>
    <li> Does a good job on heels.</li>
    <li> I love my Emjoi Pedi, but when I purchased these I thought I was buying the most course available.  I bought these, along with the Extra Course, which, in my opinion are not very course at all.  Apparently I didn&#x27;t look hard enough because I should have purchased the Extreme Course, and these to use next.  Anyway, they work, but you can go through a lot of them when it isn&#x27;t necessary if you just purchase the Extreme Course in the first place.  I didn&#x27;t know that until I read the back of the package after I received them.  They are still usable, but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> lasts longer than I expected. for men a coarser one would be better</li>
    <li> I like these better than the ones that came with my Emjoi unit.  They are courser and last longer and do a better job.  I am even considering trying the super course ones.  I love my Emjoi.  Why did it take so long to find this wonderful thing.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Back ups for when I need to replace my current rollers in my Emjoi.</li>
    <li> eficas very good and let me clean feet and a huge soft love the perfect product</li>
    <li> Wife loves them. Perfect fitment</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> These work great!  I have the smoother rollers but use these all the time.  I have seen a lot of other brands but their rollers seem so small compared to Emjoi&#x27;s. So glad I got this one.  Only thing;  got to use it more often!  My bad 😃</li>
    <li> Keeps my feet smooth as baby feet!</li>
    <li> These work great on the Emjoi model I have from a few years back...I was so happy to find the refills on Amazon and at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Great Price, worked as expected.</li>
    <li> Replacement spools are good but not as expected. Since I got the super coarse I thought one would take care of an initial cleaning of the callus but I had to use three. Still satisfied though, would order again Easy to install.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two coarseness levels now and both are not coarse enough...disappointing...</li>
    <li> my feet are so dry they split and bleed,these grind them down quick,but be carefull the 1st time i used them i went to far and had problems walking for 8 weeks! There is a reason why your feet are tough and if you take to much off they will hurt to walk on</li>
    <li> Works very few on my very callused feet</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me. II have been using the same roller since purchasing without having to replace it yet!</li>
    <li> Great value and works like a charm</li>
    <li> Depends on your skin, find the one that work for you.  After you repair your foot, you may consider using a fine roller for maintenance.</li>
    <li> These are great for my husband&#x27;s feet. He has major callus issues and so far this grade of roller is really helping.</li>
    <li> My mom loved these roller files. Strong electric motor.</li>
    <li> You need the coarser rollers if you want to get your feet smooth fairly quickly</li>
    <li> Have a stubborn callus on side of large toe that needs extra work. Super coarse version of roller  gets rid of it easily. As usual, don&#x27;t use  it on one spot too long.</li>
    <li> Good price..works like it should!!</li>
    <li> Havent used these yet but I know they will work like a champ. Very fast shipping. Ped eggs, pumice stones and all that stuff just doesn&#x27;t cut it, but I think these will be a god send.</li>
    <li> Everything smooth and as expected</li>
    <li> Work just fine. I have extra so I won&#x27;t run out for a while. Price is right.</li>
    <li> The refills are good and will take some time to deplete them&lt;br /&gt;gab</li>
    <li> I like this item and recommend my friends.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and works well with the parent product.</li>
    <li> Does remove dead skin from feet as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Love it!! Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original. Seemed to get dull faster</li>
    <li> I prefer the fine rollers. These break up the tough skin but do not make my feet as smooth as the fine ones do.</li>
    <li> these are for supercourse feet and calluses, these are the replacements, for the machine</li>
    <li> I love these refills! They work great on winter-dry feet! I recommend these, lotion then socks for baby soft feet.</li>
    <li> If you need the Emjoi, order some of these; they work a bit quicker than the regular (blue) ones.</li>
    <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
    <li> I must have if your getting the micro pedi they dont wear out quickly but im a heavy user and its always good to have spares</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;super course&amp;#34; refills work well. I will purchase them again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE, WHAT CAN I SAY</li>
    <li> I thought these refills would be more coarse than the blue roller that came with my Emjoi.  I would say they seem more like fine sandpaper.  The picture is deceiving, it makes them look a little rougher. I will use them but I wish I had bought refills of the blue roller.</li>
    <li> They work really well but don&#x27;t seem to last a long time. My feet are not in bad shape...I had used other rollers up until I found these extra course ones. Went through the four of them in a relatively short time. I don&#x27;t work and am not on my feel all day so this is the best reference I can give.</li>
    <li> These will come in handy when I need to replace them.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Will be ordering more when needed.</li>
    <li> I use these after using the even-coarser green rollers. I love this product, so much better than the others. (I&#x27;ve tried the tweezerman razor, which is actually frightening, and the egg things, which make me think I should just use a cheese grater). These rollers are much better. They don&#x27;t take nearly as much work and aren&#x27;t as scary. If you are a runner, or just someone who gets a lot of callouses? As they say in rugby, go hard or go home. I recommend the green and these blue rollers. The bright blue ones? Not very effective for me- I just end up replacing them quickly. Pay attention to the batteries, too.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect texture</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast delivery</li>
    <li> SO Happy These Exist - now I don&#x27;t have to pay $29.99 for three replacement rollers from QVC where I bought my Emjoi. These arrived on time from the seller, fit my Emjoi perfectly, and they are a fantastic price; please don&#x27;t stop making these. Summer sandals here I come.</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE STRONGER THAN THE REGULAR ONES, BUT IF THIS IS AS COARSE AS IT GETS THEY WORKED WELL, FEET ARE SOFT AS A BABY, EXCELLENT PRODUCT,</li>
    <li> Very effective, I have horribly dry feet and this with persistent use of Working Feet cream really helps!</li>
    <li> The product description is not accurate. The rollers are a miniature version of the&lt;br /&gt;rollers by the same name. I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go along with the Emoji I bought my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day (yeah yeah, I know.. a strange gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day!).  I really like the amount of coarseness on these rollers.  I used these first on my feet and then follow up with extra coarse rollers.  They do a great job, but I would advise to be sure not to overdo it!  Doing so can make your heels slightly tender!</li>
    <li> These are absolutely the best thing for dry Arizona feet.  My feet are extremely dry here in the desert and these super coarse little babies do the best job of keeping my feet all over soft.  The heels of my feet used to crack all the time, it was very painful but not any more, a fee minutes everyday and you waould never guess my feet ever get dry!</li>
    <li> The right roller for feet with thick skin.</li>
    <li> This will help you on your pedicure not going every week</li>
    <li> They are excellent just the right consistency not too coarse but enough to smooth away the calluses. The price is awesome  a great buy will be purchasing them again for sure.</li>
    <li> Did not fit the pedi cure solutions machine.  I wasted my money</li>
    <li> These are great and price is so much less than what I would have on QVC.</li>
    <li> These are much better than the ones that came with my Emjoi.  They make the job much quicker.</li>
    <li> Effective yet gentle.</li>
    <li> Not as coarse as I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> these are nice, do a good job</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. The product works great</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the extra course as the blue rollers wore out too quickly.  These work much better for me, and the price was very reasonable for 4.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Work great</li>
    <li> These worked great for my daughter&#x27;s feet but irritated my skin for days after I used them. I can still used just only on back of my heel and not entire foot.</li>
    <li> Looks generic (came in an unmarked plastic bag), but I actually think they do a better job than the name brand that came with the unit.</li>
    <li> These work great, fast shipping Thanks</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the one that came with the product.</li>
    <li> Both Replacement Rollers are fine,</li>
    <li> Wow!  Smooth heels!!!</li>
    <li> These are great for the really rough spots around the heels.</li>
    <li> These work 5 times better than the original roller for the Emjoi micro pedi. Will order again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Good replacements for the rollers that came with the Emjoi</li>
    <li> These are the best rollers!!</li>
    <li> They were only a half step up from the rollers I received when I purchased the Emjoi.  They were not Super Coarse.</li>
    <li> Love these! Super quick and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Was not the right ones</li>
    <li> This work great and the delivery was so fast.</li>
    <li> Not any better than the standard refills</li>
    <li> Takes care of my calluses on my heels.</li>
    <li> These roller files fit 2 different pedi products, so if you bought your unit at cosco (like I did) these fit it perfect, thank goodness, I was worried where to get them!!</li>
    <li> Work fine, but needed coarser refills. Ordered extreme coarse &amp; will advise if these are as helpful.</li>
    <li> My feet love these.  The rollers and the Enjoi Pedi nano callus remover are the best thing ever.  I wear sandals all the time and in the winter, even pedicures weren&#x27;t getting rid of the ugly calluses.  These do a great job, painlessly.  They never take off too much and leave my heels sore.</li>
    <li> works well for tired winter boot feet in Alaska!</li>
    <li> Perfect, works with my machine and is great for really coarse jobs</li>
    <li> Love it - I have tough skin in my feet and the Emjoi Pedi and rollers work great</li>
    <li> Great for rough dry feet!</li>
    <li> great .................solved my problems. feet so soft</li>
    <li> The Micro-Pedi is awesome, I use it all the time and feet have never been so smooth and soft.  I live in a dry climate and have always struggled with cracked, peeling, dry, calloused feet.  These make my feet softer and smoother than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had, which has been many.  I ordered these replacement rollers, which are more coarse than the rollers it came with.  The coarse rollers left my feet smooth and worked more quickly than the more fine ones.  If they aren&#x27;t working for you, it is most likely because you need to replace the roller or the battery.  I love these, though, and highly recommend it to anyone, with even the most calloused heels.</li>
    <li> got what I expected at a good price</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of getting rid of the rough skin on your feet</li>
    <li> not much difference between course, extra course and super course. I wish I could get something much more course because these seem to wear down way too fast. my heels must be much harder than most. I wish they would label them by grit # like sand paper, then I would&#x27;ve known there wasn&#x27;t enough difference from course, extra course and super course to bother buying each. why can&#x27;t they actually make something SUPER COURSE???</li>
    <li> The super coarse rollers work much better than the &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; blue rollers that come with the Micro Pedi unit. But I prefer the extreme coarse rollers which work even better and faster, and will most be ordering more of them when I need them.</li>
    <li> Works very well, you&#x27;re feet will thank you AAA</li>
    <li> ThSee rollers are great. I&#x27;ve always had such deep cracks, even when I was professionally getting Soa treatments and pedicures. I love the integrity of not over hanging for a device that works do amazing well! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The super coarse rollers were a good start for getting all my dried skin removed. After using these for a small time, then went to a finer roller with excellent results. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Works better than the higher priced rollers.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Perfect and a great price!</li>
    <li> these fit my Emjoi perfectly and love the fact that they are super coarse</li>
    <li> Great. Works well coarse enough and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great micro-pedi rollers and they are washable!</li>
    <li> These seemed to wear down just as fast as the original rollers. In fact i have been disappointed by the performance of the micro-pedi on the whole. Am shopping for better pedicure system</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
    <li> they work really well</li>
    <li> These are REALLY coarse..I&#x27;ll have to be careful..already took off a few layers of skin in addition to callus</li>
