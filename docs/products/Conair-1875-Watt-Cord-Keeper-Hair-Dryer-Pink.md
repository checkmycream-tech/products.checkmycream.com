<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had one of these in dark blue for years, it finally gave out. This one is alright, but feels lighted and cheaper made then my old one. Love the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> I really like this Conair hairdryer.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months and use it most every day.  It&#x27;s easy to use, dries my hair quickly and I like that I can set the temperature and speed separately and that the cord retracts.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my new Conair hair dryer and the option for choices on level of drying. I am a little disappointed that occasionally the cord &amp;#34;hangs up&amp;#34; as it is retracting and is very difficult to start again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer on sale at CVS. I love the cord keeper. I just hold onto the cord while it&#x27;s retracting. The removable filter is much better than other dryers I&#x27;ve used, because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer. This dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very thick coarse hair. With other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair. This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers. I still have to use a flatiron, but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat.    I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Way to loud, and it takes a long time for your hair to dry.</li>
    <li> Works really well and retractable cord is great for storage.  This dryer is lightweight and I love the different heat settings.  Only negative is cord button is a little hard to push.</li>
    <li> it does the job well, a little heavy but i can deal with that. retractable cord was a feature I didn&#x27;t know about, which was a wonderful surprise!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new hair dryer in 20 years. I blow dry so infrequently that my old windmere still works. But I figured it was time to get a better, safer dryer.    I chose this dryer based on the price and reviews. Modern dryers are all much bigger and heavier than the old ones which is kind of annoying. If any part of this dryer overhangs the edge of the counter, the whole thing starts to slide off.    The dryer itself works well, my hair is quite thick and I thought it worked very quickly to get my hair to an almost dry state. (I never blow all the way dry to keep the hair healthier.) I also like the cool air option. The cord is definitely long enough for use when you&#x27;re at the bathroom counter. It&#x27;s great to have it so neatly tuck away inside the dryer.    My only caution is retracting the cord. It snaps back pretty fast which cause the plug end with it&#x27;s safety block to whish around. It banged into the cabinets and almost knocked something off the counter as it flipped around. I would suggest holding the plug end as you retract the cord so you don&#x27;t hurt someone.</li>
    <li> best dryer I&#x27;ve had for years--easy to regulate temp and speed and cord retracts quickly</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty average product.  My issues with it:   - heavy weight  - positioning of on/off switch is really awkward, you cant use your index finger  - the diffuser and concentrator are too long, with them on the entire construction is just way too big    If you&#x27;re used to compact hair dryers keep looking, this is not it.  Having said that it still does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - dries hair, and it&#x27;s on the less expensive side of the range.</li>
    <li> The results the hairdryer produces are great.  The retractable cord is not.  Mine broke after the fist use.  Now I can&#x27;t get the cord to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; into place when I pull it out, and the retract button is temperamental - doesn&#x27;t work when I need it to or goes off suddenly on its own.  Also, be very careful when you use the retract button; the heavy plug at the end is dangerous.</li>
    <li> only problem (?) is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil, but that is about it. i like it and it works great!</li>
    <li> I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I&#x27;m drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for $20 and was pleased with the performance, especially the retractable cord feature.  However, about a year after owning it, it shorted out near the bottom and was working inconsistently.  I had my original receipt and it was warrantied for 2 years, so I contacted Conair.  The customer rep said I had to pay the shipping to them, (insured,) and write a check to them for the shipping back to me.  I could have gotten a new hairdryer for the cost of their so-called warranty.  I went and purchased a Revlon hairdryer and will never buy from this company again.  So, if you are thinking they will replace a faulty product for free, THINK AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Long story short.. I used it 4 times and it is now dead.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I bought it locally in late January, used it 4 times and now it has died.&lt;br /&gt;When i first used it I heard something rolling around inside the unit while I was drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried shaking it out but got nothing.  I was pretty much expecting it to not last long at this point.&lt;br /&gt;I began to dry my hair today and again heard the sound, then a loud &amp;#34;Clack&amp;#34;. The unit quit and had a burning smell.&lt;br /&gt;I shook it over the counter and 2 small pieces of red plastic shook out of the front. Nothing wrong on the outside so&lt;br /&gt;must have either broke off inside or been left inside by sloppy workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I really wanted this machine to work for me so I will purchase a replacement and give it a second try, since it&lt;br /&gt;seemed defective right out of the box (having something rolling around in it.)&lt;br /&gt;I love the retractable cord.  It&#x27;s only about 5 ft long so could have been longer but was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;I just hate winding a cord around a machine.. it&#x27;s messy.. the machine might still be hot etc.&lt;br /&gt;Yes of course you have to hold the plug as you retract it or you&#x27;ll get wacked.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice heft to it and seemed very solid.  Attachments stayed on when in use.&lt;br /&gt;It moves a Lot of air thru it - more than the comparabe Remington D 3020 Volume and Shine hair dryer (which I also had on hand).&lt;br /&gt;I was just begining to compare the 2 when the Conair bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;This was disappointing after having a hand held unit that worked for 36 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer at Target for $20.  I use only Conair dryers, and know that it is a matter of trying until I find the right one for me when the old one dies.      This one is so loud that it hurt my ears.  I know that I could have gotten used to it, but decided that it was best not to try.    I have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair- diminishes the shine.      This dries quickly and thoroughly, but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it.  I will go back to a regular Conair.    I love the brand, but just not this item.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product salon finishing and the cord retracts! Best part had it for over a year it&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> Broke after a month and a half :(</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. It has temperature control and speed of air flow. The cord keeper is also very helpful. Its not too loud and no odor is produced. Great hair dryer for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is my second 209R.  When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.    This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.    Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING CONAIR HAIR DRYERS FOR YEARS.  NATURALLY, WHEN MY LAST ONE FINALLY GAVE OUT, STARTED TO EXPLORE NEW ONES.WITH A RETRACTABLE CORD.&lt;br /&gt;FOUND THIS ONE FOR UNDER $20.00 AND IS SIMILAR TO MY OLD ONE, EXCEPT IT HAD MORE POWER.  THIS HAIR DRYER DOES EVERYTHING THAT I REQUIRE WITHOUT SPENDING A FORTUNE.  VERY PLEASED WITH IT AND AM CERTAIN IT WILL LAST A GOOD COUPLE OF YEARS AS HAVE ALL MY OTHERS.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in a local store about eight months ago. (When your hair dryer dies, you need a new one the same day. Can&#x27;t wait for shipping.) It worked fine until last week. I was drying my hair with it when suddenly a bright blue flame about 4\\&quot;-5\\&quot; long shot noisily out of the place where the cord met the plug, like a blow torch. It burned for a few seconds, and then the cord fell off the plug, at which time the flames stopped. I pulled the plug from the socket. It looked like the cord melted at the attachment point. Black residue was all around the wall outlet and on the sink below. Scary!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the Conair Hotline, and they said, at first, they couldn&#x27;t do anything for me because the dryer, based on model and serial number, was out of warranty. The warranty is for two years, but I only bought it 9 months ago. It must have sat in the store for quite a while. I was told that unless I had my receipt, (I didn&#x27;t), they couldn&#x27;t help me. I can understand not replacing it if the motor died or no longer blew hot air. I know hair dryers don&#x27;t last forever. But this was a safety issue, and I thought they should compensate me in some way, although I was not really sure I wanted another one of their products. I told the rep what I thought, and she said she would pass along my feelings to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, they requested that I send the defective dryer to them, and replaced it with a new one within a week. I am very pleased. I do love this dryer. In the meantime, I bought a newer model, which is not as hot and takes a lot longer to dry my hair. Probably better for the condition of my hair overall, but I like to get up and going faster in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars because of the customer service. I would buy Conair again because of it. These items are made in China, and I don&#x27;t think quality control is very good there. I had a Revlon dryer, also made in China, that blew flames out and burned my hair. They wouldn&#x27;t help me at all. Won&#x27;t go for that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, my cord got stuck inside the dryer once. I unscrewed all the screws and still couldn&#x27;t get the unit apart. My husband discovered that the parts are also glued together, and used a knife to carefully separate the glued joints. He got the cord out, and I just left it out after that. I didn&#x27;t care if it retracted. This had nothing to do with the cord-plug problem.</li>
    <li> Works great and has an abundant amount of features.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it.  I really like how this dryer works on my hair.  It does not&lt;br /&gt;leave it dry or fly away, but nice, shiny and lively.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I dropped my previous one, different brand, and had to replace it.  The cord-keeper part is the main feature for me.  The hair dryer itself works fine, a little louder than most but is also more lightweight than most.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, love the retractable cord, I dont really care about the color, inexpensive, but really loud. Oh well, can&#x27;t have it all in life. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer at a local store, and 3 days later am packing it back up in the box to return.  I really like this dryer, but man is it heavy!!!  Too bad, because my hair looks great after using it.  Although I really like the cord keeper feature, the cord is too short for me.  I like the heat this dryer blows out, but often it gets too hot, so if I have a necklace on it burns.  If it wasn&#x27;t so heavy, I&#x27;d keep it.</li>
    <li> Second one i purchased for wife and daughter</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. It worked for 6 weeks (just beyond Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy). This is the second Conair blow dryer I have bought her that did not last. Will never buy another one.</li>
    <li> I very much like the way my hair comes out with this hairdryer.  Less frizz and dries quickly.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the heaviness of the dryer.  It is three times heavier than my last hair dryer and after a while my arm gets tired.  If light weight is important to you, don&#x27;t buy this one.  Also, I thought the price was pretty good, but I have actually seen similar dryers cheaper at Costco.</li>
    <li> It works. The cord feature is great. The price is right. What else is there to say.</li>
    <li> I was buying this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she has thick, curly hair that really requires the ceramic-ionic technology. She also wanted one with a cord keeper and I was excited to find this model that seemed to have everything she was looking for at a reasonable price, but when it arrived and I looked at the box, there wasn&#x27;t anything about the diffuser that is listed in the product description. All that is included is a concentrator, which is exactly the opposite of what my sister needs. So this is going back and I&#x27;m back at square one with a very limited amount of time. At least Amazon has a good return policy!</li>
    <li> For the reasonable price this is a good buy for the quality. The ionic feature really does make a difference in defrizzing and creating less fluffy hair and making hair shiny.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer does well with my thick hair. good in the hand, the cord is a bit forceful. At times I have to pull it out again to get it to retract fully but this could be attributed to independent factors (angle of handle when activating cord keeper).  Fantastic for saving space.</li>
    <li> This item is just what I wanted.  Enough power, ion, and the diffuser and concentrator attachments are great.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS DRYER. THE FACT THAT IT HAS A RETRACTABLE CORD IS A REAL PLUS. THE HEAT AND SPEED SETTINGS ARE ALSO GREAT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two hair dryers in the last 27 years so when I had to buy another this weekend I wondered what all of the \\&quot;ion technology\\&quot; stuff was all about...well...I&#x27;m not sure I love it. My hair is long and fine and I had to use three times the amount of root lifter to get my hair to do anything; pretty much it&#x27;s just plastered to my head!     The other thing I did not like was that the buttons are right where my fingers go so I kept hitting them and changing the settings as I was drying.    A PLUS is that even though my other dryer was 1875 watts this dryer seems much more forceful and it dried my hair \\&quot;over all\\&quot; very quickly without getting super hot. I&#x27;m sure the dryer is much better for my hair than my old dryer, but I just can&#x27;t take this limp hair!    I&#x27;ll update in a few days, maybe it was just a bad weather day....</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m not going to say I don&#x27;t like this dryer because hey it does the job.  What I don&#x27;t like is on hi it doesn&#x27;t blow near as hard as my Revlon dryer.  So I had to get used to this one.....also I have to keep this on Med heat because the hot heat is so hot I feel like either my hair or the dryer is going to start melting.  I love Amazon but I went into my local dollar store after getting this one in and their it was for only $14 dollars.  Overall it does the job and the cord keeper feature is a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer about a year, and it does dry hair, and the heat settings seem to be what they say they are: hot, warm and cool. Also High and Low power are accurate. Unlike some other reviewers, I find that its drying power is fine -- but I have fine hair that dries really fast anyway. However, the retractable cord function has never worked well. The button does not seem to depress all the way, and IF it retracts all the way at all (not a guarantee most days), it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had to keep pushing and pulling to engage the retracting mechanism, which is half-hearted at best. Most times I just give up halfway and wind the cord around the unit because it&#x27;s too big a bother. I have NEVER experienced it retracting so fast that the cord whips around or anything; not anywhere near close to that problem for me!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  In addition to its useful purpose, I like the retracting cord so that when the dryer is put into a drawer, the cord is not getting into everything else in the drawer.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing.  The button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit (by necessity) and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so I could no longer retract the cord.  Other than this inherent drawback, I love that the cord retracts for safety/neatness/space-saving, etc.  Dries efficiently without being smoking hot.</li>
    <li> Pros: Can penetrate and dry thicker hair&lt;br /&gt;  Suitable for straight hair/straightening hair&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap&lt;br /&gt;  Cord makes it neat to keep in the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Loud in your ears&lt;br /&gt;  Diffuser is horrible. Curly girls do not benefit from using it.&lt;br /&gt;  Does not manage frizz well&lt;br /&gt;  Heavy and slides everywhere&lt;br /&gt;  The cord seriously whips around. Beware!</li>
    <li> I placed this on my wishlist and it was purchased for me for Christmas.  I love the color and the cord keeper, however it is very very loud on any setting.</li>
    <li> Love the hot pink!  Different speeds and heat settings are fantastic.  Re-tractable cord works well.</li>
    <li> excellent product. worth the money. haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all. only warning: watch out for that retractable cord..</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get much for $20 these days.  However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast \\&quot;Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.\\&quot;  Well, I don&#x27;t know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It&#x27;s really not a big deal and doesn&#x27;t take much effort on the user&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn&#x27;t be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  &#x3D;o)</li>
    <li> I had this one for over 3 years and it worked great.  It just recently died and I bought the exact same model.  The retractable cord is so nice!</li>
    <li> My 20 yr old dryer died :( and I replaced it with this one. It is wonderful. Works well and the heat settings are easy to change.</li>
    <li> This dryer has great power and a variety of settings.  The retractable cord is a GREAT feature and keep the cords protected so that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled, split, or caught up with other appliance cords!    I like this hair dryer...but my old one (see link below) had a very nice feature that you could not only retract the cord, but also fold the handle up which was perfect for storage and traveling.    [[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairdryer daily since I received it.  I have to say it works well on my long, thick hair.  I am glad that I purchased this rather than something pricier with more bells and whistles.  I really like that it has a retractable cord.  Overall, a good item.</li>
    <li> Good power and heat!  Bulky for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a newer model of the one that we already had that finally stopped working. We loved the older model and are glad that we were able to replace it with this one. It is just what we wanted.</li>
    <li> This dries quickly and the heat is gentle producing hair with less frizz that is sleeker and shinier than  the hair that older dryers produce.    The downsides are the bulk and the size.  I find the size of the dryer sometimes is offputting to move around the head- not impossible but alot better with a smaller dryer.  I also don&#x27;t care for how poorly the labels for the heat and air settings wears- its only a few months old and already there&#x27;s alot of wear due to how my hand usually grips the handle.  I notice this issue alot in Chinese made goods (especially keyboards), but its annoying nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Like  many other of the commenters, my Conair hair dryer quit working after 3 months.  Good luck with customer service.  They&#x27;ll look at it but require you to pay freight both ways.  $20 in freight for a $17 blower!  Doesn&#x27;t sound like a company that is serious about finding problems so that they can improve their future products.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of long hair.  This dryer is very heavy and did not last very long.  It is great for weight lifting.  The dryer literally started to fall apart little by little, but all in all, it did not last; and I only blow dry my hair occasionally!</li>
    <li> This Conair works so much better than most blow dryers.  It is a great color and had a great output.  I was so very impressed with how much quality you get for the price.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier, not cheap plastic at all.</li>
    <li> The price and specs are good, but it is just too noisy.  Much noisier than the average hair dryer.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer because my last Conair had finally conked out after about 15 years.  I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it.  I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting.  The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting.  Something is seriously wrong with that.  Also, the cord was very difficult to retract.  I can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time.  This convinced me that even though a retracting cord may be convenient, it is more trouble than it is worth.</li>
    <li> ugly but works great. wish they had the same model in black</li>
    <li> I had a cord keeper for years.  This is a nice hair dryer with all the options and attachments I need.  It is a bit larger than my older version.  I will keep looking for one that is lighter weight and smaller.  I really, really liked my older one.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: The color looks nice on it and it&#x27;s very professional. There are 3 level intensity of wind for both hot and cool blow, which won&#x27;t overdry my medium long hairs. It also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator( but I don&#x27;t have the need to try them yet).  Con&#x27;s: the handle can&#x27;t fold! I am so used to the folding handle of my mom&#x27;s hair dryer. So I must always keep this in its big box (considerably big compared to other folding handle hair dryers).  Overall, I love this hair dryer.  --UPDATE---  After 5 years, the dryer stops working. No damage/dropping occurred. It just doesn&#x27;t start anymore. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This dryer is very nice.  It&#x27;s true that you need to hold the end of the cord before you push the retractor button as it does snap back quickly and with a lot of force behind it.  However, I like all the settings--it&#x27;s at least ten dollars cheaper than a lot of other comparable products and works great.</li>
    <li> This replaced a still working 10 year old Conair that had a rear screen that collapsed into the drier.  The new one is well worth the money, and the real proof is that my wife likes it for the ion feature.  It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t seem to move the air as quickly as the old dryer, but it dries hair just as fast and is slightly quieter.</li>
    <li> Works well, and even the cool shot is very powerfull. This runs around 1800 watts and does not work in other voltages execpt for US. (Does not work for 50-210/240). Only works in 60-110V. The cord is long enough.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer started making a buzzing sound when I moved it, so my husband said, \\&quot;time for a new one.\\&quot;  Bought this one while at Wal-Mart, thinking the retractable cord would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord - retracts about halfway, then you either have to pull it out and push the button again (and hope it does it), or push the cord in yourself.  Kind of a hassle just to hide the cord (which doesn&#x27;t really matter to me since mine goes in a drawer every day anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed - doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as quickly as my old one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - I cannot believe how LOUD this dryer is.  My eardrums hurt, as if I had just gone to a rock concert and stood by the speakers.  My daughter (4) covered her ears (in the next room!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even use this thing today becuse of how loud it was, in fear of causing hearing loss (haha).  After much research, I picked up the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Hair Dryer, model RV544.  Used it tonight and it&#x27;s wonderful!  Very fast, and pretty quiet for a hairdryer.  It&#x27;s not advertised as quiet on the box, but reviewers said it was and they were right.  No retractable cord, but I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this blow dryer, it&#x27;s just right, not too big or too heavy and the ionizer helps so it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair like my old hair dryer. I really like that it has 3 temperatures and attachments, and the cord keeper is great. I also love the color. I am very satisfied with this product and will definitley buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and I&#x27;m not all that impressed with it. It&#x27;s performance is decent (dries hair quickly with less frizz), but it&#x27;s design and construction leave something to be desired.    Issues:  1) It&#x27;s really heavy so be prepared for your arm to get a work-out when using it.  2) The placement of the cord retractor button is really bad. If you set the dryer down on it&#x27;s side sometimes the retractor button will get bumped causing your dryer to slide across the counter.  3) About 1 month ago the on/off button popped off. I was able to stick it back on, but it will occasionally still fall off during use.  4) The cord retractor is somewhat dangerous and also will get stuck occasionally during cord retraction.  5) The placement of the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; requires you to hold the dryer awkwardly to keep from accidentally pressing it.    Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of preference in design, but this dryer has been  very awkward and difficult for me to use. I just don&#x27;t think that the performance is good enough to put up with all of the negatives. I will probably shell out a little more money the next time I purchase a hair dryer and get something better.</li>
    <li> This is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve bought in more than 30 yrs and it&#x27;s great.  Very happy with it.  Don&#x27;t go to work with wet hair anymore.  Also, nice blue color.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works just fine.  I&#x27;ve used a Conair product for years before it finally died and this is the replacement model I purchased mid December of 2007.  Just as other users have noted, be very careful of the retractable cord as it does go WAY too fast and has a tendency to sock you in the face or hand as it flies in.  But worse yet, the retractable cord broke after only 2 months of use.  Now it is permanently retracted and I can&#x27;t seem to unjam it.  That means I can&#x27;t pull the power cord out and therefore can&#x27;t use the dryer.  What a piece of junk!  Of course the 2 year warranty asks you to mail this heavy sucker back and then pay $5 to cover shipping back to you.  Meanwhile, the hairdryer is only $20...  you do the math.  Another fault is that the lettering on the dryer (high, low, hot, cool, etc) rubs off within days.  Not a big deal, but another cheap factor.  I&#x27;d still buy Conair, just not the retractable cord version.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  Not sure why complaints about the cord - directions say to hold the plug.  If you don&#x27;t hold the plug of course it&#x27;s gonna snap back and hit you.  As for the noise.  Yes, it is noisy but you are using it for a short time and it is just as noisy as any other hair dryer.  And it is not too heavy.  I think it dries my hair fast and arm does not get tired.  All in all, I would recommend this dryer.  I love that it is pink, the cord retracts and takes up little space for storage.</li>
    <li> This dryer has the features I wanted, and works like I hoped. It dries my long hair quickly, though I don&#x27;t know for sure it would do the same for super-thick hair. Also, combined with the right technique and product, it leaves hair is smooth and shiny. Some people have complained about the weight; I haven&#x27;t noticed it being heavy at all, and I consider myself puny.    I like the retractable cord, although I learned the hard way to hold the plug while retracting. It does have two speeds (besides off) and three heat settings, along with a cool shot button. It also uses ceramic technology, though not tourmaline, for those who are up on those kinds of things.    All that said, my point of comparison was a 15-year-old dryer that was probably cheap to begin with. If you&#x27;re looking for something nice, I&#x27;m sure there are better dryers out there, including better Conair models. But this does exactly what I need. I found this on sale for around $15 and I feel like I got a great deal for that money.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer to replace another one that I bought online (the previous was not powerful enough). I really like the cord feature but it can hurt you if you aren&#x27;t careful. It retracts VERY quickly! Overall, I love the blow dryer and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> First, it&#x27;s red and not blue. Second, it&#x27;s large, very heavy and loud. Third, after 3 months&#x27; use, it died on me. Vendor offers no return/replacement after 30 days.</li>
    <li> This thing crapped out after only 5 months of use!  Would not buy if I were you.</li>
    <li> Really nice product, but some times the cord retainer button not working properly</li>
    <li> The dryer worked great. Heavier than I&#x27;m used to.  I followed the directions when retracting the cord the first time:(to hold the plug end in one hand and push the retraction button with the other), but the button wouldn&#x27;t press down easily, so I let go of the plug end to use 2 fingers to press the button (and cautiously turned my head away just in case).  But the plug end whipped around and clobbered me in the face anyways, so watch that feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a second hairdryer to leave at my second home, figuring that it was cheap and had a retractable cord to save space.  I also own a Conair Infiniti 213L.  For the price, the 209R is a decent buy.  However, for $50 more, I highly prefer the Infiniti 213L.  Otherwise, the 213X (the cheaper equivalent to the 213L) is only $16 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Conair with Ion Shine and Ceramic Technology&lt;br /&gt;Retractable cord; as others noted, it retracts violently though - hold the plug while retracting&lt;br /&gt;Removable, washable filter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still surprisingly heavy compared to Conair&#x27;s other $15 models.&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Cold Shot\\&quot; is lukewarm&lt;br /&gt;No ion on/off button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison to the 213L:&lt;br /&gt;209R has a limited 2-year warranty, while the 213L has a 5-year warranty&lt;br /&gt;209R does not \\&quot;calm\\&quot; my hair down as much.&lt;br /&gt;209R takes a little longer to dry, seems less powerful (?)&lt;br /&gt;209R does have a smaller \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button, which is better than the 213L (too easy to press on the 213L)&lt;br /&gt;213L has an ion on/off button.&lt;br /&gt;213L&#x27;s cold shot is actually cold.&lt;br /&gt;213L is about equivalent in weight, though, so for those complaining that the 209R is heavy, they&#x27;re *all* heavy.&lt;br /&gt;213L is much, much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;213L has Swarovski crystals (silly, I know, but pretty).&lt;br /&gt;213L does NOT have a retracting cord, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this one, because $20 was my \\&quot;price point.\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t want to spend $35 (or $68) on a \\&quot;throwaway\\&quot; hairdryer.  But in a pinch, this one works OK.  However, if I was thinking long-term (who buys hair dryers like candy anyway?), I&#x27;d go with the 213L.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000E8PG98 Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 Watt Hair Dryer with Ceramic Technology and Cord Keeper]]For the money, this dryer was OK.  It was a bit too noisy on high speed, and the two speeds instead of three was unfortunate.  It is a little unbalanced, but not so heavy that I won&#x27;t get used to the balance.  I&#x27;m not sure that it dried my hair any faster and I have short hair.</li>
    <li> I replaced an earlier version of this model, and I&#x27;m grateful that this version has a reset button on the built-in safety breaker.  The previous model&#x27;s breaker malfuntioned and if I didn&#x27;t know an engineer, I would have had to replace it a month after it&#x27;s purchase.  I hope that this reset button prevents this from happening.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> Quick drying heat, retracting cord so it doesn&#x27;t make a messy room. Beautiful dark blue colors,  easy switch to choose how hot you want it and how powerful. Good value for your money</li>
    <li> Broke after using it for two weeks</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son&#x27; s girlfriend for her birthday she barely used it and it stopped working!  I am very disappointed in the product and in Amazon, I have been a very good customer and I can&#x27;t return it do to the date has passed.....really! Guess what I gave it to her on July 8th and it stopped working only 1 week ago she used for just 2 weeks!!!!!! It&#x27;s a piece!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Conair hair dryer with the Cord Keeper in the past 5 or so years and I have been very pleased with both of them. I had the smaller model with the fold up handle first which traveled with me AND was used almost daily at home until something went wrong with the plug. This one is heavier but I like the way you can adjust the heat and the speed settings, rather than just high/low/off. I LOVE the internal Cord Keeper - would hate to ever go back to one without that feature!</li>
    <li> Great item!  Works like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> cord disappears, this one is just fine.  My sister was visiting and said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s the shortest hair dryer cord I&#x27;ve ever seen.&amp;#34; until I showed her how it retracks and pulls out at will.  Decent hairdryer/decent price.</li>
    <li> Great product -- love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because i liked the price and the fact that it had a cord that rolled into itself.  Unfortunately, because the cord goes into the handle (a function that I never even use!) it is a very short cord.  Make sure to measure the distance and compare it with these specs before buying.  The cord is so short that I can&#x27;t plug it into my wall jack near the floor and stand up to blow dry my hair.  Also this dryer is extremely loud.  I would recommend this as a second blow dryer for travel maybe but it&#x27;s probably worth it to spend the extra money to get a better model.  I wish I had...</li>
    <li> Thank you so very much , your service was excellent and the dryer also was excellent. We will highly recommend you to our friends.</li>
    <li> works, retractable cord is nice</li>
    <li> The blow dryer itself is fine. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it and it works well. However, I bought it because the cord is supposed to retract. Most of the time about a quarter of the cord won&#x27;t retract, and sometimes it is more than that.</li>
    <li> love not having to mess with the cord</li>
    <li> The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap.  After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug.  Since it&#x27;s more than 60 days, I can&#x27;t return it to the store.  And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I&#x27;ll just toss it in the trash.  I will not waste my time or more money on Conair.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Does a great job. Easy to operate.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is ok. It does the job but I wish I spent the extra $10.00 for the Conair Ion cord keeper. I previously had that hair dryer and it worked amazing. The cord keeper is good however the &amp;#34;drying power&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t seem that good. It takes a bit longer to dry my hair than the norm.&lt;br /&gt;However the item came fast and it is was as described so no complaints there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! It&#x27;s kinda loud but a great product!! Would buy another. Loved the red! The cord goes back up the dryer. Loved that feature.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I loved the hidden real away cord.  Works great and puts out LOTS of air.  Drys hair fast. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a year and I&#x27;ve had to take it apart three times to a fix a jammed cord. It dries my hair just fine, I wish it retractable cord feature was a little more reliable</li>
    <li> Just bought this at Bartell&#x27;s and tried it out. I am planning on returning it asap. Here&#x27;s why: SUPER loud- it makes my ear buzz!! If that was not an issue, here is what else I don&#x27;t like: the air stream is surprisingly weak, the cord is too short, and it doesn&#x27;t have a good \\&quot;feel\\&quot; in the hand. The whole thing feels cheap- which maybe is because it was cheap :)</li>
    <li> Great dryer,  works extremely well,,,,  love the automatic rewind.... works great, just follow the directions.....Very satisfied with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Buy this blow dryer and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.  It&#x27;s loud but so what!  Your hair dries so quickly, who cares?  This is absolutely the very best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used and the retractable cord is simply great.  If this one breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another one of them.  To those of you who are complaining about receiving a blue blow dryer when the picture on Amazon is pink...well, it does state on that same page the blow dryer you will receive is BLUE.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just me but it has no power it takes me 3 times as long to dry hair with this dryer than my other one.  The cord retracts too fast and whips around to hit your hand.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My professional grade hair dryer died, so I just picked up a dryer from a local retail store.  This was the best dryer they had available for sale.  I wish I had kept the box so I could return it!  This dryer is horrible.  It is extremely heavy and has a super short cord.  With my old dryer, I was able to dry and style my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes.  With this dryer it takes over 35!  It leaves my hair feeling dry and crunchy.  Also, I&#x27;m not able to style it as well with a brush while drying, so I have to spend extra time styling with a flat iron.  I would suggest that you spend a little more to get a better quality dryer.  I think this would only be good for men, or women with super short hair.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair from years ago that was on its way out so I decided to buy another one. It is very efficient and powerful and I love the cord keeper feature. I thought the opening was a little larger, but other than that, so far so good.</li>
    <li> Overall, love the dryer. I do wish there was a hook for hanging and ultimately would love to see a medium heat setting. The dryer really does make my hair shine! Good deal for the cost and the retractable cord is a a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This is an okay dryer. I was a bit concerned about purchasing due to the reviews on it being heavy...but it isn&#x27;t heavy. Performance is good but nothing stellar. No problems retracting cord...just hold the end of it so it doesn&#x27;t flop. There is some power behind it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the most off putting thing about this dryer is the noise! It honestly reminded me of the shriek of the Nazgul. I got used to it after the initial shock. So far so good-seems to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is not pink but more of a hot red. And it looks kind of a cheap plastic.    However, this blow dries my hair pretty fast. So, it does what&#x27;s required of it!    I took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer. If you live in a house, that&#x27;s probably not a big deal; but if your apt has thin walls... you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night.    I really like the fact that the cord is retractable. Word of caution: hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place. And if you&#x27;re not careful, this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast.    Lastly, a couple reviews have mentioned that this Conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers. My old hair dryer must have been pretty heavy too then because I don&#x27;t really notice it. Either way, at least it&#x27;ll give you a work out!</li>
    <li> I had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me.  I went in search of it at all the local stores.  I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I bought a couple other ones that I ended up returning, because I didn&#x27;t like them.  Therefore, I was pretty happy when I found this close match on Amazon.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> the cord is convenient, but its not long enough. and the power is not strong enough (the blowing action).  i would have returned it but i was moving at the time and didnt have time to do it.</li>
    <li> Love the retractable cord and the dryer quickly dries my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  probably good but it&#x27;s  actually a pinkish/purplish...I&#x27;m  a dude...not for me...</li>
    <li> Cord button broke after a few months. My wife&#x27;s Remington tiny paisley printed hairdryer works much better. For the price it&#x27;s not bad but I won&#x27;t buy again. Lasted many years but has now been producing a burnt smell when I use it. I clean it often but it&#x27;s lived a long enough life.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  This hair dryer didn&#x27;t last 3 months. Also, the cord keeper stopped working right away.  I have bought Conair products in the past and will do so again just not this hairdryer.</li>
    <li> It worked great for drying my hair, but the only flaw it had was that the cord retracted too fast. Also, the button for the cord retraction is placed awkwardly so you can&#x27;t push it while holding the hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I do like that this is a powerful dryer. However it is really really loud and quite heavy. My biggest complaint is that the attachments are nearly impossible to attach. I have curly hair and quite often diffuse it, this dryer is pretty much worthless to me if I can&#x27;t easily attach the diffuser...</li>
    <li> I have a few of these for different rooms. Works well and cord retractor makes cleaning easy.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer about a month ago, and it works really well. It heats up, had good air pressure, and the cool setting works well also. The only complaint I have is the retractable cord. The button is a bit touchy--it only works if you push on one part of it. It is also a bit difficult for me to squeeze hard enough with one hand. The cord itself is a decent length, but it is easy to pull it past the red tape that warns you not to pull any further.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t get cheep like me, this hair dryer  is loud! Even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the Infinity Cord-Keeper , it&#x27;s the bigger that&#x27;s better. The larger version acts like a muffler. Spend the extra $20 bucks. I did, the real deal is now on order.</li>
    <li> This is a back up for the one just like it, only a different color. Lots of power.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the hair dryer (and she is fussy about such appliances) and my little two year old loves the retracting cord!  Good dryer at a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer last week; it does dry my hair much quicker and I like that it has 3 heat settings - including &#x27;cool&#x27;.  But I will be returning it as it is very heavy and the cord isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me this as a gift and I was a bit hesitant on using it at first because I have extremely thick, long, and curly hair which is prone to frizzing. I tried it out and loved it! My hair felt quite gross while I was drying it (hard to explain), but afterward it looked amazing and was so soft! I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone, even those who have the curse of th curly hair. lol</li>
    <li> photo showed red.  What came was pink.  Most guys won&#x27;t be happy with a pink hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Saved me a trip to the store. Price was comparable to store items of similar design/claims. I think Conair has quality products, and the retractable cord is convenient and works dependably. Has plenty of drying power. Not an ideal travel dryer, as it is appropriately larger than small, under-powered travel dryers. Perfect for daily home use. Last Conair dryer lasted 5+ years. Similar design and features. I think that&#x27;s good durability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that the box my hair dryer came in looks like it was run over by a truck! The picture of my product was pink, I wanted pink that is why I ordered it. The actual product is blue...not pretty! I don&#x27;t know if it will work or not because it looks so beat up. If it doesn&#x27;t I will return it! I was going to go ahead and wrap up the hair dryer for my granddaughter...then I notice a sticker on it. It is an offer for a free travel case...IT EXPIRED IN 2008! You sent me a piece of four year old JUNK... the box had been torn and taped back up. I&#x27;m VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON for sending this out!!!! I thought I was getting a new hair dryer! I&#x27;m going to return it!!!!! And I may never buy anything from here again!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well.  The various settings dry soaked hair as well as damp hair.  The price was right.  The cord-keeper is a practical aspect...no more wrapping the cord around the dryer.</li>
    <li> I have no regrets about purchasing this hair drier. It does not frizz my hair at all and is easy and quick to use :)</li>
    <li> I love it for what it does, and I love it because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love the retractable cord!!  It does go back in fast so I hang on the the plug (lightly) until its retracted so the plug doesn&#x27;t swing around and hit something.</li>
    <li> I am only keeping this dryer bc I used it and my husband threw away the box.&lt;br /&gt;A little history, I had the earlier version of this dryer, about 6 years ago! It just went out! That is awesome bc I am hard on my hairdryers. This one, or so I thought, would be the same.....only a little better i thought bc it is newer model.&lt;br /&gt;False.&lt;br /&gt;This one, even though it says its the same power, it can&#x27;t be. IT doesn&#x27;t blow nearly as much air, not as hot, and is SOOOOO loud I find myself dreading to turn it on. It also doesn&#x27;t have a place to clean off the lint that accumulates behind the blower. I assume it will not last long, and might be done with Conair after this one. Boo.</li>
    <li> this got here super fast and it gets really hot just what a girl needs to look her best got a red one close enough to pink for me</li>
    <li> Great dryer. Really like how there is a constant cool setting that doesn&#x27;t have to be pressed the whole time. The different heat setting are nice as well. And the cord keeper, oh my gosh---totally radical.  No more wrapping the cord around the dryer for me (I hope)</li>
    <li> In the days when I had hair to blow dry,most handhelds just either were too hot,or just plain sucked. I got this for my wife and she has beautiful thick hair,if she&#x27;s happy with it,it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blow dryer.  I have never noticed any difference of any dryer from the ones my mother used on me as a child in the early 90&#x27;s to all the new &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; technology.  Let your hair air dry until it&#x27;s about half dry, dry the dryer with a paddle brush and only point the dryer down on medium heat.  It&#x27;s all the same.  I like the cord keeper and the bright color.</li>
    <li> Not like my other Conair 1875 - quality is much less than the original. It is loud and does not have as much power.  I paid the same for my other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; Conair.  This is used at a vacation home, so not that big of a deal.  If I had to use this every day, I would definitely return this item.</li>
    <li> Great price, and if this one lasts as long&lt;br /&gt;as my other one did, it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Works great!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now. I like the retractable cord, 3 heat settings, and blower settings. Nice weight, doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap.</li>
    <li> my Conair dryer quit working after several years, it was no question that I would buy another Conair product.  I love this one.  inexpensive and drys my hair perfectly.  I am glad I bought this model.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was quick too.... I only waited 2 days for it and then it was no more ponytails for me!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is quite powerful.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a replacement for an older Conair.  She loves the speed and heat choices.  Very light and easy to use.  Also very easy to clean by removing the intake cover for the motor.  Some attachments included is a plus.</li>
    <li> As my title says, this is almost a cord keeper.  I was replacing an old cord keeper model and this is almost exactly the same.  Except that when you retract the cord, a good 6 inches sticks out.  I think this is intentional and really seems to defeat the purpose.  I can buy a hairdryer for much less money without this option.  I payed for to get more and you really don&#x27;t.  The dryer itself works fine but the cold shot button doesn&#x27;t always make the air very cold.  This hairdryer is only &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer--it has 3 different settings of heat and a \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot; button, and 3 different air intensities. I have very thick hair that is a little longer than shoulder length, and this dryer does the job in 30 minutes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers about the cord--it is convenient, but you do need to be careful when you retract it. I have to feed the cord into mine at the end of the cord. That being said, I still think it&#x27;s a good hair dryer and the cord is a plus, too!</li>
    <li> I would have given this a better rating, because the dryer performs just fine. I especially like the variable speeds and heat settings.     CAUTION: Be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug.</li>
    <li> The dryer works well, but the cord retractor no longer works after 2 months.  I&#x27;m no longer able to lock the cord once it&#x27;s pulled out, so this hair dryer isn&#x27;t usable.  I&#x27;m now buying a new one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord keeper.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about a month ago. It worked great! Dried my hair quickly with no problems. Then one day, I plugged it in to use it and nothing happened. The hair dryer wouldn&#x27;t work. I pressed the reset button and tried everything. Luckily I kept my old hair dryer (a Revlon) just in case! I would not buy this product again...I contacted Conair a week ago and they said I&#x27;d hear back in 3 business days...haven&#x27;t heard anything yet. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I would give this hair dryer 5 stars for the money, but the cord keeper is defective.  It broke after 2 months.  The cord will not stay pulled out anymore.  That&#x27;s kind of a big problem.  Now it is useless.</li>
    <li> The retractable cord has already stopped working...probably haven&#x27;t used the dryer 10 times. It won&#x27;t stay out!</li>
    <li> Awful sound and no power.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected... great.  The individual heat / fan speed controls are a very nice feature.</li>
    <li> It was way too loud, does not dry the hair as fast as other hair dryers. It pulls way too much current making all the places were I have used it tryp the brakers..... Was not happy at all and gave it away</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and absolutely love it, nice color, light weight and love the retraction cord, awesome blow dryer</li>
    <li> For the price, a very good and flexible hair dryer. The retractable cord, the many levels of heat and volume add up to a very functional unit.</li>
    <li> This model is my favorite dryer. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Still using this after a year.....love the retractable cord</li>
    <li> Thought it was a little heavy when i first used it. I got used to using it and i don&#x27;t think that now. It&#x27;s very easy to use. Has 3 different heat settings. Has a low and a high speed. The cord keeper feature is great, saves a lot of space. I&#x27;d recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works  great for curling my hair with the diffuser. Other blow dryers make my hair frizzy, but this one does not.</li>
    <li> nice hair dryer &amp; a nice color too I like the retractable cord easy to keep it neat</li>
    <li> In past we had a Conair 1600 Watt, it lasted over 18 years. This appears to be just as good. The retractable cord is not perfect, but we will not use as the dryer will hang at vanity. The older versions had a loop to hang, these new ones do not. So we placed a ziptie for a hanger.</li>
    <li> With everything requiring cords these days this hair dryer saves me space in the bathroom.  It is perfect for drying and styling my long thick hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Does not blow hard enough for me. Bought a different brand and it works great!</li>
    <li> I use this hairdryer 3-4 times a week. Great power and is quite nice...plus it&#x27;s in my favorite color, red.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord.  The high speed is great!  I was surprised by how quiet it is.</li>
    <li> great power, dries hair fast. love the retractable cord!</li>
    <li> Not a favorite of mine. Cord is on the shorter side. It&#x27;s a heavier dryer. Also is pretty loud! I&#x27;m a hairstylist so I&#x27;ve had plenty of hair dryers and this one is cute but will probably be getting a different one for at home soon.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dyer just like this and it finally died, loved it so much I bought it again, it&#x27;s a darn good hair dryer and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Hairdryer was really loud and didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster for the extra noise. I would spend my money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> nice retractable cord</li>
    <li> WAY TOO LOUD. Cord keeper is a nice touch but returned it to prevent hearing loss. Going back to using a hair band for the cord.</li>
    <li> It has different heat settings and blower setting and  the cord retracts so I don&#x27;t have it tangled in other things in my closet.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Works just like my old one but the cord retraction on this new one is legit. Actually rips the plug straight out of the outlet. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; bout! :) I&#x27;m obsessed. Why did I wait so long?!?</li>
    <li> By far the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve used and for the price is definitely worth getting one of these bad boys!  Make sure to clean the back every now and then just place against your vacuum hose to get excess hair and debris!</li>
    <li> Bright red, not pink. Works great, although a little loud.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my old Conair hair dryer. I like the 1875 models, as they are usually more powerful and work more quickly. I do not recommend this model, however. Although it is an 1875 power, it works like one of the smaller, less powerful models. And this one is terribly, terribly loud. I&#x27;m actually concerned that I might suffer hearing loss if I were to use this on a daily basis. I&#x27;ll be returning this one.</li>
    <li> Bought (2) of these SAME Dryers at Sears a month age. They were Fire Engine &amp;#34;&amp;#34;RED&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  Looked Fine,&lt;br /&gt;This one came &amp;#34;&amp;#34;BRIGHT &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;PINK&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy,  and I am  embarrassed</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great price. Retracting cord a little hard to get use to. Don&#x27;t retract it most of the time.</li>
    <li> Really loud!! Cord started sticking when retracting after a couple of weeks. After about two months it stopped retracting at all. After some effort, I was able to force the cord all the way back in, and now the cord won&#x27;t pull out at all!</li>
    <li> It replaced my old ConAir ionShine with retracting cord. I was able to buy those (the old ones) at the big W (you know where) for a reasonable price, but they would die about every 6 to 12 months. When the last one died, they didn&#x27;t have any on the shelf (go figure). So I tried to find a replacement with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it&#x27;s life in the cabinet under my sink, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fold in half like my old ones hasn&#x27;t been a problem, so far. In fact, it&#x27;s probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD). Only gave it 4 stars because, well, it&#x27;s not made of gold (which would probably melt from the heat anyway).</li>
    <li> Was not the red one I wanted, but is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time. I&#x27;ve only had it for one month so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last but so far I&#x27;ve had no problems. This hair dryer is great. I&#x27;m not sure if it is as good as the more expensive brands as I have never paid over $20 for one but it definitely gets the job done. Oh and I looove the retractable cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for less than a year and its button functions  are not working anymore even though the hairdryer itself is in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame that Conair uses such cheap materials for their products.</li>
    <li> Love the cheap price. Yes it&#x27;s a bit loud but so are other hair dryers. Won&#x27;t lose my Barbie pink hair dryer!</li>
    <li> work great and I&#x27;m very satisfied,Great seller! Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and Quality product.Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this hair dryer.  I ordered because of retractable cord.  very noisy</li>
    <li> This replaced the same item that I had had used daily for at least 10 years before it died on me! Love that I can leave it plugged in and the cord it not in  the way of other items on vanity surface.</li>
    <li> Love the retractable cord easy to use and performs the way one would expect. Like the color too and the fact that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a decent little hairdryer for the cost. But from the picture, I thought it would be pink. It&#x27;s not pink, it&#x27;s red.</li>
</ol>
