<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this Facial Oil cleanser! Clean my eye make up very easily and without irritating my skin!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this again! It completely broke my face out.</li>
    <li> Love it as hand moisturizer and use at night time. Love the smell and ingredients. Didn&#x27;t like as makeup &#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;Ove</li>
    <li> I was a bit leery about putting oil on my dry face to clean it. I have combination skin tending more to dry as I am 54 years old. I like that fact that Intsa Natural sends you an email with recommendations to use their products AND they do no blow up your email either! So following their recommendations, I used about 5 pumps in my palm and rubbed my hands together a bit and rubbed it on my dry face and neck in small circles.  Added a couple of more pumps to used to remove my eye makeup, I use a lot of mascara.  Used a warm wash cloth to wipe everything off and all my makeup and eye makeup came off!  I did use a little bit of my Chanel eye make up remover to remove the last traces of mascara, but I am fine with that.  I was still skeptical at how well this removed makeup so I used the Intsa Natural Rose Water Toner to tone and remove any excess make up.  I was very surprised at how little make up was left on my face and neck. Way less than using my go to face wash!  No worries about having an oily face.  My face did not feel oily after cleaning.  I do have a couple of dry spots, around my nose and at my temples.  After three days of using this morning and night those dry spots are gone. The product has a very light pleasant scent and that is due to the ingredients used not added perfume smells.  I would highly recommend this product if you have any type of combination skin</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical about using an oil to cleanse my face, but it really works well.  InstaNatural products are excellent.  The customer service is awesome too.  I especially love to use this in the winter when my skin is dry.  Leaves your skin soft and clean!</li>
    <li> So, I am in LOVE this this cleanser! I was quite skeptical to use an oil cleanser. It works wonderfully. I have been using for a few weeks now and my skin is so clear and soft! It smells divine too! I love using it with my Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Very happy with results!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a facial cleanser this product is for you. It&#x27;s not over oily smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film or heaviness on your skin after washing it off. Great product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  My face looks and feels better and cleaner after cleansing with this product.  The smell is amazing.  This is an oil cleanser but it is not too thick.  It spreads nicely over my face.  I love the pure ingredients also!  I am a  fan.  I look forward to purchasing more products in the line in the future!  Shipping was fast.  I also received an email with directions on how to use the product!!!  TOP NOTCH COMPANY!!!  THANK YOU for making a wonderful product and for wonderful customer service!!!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the stuff. Cleaning with oil seems counter intuitive but it dissolves dirt and makeup better.</li>
    <li> This facial oil cleanser works great to clean my face. It&#x27;s gentle and made my skin smooth and feel moisturised when I was done washing my face. Very nice value as this is a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I really like this Facial Oil Cleanser!  I have dry skin so after massaging into my skin, I leave it on my face for 30 secs. to a minute, then I remove with a warm, wet cloth. Works well at removing makeup and leaves my skin feeling moisturized.  It smells great and I love the ingredients.  I have used many cleansers in the past and ended up with dry, flaky skin, but not with this one.  I am so happy I tried it and will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> wow, love this cleanser and the essential oils in it smell so wonderful..never use a oil cleanser before made a believe in me will diffidently order again llove it feels makes my face feel so soft..</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It has a nice clean scent and is very moisturizing to your skin.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviewers...it&#x27;s not a bad product and does have some great oils within the ingredient list.  However, it&#x27;s probably more suitable as a facial oil rather than facial oil cleanser and makeup remover.  My personal opinion is the consistency is way too thick to be considered a cleanser oil.  I could just use either olive, coconut or grapeseed oil to remove eye makeup and would probably have similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used DHC cleansing oil and loved it because it&#x27;s water soluble.  I wanted to give this oil cleanser a try because it&#x27;s all natural and organic BUT...this oil is NOT water soluble.  My skin feels the same after attempting to clean my face with this oil vs coconut and olive oil.  Like I mentioned earlier, this is probably a decent oil for just overall moisturizer for the skin but I definitely would not consider this a facial cleansing oil.  I&#x27;m considering returning this and getting DHC again.</li>
    <li> very bad! I don&#x27;t know how to use it! wasted my more clean-cream. I dislike it!</li>
    <li> I bought it after reading the reviews. It&#x27;s not bad but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Just doesn&#x27;t go well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I am mildly obsessed with this cleansing oil! After years of using all sorts of drugstore brand facial products in an effort to combat my skin&#x27;s ever changing condition (dry, oily, broken out, dull, etc.) and doing some research, I decided to switch over to a much more natural approach to skincare. I searched for products that had natural, organic if possible, ingredients to use on my skin in place of the chemical/paraben/alcohol laden products I had been using. I ordered a set of products from Amazon that I have been using in tandem for about a week, and I am already noticing a HUGE difference in the appearance and condition of my skin. The entire regiment starts with cleansing with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing my face was a chore, but with this, it is a luxury. I feel like I am getting a mini-spa facial every night when I put this on with my fingers and massage it over my face and eyes. It melts away my makeup easily, and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not at all oily! I use a baby washcloth with warm water to gently wipe away the product when I am done applying it, and it takes all of the impurities, dirt, and makeup away without stripping my skin of its moisture. It smells like a spa facial oil treatment, and I look forward to using it every night. I follow this up with the Foxbrim Natural Facial Toner and a natural facial moisturizer I also ordered from Amazon. A couple of nights a week, I rub a teaspoon or so of Manuka honey over my face and let it sit for 5-10 minutes as a natural mask between cleansing and toning,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product! I will definitely be replenishing when it is done, and I so appreciate a company that cares about making sure that the products they make are as beneficial to the skin as they are effective!</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;m a lifetime fan of InstaNatural facial products.But if you have oily or combination skin, you may not want to use this facial oil cleanser on a daily basis. I do not use make up, so I cannot speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness as a make up remover.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff. I will never use soap on my face again to remove makeup. With oils, it comes right off, and this product has a very pleasant fragrance!</li>
    <li> A great facial cleanser and make up remover combined in one. It leaves your skin smooth and refreshed after using.</li>
    <li> Absolutely exceeded expectations! I NEVER thought I would be &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; with oil. The results have been remarkable and I use it also on my body and in my bath. I recently moved to an extremely cold climate and am staying in a hotel which has done a number of my skin. Skin care is really important to me and its really hard to find a cleanser that will get the makeup off, not strip my skin, and leave it feeling clean all at the same time. Well, I need not look any more. My skin is happy.</li>
    <li> Cleans really nice! Make sure you use a wash cloth to remove the make up and dirt!</li>
    <li> I switched from my Almay eyemakeup remover to this natural oil cleanser to help my eyelids stay hydrated .  I really like how it works and feels.</li>
    <li> Works well as an eye make-up remover and skin cleanser. It&#x27;s a nice treat for dry skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> Compared with MAC and DHC&#x27;s cleansing oil, this one is too greasy for me.</li>
    <li> Removes waterproof makeup easily and smells great! I like to pump the oil cleanser onto my hands and rub it into my face to remove my makeup rather than onto cotton pads to wipe my face. When I think that I have removed my makeup, I use tissue to wipe the oil off and rinse my face off with water. Whether or not you continue with a different cleanser is a personal choice. The oil cleanser smells like rosemary to me in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
    <li> the scent is way too strong, it gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> This facial cleansing oil removes all of my makeup and makes my skin feel fresh and clean without any dryness or residue. Also, their customer service is the best ever!</li>
    <li> I use this with my facial brush</li>
    <li> I have acne prone combination skin and very sensitive eyes. I decided to try this product because I wanted something more gentle on my skin and eyes. This product is very oily (obviously) and when mixed with water your skin will still feel a bit oily after the fact. However, if you use a cotton pad to wipe away excess product or a hot towel, your skin will feel very soft and smooth. On my heavy days with mascara and eyeliner, it takes me  a bit longer to remove all make up and from time to time it burns my eyes. It may have something to do with what I wear on my eyes that day. Overall, I think this product is okay and I will continue to use it. The reason I am giving this 5 stars instead of 4 is because this company has blown me away with their customer service. They genuinely care about their customers and their satisfaction. They wrote to me asking me if I like the oil and I told them at this time I think it is okay, but that I am not blown away by it. They immediately refunded my money and told me I could keep the product. They want the customers to love the products. It is rare to find companies this customer service oriented with true dedication to their brand. I 100% recommend the company and will be trying other products by this brand.</li>
    <li> It can not wash off with water, I have to use soap twice to remove it!</li>
    <li> i used Josie maran oil cleanser for awhile and never liked it. This stuff however is cheaper and removed makeup better. And doesn&#x27;t taste horrible if you accidentally get on your lips! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Did not like this, a little too oily for me, I don&#x27;t like m face feels oily/ sticky. But the customer service is wonderful. It definitely worth to I&#x27;ve this a trial. Everyone has different preference in skin care. Their eye gel is wonderful....I will said solid company, worth to give their a try. hassle free.</li>
    <li> Please, please, please!!! Read the one-star reviews and trust those. Those are the real facts and true.</li>
    <li> I use this once a day. In the morning. At first I really didn&#x27;t like it. It felt sticky and gunky and gross. Fact is though, I just wasn&#x27;t used to using oil to clean my face. Oil to clean oil? BIZZARE! But it has done its job :) Don&#x27;t be scared if you break out at first. I did. My skin wasn&#x27;t used to it. You have to make sure to wipe your face clean with warm, wet cloth/napkin after using this product. If you leave too much of this product on your face, of course you&#x27;ll feel greasy. WIPE IT OFF! :P That&#x27;s what I do, and this product has worked wonders for me. My face just feels sooo much healthier since I&#x27;ve used Instanatural products.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with the Instanatural cleanser. It removes all my make-up , washes off easily with warm water and leaves my face squeaky clean!</li>
    <li> I received this facial oil cleanser free and for review.  I was unsure about an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; cleanser as it sounds like an oxymoron.  However, it really does work and impressively well.  Whether I am wearing makeup or not, the all natural ingredients gently cleanse my skin.  I feel as if the dirt is being lifted from my pores.  I use a couple sprays and gently e&#x3D;rub it in my face and on my neck.  I have very sensitive skin and it does not cause any type of redness or irritation at all.  I then rinse with warm water and a wash cloth.  I feel refreshed and clean.  my skin is left feeling smooth as opposed to that tight feeling some cleanser leave behind.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing that I will never put soap on my face again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few things more cruel in life than having pimples alongside the wrinkles that come with being in your 50&#x27;s! Over the years I have used all different kinds of cleansers, but regardless of my careful regimen it wouldn&#x27;t prevent the occasional breakout....Until I started using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing can work miracles overnight, and a facial cleanser is no different.  During the first week or so, I experienced a few zits while it was working to clear &amp; cleanse my pores.  But I&#x27;m happy to report that in the 2+ months since then, I have not had a single breakout!  There are no blackheads &amp;  my face is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pump a few drops in my palm, and apply w/my fingertips to remove makeup.  I use a tissue or baby-wipe to remove the dissolved makeup, and followup with a few more drops to clean away any makeup residue &amp; rinse by splashing warm water &amp; patting dry.  Several times a week I apply this oil to a Neutrogena resurfacing pad to keep the skin exfoliated, and to assist serums / creams to work better.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I use a few drops to wash away the moisturizers from the night before - and it provides a terrific texture on which to apply fresh makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing anything I generally refer to the reviews.  I recall one lady saying how hard she worked to remove this oil -- &amp; frankly it confuses me as I can&#x27;t figure why she felt this was necessary - A  simple water rinse suffices.  Using soap behind this product would only erase the positive factors it brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is very reasonable as a bottle lasts a very long time -- After 2 months use I am just half-way thru the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a believer in this product, that I have told my 11 year old grandson to start using this to wash his face ... I figure an ounce of prevention could prevent many of the breakouts that puberty brings.</li>
    <li> Very efficient in removing eye make ups</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this oil cleanser.  It has been the best eye makeup remover I have found. It takes off makeup easily and leaves skin soft and clean. Plus it has natural ingredients! I never really write reviews but I thought so highly of this product and want other people to benefit from it as well.</li>
    <li> This is my new twice daily facial cleanser. I am 56, and have dry skin; and appreciate the high quality oils this product contains. I smooth the cleanser (just a combo of several oils, no soaps) on generously and it cleanses well and easily removes waterproof mascara. I use a warm washcloth to rinse my skin after use. I have bought it twice; my first bottle lasted around 6 months. Highly recommend it-- a safe, chemical free,  effective and reasonable facial cleanser!</li>
    <li> Deep Cleansing Facial Oil Wash. Gently and thoroughly dissolves makeup, dirt, and excess oil without over-drying.  Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients</li>
    <li> Finally a cleanser that removes ALL of my makeup. I used to have to use two different cleansers to get all my makeup off and still be left looking like a raccoon at the end of the day. The best part is I don&#x27;t need to scrub my face for it to work. I just gently massage it on my skin and off comes my makeup while cleaning my face. I was provided with this product to give my honest opinion and I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the top broke and can&#x27;t be fixed.</li>
    <li> This product is not one of my favorites, it is very greasy when applying. It felt like I was applying baby oil to my face, I have acne issues, and this product did make me break out. It didn&#x27;t completely remove my makeup, I had to wash my skin again with my usual soap afterwards,. My suggestion for improving this product would be to make it much less greasy, make it a little &amp;#34;sudsy&amp;#34; so you feel like your washing your face, and improve the makeup remover ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent, and the product arrived promptly</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> My face feel very smooth after I use this facial oil to remove my make up. It also helped my eyelashes grow.</li>
    <li> I love this product. While I no longer have problem acne, I will still get a pimple or two. This product does NOT aggravate that so it makes me wonder how it would have worked when I did have a real problem. I tend to wash my face twice especially when I have makeup on. This is great for the first wash to get the makeup off. The second wash I alternate between a gentle scrub and a gentle wash and if I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup sometimes I just leave it after one wash and my skin feels fabulous whichever I do!</li>
    <li> i found out first hand why this particular facial wash had such amazing views! First off, the smell is divine! It reminds me of rose water and I can&#x27;t get enough of it! Secondly, my skin is super sensitive and I was a little cautious using it be I can very easily get a rash. Thankfully I have not had any issues. It&#x27;s so soft and moisturizing to my skin - I&#x27;ll definitely be re ordering it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months and it is great for my skin. It works well to remove makeup, even waterproof mascara, but mostly I love it because it works so well for dry, sensitive skin. Before using this cleansing oil I had problems with dry, flaky patches on my cheeks. Those dry patches are no longer a problem. It does not cause breakouts for me either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil cleanser before and thought it was totally weird when first using it but it left my skin amazingly soft! It does have a strong scent but it&#x27;s appealing to me so I don&#x27;t mind. Love the stuff from this company!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cleanser Highly Effective leaves your face soft moisturized and just feeling good. I was somewhat skeptical due to the fact that I am still experiencing breakouts in my fifties (so sad) anyway upon using the product I found it to have a nice fragrance and to be a very good cleanser as well as moisturizer. Word of caution.... do not use your good face towels as the ingredients in this tends to lighten your towels dramatically with only a couple of uses. Outside of that wonderful.  I bought  special wash cloth for my face and I will continue use this product.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser for dry skin. It removes makeup beautifully even waterproof mascara. Just one pump goes a long way. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser and perfect for the winter when my skin is super dry.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this product! Allure suggested a much more expensive oil cleanser, and on my hunt for a cheaper version I found InstaNatural. I made sure it was organic and the ingredients were the same and place my order. I haven&#x27;t regretted it since and will definitely continue use.</li>
    <li> Yuck. I applied this to my dry face them massaged it in, then rinsed it off in the shower. It felt very oily and my face did not feel clean. So I used facial wipes. Oh my goodness, the oil did not remove my make up!</li>
    <li> Sorry....I would not buy this again, nor can I use now that I bought it. It&#x27;s very oily, the oil drips down the bottle when you spray on a piece of cotton, and it doesn&#x27;t take off all your make-up, as it claims. I gave it two stars because it smells good, but my face is oily, I need to wash it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed.... I should have taken a picture of myself. Because I know words alone can only sell so much. But a picture speaks.... you know what they say. I will however attempt to give a vivid review of my experience. A little background on me. I am 39, African American and female. I have suffered from acne since I was 11. I have acne scarring thats deep and dark, both large and small. On my forehead, cheeks, chin and neck. I have tried it all. OTC to prescription. The only thing that helped prevent breakouts was pregnancy. After a while I assumed this would be my fate. Years ago I learned of oil washing and took a stab at my own concoctions and failed miserably. But the idea of oil cleansing continued to appeal to me. I stumbled on InstaNatural sometime ago decided to try it out. Not only were the ingredients amazing but the price was well worth the gamble. I &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my face that night and the next morning I saw results. The day after was like whoa. It was by the weeks end that I realized I should have taken a picture. My skin is so beautiful. Even now three months later I have to stare at my reflection because I cant believe its me. My deep acne scars are just about gone and the smaller acne scars have since faded. So if the title of this review has you confused with the star rating then I apologize but let me clear this up for you. I am in love with this cleanser. It is amazing and has done amazing things for my skin. I have even referred a few people, my sister included. Try it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It works great for removing my makeup. Will order again.</li>
    <li> My skin was getting dry, so I decided to use a oil facial cleanser.  It took me a little while to get used to the routine of rubbing the oil on my dry face and rinsing with a wet towel.  My skin feels smooth and moisturized now and I put minimal (and sometimes even none) lotion on afterwards.  I used to get the occasional pimple or cyst.  But after I started using this facial oil, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts of any kind.  It&#x27;s also a good makeup remover.  It thoroughly removes the different types of makeup I use.  I really like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> am ordering more of this wonderful product, ,my makeup comes off so easily</li>
    <li> works great. I was worried that I&#x27;d breakout putting oil on my face but I didn&#x27;t and it leaves my skin smooth with retained moisture which is good for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used. I use to buy the Nude facial oil cleanser, but it&#x27;s a bit expensive, so this is a good alternative! It sounds contradictory, but any acne I have is always less irritated in the morning after I use this the evening before.</li>
    <li> It is a nice natural facial oil, though it does not come off with water, so after washing your skin still feels oily and requires another cleanser (which is not the case with some other facial oils which can serve as the cleanser).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive rosacea type skin. I started using this product a week ago, and have been very happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering from a little acne on my chin area caused by dry skin. I find most moisturizers actually irritate my skin however reduce the acne, and would skip them frequently. Once I started using this product a week ago, within two days the acne was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I had already washed my face in the shower with my normal go to sensitive skin cleanser. I took a small amount of this and covered my face, massaging it in, then took a cotton pad and removed the oil. I was shocked at how much dirt it pulled off. It was like I hadn&#x27;t even washed my face beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is Natural &amp; Organic, that it is easy to use, that it pulls away dirt other cleansers I use have not been, and that I don&#x27;t need to add a product to restore moisture to my face. As stated above, I&#x27;ve already noticed a dramatic improvement in the little acne I did have. My sensitive skin has taken well to it, I&#x27;ve noticed no adverse reactions at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I also used it to remove Urban Decay waterproof liquid liner, and it worked just as well if not better than my normal go to eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Works great but the glass bottle makes me nervous!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product and was even contacted by the company to make sure I loved it! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Very good skin oil cleanser. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser!  I was worried it would make me feel oily but it really doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my skin is noticeably brighter and healthier!  Will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;45 years old, Florida, former smoker. Did not take preventative measures with my skin, so of course I am less than satisfied with how I&#x27;m aging. Makes my skin feel supple and clean, moisturizer goes right on over, doesn&#x27;t sit on top, takes off my eye makeup without having to use a separate product. Also economical a little goes a long way. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is okay for me. I&#x27;ve used several oils and have better experience. The price was good and  i like this brend so I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s okay. When you apply this oil to remove your makeup, i&#x27;d have to pump it at least 4 times to get enough oil to put it all over my face and immediately I would grab a tissue and remove the oil along with makeup. It&#x27;s not great where you&#x27;d feel the OIL on your face, where I&#x27;ve used other oil cleansers where you don&#x27;t feel the oil and you just wash it off, however ingredients are likely the difference...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i&#x27;m okay with it. I use it between this and other cleansers. When I use this oil, i make sure to use a foam cleanser and wash away my makeup. Sometimes even those two doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it off and I&#x27;d have to use the cotton and toner to remove the residues. I don&#x27;t feel fully washed and maybe it&#x27;s because I have a dry skin.... I&#x27;ll continue to use it until i&#x27;m done, but i&#x27;ll be looking for another product to remove my makeup...</li>
    <li> this is a great cleanser, good quality</li>
    <li> Have to be very careful around the eyes or oil gets swept into the eye with lashes. I like a cleanser I can use around my eyes for cleaning. However once oils enter eye difficult to shed oil for awhile and that is uncomfortable.  It&#x27;s like water resistant sunscreens in the eye area. Like the feel and smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.. I will buy more</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft and is great for removing makeup.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and makes my face feel soft and smooth.  I have never used a product that I liked better than this oil cleanser.  I have super dry skin.</li>
    <li> This face cleansing oil has been AMAZING!! I have been struggling for a several years now and have bought countless bottles of many different brands in the store with no luck at all. I was all but hopeless when I saw a pinterest idea of cleansing with oil. I dont have time to make my own so I looked around and this had the best reviews so I took a chance and BAM! Problem solved! And am so very happy to have found a solution and found this product. It smells so good and is so gentle on my sensative skin. I will never go back to foamy store brands again. I have struggled with oily skin all my life and to find that cleansing with oil was the answer still amazes me! Thank you so much for this wonderful product. I will be a customer for life! :)</li>
    <li> I actually wanted to begin oil cleansing as its a good way to clean the skin and keep it balanced (preventing acne and other problems) so I went with this. I actually stopped using my salicylic acid scrub to make sure this cleanser worked. So far I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks and even after a sweaty workout, my face is left both clean and soft. I&#x27;m not getting that waxy feeling one normally gets after face washing. I use it in the shower and leave it on for a few minutes and slowly wipe it off as I shower. It also smells like something from an Aveda spa!</li>
    <li> I love that it is natural and free of the chemicals so many cosmetics contain. The scent is not strong or off-putting as some natural products can be. A natural product, this cleanser contains the following key active ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;+ Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Lavendar Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Tamanu Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Hemp Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Sea Buckthorn Oil&lt;br /&gt;+ Geranium Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;I also found great use for this as a makeup brush cleaner as I currently have a sensitivity to lavender and it gave me a slight headache.</li>
    <li> Love this. Will buy again. I do believe I like Josie Maran brand best.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for getting close to 50 yrs old. Love it!</li>
    <li> Have used oils for makeup removal for a long time now - this is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Did not remove my makeup. Heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use many oils so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I like the way it feels on my face after I use it.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product to clean my face and while it did an okay job it didn&#x27;t take off my mascara. I, however, love this product as a moisturizer! It has such a wonderful clean scent and I thought that it was logical, because of its cleaning properties, to use as a moisturizer without worries of breaking out from oil. I don&#x27;t put much on but then I let it absorb and when I put my mineral powder on top I am left with a dewy complexion. I am turning 45 this year and my sister-in-law told me that she was looking at pictures of me from when I was younger and she was struck by how \\&quot;I haven&#x27;t aged\\&quot;. I know some of this is because of genetics, what I eat, keeping hydrated and getting lots of sleep, but definitely also because of how I take care of my skin. Products like this definitely make it easier. I&#x27;ve never been one to put chemicals on my face if I didn&#x27;t have to. I am a HUGE fan of InstaNatural!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like writing online reviews but I couldn&#x27;t help myself when it came to this product. This is my first review ever and I just want to say how happy and In love I am with this product! It removes all my makeup and leaves my face so soft and moisturized. I have dry/combo skin and this has been such a rescue to my skin. I noticed a huge difference within a week of usage. My skin stopped breaking out and my  fine lines were less visible. I rave it to all my friends and coworkers when they even started noticing my skin change. I also picked up two more instanatural products and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. JUST BUY IT you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. It leaves your face clean but also moisturized and hasn&#x27;t caused acne, irritation, or dryness. Customer service is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First time using an oil cleanser, with oil prone, combination sensitive skin I was concerned. But this product is wonderful and has quickly become my new standard for skincare. It does not leave your skin feeling stripped. I wash, then remove the oil with a face cloth and follow with rose water tonic. My skin looks and feels glorious.</li>
    <li> very thick oil - leave heavy oil film on face. does a good job at removing eye makeup though with only a few squirts of product. can also be used for shaving!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing.  This is my first time to try a facial oil cleanser to remove all of my makeup -- eyes and all!  It works and leaves my skin feeling so smooth.</li>
    <li> I do love this oil cleanser. It&#x27;s super gentle...my skin is very soft after a few weeks of twice-daily use yet it is effective enough to remove gel eyeliner, waterproof mascara and 12 hour lipstick. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel on the skin, as you may anticipate, but it leaves my face feeling hydrated and clean. I love it!</li>
    <li> Like it will recommend.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with cystic acne all my adult life.  After my skin had a major flare up in recent months, I decided to try this product and abandon all the other products typically marketed as acne cleansers.  What a difference!  My skin had always felt angry and inflammed, every day.  After using this product, my skin calmed down and felt comfortable.  I noticed a difference after the first use.  No tightness, felt like I did not even need moisturizer.  It easily removes my makeup, including mascara.  I still get breakuouts, but my skin is less inflammed and feels so much better.  I have hopes that using this along with other Instanatural products will bring me clear skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been washing my face with oil for a long time now and this oil is definitely on the top of my list!  I have really patchy red skin and I decided to give this and the InstaNatural Moroccan Rose Water a chance.  I noticed a difference after the first use and was blown away by how clear complected my skin became!  It does go really far and I&#x27;m able to wash my whole face with just one squirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the results I got was because of using the two products together, or from one individually... I use the two together and have really enjoyed both equally.  I not only would recommend this to others, but I HAVE recommended it to my best friend.  And you know that says a LOT.  :D</li>
    <li> I had been suffering with bouts of cystic acne on my chin, forehead, and nose for several months and was on the hunt for a new face wash that would prevent then and make my pores smaller. I was looking into making my own jojoba oil based cleanser when I came across Instanaturals line of products. I decided to go ahead and buy this instead of making my own and I&#x27;m super glad I did! The directions say to apply to a dry face and let steam from a cloth help work the oil into the pores to lift out dirt. Honestly, I usually apply this to my face as soon as I get into the shower while my face is still dry then continue shampooing and stuff and use a cloth to wash my face off last. I&#x27;ll also drape my cloth over my face a few times to get a more intense steam effect. I wear liquid eyeliner and mascara and have had no issues cleansing with the oil and I feel that it does a better job than other cleansers at removing makeup. After 4 weeks of using the product I can tell a difference in my pore size and my makeup looks so much smoother throughout the day. I have had a few tiny whiteheads pop up on my chin and nose which I credit to the fact my pores are expelling the gunk that&#x27;s been trapped in them. The whiteheads don&#x27;t get inflamed and are gone by the next day. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;ll do for my skin in the next 4 weeks!</li>
    <li> I came across this product as I was looking for a quality facial oil cleanser to replace what I was using. This is exceptional! I have dealt with adult acne for years and tried every product imaginable, only to have dry, flaky skin with acne! Within a week of using this, my skin started to clear up and after 2 weeks I had NO breakouts. I just massage it into my dry skin, let it sit for a minute or two, then take off with a wet washcloth. It even removes my eye makeup and my skin is left feeling baby soft. I love this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to use as a moisturizing face wash. I was breaking out around my chin and hairline. When I used harsh acne washes, my skin would dry out and the breakouts would get worse. I wasn&#x27;t expecting great results with an oil cleanser, but after reading several positive reviews, I decided it was worth a shot. I used a couple of drops, rubbed into my face then rinsed with warm water. A little goes a long way. Immediately my dry, moisture stripped skin felt replenished and  looked bright. I used this twice daily and I am really happy with the results. My breakouts are practically one. When my face gets extra dry due to cold weather and dry heat, I use a drop as a moisturizer without rinsing and my skin NEVER feels oily. I love this oil! I expect this bottle to last a long time even with daily use. I definitely want to try more of insta natural&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Another quality product from InstaNatural!  I love the Vitamin C serum and now I love this too.  What to try next...</li>
    <li> I have just begun using this facial Cleanser so I cannot yet fully be sure of its affects on my skin. That being said, this is the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve done to my skin and I like it. haha. Cleaning oily skin with oil??!!! Putting it on dry then wiping it off?? &amp;#34;Ummm, no.&amp;#34; haha Well I took a risk and it&#x27;s kinda cool. My skin is definitely softer and my skin is still oily but not like before. It looks healthier. I think this plus the skin clearing serum might be my perfect mix! Keeping my fingers crossed and I will update my review after one month.  Update:  Okay so I&#x27;m still using this but not exactly like a cleanser. More like a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know but it works great for me. lol. The serum I had to stop using since my skin said &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34;. So that was basically the end of that. This however, is worth it. Lots of product in the glass, hardly any needed for your face so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cleanser, day cream and serum. The cost was reasonable and the products are packaged attractively and function well.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again, have already ordered a few more items.  The oil cleanser works good, smells great. The lotions, serums go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Much better than soap if you have dry skin or hard water..  While it does wash clean, it leaves my face feeling moisturized and soft.  My only problem with this is that I need to use it more!</li>
    <li> oil cleansers are the best way to clean your face!  no drying out of the skin, the cleanser leaves my face feeling so clean and hydrated.  dont even need moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about a week in using this product and at first I liked how soft my skin felt afterwards and it also did a great job removing makeup. But now my face is breaking out and this is unusual for me. I have combo/oily skin with mild rosacea. I don&#x27;t normally suffer from breakouts and I have one bump that feels very deep and it&#x27;s painful. Since nothing else has changed in my routine, I&#x27;m attributing the breakout to this product. I&#x27;ll have to discontinue use and hope the current situation clears up.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleaner. My skin is super dry and this does not dry it out at all. You might have a hard time believing an oil can clean, but it does. Takes off my eye makeup better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I use it to clean my makeup brushes too. It does a better job at that too! This will be the only facial cleaner I use from now on.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and while this did not make it worse, it certainly doesn&#x27;t remove makeup.  I&#x27;d use five pumps, massage 30 seconds, and about half my makeup would come off....not like DHC at all.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this. Just few days of using, and I received several compliments on the difference of my complexion. Insta-Natural Products have improved my complexion so much that a few of my co-workers have started using this. Their customer service is very prompt and answered any questions that I had.</li>
    <li> love this!  i have acne, oily skin under with dry patches on top and this is able to combat the dryness without making my face any oilier.  i apply it on my face... massage in circular motion.  dry skin flakes off and i wipe with a cotton ball and rinse/cleanse with a gentle cleanser.  this has made so much good with my skin.  all the dirt and impurities and make up end up in the cotton.  this is now a staple in my morning and night routine.  i can definitely notice a difference when i skip this and i always go back to using it.  i do highly recommend this for oil cleansing.</li>
    <li> MY PERSONNEL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very impressed with this deep cleansing facial oil. I was a little skeptical at first, and thought it would make my skin greasy but I was wrong! It helps take off my makeup at night and cleanse my pores. My skin has actually looked brighter and more alive since using this! It has also left my skin feeling very hydrated and less dry. I love the fact that it as all natural ingredients and is extremely gentle on your skin. I am overall very impressed with this product and the company as well. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their awesome products!  Adovia is among a few beauty lines I really do enjoy. I can understand the ingredients that I am putting on my skin and that is important to me. Quite a few things break my skin out, so I am very careful and aware what I out on or in my body. I have never had any issues with Adovia products and they work so well to bring dull skin back to life. The Dead Sea mineral are magic and I love how they make my skin look &amp; feel.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this product when I&#x27;m removing my makeup! Most makeup removers that I have used in the past were too harsh for my skin and my face ends up feeling raw, irritated and dry. At one point, I had to resort to using baby oil to remove my makeup. I prefer using InstaNatural&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser because not only does it work great as a makeup remover, it also purifies my pores and pampers my skin! I love the fact that it has natural ingredients that works well for my ultra sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Well i asked for it i wanted a face oil that cleans my face removes mascara and i wanted it all natural i also wanted to be able to use it instead of making it my self i also wanted to be able to add it to my scrub i love making and wala instanaturals came through for me again, they made a product i am loving to the fullest, it has everything i wanted and takes off my mascara my water proof that drives me crazy without an issue I was so excited to get this that night when i came home i needed to get my mascara off otherwise it flakes all over the place and tried this, took it off completely without me having to scrub my face off completely shocking, i havent found a product that can actually do that without scrubbing, this is a first of it&#x27;s kind and as you can see i&#x27;ll keep this one close to my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This facial oil cleanser is the very best! It is so gentle on your skin and makes your skin feel clean and nourished. I recommend every single product instanatural makes, I can add this to my favorites list! I am so thankful you came out with a cleanser! You make my skin so happy!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great at getting my mineral make up off.  I would apply it to my face and melt all of my make up away,  then follow up with a soap to get the oil and make up off.  It really worked great.  Highly recommend if you want something to really get that makeup off of your face.</li>
    <li> Another fabulous Instanatural product. I can&#x27;t speak more highly of this company. It&#x27;s a hidden gem as far as products, price, and outstanding customer service. The facial oil takes off every bit of makeup including eye makeup very gently and effectively.</li>
    <li> &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP83a6e7ca4ca36a179e7aadbecf6569ba\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    I received this to review and it came really quickly. One of the best parts about ordering from Instanatural is that they send you a message with facts about what you ordered and what you can do with the product. It&#x27;s so helpful! The ingredient list is astounding there&#x27;s so much natural oil it&#x27;s good for skin and body. Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a rush I rub it on my hands, arms, legs, face and hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and I love it. Even though it says face I&#x27;ve used it in my hair and I don&#x27;t have anymore dandruff or itchy scalp. So this has more than just the use for your face. I put it on before I get in the shower so the hot steam can work with the oil and open my pores and I find that this helps even more.    I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM83a6e7ca4ca36a179e7aadbecf6569ba\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this facial oil cleanser based upon the reviews that I read. The cleanser made my skin soft, but it didn&#x27;t help my acne.  It was good for cleaning my makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of facial cleansing oil for awhile now but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try out very many brands yet.  InstaNatural was nice enough to send me their Facial Oil Cleanser to test out and so far I am really loving it.  The InstaNatural Facial Oil Cleanser is the perfect blend of ingredients that works great at taking off my makeup &amp; doing a great job at deep cleaning my skin.  When I feel like my skin needs an extra scrubbing I simply mix some of my exfoliant in with the InstaNatural Facial Oil Cleanser, massage into my skin and rinse off with a warm muslin cloth! Awesome :)</li>
    <li> InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil is a great way to clean your skin.  I really like how this product works.  It is gentle and reviving.  It removes makeup too.  The cleansing oil purifies your skin and pores.  It left my skin feeling super clean, but not dry.  The product is easy to use.  I simply apply it to my face and rinse with warm water.  It really does a great job removing dirt too!  InstaNatural also provides a satisfaction guarantee on their Deep Cleansing Facial Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free sample provided</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had an oily face so I am always looking for different face washes that will fight the oil and improve my skin, pores, breakouts and whatnot. So of course I was excited for this one. I was a little concerned that it was a cleansing OIL, being that oil was the main thing I was trying to get rid of, but I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, squirted some on a wash cloth (it looks a little strange, like cooking oil I guess lol) and I rubbed it all over my face. My face was of course extremely oily at this point, but I had high hopes still.&lt;br /&gt;I then started to rinse it off with warm water. This is when I got worried. When I first started splashing water on my face it felt like I was just mixing water with the oil and smearing it all over my face instead of rinsing it off. At this point I was convinced when I was done, my face was going to look even more greasy than when I started. So I continued to rinse my face until my fingers weren&#x27;t oily anymore, put my glasses on and looked in the mirror... and to my pleasant surprise, not only did my skin look soft and not oily but it felt super soft and not oily too! I must say I was pretty shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Long term, my breakouts have seems pretty controlled. I can&#x27;t honestly say if it&#x27;s solely because of this ( my breakouts are pretty sporadic anyways) but I haven&#x27;t had any major breakouts since I started using it and it has definitely improved my skin of my face. It leaves it soft and not greasy, where many other face washes will make my face not greasy, but in turn make it really dry. This one keeps your skin at a very happy medium!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend you try this product out, especially if you struggle with your facial skin like I do.</li>
    <li> I really love this Facial Cleanser! My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts. I only use eyeshadow, mascara, and Eyeliner and this product removes them easily. My routine is I apply this Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  Using a hot wet clean washcloth I wipe away the cleanser. Then I appy insta natural toning rose water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again. Immediately followed with insta natural vitamin C serum and just one squirt of insta natural rosebud oil. The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products. All in all it has been a great experience :)</li>
    <li> Throughout the last month, I have been using this cleanser in the evening to remove my make-up. My skin is very dry/dehydrated, and it typically flakes in the winter time. As a make-up remover, I use about three pumps of the cleanser and massage over my face, concentrating on the eye area if I&#x27;ve used mascara and eyeliner. Then, I use a wash cloth in circular motions to remove my make-up and the remaining cleanser. Usually, I follow with a different cleanser to ensure that make-up removal is complete, but there are days when I&#x27;m too lazy to complete this step or I haven&#x27;t worn any make-up, therefore it is unnecessary. Previously I was using Clinique&#x27;s Take the Day Off balm, while I loved this cleanser and it adequately removed my make-up, I was looking for something that was more hydrating- this is it!!! My skin feels very soft after every use, has a beautiful glow, and the best part is I don&#x27;t have any flakes! Additionally, I&#x27;ve tried this in the morning with my Clarisonic as well and love the results, especially when I&#x27;m putting make-up on, as it goes on much smoother.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job at removing all of my makeup, even my eye liner and mascara. I enjoy the smoothing and moisturizing effects on my skin. I think using this oils remover is beneficial for aging skin too. It just feels better. A little goes a long way and the light calming scent is an added bonus. I was sent this for review, however this does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It is way more gentle than any other makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used, but at the same time, WAY more effective! It removed ALL of my makeup after a long night at a banquet, including waterproof mascara and eye liner. It&#x27;s a great cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it with my bare, clean hands and just gently massaged it all over my face until everything was off. Then I wiped it off with a paper towel damp with warm water and it came off easily, leaving my face feeling soft and clean, not oily at all. LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial cleansers.  Many have worked fine, I just haven&#x27;t found one that I really love.  A while back, I read an article online about washing your face with oils.  That seemed crazy, but intrigued me.  I have combination skin-a little oily around the hairline and nose, dry patches on my cheeks.  In the winter my skin gets really dry, so I thought maybe using oil to cleanse was worth trying.  I was really excited to have the opportunity to try out Instanatural&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Facial Oil this past month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instanatural&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Facial Oil is all natural and organic-something that makes me happy.  Why would I want to put chemicals on my face if there are natural products that yield the same (or better) results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My experience with Deep Cleansing Facial Oil has been wonderful!  I am in love with this product!  It smells heavenly, and you only use a small amount to wash your face so it will last a long time.  It rinses off easily, and leaves my skin soft and clean.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, and I don&#x27;t have that dry feeling I used to get after cleansing my face.  Although I still use moisturizer, I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash-I don&#x27;t feel like I need to after cleansing with this product.</li>
    <li> Cleansing Facial Oils are all the craze now a days as they are beginning to replace normal cleansers that we can buy to remove dirt, grime and makeup.  While it is becoming a new trend, using oil to remove makeup has been around for years… in fact, my mom would tell me that my dad suggested she use Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Coconut Oil to remove her makeup years before it started to become popular.  A best kept secret for many years, it is now something you hear about often all over the internet, on television and in magazines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural’s Gentle &amp; Reviving Deep Cleansing Facial Oil is a skin and pore purifier and makeup remover.  Said to be the fastest, easiest way to banish dirt, grime and makeup from your face – application is easy and so is the removal.  Simply massage a small amount of the facial wash into your skin to take off all the dirt and makeup.  I have enjoyed using this especially to remove my waterproof mascara or lash adhesive.  It works well and doesn’t leave my face feeling dry or my eyes irritated like some cleansers can do.  It’s still delicate enough to not strip your skin of natural oils that you need to keep your skin soft and moisturized and your skin doesn’t feel oily after washing it off.  I like to put a little of the cleanser on my finger tips to remove eye makeup or put some of the facial oil on a cotton pad or cotton ball and gently rub on my face to remove the dirt.  I then rinse it off with warm water and pat my face dry with a clean cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is very easy to use, simply just push down on the pump and your facial oil is dispensed.  You can decide whether or not how you want to apply and use it.  Like I said depending on what I need to take off, I will use appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you have never used a cleansing oil before to clean your face, it may be a bit different from what you expect a cleanser to do.  If you already have oily or acne prone skin, it may also seem like you are doing something completely wrong by adding oil to your skin to clean it when your skin already over produces oil.  However, sometimes many don’t realize that your skin may be overproducing oil because it is not moisturized and therefore your skin is overcompensating for lack of moisture.  While that may not be the case for everyone, I definitely suggest trying a facial cleansing oil to see how it would work for you.  I use some form of oil whether coconut oil, Argan oil or Rosehip oil to moisturize my face at least once a day and over the last two years my skin went from break outs to barely a pimple in site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;insta natural cleansing oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial cleanser does have a light fragrance that smells almost like jojoba oil (probably because it includes jojoba oil) and while it does have Lavender Essential oil, the scent of lavender is not over powering and just light enough to where you can smell a hint of it, but it doesn’t drive me nuts.  Since I have very dry skin, this has definitely made a difference in my skin care routine, keeping my skin soft and moisturized even before adding my serums and moisturizer.  I loved that I was able to get through the summer months without a severe eczema flare up because my skin stayed supple. While this is a liquid / oil like textured product, it doesn’t feel “oily” and cleanses the skin while locking in the much needed moisture our skin needs.e doing something completely wrong by adding oil to your skin to clean it when your skin already over produces oil.

    <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it will work.. New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  But what I can say is that it feels really nice and it works amazingly well for an eye makeup remover.  It also smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Oh, I love, love this oil... It makes my face glow and gets out all the dirt and grime...  I also use it on my hands...</li>
    <li> This product is not for me. I absolutely fell in love with the scent of this cleanser. But it doesn&#x27;t thoroughly and completely remove make-up, as reported by some other reviewers.  Also, as I have oily/acne-prone skin, after a couple of uses, I started to get pimples. My sister has dry to normal skin. I will give this product to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate that the company diligently followed up with an email, inquiring as to how I liked the product.</li>
    <li> smells pretty good but I don&#x27;t think it does a good job on removing makeup.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that an oil would cleanse the makeup off my skin but it truly does!  I use 3-4 pumps of the oil in my hands and gently massage it onto my face and neck.  I could get away with less product but I like how it easily glides across my face with that amount.  I use a warm, moist wash cloth to remove the oil and makeup.  I follow up with a toner, serum and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> If you want something that will help to remove your makeup without drying/stripping your skin, I highly suggest giving this a try.  Don&#x27;t be afraid if you have oily skin!  This will help to balance out your skin no matter what your skin type.  Apply this to your dry face and work it in (you should see your makeup dissolving),then get a warm wash cloth and wipe it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that this comes with a pump.</li>
    <li> my favorite oil cleanser ever. i evn use it on my brushes and as a eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recieved this in exchage for a product review. my reviews are 100% honest and my opinion</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Anti-aging deep cleansing oil!! I had never used a cleansing oil before this and was a bit skeptical and worried that it may add oil to my already oily skin. I worries needlessly as it left no excess oil behind,, just a deep clean that left my skin feeling smooth and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I have used many cleansers in the past and they work fairly well but I was amazed by the &amp;#34;yuck&amp;#34; that was left behind on my washcloth after using this oil and it pulling out all of the toxins and impurities from my skin. After just a few uses the difference was apparent and I now use it nightly!&lt;br /&gt;I love using all natural products on my skin and this works so well!</li>
    <li> Easy to clean the face. Smell good. Non-greasy - leaves skin satiny. I like it very much!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mid-twenties, and I still have terrible acne. Now that I&#x27;m a new mom, I also have weird combination skin, super oily t-zone and super dry on the rest of my face.  I had never used an oil cleanser before, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now, and it&#x27;s great! It doesn&#x27;t cause any extra breakouts, and I have fewer breakouts while using it. I haven&#x27;t been as consistent as I would usually been in skincare, because I&#x27;m a tired new mom, and I have to use a cotton round to apply this, and then I usually follow it by washing my face with my usual salicylic face wash, so I sometimes skip this step and just use the regular face wash. It also really is amazing at removing makeup!&lt;br /&gt;(For clarity, I&#x27;ll explain that I have fair combination skin, with hormonal cystic acne on my chin, neck and sides of my face by my ears, otherwise I just have little whiteheads by my nose and lips.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about cleaning my face with oil, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Ad all of Insta Natural&#x27;s products.  I highly recommend all of them.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this cleanser as I am a huge fan of InstaNatural products, but this oil cleanser was a bit of a let down.  You absolutely need a wash cloth or muslin cloth to remove the oil from your face, and I find that it doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup.  I only use standard mascara, nothing waterproof, and my past oil cleansers have all been able to remove my mascara.  I will continue to use it, but likely won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> I have seen many people use a facial oil to remove makeup, however I had never tried one until now. I was very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the average day I wear foundation, powder, blush, eye shadow, eye liner, mascara and some kind of lip product. Removing my makeup can quite often be a job. I have always had a hard time finding 1 product that will easily remove it all. However this Deep Cleansing Facial Oil by InstaNatural does the job for me! At the end of the night, before bed I remove my makeup. Since I started using this, my routine at night has become MUCH easier and faster. I simply take 2 cotton rounds, and soak some of the facial oil on them. I start by removing the makeup on my face, cheeks, forehead, nose and lips. Those areas are easier to remove and require less effort. Then I take my 2nd pad, and soak that one with some oil as well. I slowly slide it across my eye about 3 times, then I flip the cotton pad over and do the same to my other eye. After that, my face is clean, with no sign of any makeup left over. Any oil that is left on my skin is usually absorbed into my skin. Very rarely will my face feel super slick and greasy. I have not had any reaction or breakouts to this at all. I do suffer from dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way to use this to be beneficial to your skin, is to use it as slip for a facial massage. Few drops all over, and you can give yourself or someone else a wonderful face massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended this to my family and friends who I know also have problems finding a good way to take their makeup off, so naturally I am also recommending it here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> Washing or cleansing your face is a daily ritual for everyone. Make sure to cleanse my face twice a day every day. Normally I would use a foaming type of facial cleanser. Honestly it worked, and have used many cleansers in my life. Many of the past cleansers were find, and worked ok. Still having said that I was never fully happy with the prior cleansers for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few weeks I have been trying a new  facial cleanser. Insta Natural has allowed me to try their Deep Cleansing Facial Oil &amp; share my thoughts. At first I thought, &amp;#34;Cleanse my Face with Oil?&amp;#34;  Honestly a cleansing oil is a new concept for me. My skin is combination, and my forehead can get awfully greasy. My first thought was that this would not be a good product for me, but I was wrong. Yeah I was wrong. It was my prior belief that I should be oil free in my skin care products; because I was miseducated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil is amazing. Yes this cleansing oil gets my skin fully clean, and no my skin is not oily or greasy. In the past other cleanser would strip my skin causing my oil glands to overwork to product oil. While using Insta Natural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil my skin is balanced. It&#x27;s my feeling that my skin looks dewy, and my pores appear smaller. Most important no more greasy forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why use Insta Natural Deep Cleansing Oil? It is highly effective at cleansing my face without stripping it.  Just a few drops can fully cleanses your face so it&#x27;s a great value also. What most important is that these products are NOT tested on animals. This cleanser is also made in the USA. All of the ingredients are real &amp; natural no synthetic chemicals. Often products are loaded with fillers, and synthetic properties that your body does not know how to properly process.  Like that there abount 10 essential oils used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best way to use this product is to use your clean dry hands on dry skin. I takefew drops on the tips of my fingers. Then work in small circular motions until my entire face is one. Work that in for a good minute or two. Then follow with warm water to rinse it off, and pat dry. This is my process play around to see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural did send me this product to try for free &amp; share my thoughts. These are my thoughts only!</li>
    <li> I do really like the Facial Oil Cleanser with one exception.  It doesn’t really work that well on removing mascara.  That having been said, it smells great and leaves my skin soft and ready for your other products.  The cleanser doesn’t strip my skin of what natural oils there are and that’s important to me.  BTW, I also love your Vitamin C serum.  It, too, has a great scent and really sets the stage for the moisturizer and gives it a boost.  All in all, I love all the products I have tried and will continue to order them.  I do need a bit more moisture at night and hope that you will eventually come out with a cream or lotion specifically for nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work and follow-up with customers who are using your products. We appreciate your dedication to customer satisfaction and opinions on how to improve products.  I’m sure the feedback is useful to you.</li>
    <li> It removes make-up well.  I brought it to remove mascara.  I used it all over my face.  It made me break out like a teenager.  Smells good but not too strong.</li>
    <li> For complete makeup removal that leaves skin soft and hydrated...give this a try!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have combination skin and it leaves my skin clean and feeling great.</li>
    <li> I was thinking about buying this product and was looking and reading reviews. I&#x27;ve read thousands of reviews and these are suspicious.  They are all a bit too good too be true. if you look at the reviews of the reviewers they are all 5 stars.  The company also have only been around for four months and already have 370 with 5-10 people reviewing a day.  It&#x27;s not the natural way of reviews.  I don&#x27;t trust them.</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Love love love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Feels nice on face! In general I enjoy using it. No more soap. Can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face felt after using this for first time. This comes second to hemp seed oil that I use at night to cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> This product has completely changed my make up removing routine!! It has eliminated the cleansing wipes. For someone who wears a pretty good amount of make up (okay, A LOT lol) and keep it on for about 13 hours a day, this is THE BEST make up remover I have come across. Usually takes 1 to 2 make up wipes before starting the process of actually washing to get a deep clean...but with this, I just put it on, rub on dry face with ALL my make up still on and it literally melts all your make up off!! Insane! I love all the benificial oils that are in it to help smooth and repair my skin. This is definitely the one! I am happy to recieve this wash to review. I will be using this as my daily go to forever!!!</li>
    <li> Just thinking about putting OIL on my face to clean it made me feel weird!  I have combination skin with an oily forehead, so this seemed really counter-intuitive for me.  When I used it, I noticed that the little pump that gives you just the right amount of product to use, which I really liked. I noticed that it worked really well to remove the make up from my face. And the oil that I&#x27;d originally been afraid would be problematic for my skin proved to be moisturizing and did NOT cause break outs. I&#x27;m excited because I&#x27;d always avoided these types of products before, and now I am reconsidering.  I received this promotionally for review, but all opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this oil because my skin has become increasingly dry as I have aged.  Let me just say I LOVE it.  I rub it in and let it sit for a minute and following the guidelines that the company sent - just use a very warm washcloth to cleanse my face.  It doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye-makeup (I use something different for that anyway)...however I really like how it leaves my skin feeling clean buy not dry...I then follow with my Vitamin C Serum and other moisturizer.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice cleanser. InstaNatural makes wonderful skin care products. I use several of their products already on a daily basis.  The pump is a great feature on this bottle and InstaNatural definitely has their branding down; love the look of this packaging. This cleanser works for my dry, fair skin. No oily after feeling and it&#x27;s hydrating.  *Sample provided for review*</li>
    <li> This product is beyond amazing! I was skeptical at first, I mean, rubbing oil on your skin to clean it? It works, seriously! I love the smell! I love that in just a few short weeks it has pretty much cleared up all my pimples and has left my skin tone more even and my skin more supple. I can honestly say my skin looks better than it has in over 15 years! The best part in my opinion is that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients! Do yourself a favor and buy this, even if you have perfect skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff - I&#x27;m officially sold on the oil cleansing method.</li>
    <li> Seem to be helping daughters acne with natural ingredients so mom is happy with the entire line.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try out InstaNatural&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Facial Oil. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that takes my makeup off with ease and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. I have sensitive skin, wear contacts and have seasonal allergies with a lot of eye irritation so I won&#x27;t lie, I was scared to put this on my eyes to remove my makeup. A lot of the makeup removers leave my eyes burning and stinging. This was very gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t *love* about the oil was that I felt like I needed another cleanser to clean off the oil. It&#x27;s not as bad as others that have tried and I am continuing to use this until I find that &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; cleanser since this is one of the better makeup removers. I want a cleanser that can remove my makeup with ease...I don&#x27;t want to add another step to the ever-growing beauty routine list...one of the downsides of being almost 35...I&#x27;m making a crazy effort not to look it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it&#x27;s definitely worth trying. I know how picky I am and I think most people could handle the oiliness (I might be overly sensitive). It smells clean, feels clean and if it can get off Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara, it&#x27;s definitely got my attention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product Received in Exchange for an Honest Review*</li>
    <li> Too oily and does not remove the makeup as well.</li>
    <li> I have received a lot of different skin care products to try but non to wash my face. Perhaps the most important part of my skincare regimen. I generally just use soap and water. Even the best brands of bar soap do nothing good for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Deep Cleansing Facial Oil free in return for an honest product review. I had a couple of friends receive their bottle to try before I got mine and they RAVED about it. I was so beyond excited to try.&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t have to wait very long! The night I received my bottle I tried it for the first time. The bottle is a really good size and will last a long time so you know you will get your money’s worth. The first thing I noticed was the scent, it smells amazing I pick up mainly rose. It is a lightweight oil that feels nice going on without feeling greasy. I only need a very small amount to wash my face and neck. I have been applying it onto a Konjak sponge so it feels like it is deep cleaning your pores. It rinses very easily without leaving any residue whatsoever. My skin is SO soft! It is now a part of my night time routine and most likely will stay that way. Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> This oil cleanser is awesome . I have been dealing with hormonal acne and nothing seemed to work plus most acne stuff dries you out which seems to make me break out more. I started using oils and found that they do help acne. So I thought maybe a cleanser would help. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on products that don&#x27;t work . Within 1 day I could see a difference . By the 5th day my acne cleared up.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week and can&#x27;t believe this product is working so great for me. I work in the cosmetic industry and can&#x27;t be with a face full of acne. I was so distraught  and now I&#x27;m so happy. I plan on ordering another one today. Don&#x27;t want to run out ever. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
    <li> I ordered atleast 5 variety of instanatural products because of a 20% off coupon that i received from my previous purchase from them. What can I say, I love their products! This particular oil is very gentle to the skin, I have to admit that the packaging (dark glass bottle) kinda overwhelmed me. It feels like im putting some sort of medicine to my face. But nope. It removes even the most stubborn makeup that i have, which are my waterproof eyeliner and mascara. It does feels a little oily (it&#x27;s an oil after all), but it does what it promises. A well deserved 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I like the texture, leaves skin very smooth. LOVE it! Like the smell.</li>
    <li> Got this as an alternative to soap. It does clean your face and removes makeup. My face does feel clean and moisturized after using.</li>
    <li> It broke my face out.</li>
    <li> I like to cleanse my skin with oil and I tried this one because it was $4.00 cheaper than another brand I had previously used.  At this point, I would order this one again.  It works well and the price puts it in the bonus round.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My 50 year old skin feels better than ever!</li>
    <li> It smells so good, the kind of smell you&#x27;ll find in spa. Great for routine facial cleaning, leave your skin feel refreshed and not dried out as chemical cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is the first facial oil cleanser that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily/still &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is the third product by InstaNatural that I have had the pleasure to use.  I am as impressed with this Deep Cleansing Facial Oil as I was with their other products.  I received my shipment fast and packaging was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical wondering why I would want to clean my face with oils?  Isn’t the idea to get rid of all the oil and grime from my face?  After the first use I completely understood why this facial cleanser is the most natural and nurturing way to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;I used cotton balls to apply the Deep Cleansing Facial Oil the first couple of times and that worked perfectly.  After that I have now switched to applying with a small cloth.  There was a nice light scent to this amber-colored oil and I experienced no sensitivity issues.  The area around my eyes can be very sensitive but there was no problem when I used this facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it goes on, its silky and feels wonderful.  I really enjoyed being able to see all the dirt and impurities on the cotton balls too.  Boy, my face can get pretty dirty!  I rinsed my face with warm water and patted it dry as the directions stated to do.  I noticed a very clean feeling all over my face and neck, yet my face didn’t feel dried out and tight as it usually does with just plain soap.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest worry using the Deep Cleansing Facial Oil was that my face would not have a nice clean feeling and would be left oily and may even experience acne breakouts.  I had the opposite results!  My face felt light, very clean and not oily, but not dry.  Wow, that’s exactly what I’ve been looking for.  Lately the weather here in Hawaii has been extremely hot and more humid than usual, even after using this facial oil my skin was still light with no additional acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;Since I don’t really wear makeup but I still wanted to see how this facial cleanser did with eye makeup I had my teenager try it out. She loved the feeling and stated that her eye makeup came off easily without stinging her eyes, as other makeup removers do.  We might have to share it now :(&lt;br /&gt;One of the great things about InstaNatural products is the generous amounts they give you.  This Deep Cleansing Facial Oil comes in a 4 oz bottle. You don’t usually see that with other skin care items.  What’s even better is, you don’t need a whole lot to get the job done either.  Making the large packing actually last longer.sily without stinging her eyes, as other makeup removers do.

    <li> I love this cleanser! It doesn&#x27;t lather like other cleansers &amp; leave your face super dry but after you rinse, your face feels clean &amp; refreshed! I wear my mascara really thick &amp; I use this to remove my eye make-up... I was sent this product to review but I would definitely recommend it to my family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> The oil smells really good and refreshing. It leaves my face feeling smooth and looking moisturized without feeling tight or dry. I will definitely keep using and update my review later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy face soap again. I like this product so much more than any other soap out there. Soaps dry my skin out, and other cleaners have harmful chemicals in it. This product not only did the job, but it also left my face feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional blogger that was asked to review this product. I give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It is making my face feel lots softer and less dry.</li>
    <li> For the last 40 years, I have used Vaseline in removing my makeup(especially my eye makeup). It hasn&#x27;t worked perfectly but it has worked none the less so I went with it. Now I have found a brand new product and it&#x27;s a winner. Deep Cleansing Facial Oil by Instanatural.  My review: I have never used a cleansing oil before. The thought of it kind of made me cringe. My face has always been so funny and I found out a long time ago that I can&#x27;t just put anything on it being extra apprehensive of anything greasy or oily. This product has a nice smell to it. I applied it with a cotton ball and rinse my face afterwards. It did not leave any residue or irritate my skin whatsoever. Score!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product I will reorder.</li>
    <li> The InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil is a very unique product.  It contains the most beautifying oils to deeply clean and moisturize, leaving your face feeling soft and refreshed!  The unique Facial Oil cleans your face and pores, without stripping the skin of its natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one bottle of InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil to review!  This Facial Oil has the perfect blend of ingredients to clean deep down impurities and makeup, leaving your skin super smooth and nourished!  It’s really easy to use, just pump the oil onto a cotton ball and wiping gently into your face.  Then just rinse with warm water and pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial Oil is perfect for all skin types, especially regenerative for mature skin.  It soothes the skin after shaving or on sunburns.  Besides cleaning your face it also removes any kind of make-up, foundation to lipstick.  This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really love how well this product removes my makeup.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that it removed my mascara with only one try.  I pile on the mascara because I have thin eyelashes and it can be a chore to remove at the end of the day.  Not only is this great for removing makeup, it&#x27;s made my skin feel softer and look more vibrant.  I don&#x27;t have that dull look any more.  I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin but I don&#x27;t want to look like I do. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with the performance of this facial oil cleanser.</li>
    <li> My skin is normal skin neither too dry nor too oily. This facial oil is basically a cleansing product for removing makeup or any other impurities on face. I normally use it to clean my face before bed time. Initially I was bit hesitant to apply oil on my face, have never done it before and oil can give acne. I started applying this with very little amount, this product first makes skin oily but when you wash with warm water it wipes away extra oil and keeps balanced oil in skin just enough to keep skin hydrate.&lt;br /&gt;I usually pour 2-3 drops of oil on tissue paper or cotton ball and then wipe my face with that tissue. I can easily remove daily eye and face makeup using this oil.But if makeup is very heavy then I first use face wash. After applying oil I always wash my face to remove any extra oil.&lt;br /&gt;This product has many essential oils and I like it&#x27;s scent. It has light scent and goes away in few minutes. I also observed that it acts as a moisturizer and removes any dry patch on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, oil is not always bad for skin. It can be used as a cleansing agent also. I am using this facial oil since last 2-3 weeks and have positive experience. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. My skin is not oily and this product suited my skin. I don&#x27;t apply this in morning and use normal facial scrubs and face wash in morning. In short, I use combination of facial oil and face wash for cleansing face to ensure that my skin is perfectly balanced.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for review purpose.Opinions expressed are 100% of my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cleanser that leaves your skin moisturized and soft without irritation.  I like to apply it with my hands and then use a washcloth and warm water to remove it.</li>
    <li> One of the first things I look at when I receive a product is what is in it. Some things can be a bit to harsh for my skin so I always make sure that there’s nothing to bad in a product. With ingredients like Organic Jojoba Oil, Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil, and Olive Oil as the first few ingredients I figured I was pretty safe. I tested a portion on the back of my hand before applying to my face and didn’t have any adverse reactions so I decided to just get to it. The ingredients actually left my face feeling fairly soft and after rinsing it wasn’t greasy at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did notice about the InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil was the directions. With the Julep Bare Face Cleansing Oil I just squirt some into my hand, rub my hands together, and then rub it on my face really well before rinsing off. However, with the InstaNatural Deep Cleansing Facial Oil this was not the case. You actually apply this to a cloth and use the cloth to rub the product into the face before using water to rinse it away. I would also like to mention that this oil is NOT tested on animals and is made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a GREAT cleanser and I will be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This facial oil at first made my skin break out, but that&#x27;s probably because it was just adjusting and getting all of the impurities out of my skin. It kind of freaked me out at first, but then my skin started clearing up! It&#x27;s crazy how oil can clean your skin?! I love that it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about ya&#x27;ll, but I have extremely oily skin and even extremely dry skin; usually depends on the weather outside. And I always worry about if the chemicals in other facial products will harm my skin. But after reading in on this InstaNatural Facial Oil Cleanser product, and also experimenting with it as well, I have to say that this is by far the greatest, organic and fast acting facial cleanser I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried it was going to make me break-out and pack on more oil that I already don&#x27;t need, but it was actually the complete opposite. It left my face smooth, moisturized and it didn&#x27;t even take away my natural oils. And I really love how it makes my face glow when I smile, makes me feel proud to show off my face to the public. Lol.</li>
    <li> I am 38 and have been using this Facial Oil Cleanser for about 2 weeks now and I am very pleased. I was looking for a product that would cleanse my face, but not be harsh. These oils are all great for your skin &amp; leave my skin feeling more elastic than it has in years. I still use my old eye make-up remover just before I wash my face, because it doesn&#x27;t remove my eye make-up, which I don&#x27;t mind. I appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my facial cleanser in or around my eyes. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems ever since I was in my 20&#x27;s. Now I am in my 60&#x27;s!  Not only do I still suffer from occasional acne, but also red, peeling, sensitive skin. Many cleansing products dry out my sensitive skin, and some oil cleansers make me break out. I cannot tell you how many products I have tried, hoping to find one that worked for me. I am delighted to say that this product really works, and it has literally changed my skin in just a short time.</li>
    <li> I have used oil based facial cleansers for over a year now.  Granted, there&#x27;s not many out there that don&#x27;t cost a small fortune, so I&#x27;ve run the gamut.  I have evern created my own blend for use.  So, when I was offered this product to try for free, I was ecstatic!  I was conveniently running low on cleanser when I received this in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is divine!  I love the smell of this product.  It is refreshing and luxurious all at the same time.  I feel like I&#x27;m in my own spa when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light.  It is lighter than any other oil based cleanser I&#x27;ve used.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than feeling oily when you&#x27;ve finished washing your face.  And some make you feel really oily when you&#x27;re finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it clean my face better?  That I don&#x27;t know.  I had the same normal of adult acne breakouts that I usually do.  Maybe a little more, but I attest that to added work stress lately.  I do HIGHLY suggest keeping it away from your eyes.  I&#x27;m an all over the face person and had a few breakouts around the eye area that I wasn&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> Love this product - best facial cleanser I have used - removes makeup and leaves face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 out of 5 starts, because it was better at removing make-up after washing your face (when there&#x27;s just residual make-up left), than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see a full review of InstaNatural&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil, please visit http://meghanmariesite.wordpress.com/2014/09/16/deep-cleansing-facial-oil/</li>
    <li> A combination of high quality essential oils that combine to remove dirt, impurities, and oil. This cleaner with these oils worked wonders for my skin and reduced my pore size after a few weeks of use. Even with my oily skin, using an oil based cleaner was surprising good for it and helped keep the oil at bay. I did find that it smudged my makeup more then removing it however and had to use a makeup remover prior to washing with the cleansing oil. Overall, a very nice cleaner to have! I received the product complimentary for review purposes and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> This cleansing oil gently and thoroughly removes all traces of make-up including liner and mascara.  I was surprised to find how much residue was left on my skin with my usual facial soap-type cleanser.  I have combination type skin and this product leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, not oily.  Just be careful using the pump dispenser or you&#x27;ll squirt it across the room.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected at all.  I expected something more like the DHC deep cleansing oil, which I&#x27;ve used for a long time.  I decided to try this because it has lavender essential oil in it, which is a really good ingredient.  But, this oil doesn&#x27;t wash off cleanly at all.  It&#x27;s really oily and you have to wash again with soap to get this oil off your face, which kind of defeats the whole purpose.  So, I ended up buying my usual after using this only one time ;(  wasted purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Too oily.  Doesn&#x27;t emulsify with water.  Heavy.  Went back to DHC.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser and serum combo. Having acne prone skin, my entire life, I would have NEVER thought I&#x27;d wash my face with OIL! But, now in my 40&#x27;s, I have started learning what my skin needs. It needs INSTANATURAL! All of their facial skin care line has been a true blessing for my face. From the cleanser, toner, serum, eye gel, and moisturizer..you won&#x27;t find a better product line that ACTUALLY works (so far seeing and feeling results in just two weeks!) Affordable, top notch quality skin care, you&#x27;d be foolish not to give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed:) Oh, if you have any questions, contact them and ask. They actually return emails with detailed answers with in a few hours (or minutes in my case!) WIN-WIN-WIN!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. The company ent email as follow up and to ask if I had any questions.&lt;br /&gt;So nice to have a cleansing oil as the weather gets colder-ads moisture but my face feels moisturized.  I am noticing some fading of crows feet too!</li>
    <li> great facial cleaner that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
    <li> Very effective if you use a wash cloth to wipe off cause its very thick... other then that it leaves your face so smoothed and doesn&#x27;t leaving it dry I don&#x27;t need to use a moistuizer after this use :)</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to tell you that I rarely write reviews, so get ready for this one!!!    I just turned 60 years old last month and have always had problems with my complexion.  I have very dry skin, large pores and suffer from inflammation of my facial skin due to lupus, so therefore it is also ruddy.  I have used all lines of facial products during my lifetime.  I&#x27;ve used the VERY EXPENSIVE department store lines, from Clinique, Arden, Lancôme and even Channel!!!  I won&#x27;t name names here, but I&#x27;ve broken out from some of their products.  Only once did I ever return something, not knowing I had a right to.  That was with an eye serum that inflamed my eyes. I was given the third degree when I returned it and I had it for less than a week, with my receipt and my eyes were so obviously inflamed.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the hassle.  I had also been to dermatologists during my 20&#x27;s and their products did absolutely nothing and if I remember correctly, made my face even worse.    I&#x27;ve been currently using Olay&#x27;s Regenerist for about the past five years now.  While it is a good line, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick that my recent order with Insta Natural is doing for my face and in such a short time too.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks now and I have seen a major improvement in my complexion!!!    First and foremost, my nose and surrounding skin has always had large pores, but yet I have dry skin.  The first time I used Insta Natural Cleanser, I noticed the pores begin to tighten, but not in a dry sense, for this is made of a combination of oils and oils are what a mature skin needs.  Actually, with all these God given gifts of natural oils, all types of skin will benefit from it.  Can you imagine if I had started to use something like this in my 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s what my face would look like now?!?!  Girls, if you are that young, take my advice and start using this line of products.  And ladies, if you tried all the other \\&quot;promising\\&quot; products out there, you willbe glowingly surprised at what you will be seeing in the mirror.    About the 4th time I used it, I was engrossed in reading something on the computer and kept massaging the cleanser into my skin.  I was completely absorbed with what I was reading and completely absorbed into the massaging of the cleanser also.  After about 20 minutes, I could feel the dry skin coming off my face!!!    Last night, I ended up doing the same thing.  Massaging the cleanser in and reading on the net.  I couldn&#x27;t believe what happened after about 20 minutes once again.  I felt a small, hard grain of something and was curious if it wasn&#x27;t that nasty blackhead on the top of my left cheek bone; that no matter what I did, and yes, I&#x27;ve even tried gently squeezing it out to no avail.  Yes, I know that&#x27;s a NO-NO.  But sure enough, IT WAS FINALLY GONE!!!  WHOO HOO!!!  I attribute its removal to INSTA NATURAL CLEANSER and their blend of oils that made this nasty thing go away!!!    Last year due to health issues, I have finally taken my life into my own hands with God&#x27;s natural remedies............and guess what?  It&#x27;s working and I have just recently started working with oils.    The oils in this compound cleanser are some of the best and no doubt, in my mind, they are pure and that is very important.  Now I have only had this for a couple of weeks, but I have seen such vast improvement in such little time.  The fine lines around my mouth and eyes are beginning to plump up.  That&#x27;s what oils will do to your skin.  My pores are tightening and the inflammation and ruddiness on my cheeks and nose are improving.  My skin is so soft, like that of a child&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t wait to try their C Serum next.    I&#x27;d love to order the entire line and eventually will, but due to budget constraints, I&#x27;ll be adding them a little at a time for I believe that my 60 year old self will soon be looking like my 40 year old self.  In fact, a couple days after I started using this product, my lawn service guy asked me howold I was?  When I told him, he was surprised!!!  He said I didn&#x27;t look that old.  And I know it is due to this cleanser, because why didn&#x27;t he ask me that question all spring and summer, or for that matter, the past few years?  I just glow, I guess.  I&#x27;m really impressed.    So my advice to all you girls out there, no matter what age you are, DO TRY THIS/THESE/THEIR PRODUCTS!!!  I use 2-3 drops/squirts/day, but when I get into that facial massaging mode while reading, I do use 5 drops of it.  The results are amazing and this 4 oz. size bottle will last quite awhile and is SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than other chemically based products, even from the drug stores.    Oh, and their service department is excellent in following up with you, wanting to know how you like it, if you have had any questions or problems with it, if you would even like to return it.  That&#x27;s very commendable on their part vs. dealing with some snobs in the department store pushing chemicals to put on your face.  I know, because I worked with them.  That makes me wonder, now that I am into holistic health, if other products with chemicals in it, aren&#x27;t a contributing factor to one&#x27;s decline in health.    If you read this far, take care and have a blessed holiday season with your loved ones.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is 100% natural and organic, and contains Jojoba oil, olive oil, and hemp oil, as well as other amazing ingredients that are known for their beauty and cleansing properties. I love that this is a cleanser- and an oil. Most cleansers strip everything from your face, and can cause more &#x27;harm&#x27; than good in trying to keep your skin clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two &#x27;pumps&#x27; of InstaNaturals Cleanser at each use, twice daily. I massage into my skin, relax and enjoy the wonderful scent for a minute (or five...), and then rinse my face well with warm to hot water, and pat dry with a towel. It&#x27;s been over a  month, and I still am working on my first bottle. My skin is soft, and CLEAR! I used to average one &#x27;blemish&#x27; at any given time, and sometimes a few more. I have only had one blemish since making the switch. I had no ill reactions or side effects to any of the gentle and pure ingredients. I will not go back to other commercial stripping cleansers made with chemicals ever again! This cleanser cleans, moisturizes, and does not leave me oily. Thank you InstaNatural for another great product!</li>
    <li> This product is AWESOME! You don&#x27;t even have to use water. It literally removes all of makeup deep into the pores! Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love this for my 40 year old skin. I have oily skin that can break out and it can be sensitive but this cleansing oils feels and smells great. My skin is definitely doing signs of healing and looks healthier, dewy. (My skin was dull) I steam my face with a clean wascloth for a few minutes and then massage this oil on my face and neck. I remove it with the washcloth and warm water.? The only issue I had was that the bottle leaked because the top wasn&#x27;t screwed on fully during shipping.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  I love this stuff...like really love it.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much my old facial cleanser was stressing my skin out.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried an oil cleanser and I will never go back.  I have combination skin that tends to be prone to break-outs and is sensitive.  This facial cleanser leaves my skin soft, smooth, and clean.  Update (1/15/16):  I have been using the new formula for a couple of weeks and I have to say it is an upgrade.  I was afraid that I would not like it anymore but it is very nice.  This is lighter and washes off much cleaner. Also not much scent compared with the old formula.  Note many of these reviews are for the old formula and this new formula, although great, is much different.</li>
    <li> You have to try this to believe how well it works, to clean your skin well and make it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go natural using facial cleansers tired of all the chemicals but I real don&#x27;t see to much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am usually so tired and normally hate washing my face at the end of the day but because of this product, I actually enjoy doing it.  My face just instantly feels hydrated and calm.  I have been a customer now for awhile and will continue to be.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for long but I am very pleased with it. The geranium scent is pleasant. It cleanses my skin like no other could match. Most amazingly, it cleaned out the blackhead on my nose with little effort, and it seems to be able to shrink my pores just like that. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used it for a longer time and if I have more to report.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT REALLY WORKS!</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial oil for past three weeks. In my opinion it should be used as a make up remover along with other facial cleanser to achieve proper cleaning experience. This oil removes make up properly, including any eye make up (eye liner, mascara etc) and does not leave any residue. I usually use it before shower and then wash my face with my tea tree cleanser. That way my skin feels clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it using as makeup remover instead of wipes.</li>
    <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t actually rinse off like the DHC Cleansing Oil.  Strong smell.  I ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have very dry skin and this definitely helps!  I&#x27;ve already ordered more because I don&#x27;t want to run out of this one!!!</li>
    <li> I recently decided to try oil cleansing to see if it really does live up to all the hype that it&#x27;s receiving.  Am glad that I bought this product.  As a beauty pro and junkie, I like that it&#x27;s not filled with synthetic chemicals.  It also leaves my skin feeling cleansed, soft, and moist which is great since I also use Retin-A as part of my nightly skincare regime.  It&#x27;s been a few weeks now since I started using the facial oil cleanser (nightly) and my skin is responding very well with more refined skin texture and visibly smaller pores.  It&#x27;s also alleviated the flakiness and dry patches from the use of Retin-A. Thought I&#x27;d have problems since I have very oily skin but my skin is actually less oily now due to the fact that I&#x27;m not stripping my skin with chemical surfactants normally found in other skin cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent too with follow up advice on getting the best results.</li>
    <li> If you have experience in using facial oil cleansers (Shu Umera, AmorePacific, Nude, etc.)  and expect this to be the same, prepare to be disappointed. This  is simply a lovely mixture of oils, but they don&#x27;t emulsify or rinse clean. After putting this oil on your face (quite liberally), you need to wipe it off with a cotton ball, cloth or tissue to remove makeup. Your face will still feel oily, and, in my opinion, not clean. I tried this 3 times before giving up--twice with a Clairsonic trying to get it to work. I hate rubbing my eye area, but had to in an attempt to remove mascara--and still ended up with mascara shadows under my eyes each morning! This product is going back. This is certainly a nice mixture of oils, but I sincerely doubt that it cleans well.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, removes make up properly, but be careful with an area around eyes, it irritated them.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance, feels very indulgent on my skin!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that an oil cleanser would leave my skin oily. I am very happy with this product. It smells good and leaves my face clean and soft. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I needed a new facial cleanser and bought this after good reviews in amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I wasnt too happy about it at first because the oil would still stay even after washing it with a separate cleanser. But i realized that it was because i didnt know how to properly use the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now i love it because it erases my makeup very well, doesnt irritate my skin and also kinds of soften my skin. It doesnt cause any proplems even if i use it everyday, and produces very consistent results. I would definetely rebuy it if i could.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, results seen within week of use! I am African American with oily, acne prone skin and my face has never looked and felt better. No more high priced facials for me!</li>
    <li> removes make up well without skin feeling dry or over processed.</li>
    <li> Love this Oil Cleanser, i get breakouts so I was a little worried about putting oil on my skin. It really makes my skin soft and no breakouts! I recommend this product and it smells wonderful :)</li>
    <li> LOVE!  Use twice daily.  Have sensitive and combination skin and skin appears a little bit more manageable.  Skin also looks clearer and smoother. Not sure about pores yet, haven&#x27;t seen any difference in the week that I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> My face therapist told me the best products to use on your face are oil because of the laws of attraction. I use this frequently and follow it up with cold pressed avocado oil and I get lots of comments on my clear and soft complexion or as some say flawless complexion, great for an middle aged woman. Prior to using this combo I would use store bought products and my skin always looked flushed. The rosy color has gone since providing the proper hydration from using an oil cleanser and the avocado oil. Both leave my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed the facial oil cleanser. It really cleans well, is super gentle, and feels luxurious to use. So far I am really pleased with the quality of the InstaNaturals products as a whole and have been recommending them to my patients as a great natural skin care line.</li>
    <li> The smell is a little weird but once you get used to that you will love this. It is light, not greasy and cuts through makeup easily. My  skin feels great afterwards and i can forgo moisterizer with this! Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am very much liking these products, I&#x27;ve been using them a little over a month now.  I purchased the cleanser, toner, moisturizer and couple of the serums. The products are very lightweight, they penetrate my skin and don&#x27;t leave a build up on my face whatsoever. They have a nice fresh smell. A little goes a long way, so these products last. I can already notice my skin looking brighter and with a more even tone. And the products cost a fraction of some of the more expensive brands that I usually use, but work so much better in my opinion! This is definitely my new skin care line.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover and oil cleanser I have ever tried.  The scent is a floral mixed with citrus, and I can definitely tell you that it smells absolutely amazing, and the scent lasts a long time on my face. This oil cleanser does a great job removing my mascara, foundation, lipstick, and my eyeliner pretty easily without using a separate makeup remover!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to explain my experience after using this product as a facial cleanser since I have been using this for a couple weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One:&lt;br /&gt;Well, the first day when I opened this bottle, I totally thought I would be expecting this to be a soapy cleanser.  This is an OIL cleanser, filled with oils from different plants.  I was worried about putting this on my skin, especially because I tend to have some oily spots around my T-Zone.  But I know that a lot of the other face cleansers I have used usually strip my skin of the natural oils, and my body tries to compensate for that by producing additional oils in the areas of my face where I need them.  This is most likely why I have oily skin in certain spots.  The first time I used this cleanser I applied 3 pumps on my face, which is a lot more than needed.  Only one or two pumps is more than enough.  I applied this on dry skin and massaged it all over in a circular motion.  Then, I rinsed my face with warm water using a wash cloth.  The result gave me a very soft skin that lasted the entire day!&lt;br /&gt;The first week of using this product, I noticed that my skin was feeling softer day after day.  My family members even mentioned that my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week Two&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I started to notice that after the second week of using this product, the oil distribution that was usually concentrated along the T-Zone areas of my face is starting to balance out more with the rest of my face, and I no longer have the extremely oily spots like I used to.  This has helped me even with how my makeup looks, since I usually like to apply mattifying primers along my T-Zone.  And since I no longer have the need to do that, my face now looks more even that it ever has, and my makeup does not look oily or droopy.&lt;br /&gt;The other very important thing I need to mention is that this facial oil cleanser has led me to use a lot less moisturizers throughout the day to keep moisturized in the cold weather.  I went outside a couple days ago to play with my nephew in the snow, and that same morning I had applied the facial oil cleanser on my skin, and stayed outside for about an hour in the cold.  When I went back inside I noticed that my skin had still retained its moisture, and I did not need to apply a moisturizer.  This is pretty impressive for an oil cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am pretty amazed by the quality of this product and all of the InstaNatural products I have tried so far, and I highly recommend this facial oil cleanser!  I hope that this review was helpful in making your purchase decision.ke to apply mattifying primers along my T-Zone.

    <li> This oil cleanser took a little getting used to. I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin and the cleanser left my skin feeling slightly oily. I did have a couple of minor breakouts but after about a week my skin adjusted. This cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft. There is never any dirt residual on the cotton ball after toning and I have been able to switch to a lighter day moisturizer. I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love it! My face is clear and more even! I am 38 and was looking for a fave wash that would clean, not strip my face, &amp;amp; improve my complexion....!FOUND IT!!!</li>
    <li> WORKED AMAZING!! LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for a few weeks now. I do not see a huge improvement in acne scars and dark spots (yet) but it does seem to give my skin a smoother appearance. It has a very pleasant citrus-type smell.</li>
    <li> What is this you ask? Well what I use this for is a cleanser. It is oily cleanser. So that might take some time getting used to. It took away my makeup with no problems. If you work out and need something to help take off the sweat and grim build up. This would be great option for that. Should you forget to take off your makeup and sleep in it over night. Which one is a no no. It also ages your face 7 days yes that is a week per night you leave your makeup on. Not to mention the makeup will get into the pores and make your face age faster too. It comes in a pump. I had to use a couple good pumps. I would not suggest this in the shower if you do warn the next one. It has some oiliness and if you are not careful you could fall. So I would do this with warm water and then after you have rinsed it out to shock your skin with cool water. I am sure you are asking why well warm helps open up the pores and cold helps close them up.  I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I did get them either free or lower price.</li>
    <li> Just in love with this cleanser. My skin is dry and this is the first time I try a cleanser which hydrates my skin</li>
    <li> This is okay.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible &#x27;gains&#x27; on my face.  How long is one supposed to use it before observing benefits?</li>
    <li> This is product is so good! Not only for removing make up, but my skin is so soft! I used to get small black heads on my nose and chin...and since I&#x27;ve been using this product they are completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also need to make a special note for the amazing costumer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else to say...I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good product for facial cleaning. Effectively remove the makeup at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I usually stay away from facial oils because of how greasy they are, but I decided to try this since I got it for free and it works awesome! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel slimy and gross, it&#x27;s just really hydrating and smoothing. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because the ingredients are so healthy and if you like facial cleansing oils, this one has everything you want in one. It removes makeup wonderfully and leaves your face soft and clean feeling. Because my skin gets a lot of blackheads, I usually follow this at night with a bentonite clay cleanser. This oil works well with other cleansers or by itself. This is the fourth product from instanatural that I&#x27;ve bought and I love them all.</li>
    <li> amazing facial cleaning oil that makes the skin soft and not at all dry like some cleansers can do . as always Instanatural makes a fantastic product that is so much nicer to use than my regular facial wash. It also closes pores nicely and smells pretty it a fantastic buy&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to try in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this product when I&#x27;m removing my makeup! Most makeup removers that I have used in the past were too harsh for my skin and my face ends up feeling raw, irritated and dry. At one point, I had to resort to using baby oil to remove my makeup. I prefer using InstaNatural&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser because not only does it work great as a makeup remover, it also purifies my pores and pampers my skin! I love the fact that it has natural ingredients that works well for my ultra sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Really enjoyed this product! Does a really good job of washing your face and removing your makeup.  I love the citrusy smell.  The only reason I gave it a 4-star review rather than 5-stars is because of the price.  However, this is a real high-quality product.  The bottle size seems small when you get it but the product will last a long time.  I only use about 3-4 pumps per washing--you can barely tell that I&#x27;ve used the product at all and I&#x27;ve used it consistently for a week.  I&#x27;m very impressed--didn&#x27;t break out this week while using this product.  That&#x27;s BIG for me.  Ingredients are top-notch!</li>
    <li> If you want all your makeups including foundation, concealer, eye shadow, lipstick and mascara  to be cleansed off of your face and receive nutrients at the same time then this product is for you. If you don&#x27;t wear makeup and want something to cleanse and moisturize your face and neck,  that is all natural and free of  fake ingredient , then this product is for you.  This facial oil cleanser is amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial oil cleanser! I tend to have dry skin on my face these days. The cleanser helped to make my face feel cleaner and smooth! I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it got my skin!</li>
    <li> I am highly satisfied with my facial oil cleanser.  My skin has greatly improved, pores are shrinking and the small lines around my eyes are slowly improving. I am so happy I came across this product and I plan on purchasing more once I run out. I sure hope the company does not stop making this miracle oil.  The customer service and communication is top notch.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser!  I totally recommend it.  Check out my full review here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://kinkykinetik.blogspot.com/2014/09/product-review-instanatural-facial-oil.html</li>
    <li> Feels so good on the skin, nice and clean.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t so sure about using oil to clean my face since I have oily skin.  But this stuff is great.  I use a retinol product and have a tendency to get flakey skin.  Using this has stopped the problem.</li>
    <li> My goodness, the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used for the expenditure.  Very very good quality!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my face so soft and clean and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy at all.</li>
    <li> my face has never felt better.</li>
    <li> I tried the oil cleansing method months ago, and it made my acne-prone skin flare up horribly, even after weeks. But I&#x27;ve been using this recently to take off my makeup before washing my face, sometimes using it twice and skipping the cleanser, and my face feels smooth, radiant, and hasn&#x27;t broken out. This would be really good for all skin types, and it removes mascara and eye makeup really well too, which is a lot gentler for your eyelashes too. It&#x27;s really nice to have around and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing and smells wonderful! I use it to remove makeup and it gets every last smudge of eye makeup off quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I love to use new cleanser to find one that work well for removing all of my makeup - I tried this one and it did remove my foundation, but I ended up with raccoon eyes.  I used several cotton balls with the cleaners and still could not get my eye makeup off - I used my other cleanser and removed my eye makeup with that.  My skin felt soft when I was finished with cleaning it and a bit greasy, but since I was going to bed that was great with the dry air from the A/C blowing all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this cleanser for my face, but not for my eye makeup - I can see using this when the air is dry and your skin needs extra moisturizing for the night, but for eye makeup I could not figure out how to use this cleanser- I hate the raccoon look.  I will not be using this to remove my eye makeup again.  I do love to have skin that feels soft and clean like after using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Not for everyday for my needs, but perfect to remove eye makeup that seems so stubborn</li>
    <li> The makeup cleaner is fabulous.  Very little effort to wipe off mascara, eyeliner, foundation.  Does not dry out my skin.  Would recommend to anyone that wears makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product to use for removing eye make up!</li>
    <li> Really loving this cleansing oil! I have oily skin so I was wary of using this but was pleasantly surprised at how well it removed my makeup, including my eyeshadow and mascara. Once I washed my face thoroughly my skin felt soft and really clean. Doesn&#x27;t break me out either which is amazing! Definitely want to buy this after I run out. I&#x27;m excited I was given this opportunity to review this product!</li>
    <li> I received this for free to test and review, but nonetheless, I&#x27;m 100% honest in this review. I was really surprised at how this cleanser made my oily face cleaner and smoother. Since my face is normally so oily, I was hesitant to use this, worrying it would only make it worse, but after using it for a few days, it actually made my face seem much less oily! Great product. One thing to mention - although they say &amp;#34;makeup remover&amp;#34; I found that this did a TERRIBLE job at that, and actually really bothered my eye area, so I would not recommend using this for anything beyond a basic facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I really believed this cleansing oil would remove my makeup. It didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had to purchase cleansing towelettes, which really do the job. It might be the fault of the Konjac sponges I used instead of my usual Buffpuffs. The Buffpuffs were able to scrub my skin better so that the oil worked better too. Alone, this facial oil didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> I applied for the promotion this company was doing, and was super happy to be able to try out their facial oil. They also sent me a free bottle of their Rosehip Oil as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably just really naive in terms of facial care, but the idea of applying oil to my face  seemed a bit strange. For me, I try to keep my face NOT oily. Still, I was excited to try the product, and did so as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Facial Oil was pretty self explanatory. It cleansed. It says on the front of the bottle that it can be used as a makeup remover. The first night I tried it, I didn&#x27;t have makeup on. I&#x27;d used another cleanser earlier that morning, and has basically sat inside all day, so I didn&#x27;t think my face was in need of too much cleaning. I grabbed a dry facecloth, applied the oil and began to gently wipe my face. I was mildly horrified, and weirdly impressed when my white facecloth turned brown. I couldn&#x27;t believe the grime it had picked off on my face after just a quick sweep of the area. Since then, it has become my go to cleaner, makeup or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, their was a definite oil feel and I was worried for the impending breakout. It didn&#x27;t happen. My skin absorbed it and my face was super soft. No residue and no acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to my Rosehip Oil, while the bottle gave possible uses, I was wanting to see what other people used it as. I turned to two of my groups on Facebook. They are both for varying levels of &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; moms. I asked them if Rosehip was in any of their daily routines. A lot of them used it for a facial cleanse and moisturizer every night. (I tried this later on and found that it was interchangeable with the facial oil and provided similar results).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others used it on their babies, for dry patches of skin, and even cradle cap! They used it in their hair, and as the bottle suggested on their scars, even their stretchmarks! I&#x27;ve tried it, not routinely, on a few of their suggestions, and each timeI was pleased.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try oil cleansing for some time but was so nervous!  I was worried about using the wrong oil, using too much or too little and ending up with a hot mess.  This facial oil cleanser takes all of the guess work out oil cleansing.  I love it!!  I smooth it on and then wipe it off with a warm wet washcloth.  My face feels so soft and smooth. After using this oil cleanser for a little over a month, my skin honestly looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a one-step product that will *gently* remove my makeup (including eye makeup!), and leave my face feeling clean and light.  This is it!!  Smells wonderful, only requires a couple of small pumps on your fingertips, and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy film or dry my skin out...perfect balance.  Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> InstaNaturals Facial Oil Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is pump style Oil Facial Cleanser and yet it doesn&#x27;t leave your face as oily as yesterdays breakfast or even today&#x27;s lunchtime fries. It just isn&#x27;t like that. It cleans the face, leaves it feeling soft, moisturized and yet tight. I do recommend this product and as I continue to use this Facial Oil Cleanser I will write more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would think that a product that uses oils to clean your face would well not clean your face and leave it even greasier. However, it is the total opposite effect and the ingredients help balance your skin out while keeping it from overly producing oil from your pores and the pH will become balanced on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients found in the Deep Cleansing Facial Oil by InstaNatural:&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil - a light oil that don&#x27;t clog the pores and cause allergic reactions. It&#x27;s packed with Vitamin E and minerals that help promote clear and healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Olive Oil - soothes and heals the skin, while repairing the cells and preventing cell damage Lavendar Essential Oil - soothes the skin and is very good keeping your face free of bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Pink Grapefruit Essential Oil - acts as a wonderful astringent and toner&lt;br /&gt;Tamanu Oil - great for marks of wrinkles, aging, stretch marks, acne and a bunch more&lt;br /&gt;Hemp Oil - will help reduce pore size, and get rid of those black heads, acne, and protects the skin from free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;Sea Buckthorn Oil - provides the skin with antioxidants and Vitamins C, E and Anthocyannis. Known to be able to treat acne and prevent age related damage. Also keeps skin moisturized. Geranium Essential Oil - Keeps the skin cells strong and treat or clear acne, scars, and spots.</li>
    <li> In love with this cleanser. No scrubbing required and all makeup comes off with ease (even eye makeup). Leaves my face feeling so moisturized after using it. I even notice I get less breakouts!</li>
    <li> Waoooo is a 5 star product .</li>
    <li> I like this product. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that works as well as the DHC face oil which is great but not organic.  This oil is a little thicker but it does take even my waterproof mascara off. I always use a warm washcloth to remove the oil but then I use a face wash also.  The face wash alone will not remove my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it is thick and because I think 5 stars has to be a phenomenal product with no downsides.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product. I have to admit that I was a little nervous at first using an oil cleanser; however just after a week of using the Facial Oil Cleanser, I was receiving compliments on my skin. At the end of the day, I look forward to washing my face and feeling the fresh soft skin it leaves. I love that your products are all natural and I am excited about trying more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;Michelle S.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so hard to wash it ,</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a cleanser that washed off with water like many on here. My face is easily irritated and I have been using a cleansing balm that is greasy and gross. I really like this mild scent, and it does get off all the makeup and oil you just have to work at it a little and then wipe with a damp cloth. I thought it dried me out at first, but I think what it really did was worked off some dead skin that my greasy balm hadn&#x27;t really been removing from my face. All-in-all I really like this product.</li>
    <li> First several times i tried this product i was happy, but then...</li>
    <li> I have used facial cleansing oils for years.  I like to try new ones to see what&#x27;s available.  This oil smells good-no artificial perfumes. But that is the only thing I liked.  The texture is so thick I needed to rub too hard to get it spread and worked into my skin to remove makeup, etc. This product also leaves a thick film of oil even when I use a washcloth and warm water to remove it (as advised).  The remaining residue clogged my pores and caused breakouts-in addition I do not want to rub my face with a washcloth twice a day.  When I exfoliate it will be with the right tools.  My skin reacts really well to moisturizing oils formulated for the face and which are formulated to stay on the skin after application.  Sent it back.</li>
    <li> I use twice a day with amazing results. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin or cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> Unlike others I was not a fan of the smell. It&#x27;s juniper or something else equally strong and just not pleasant for me anyway. Also did not remove eye makeup as readily as others have reported. I really have to leave it on to soak and even then my mascara requires multiple passes of the washcloth before getting it all off. I don&#x27;t want to have to rub my eyes more than necessary. And my mascara is water resistant but not waterproof. So this was not the one for me.</li>
    <li> I love this item, it smells so nice!</li>
    <li> Very strong smelling and for this I take off three stars. It also made me break out a little bit so I don&#x27;t think my skin liked it.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about using oil cleanser on my face but I&#x27;ve heard good things about oil cleansing so I though I&#x27;d give a go.  So far, so good!  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like I expected, but rather leaves my face feeling soft and not greasy.  I can&#x27;t tell anything significant changes in appearance (nor do I know if you&#x27;re supposed to!), but my skin does feel soft.  I&#x27;ll definitely stick with it!</li>
    <li> Love to use this before my Vitamin C serum.</li>
