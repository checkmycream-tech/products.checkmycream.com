      <li>AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE HIALURONIC ACID IS THE BEST FOR THE SKIN.</li>
      <li>This is a excellent eye cream.  </li>
      <li>Happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>

      <li>And the price is great.  </li>
      <li>It is great for puffiness and makes my eyes shine and it works great.</li>
      <li>Great product....</li>
      <li>Works great under eyes.</li>
      <li>Seems to be a good product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product as being a really good product for lifting and puffiness, does not do anything for wrinkles however.</li>
      <li>I used this for a number of months, so I gave it a good chance.  </li>
      <li>It feels good going on.  </li>
      <li>It takes a good 10 years off.</li>
      <li>I found that I loved it on my eyes.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Wife is loving it all and after six months or so here</li>
      <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t see any results with the product and the cons weigh outweigh the pros on this one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found an eye cream that is effective at reducing poofiness.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled I can still purchase this eye care from Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than the pen.</li>
      <li>I love this eye product.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed use it.</li>
      <li>i cannot imagine anyone giving this product anything more than 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>I have a friend that works for ROC and gave it to me as a gift ever since I have been using it love it</li>
      <li>But truth is, holding a rag with ice cubes over my eyes for 5 minutes, or cucumber slices, would do more than this \\&quot;lift\\&quot; eye cream did.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s why I have used this product for so many years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about  </li>
      <li>My favorite is the filler, but this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other products but none has done what the RoC has done and I am very happy that I have found this product</li>
      <li>If it is still available I will surely buy it again and would tell my friends to buy it which I have done.</li>
      <li>You have to find just the right amount to apply and that is tricky because the product is a gel type consistency and it kind of comes oozing out of the tube....</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a person who react easily to cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>It works fine under eye shadow primer and shadow.     </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve never expect such a good result as it came to my crow feet and saggy skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>It is light and non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t burn/bother my eyes the way so many other product have.  </li>
      <li>and this really work!</li>
      <li>(I bought my first bottle at Walgreens).  </li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars for working pretty well but being itchy an prickly.</li>
      <li>It has consistently \\&quot;pilled\\&quot; up, or flaked off (whatever you want to call it) around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>However, it works, my eyes look better, the eye bags have become smaller too.</li>
      <li>your face first including the eye area and&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>Love other RoC products with no unpleasant side effects.  </li>
      <li>I use several other ROC products and love them, so I&#x27;m surprised that this one isn&#x27;t as kind to my skin.  </li>
      <li>IS SO PURE ...</li>
      <li>I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture/elasticity of the skin underneath my eyes and also my eyelids after using this product for several weeks.  </li>
      <li>So Roc is not worse than others.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for puffy eyes...</li>
      <li>was very liquid which it is supposed to be a cream I believe</li>
      <li>AND I FELL VERY WELL.</li>
      <li>and even I kept on using my other creams, drank a lot of water and ate healthy; wrinkles increased around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Roc Complete Lift Eye Cream does exactly what it advertises to do..</li>
      <li>It significantly reduces the puffiness under the eyes and fine lines are less apparent.  </li>
      <li>But for quick and obvious results, I recomend it!</li>
      <li>Oh, it took about 3 days after I stopped the eye cream before my eyes began to look normal.</li>
      <li>The tube lasts a long time so, it is worth the $$.</li>
      <li>I am a pretty big Roc fan, but I don&#x27;t like this one.</li>
      <li>It does work to lift and open up the upper lids, but I find that it feels prickly, itchy, and dry after a short time and sometimes even putting lotion on top doesn&#x27;t calm it.     </li>
      <li>light weight &amp; goes on well and feels just like any other eye cream didnt see much happeing in the \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; area in my opinion but could work very well for some others i guess since different things work differently on people..</li>
      <li>and so far it is everything that it said it is.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 51 years old</li>
      <li>I have one eye that droops a little more than the other</li>
      <li>I even keep it in the fridge and use it cold, which adds to the good feeling over poofy eyes.  </li>
      <li>Really helped my eyes get less poofy in the morning.</li>

<li> Really helped my eyes get less poofy in the morning.</li>
<li> After a few days you&#x27;ll be back to normal.  </li>
<li> but if you have sensitive skin like I do, it may sting a little when you apply it initially</li>
<li> It did not less my dark circles or make them disappear.</li>
<li> I am 66 yrs old, and have tried MANY other products, and was very sad when this came off the market.  </li>
<li> really works - hard to find in stores</li>
<li> I will keep buying this as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;And would recommend this 100%.&lt;br</li>
<li> Also apply my night cream over the serum, because it tends to stay dry after the application.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t bring me back my 20 years old but at least, I look healthier.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and my dark circles still looks the same.</li>
<li> So, my next purchase will happen when it drops down in price.</li>
<li> This is the only product out of the at least 20 I have tried that actually reduced the puffiness under my eyes and lifted the eyelids.  </li>
<li> After using the product for four weeks, I&#x27;m not seeing the results promised or that I expected.</li>
<li> have tried may products in the last few years</li>
<li> Just be careful not to get it</li>
<li> You have to be careful not to use too much of this product or it can be irritating</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> As you can see in one photo the &amp;#34;black eye spot&amp;#34;, is without using ROC and the other photo is with ROC.  </li>
<li> I put other Roc wrinkle cream underneath it, so maybe that&#x27;s why.  </li>
<li> But other than that, I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on my undereye poofiness.  </li>
<li> The lines and dark spots are gradually fading.</li>
<li> I STILL HAVE UNDER EYE PUFFINESS AND DARK CIRCLES  </li>
<li> Used product for 1 month because I watched a You-Tube video stating that it lessened dark circles under the eyes and made dark circles disappear.</li>
<li> I know it&#x27;s going to take a while since my dark circles didn&#x27;t take place over night.</li>
<li> IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
<li> It however feels like a slight burning when we apply it (retinol) for maybe 4 seconds.</li>
<li> I have been using tis product for a month and have noticed a change in my eyelid slight lifted and under eye is less puffy and less wrinkes .I</li>
<li> A WASTE NOT WORTH $18.00</li>
<li> I could not believe this little tube cost $25.00.</li>
<li> let&#x27;s just say when i stop using this, i notice my eye looks a little droopy.</li>
<li> I &#x27;ve ordered... and just wasted my money again.  </li>
<li> I have gone through many eye products because I have a horrible dark spot that looks like I have a black eye.  </li>
<li> I use very little, and the tube lasts quite awhile.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve tried Roc day/night creams in the past</li>
<li> It was  a small tube that I amazon did not advertise on their website.</li>
<li> It should have been at least $10.00 or $11.00.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DIDNT WORK FOR ME I STILL HAVE UNDER EYE PUFFINESS AND DARK CIRCLES  WILL BE RETURNING BECAUSE IM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The Eye Lift Cream does tighten the skin in the eye area, making it feel like a mini face lift. It also has the ingredients that I searched for before I settled on a skin care product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RoC products work for me. I use expensive foundations, blush, eye shadows, etc., but I prefer RoC products over all of the very expensive creams for lifting what needs lifting, fading spots that you want to go away, and putting some life back in a complexion that looks faded out. My favorite is the filler, but this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I have been using tis product for a month and have noticed a change in my eyelid slight lifted and under eye is less puffy and less wrinkes .I have tried may products in the last few years and this really work!</li>
    <li> light weight &amp; goes on well and feels just like any other eye cream didnt see much happeing in the \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; area in my opinion but could work very well for some others i guess since different things work differently on people..</li>
    <li> This really works!  My eye lids are firmer, bags under my eyes not so prominant.  And the price is great.  A little goes a long way.  I will buy the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> THIS EYE CREAM DOES PROVIDE A LIGHTER TONE TO THE AREA APPLIED. I AM SATIFIED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT I SEE</li>
    <li> was very liquid which it is supposed to be a cream I believe</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for like 2 weeks and I see no difference at all, maybe its too soon to tell</li>
    <li> This is the only product out of the at least 20 I have tried that actually reduced the puffiness under my eyes and lifted the eyelids.  I have one eye that droops a little more than the other and it is greatly improved from the use of this product in 2 weeks.  Await to see a longer term result.  I would recommend this product as being a really good product for lifting and puffiness, does not do anything for wrinkles however.</li>
    <li> Roc Complete Lift Eye Cream does exactly what it advertises to do..that&#x27;s why I have used this product for so many years.</li>
    <li> really works - hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the pen. Although it didn&#x27;t do as well as they advertise FOR ME I found that I loved it on my eyes. It moisturized well and there was no skin irritation and it DID NOT burn my eyes. If it is still available I will surely buy it again and would tell my friends to buy it which I have done.</li>
    <li> I use this one now. It is great for puffiness and makes my eyes shine and it works great. I love it!</li>
    <li> WHE I GET UP , AFTER CLEANING MY FACE, I PUT IT ON AND I FELL VERY WELL. IS SO PURE ... I WILL BUY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE HIALURONIC ACID IS THE BEST FOR THE SKIN. TRY IT</li>
    <li> This is a excellent eye cream.  I enjoyed use it. However, the price has gone up quite a bit.  So, my next purchase will happen when it drops down in price.</li>
    <li> It does work to lift and open up the upper lids, but I find that it feels prickly, itchy, and dry after a short time and sometimes even putting lotion on top doesn&#x27;t calm it.     It works fine under eye shadow primer and shadow.     I use several other ROC products and love them, so I&#x27;m surprised that this one isn&#x27;t as kind to my skin.  I gave it 3 stars for working pretty well but being itchy an prickly.</li>
    <li> this works but if you have sensitive skin like I do, it may sting a little when you apply it initially and it takes a while to normalize. However, it works, my eyes look better, the eye bags have become smaller too. The tube lasts a long time so, it is worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I heard about the RoC from someone on youtube and I tried it and so far it is everything that it said it is.  I have tried many other products but none has done what the RoC has done and I am very happy that I have found this product and I will recommend  it to all those who I meet that is in need of it.</li>
    <li> I am a pretty big Roc fan, but I don&#x27;t like this one. You have to be careful not to use too much of this product or it can be irritating and you don&#x27;t want to get this in your eye. You have to find just the right amount to apply and that is tricky because the product is a gel type consistency and it kind of comes oozing out of the tube.... Honestly I don&#x27;t see any results with the product and the cons weigh outweigh the pros on this one. I would not recommend or repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I will keep buying this as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;And would recommend this 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Found this by process of elimination. Always&lt;br /&gt;hydrate your face first including the eye area and&lt;br /&gt;apply this and you wont have the problem of peeling.</li>
    <li> only eye cream that i have found (regardless of price) that will definitely lift your eye.  the lift is enough for you to notice but not drastic.  let&#x27;s just say when i stop using this, i notice my eye looks a little droopy.</li>
    <li> i cannot imagine anyone giving this product anything more than 5 stars.  I just ran out and have to order another tube.  NOTHING works as well as ROC.  I use it in the creases next to my nose and my jaw line also.  It works well there also.  You don&#x27;t need an eye lid lift.  Just use this.  After a few days you&#x27;ll be back to normal.  This works.  I have gone through many eye products because I have a horrible dark spot that looks like I have a black eye.  Only ROC takes care of it!! As you can see in one photo the &amp;#34;black eye spot&amp;#34;, is without using ROC and the other photo is with ROC.  I have the same amount of concealer and makeup in both photos.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see no big difference. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and my dark circles still looks the same. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while since my dark circles didn&#x27;t take place over night. I will continue with this product for another 5 months. Hopefully by then I will have some great results.</li>
    <li> NO IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL. IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. WHAT A WASTE NOT WORTH $18.00</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about  this product. After using the product for four weeks, I&#x27;m not seeing the results promised or that I expected.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge improvement in the texture/elasticity of the skin underneath my eyes and also my eyelids after using this product for several weeks.  It is light and non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t burn/bother my eyes the way so many other product have.  I&#x27;ve actually had some difficulty finding this product in the store again (I bought my first bottle at Walgreens).  Happy to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wife is loving it all and after six months or so here now I&#x27;m noticing a lot of improvement with Roc products.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when the cream arrived in the mail. It was  a small tube that I amazon did not advertise on their website. I could not believe this little tube cost $25.00. It should have been at least $10.00 or $11.00. Nonetheless, the cream is doing miracles to my eyes. My crow lines are vanishing slowly and the bags under my eyes is shrinking.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this product for a month now.  It significantly reduces the puffiness under the eyes and fine lines are less apparent.  I use this at night.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to go well under my makeup.  I prefer an eye moisturizing product for day wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> I used this for a number of months, so I gave it a good chance.  It has consistently \\&quot;pilled\\&quot; up, or flaked off (whatever you want to call it) around my eyes.  Not very attractive.  I put other Roc wrinkle cream underneath it, so maybe that&#x27;s why.  But other than that, I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on my undereye poofiness.  It feels good going on.  I even keep it in the fridge and use it cold, which adds to the good feeling over poofy eyes.  But truth is, holding a rag with ice cubes over my eyes for 5 minutes, or cucumber slices, would do more than this \\&quot;lift\\&quot; eye cream did.  I&#x27;ve never found an eye cream that is effective at reducing poofiness.  So Roc is not worse than others.  It&#x27;s about the same.</li>
    <li> This is like the umpteenth... eye cream I &#x27;ve ordered... and just wasted my money again.  Doesn&#x27;t do much for puffy eyes... in fact no change at all.</li>
    <li> I have a friend that works for ROC and gave it to me as a gift ever since I have been using it love it</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product.</li>
    <li> This serum made a drastic change around my eyes and around my lips...and this in 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been sick a lot and even I kept on using my other creams, drank a lot of water and ate healthy; wrinkles increased around my eyes. I&#x27;m a 51 years old and I&#x27;ve tried Roc day/night creams in the past but I&#x27;ve never expect such a good result as it came to my crow feet and saggy skin around my eyes. It however feels like a slight burning when we apply it (retinol) for maybe 4 seconds. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a person who react easily to cosmetics.  Also apply my night cream over the serum, because it tends to stay dry after the application. But for quick and obvious results, I recomend it! It won&#x27;t bring me back my 20 years old but at least, I look healthier.</li>
    <li> I love this eye product.  It is not oily, and it works !  I use very little, and the tube lasts quite awhile.  It tightens the skin around my eyes, and it works !  I am 66 yrs old, and have tried MANY other products, and was very sad when this came off the market.  I&#x27;m thrilled I can still purchase this eye care from Amazon.com.  Thank you !</li>
    <li> My eyes were puffy each morning and were progressively worse, stopped using after 3 nights.  Love other RoC products with no unpleasant side effects.  Oh, it took about 3 days after I stopped the eye cream before my eyes began to look normal.</li>
    <li> Works great under eyes. It takes a good 10 years off. Just be careful not to get it *into* your eyes!</li>
    <li> Great product....I noticed a big difference after about one month. The lines and dark spots are gradually fading. Hopefully, I will continue to see improvements by the end of month two.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel any different.</li>
    <li> Really helped my eyes get less poofy in the morning.</li>
    <li> Used product for 1 month because I watched a You-Tube video stating that it lessened dark circles under the eyes and made dark circles disappear. It did not less my dark circles or make them disappear.</li>
