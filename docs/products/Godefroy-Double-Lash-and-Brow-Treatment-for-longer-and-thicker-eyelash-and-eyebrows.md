      <li>Does anyone know if it is safe to use during pregnancy ?</li>
      <li>It would be better if the applicator was built into the tube like a lot of eyelash serums, then you just apply it like mascara.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It definitely made my eyebrows look fuller, and for that I keep using it. But, I don&#x27;t think it is making them grow. It seems to act like a dye, coloring in the white and gray strands so they show up more and giving the appearance of growth. And, the more often I use it, the darker my brows get. I started using it everyday, then my eyebrows got too dark so I now keep them up with applications every other day. It can be quite greasy so I use it sparingly; more is defintely not better. At first I thought the price a little high, but now that I&#x27;m seeing how long it is lasting, I feel the price is reasonable. I am pleased with this purchase and plan to repeat it.</li>
    <li> After using Lilash for the last two years it was not available anymore so I changed to this and it is just as good for 1/10 of the price (I live in New Zealand)  I would thoroughly recommend this product</li>
    <li> have seen new growth even my eye brow threading lady noticed.</li>
    <li> I started this product before my wedding.  It smells great, very herbal smelling.  Its very think, almost like vasoline consistency, and goes on better with a finger than the brush provided.  If it gets in your eye is doesn&#x27;t sting, but I did realize after a few nights of using it, it slowly gets in your eye overnight and creates almost a film over your eye, which is irriating to deal with.  It worked I guess?  I didn&#x27;t notice a miracle growth but it conditioned my brows and lashes at least</li>
    <li> I could see a difference within a few weeks of using it. Loved it! Love the product and price. Works well with eyelash serum.</li>
    <li> I started to use it on my eye lashes but grew impatient because I kept forgetting to apply every day... BUT I did use it on my eye brows as I noticed they were sparse in areas and I over plucked... they are super full and thick and I don&#x27;t need to fill them in at all or as much!</li>
    <li> Complete waste of money. This is essentially like putting neosporin on your eyelids or brows. It&#x27;s goopy and messy, doesn&#x27;t really dry. I tried this for a month and saw absolutely no results. I had to just throw this away. I&#x27;m glad I only wasted 10 dollars, it could have been far worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product on my eyebrows and hope that it works. It&#x27;s only been about 2.5 weeks and the recommended time frame is 6 weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen any progress so far.</li>
    <li> I have used Double Lash and Brow product for over one month now and I am NOT pleased with the results...it has done nothing to enhance growth of my eyebrows which have become thinner due to age, etc...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 or 3 weeks now with no noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m using primarily on my brows as the outer half of my brows have become sparse over the past 10 years.  Will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.  Maybe it takes longer than I&#x27;ve given it.</li>
    <li> This product did help my eyebrows and lashes grow a bit but no at all like I thought by the reviews. It is a decent product for the money, but you have to continually use it to keep up the good results.</li>
    <li> I have very thin eyebrows and short and thin lashes.  I have been using this product for only two weeks and I see results.  Within the first week, I saw a spot in my eyebrows, which never grows and I have to fill in with pencil, fill in.  I already see results in my bottom lashes, as where I could not even put mascara on them before, now there are a lot of lashes to put mascara on.  I love this product.  Great price and works quick!</li>
    <li> Not sure if i noticed any of the miracle effects this product claims to have, but this is a very good lash moisturizer and my lashes did get a tad darker and longer too but no fullness whatsoever</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but I feel it is starting to work.  I like that it is thick and doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes.  Makes it easy to put on the lower lashes. I am hopeful!  Unfortunately shipping costs as much as the product.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but for something stronger that will give you faster results, check out royalcosmetics.net</li>
    <li> Not saying it  couldn&#x27;t work for you it just didn&#x27;t for me. I didn&#x27;t like the texture and if it gets in the eyes it feels weirdly gritty. If you buy it get more applicators, germs multiply on just the one. Good luck</li>
    <li> This is little more than putting oil on your eyelashes and brows. Your better off using some higher grade vitamin e oil. My face is oily enough that using this doesn&#x27;t help. I hate shiny face look, and who wants to take ALL their mascara off every night? Rubbing the skin around your eyes so much is not good for retaining elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t list the ingredients, so I took  chance. Here they are so you don&#x27;t have to:&lt;br /&gt;Ricinus Communis (fancy name for caster oil), Lanolin, Triticum Vulgae (fancy name for wheat germ oil) - First 3 ingredients are oil ... as I continue&lt;br /&gt;Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Palminate, Silica, Tocopheryl Acetate (name for vitamin e), Limonene, Linalool, Parfum&lt;br /&gt;Unless you can find a better use for this, I&#x27;m better off using it on my lips.</li>
    <li> My lashes are so much thicker and darker now, I barely put any mascara on them! (wink) You have to try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I had been told that it would take about six weeksof daily for results to show.  6 weeks later, my eyelashes were almost DOUBLE the length they had been, and I am over 60, when all my other hair is thinning!  Much less expensive than the prescription cost.  Get it, and you, too, may be running around your house saying, &amp;#34;Look at my eyelashes!  Look at my eyelashes!&amp;#34;  Sadly, my husband said they looked the same to him:  I don&#x27;t know whether to be upset that he doesn&#x27;t see any difference, or love the fact that he always thought my eyelashes were this pretty!</li>
    <li> I Order  2 of Godefroy Double Lash and Brow Treatment, for longer &amp; thicker eyelash and eyebrows (3ml + applicator)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he was surprised by the various</li>
    <li> I had originally bought this item because one eyebrow was thicker than the other and I was tired of trying to make them look even with an eyebrow pencil, after only 3 weeks I saw a huge difference. Even the person that threads my eyebrows commented on how good they looked. I&#x27;m very happy and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I only used it on my eyebrows and it truley worked. You have to be avid about putting it on every night tho</li>
    <li> I used this product om my eyebrows and saw results in three weeks. For years I have suffered with short ends and this product is my savior. Im almost done with my first tube which is very small but it lasted almost two months. placed an order today for two more tubes. I have hair where there was never any before, its not completly full and so i am hoping for more results with these next two tubes. I will come back and update yal on my results.</li>
    <li> no improvement.  didn&#x27;t work for me, and i ordered 3 by mistake.  no results.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I really notice the difference</li>
    <li> Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must try. It takes sometime to show results but the best option I chose to accelerate the growth in 2 weeks time is by using this during night time since it liquid based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use Ardell Brow and Lash Growth Accelerator during the day since it is Gel base, barely visible. It can be used during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this Product a rating of 5, I could see the difference within a week eyebrows thicker and dark and eyelashes thicker and longer. Maybe the combination of both the products helped speed the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 1/2 weeks and I must say this product really grows the brows and lashes very quickly. I have been using it every night before bed since I received it (Did you hear me? In just 2 1/2 weeks.)no complaints here. I had lashes that were sparse in some areas and it filled those lashes in and I have noticed my lashes are longer. I also put this on my brows as well and they are getting fuller. This product works just as well as the more expensive products if not better for a fraction of the cost. I will never be without this product ever again because I like the results in such a short amount of time. As a matter of fact, I am stocking up on more as soon as I finish this review. Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Dark brown is a cool dark (no red) and was perfect for me.  Happy with the results and the ease of use.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply not difficult to apply. Works okay. I thought they would be a bit fuller but, might just be me.</li>
    <li> Fast effect, impressive results on eyebrows</li>
    <li> The eye lashes on the eye that I applied it to are beautiful. Thick and long. Now I&#x27;m going to have to apply it to the other side to even them out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see much difference.  Switched to another product.</li>
    <li> I noticed the change for the better</li>
    <li> I got this on time.   Never a problem with orders via Amazon.   Product is very easy to use.  I used it only for two weeks but it seems to have been working.  My eye doctor told me not to use it at this time because of increased pressure in one eye (I had a little before, it is not the product that caused it).     I hope to be able to start using it again as I thought it was making a difference.  I gave it 4 starts because I don&#x27;t want to be unfair but I do need to use it for at least 6-8 weeks to   judge it properly.[[ASIN:B0017L4CVO Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, especially for the price. I had been using Latisse and it is just too expensive at $110 a bottle. With this product, I noticed a big difference in lash length towards the end of the first tube. I bought a second tube recently and am finally seeing a difference with my brows. You have to use it daily and not use too much, since it is gooey. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> The very small tube of treatment was only 1/4 full-do not order!  There is no way I could know if the product works because the tube was virtually empty.</li>
    <li> I love this product...it really nourishes my eyebrows and prevents any additional thinning, it&#x27;s like a moisturizer for your brows...it has helped with growing them also.</li>
    <li> Ive had this stuff for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t really seen much of a difference in my eyelashes or eyebrows, but maybe i&#x27;m just being impatient. I&#x27;ll continue to use the rest of what is in the tube.</li>
    <li> the product started working well on my lashes and eyebrows. no issues yet. I dont use a lot but very small amount eery night. its rpetty good so far!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work, but figured I would give it a shot. I am amazed by how long and thick my lashes are. I have been using this for a few months, but I started noticing a difference right away. This is a nighttime ritual I will keep for years to come.</li>
    <li> I felt kind of silly for ordering this but after reading the reviews I thought I would try it on my space eye brows.  My patchy brows are actually filling in after using this product morning and evening for two weeks.  I am ordering more, but will probably just use it at night since it does make your brows shinny. I had botox for the frown lines between my eyes and as a results, my eye brows no longer began at the inside corners of my eyes anymore.  I used Godefroy in the &amp;#34;una-brow area and they have filled in better than I ever expected.</li>
    <li> This product works very well.  Yes, it is better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 2 weeks by now and I see results: they are not as obvious as many of reviews say here, but my eye lashes are darker thicker and I can see that they have grown a little bit. Be realistic, I will not have same results as from extensions, so if you are looking for the dramatic change, its not the case. However, every body is different, it might work magic on you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month, I&#x27;ve found my eyelash growth little longer, the result actually is noticeable in two weeks when I start using it.</li>
    <li> I recently became a Mom and I think because of that I lost alot of my lashes.I had long and full lashes and they got really short and hardly any.I used this product every night for six weeks and I started to see the results;Longer,fuller eye lashes,It works!</li>
    <li> I was a little  skeptical of the product because it was so cheap but since so many people had given it such great reviews I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately I&#x27;m sorry to say that this product was indeed a waste. I used it for the 30 days recommended but it was giving me acne on my eyebrows. The reason I bought the product was because I have a balding patch I guess you would call it on one of my eye lids and I wanted this stuff to help fill it in but so far it has done nothing. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I purchased this over 2 months ago and used it faithfully every night along with the Ardell during the day.  I keep waiting to see something, but so far I still see the same ole lashes I&#x27;ve always had.  For the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how some reviews say it works, and so well even.  I wish I could say the same. Good luck.</li>
    <li> Pain to apply but it does work so I guess I would get it again in comparison it is worth it for lashes rather than complain about the application</li>
    <li> I used this product only for a week and I can see the results.  My eye lashes are longer.  This is better than other products I used and the price is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try to help my nearly invisible eyebrows. I basically had dots of hair at the beginning of the brow and nothing else. I already feel hairs growing in and feel confident that they will continue to fill in. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> There is no color. This is just castor oil with vitamins.</li>
    <li> I use it daily on the eyebrow and lashes.  I have noticed longer lashes but no discernible improvement on the brow.</li>
    <li> The best and cheapest to use.  I highly recommend this. I saw results in about 4 weeks. Definitely buying again next time.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works or not but judging by the box you would think it was the size of a tube of lip gloss. Not the case at all. Its extremely small , I only used it 3 times and I think I only got 2 more uses out of it. Smells like vicks vapor rub lol but it was delivered fast so that’s a plus. I don’t notice a difference but like I said I only used it twice. I’ll use the rest and update my rating. Oh I only used half of a pea size amount under each brow. if thats helpful.</li>
    <li> I have bought this for the second time.  It is great if you over pluck.  Your lashes and brows grow back thicker.  It will take a couple of weeks but it is worth it.  It is gooey and thick, but doesn&#x27;t smell.  Put it on no hair (for those of us with no brows) at night, and rub on lashes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, easy, not expensive, and I trust this product over any other product out there. Life-long customer right here!!</li>
    <li> Maybe my 74 year old pores and being a guy, who still wants to look sexy didn&#x27;t excite this stuff to action but after the month of nightly applications, nothing changed my almost bare, brow areas. It was cheap but............ I wuz-a-wishin fer a miracle inna tube!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works, it is a bit greasy and some acne flared up so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Ok the only complaint that I have is that I got on a list to receive it every six weeks and it&#x27;s been past the first six week period and I haven&#x27;t received a second one..... At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at all. I didn&#x27;t wear mascara and I put it on both my lashes and my brows twice a day morning and before I went to bed. but by the week five, I actually saw  thicker lashes and eyebrows. My brows were a little darker too! I was shocked ! hope they send another package before I run out.</li>
    <li> If you read the fine print in the package, you have to apply this faithfully every night for a long, long time.  I threw away the paper, but I think it was something like 3 months.  Well, I have been using this faithfully for a month and a half and have not seen any change in my eyelashes or eyebrows.  For those that claim they say results in 2 weeks, I am happy for you.  You must be one of the lucky ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is very greasy and must be washed off completely in the morning or your mascara won&#x27;t stick.  Of course, most of it ends up on your pillow during the night.  I will continue until the tube is empty, but unless a miracle happens between now and then, I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> and I used it faithfully.Trying SmartLash now------if it doesn&#x27;t work I guess I&#x27;ll just have to pay more for Latisse!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.I bought 6 thinking I might ran out after the six tubes nothing changed in my browse or lashes.</li>
    <li> This is slimy and feels like putting petroleum jelly (aka Vaseline) on your lashes and brows. Look at the ingredients--there&#x27;s not much in there that I see that would stimulate lash growth. I&#x27;ve used RapidLash with great results that I documented after using faithfully day and night for six weeks (but be sure to buy from a reputable seller, not from an individual seller on Amazon where you might get a fake). This product just didn&#x27;t cut it, and it felt horrible. I&#x27;d rather just condition my lashes with a light coat of oil, which would probably do just as much, if not more, good than this did.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE &amp; MY DAUGHTER WANTED IT , THEY BOUGHT IT AND THEY LOVE IT , THEY WILL BUY IT LATER FOR THEIR FREINDS .</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this product on my brows. Being honest, I haven&#x27;t noticed MUCH of a difference, perhaps maybe a slight change...it&#x27;s been 4 months...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month; I noticed improvement in my eyebrows after the first week.</li>
    <li> CARELESS? OR WHY WHEN I NEED TO PAY FOR ALL THE FEE I HAVE ALREADY DID IN YOUR WEBSITE, SO WHY DOES THE PEOPLE NOT GETTING THEIR JOB DONE? I AM WORKING ALL DAY AND HAVE NO TIME TO GET BACK TO YOU, ALWAYS FORGET, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MEAN I FORGET OR I DON&#x27;T CARE ABOUT MONEY I SPENT. I WILL SIMPLY STOP SHOPPING ON YOUR WEB.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL....can&#x27;t beat the price. I saw results right away. I&#x27;ve used a more expensive product and tried this for maintenance, but will always stick to this. I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I found this searching for Bimatoprost which it doesn&#x27;t actually have in it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. The texture is very greasy.</li>
    <li> Not works, i know better products</li>
    <li> The product is a thick ointment in a metal tube. It smells like Vicks Vapor rub and goes on like paste and is goopy.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if it actually works since I am tossing it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I only use it on eyebrows, not lashes. I started to see results, but they&#x27;re subtle. I&#x27;ve always had thin eyebrows so I wasn&#x27;t expecting dramatic change. This is not magic, but it definitely works for me.</li>
    <li> Works!!! I noticed a difference in about a week my lashes did get a little longer but not crazy long</li>
    <li> very messy, no change, false advertisment, please dont waste your money! very unsatisfied customer.</li>
    <li> My lashes seem to have gotten longer but definitely not thicker. I haven&#x27;t plucked my eyebrows since I recieved this product, about 3 weeks ago, and my eyebrows look exactly the same. This product did work but not in the areas I wanted it to the most.</li>
    <li> this product does not work  I do not recommend.  I have used other products that work much better  .  do not buy</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very effective product.  I  Applied it on my eyebrows and lashes before bed, and within 1 week I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;shedding&#x27; brows and lashes any longer.  Both appear darker as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little greasy, so you have to be careful about getting it on pillow cases, but there is no color in it and it does not stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short of using  a prescription product, this one is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It gives avery good treatment  to my eye lashes , but i prefer if it comes with a brush , so it will easy to put . Also i was wondering about the ceteryl alcohol one of its ingredients . If it is safe for this sensitive area .&lt;br /&gt;So i prefer to put all the ingredients , so we can read about it&#x27;s safety before buying .&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Om abdulaziz</li>
    <li> I definitely saw in improvement in the thickness and length of my lashes--especially the lower ones which had always been sparse. I highly recommend this product but use sparingly because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I&#x27;m on my second tube and getting ready to order my third. My eyebrows are fuller than they have ever been and my lashes longer. I do forget to use it and I can tell after a few weeks.  You need to use it most nights to get best results and in a few weeks you should notice improvement. I did.</li>
    <li> I was wary about whether it would bother my eyes or change the color or weird stuff like that, but it did not.  Just put it on at night and voila I noticed a difference in two weeks!</li>
    <li> Broke out from oils not sure if it worked</li>
    <li> I seem to be a bit allergic to the product on my lashes. My eyes bothered me when I used it on the eyelashes. On the brows it actually worked! I was surprised, but it seems to make them fill in. Amazing. I would love the same to happen on my eye lashes but the first time I tried it, my eyes were scratchy and itchy. I tried it again a few days ago but only put a bit on the lashes and kept them tightly closed when I applied it.  A bit itchy but not as bad. I think I will avoid the lashes. I do have a lot of allergies, though. I am allergic to ointments like Neosporin and this was definitely an ointment, rather than a cream.</li>
    <li> i hate using this product. i followed the advice of one of the reviewers who uses Ardell in the a.m and this one in the p.m before bedtime. so i bought both. it&#x27;s been 3 weeks of treatment exactly. i have started to notice some light growth (longer lashes) in the 3rd week. But you have to use them every single day. Even if you are dying to go to sleep and dont feel like applying all your night time products. it is easy to apply the Ardell in the morning, just like a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;it WAS easy to apply revitalash or rapidlash or mavala and all the other products i have tried. But THAT one was and still is the most unpleasant to apply. You dont just need to open it and apply the product with your right hand while holding the tube in your left hand. You need to remove the cover of the little applicator, put it aside, remove the lid of the little tube, put it aside, insert the applicator inside the little tube and get rid of all the dried oily pieces that accumulate around the opening of the tube, and apply on your lash roots and over your lashes. Well it is not easy to apply this over the lashes because it is a simple little brush like a tiny painting brush. How practical is that??&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand, you cant read anything after applying it. you have oil in your lashes blurring your vision. if you wear glasses, your lashes will leave oil residue on the glass.&lt;br /&gt;So the applicator must be re-designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it doesnt seem to be a bad product. i have tried Talika, Rapidlash and Mavala, all of them were completely useless. The ONLY one that worked well was Revitalash. that one felt like magic. i am not hoping to look like Minnie Mouse but just to grow back the lashes that fall out when i use the curler or when i remove my mascara. When you use an eyelash conditioner, your lashes look nicer with mascara.  But i know that if i got ok results in 3 weeks, then it will only get better as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you must be patient when using those products. it is not like you are going to wake up with 1 inch lashes in 1 week. the change is quite subtle, and like a diet, if it kicks in on the 3rd week, then chances are that you will get increasingly good results later.you are going to wake up with 1 inch lashes in 1 week. the change is quite subtle, and like a diet, if it kicks in on the 3rd week, then chances are that you will get increasingly good results later.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work like some of the reviews would make it sound. It did increase hair growth for my eyebrows (I didn&#x27;t use it on my eyelashes). I&#x27;d say if you are looking to just make your eyebrows a little thicker go for it, but if you have very thin eyebrows or are trying to regrow them, this isn&#x27;t really going to do that.</li>
    <li> I only just started using this product. So I can not say if it will work on thickening lashes. It does make lashes feel silky.</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks of using it&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my lashes became slightly long&lt;br /&gt;I like it and I will buy one more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my brows.  Not so much yet on the lashes.. I know it takes time so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. But should be use a long time</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Who needs expensive Latisse?! As a fair-skinned redhead with blonde lashes, I have seen significant results in both length and fullness. What a great value!</li>
    <li> I am always afraid of trying products because I am always afraid it will be a total waste of money and will not work. I am especially afraid if the price is actually a low one! I took a chance and bought this product because I had a huge gap in my left eyebrow that people were starting to notice and it was making me very uneasy around people. I started seeing new hairs after the first week.....and lots of them by the fourth week. I am now on my fifth week using it once a day at bedtime and I still need to pencil in a small spot but it is working so well to fill it in better!! I will continue to use this product. It wont be much longer before my eyebrow is back to normal again and I cant wait! The cost of this product is also way cheaper than the others and it may work slower, but it works and it is worth it for the price you pay! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> Be truthful I&#x27;m not sure that this product actually works. I think it put something on your hair follicles so that it would make it easy for your mascara to be able to curl up a little more.</li>
    <li> easy to apply I see a lit bit of results only been using it for 2 weeks</li>
    <li> i love it one week now since using and i can tell the difference</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This is useless.  Rapid Lash worked on my eyelashes (but not brows).  This product did nothing at all for either.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. It actually makes my lashes longer and lasts forever for such a small tube.</li>
    <li> After decades of over plucking my eye brows are too thin.  I saw this on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It seems to be working.  I&#x27;ve been using less than a month so I&#x27;ll continue to use &amp; hopefully I&#x27;ll have my brows back again.</li>
    <li> No changes after 2 months. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> sephora has a brow serum thats $90.00 dollars this stuff works just as well, if not better than that sephora product, and at a fraction of the price, dont second guess yourself on this purchase, BUY it, i promise you will not be disapointed, results after one week full results after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I like this product. It did a great job adding hairs to my thin eyebrows. Still a little thin but not as bad as before. I will be buying again to see if results improve!</li>
    <li> As my title says, this stuff is a miracle. :) The bald patch in my right eyebrow area started growing in and after only the first week of owning this serum. :) The more you use it, the more hair grows in the area (above and below the eyebrow). Be careful not to let too much hair grow in the eye brow area and line becuase it&#x27;ll be hard to find after a week of using this stuff, but otherwise if you want thick brows, this stuff is for you. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> I have always had to have my eyelashes tinted (sometimes professionally) because they are quite pale.  This kit is the best I&#x27;ve tried for home use. The new formulation includes two gels instead of a liquid and a gel. It is much easier to handle.  It won&#x27;t make your eyelashes thicker or longer; only darker.  If you understand that, you will be happy with your purchase.</li>
    <li> Longer - yes, thicker - no. But better then nothing. yes it&#x27;s oily, so use it before bed time. last pretty long, but I was using it only for eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Crap. Was cheap, but still crap. Lashes fell out. I am using Argan Oil, It&#x27;s working. Spend your money on something else.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference, but it may work for others. I was kinda disappointed, but what are you gonna do</li>
    <li> Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment   Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?   Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.</li>
    <li> Caused terrible eye irritation. Couldn&#x27;t use it. There was no applicator. Just a small tube of ointment.  Love other godefrey products but this one wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for a little over 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. My eye lashes are definitely longer and my eyebrows are a little thicker. The only draw back is that it really isn&#x27;t a gel as some other people have described but it is more like vaseline (and feels like vaseline) so in the morning you have to wash it off with soap or make up remover. Also, the applicator is useless and using it would waste the product. I just put a drop on my index finger, close my eyes and run my finger across my lashes. That way it gets both my top and bottom lashes and there is usually enough left on my finger to rub across my eye brow. i most likely will reorder when I run out.   *Have been using the product now for about 4 months and will definitely be reordering it...my lashes are longer/thicker and my brows thicker.</li>
    <li> Two weeks in using this CHEAP product, i woke up one morning and notice from the corner of my eye that it looked like my eyelashes were falling out,I was trying to pull them off and realized that they weren&#x27;t moving so i went to look in the mirror to see what exactly was the problem and when i looked closely i realized that my eyelashes weren&#x27;t falling out and what i was seeing was the actual length of my lashes. A word of advice, some cheap stuff do work so much more than those that are expensive.</li>
    <li> From reading the reviews on this I thought this would make a great difference in my eyebrows. But after using it for about 4-5 weeks now, I have noticed very little to no difference in my eyebrow growth. No new hairs have grown and the my brows have not gotten any thicker. I decided to buy this product to see how it would work in comparison to the brow treatment from Anastasia (which is a lot more expensive at around $40). Even though I bought this product for a cheap price I regret buying it and would&#x27;ve rather put the money towards better brow growth treatments such as the one from Anastasia.</li>
    <li> I tried it, it&#x27;s a good moisturiser for your eye brows but dont expect any new hairs growing there.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money...this is plain vaseline just 100 times more expensive.</li>
    <li> I think this product helped my eyebrows. They seem thicker where they were skimpy. Considering the inexpensive price, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results so I will not be purchasing this product again. I had high hopes for it since I read a lot of positive reviews but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> This is great!  Because it is a gel , it stays on lashes overnite and you can see that it works.  My lashes were already long from a different product but almost immediately, I could see that his will thicken them.  The very first night when i put mascara on in the morning they seemed thicker and i think that is because of the gel--  it brought outs maller lashes inbetween the long ones.  Can&#x27;t wait to see later because i haven&#x27;t had them only a couple of days but i already love the way they look.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it straight for 2 and half weeks and my eyebrows have shown 0 signs.  Infact someone just told me yesterday that my eyebrows look much thinner so Im guessing instread of hair growth it is shedding my eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone having issues with eyebrows due to thinning, over plucking, etc. One of my brows was thinner than the other. This product filled it right in and it now matches the other. I feel more confident than ever!!</li>
    <li> the lash ointment was gooey like it was old- hard to put on too. I have found others I like better.</li>
    <li> Is that product safe to use during pregnancy ? I bought this product in December and it did not work for me. I have a friend who wants to try it , but she is pregnant. Does anyone know if it is safe to use during pregnancy ?</li>
    <li> So far have I&#x27;ve using this &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my lashes as I did with Rapidlash. After reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since I wanted something cheaper. BTW: Been using since Jan.10. The date today is March the 9th.  Wow, just realized how long I&#x27;ve been using! it  I wrote it down on calendar to check progress. Big fat zero. Going back to Rapidlash.</li>
    <li> Works great just hard for me to apply everyday. I will order more great product works if you keep up with it.</li>
    <li> I have noticed my eyebrows and eye lashes are thicker and longer :)</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised, I doubled up a little bit too accelerate the process but it does work the way it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
    <li> Scent or oil one causes eyes to burn, am returning the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month now on my brows and have noticed a slight improvement but not enough to make me want to repurchase this item. It may take up to six weeks to actually see new growth so I want to give this product a chance! A little goes a long way so I will continue using it daily in hopes of better results!</li>
    <li> This product is very oily and greasy so you can only really put it on at home or before bed.  Even before bed, it rubs off on your pillow case.  I have not really noticed any difference in my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week, but his product is working already. I will be back to post before/after pics. A lot of people mentioned burning...it doesn&#x27;t need to go directly on the lash line. I got a little too close and it burned for a second, nothing serious. No irritation. No different from if mascara got in your eye, not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and I am so surprised with the results I have seen so far. My lashes are pretty short, and a noticeable amount had fallen out from using an eyelash curler a lot. I started using this product once nightly and within maybe a week and a half I started noticing a little regrowth starting in the spaces where lashes had fallen out. Now, about 3 weeks later, my lashes are definitely longer and the spaces are all regrowing. I am amazed! I&#x27;ve been using it on my eyebrows as well and they&#x27;re also a bit thicker and seem to be growing more. So as far as the formula goes, I am impressed.  This is not the most convenient product to apply, though. It&#x27;s got a greasy texture like vaseline almost, so it&#x27;s a little annoying on your eyes. Also, the separate applicator brush broke after 2 days, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because you could use anything really, it was just a little brush. It would be better if the applicator was built into the tube like a lot of eyelash serums, then you just apply it like mascara. But this product has a seperate tube and applicator and there are just times when that is a bit too much to deal with. All that being said, I would continue to put up with those imperfections just because I&#x27;ve seen the formula work so well! Would definitely recommend based on that and the price was worth the try.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! After two weeks of religious use my eyelashes do not need mascara! Let me tell you, my eyelashes were HORRIBLE before! But I am so happy with these results! I am definitely going to buy more of this product! Everyone should try this! The price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Notices some lashes conming in, not totally impressed</li>
    <li> This product works ! My eyebrows have thinned over the years , this stuff actually did help to grow enough to thicken them up. Very happy to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Accidentally spilled some on my chest. Now I have an afro on my chest. Have to trim it constantly. Very good and potent treatment. Considering to use it on my bald spot on my head.</li>
    <li> I received my package and the box itself was completely flattened and destroyed. There was also no applicator brush. I&#x27;ve only used the product twice, but so far I am not impressed based on the appearance of the product itself.</li>
    <li> Product is okay, what you pay for is what you get. I feel like when used consistently, it does promote new growth but I did not notice my lashes getting longer or stronger.</li>
    <li> been working so far.  it is a nice consistency.  cheap and i will buy again.  way better than anything i have tried.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to friends.  For me it works the same or better than the more expensive product.</li>
    <li> I coat my lashes with it before I put on my mascara, and I use it before bed time. It conditions my lashes and protects them from the the harsh rituals of the mascara.</li>
    <li> In a few days after using it i had longer lash , I bought more from it , thnx</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now.  It has helped my lashes grow in fuller and possible a little longer.  I have always had long full lashes, but I had a salon put on some of those lashes that lasted about a month.  That was a mistake because when the fell out a month later some of my lashes fell out with them.  This treatment has helped my lashes get back to normal.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than Latisse and it works just as good. I have found no difference than the price. Try It!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but given the spa wants $200 for something like this, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I have light reddish eyebrows &amp; 1 side has never grown in nicely until I tried this. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products and saw a difference. I&#x27;m glad others got positive results. However, after using it on a regular basis (2x a day) for several months, I personally didn&#x27;t see any difference using this product. Also I didn&#x27;t care for how you had to apply the product. Very cumbersome and I&#x27;m scared that the little brush you&#x27;re suppose to use gets filled with bacteria.</li>
    <li> Love this product, ordered and received within 2 days, well packaged. I am on my second tube and have seen much improvement of my eyebrows. I used to be an over zealous eye brow plucker when I was younger and have had a hard time growing my eyebrows back out, this definitely gave them the boost of growth I have been needing. It does take patience, I have been using it every night for the last say 4 weeks, I took a before picture and can tell how much better they look and cant wait to see how much they grow after this second tube of treatment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I got a used one……so bad ……！！！ poor quality！</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything would help me grow back my eyebrows. I don&#x27;t know why/how it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> Other lash growth products have worked for me, including plain castor oil.  I purchased this one based on reviews that said it makes lashes darker, hoping to get some natural color on my blonde lashes.  In two weeks my lashes were noticeably thicker and actually had a little color!  Luckily, so far no change to the hue of my blues.  The other products I&#x27;ve used were great for length (with Latisse my lashes were hitting my brows within two months), but lame for thickness, and added no color.  It&#x27;s awesome to find one that does what the others lacked.  Also, it&#x27;s cost-effective.  One tiny squeeze is more than enough to cover upper and lower lashes on both eyes. Like another reviewer, mine lasted more than two months also.  Best of all, no eye irritation.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for two weeks and all it did was irritate my eys&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend or buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a little impractical because of the consistency (it&#x27;s really thick and oily). And you&#x27;re supposed to put all over your eyebrows and lashes. So I guess my pillow case will be covered with this thing tomorrow morning..&lt;br /&gt;Also instructions say it&#x27;ll take up to 30 days to see first results :( ..  But it&#x27;s really cheap!!</li>
    <li> No difference in my brows or lashes. Was hoping to for a more full brow or even fill in the lighter areas, but not any difference.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows were thinning do to getting older. After using less than 1 tube, they filled in again. I now have the eyebrows I had in my 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been using Double Lash &amp; Brow for a couple of years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without. Now that my eyebrows have filled in, I use it only once or twice a week for maintenance. The tube may be small but it lasts for many months since only a small dab is needed for each eyebrow.</li>
    <li> I see a diffrance it is great I love this and will continue to buy this, you have to use it at least 3 nights straight for best results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product a few weeks and I can see a difference in my thinning eyebrows will probably order again</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this product, only wore it to bed once so far.  I look forward to seeing more and thicker lashes.</li>
    <li> Godefroy Double Lash and Brow Treatment nicely conditions and thickens eyelashes and brows. I use it every night before bed, very easy to apply, my eyelashes and brows are definitely thicker and fuller. I’d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product,I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.I brushed my eyebrows and eyelash with this every night.A week later,I found my eyebrows become longer and thicker.It&#x27;s true because my eyebrows is short and I can easily see the effects.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t miss it!</li>
    <li> Suffered with sparse brows forever and tried many many different formulas.This formula is just ok, but very reasonably priced. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I tried other products to fill out my skimpy, aging brows.  So far, this seems to be working.  I&#x27;m seeing new growth!</li>
    <li> used this for  2 - 3 months with no results what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;but didn&#x27;t mind that much, seeing as it was a cheap/reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after reading reviews .I got suck into ,and decided to purchased two boxes. This product does not work at all! All it does is just make your lashes shiny looking... What a bummer!</li>
    <li> too cheap to be true. did not work on me.</li>
    <li> After a month of use, I did not see one bit of difference.  I have thin eyebrows due to thyroid issues and have tried everything, but unfortunately so far have not found anything that will work.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like menthol and is greasy and just rubs off in the hair and pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I faithfully used it waiting to see some results. The only results I saw were little tiny raised red bumps along the outsides of my eyes. It was too cheap to send back. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Have not used long enough. Have payed a lot more for others worked a little if I used every night. I don&#x27;t have a lot of eyebrows so a bad start. Am afraid this wont work. I decided to try/price and good reviews</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference using this product. Many reviews I read said that it took a few month of continuous use to see results- I can&#x27;t comment on that as I only used it for 3 days. I put it on my lashes at night and my eyes would be very dry and sore the whole next day. Once I realized &#x27;Hey this started happening when I begin using that sketchy lash treatment&#x27; I discontinued use and my eyes were back to normal in a few days. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 weeks, and I can definitely notice a difference. I have had several stubborn empty spaces that are finally starting to grow in! It takes a couple weeks to notice a difference, but it&#x27;s worth a try. I will definitely be ordering a second bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is really working , and I see my lashes is getting longer . I would definitely recomemend this product to who ever want to have a real longer lashes but just it&#x27;s take 5 weeks ;) it&#x27;s better than having fake lashes .</li>
    <li> Had my doubts when I ordered but I am a believer now. Lashes are longer - even the corners.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great price &amp; I use other Godefroy products. And am more than satisfied so I decided to try this. It is goo-y &amp; greasy, but I will definitely keep using this because of the results it delivers. I am impressed &amp; as well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference. The only thing is my lashes got brittle. Not good. It was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> At least for me, it does work, but it takes a looooooong time to see the results.  I put it on at night, and in the morning, and I do see the difference, no placebo effect.  I see the lashes grow and get longer, so I know it works for me.</li>
    <li> Its kinda greasy and hard to apply, wish you have included better directions on how and where on the eyes it should be applies. Not sure of my results yet.</li>
    <li> I am getting ready to start the second tube.  I have not seen any results at all with the first.  This is on a subscribe and save basis.  I am going to discontinue this item. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It works! I see my brows and lashes getting just a bit thicker...and its been only 2 wks.</li>
    <li> I am still using the product, It helps a little, I notice my mascara looks a lot better on my lashes for a change, have not seen a lot of growth though, I would give it a 3 star.</li>
    <li> Kinda greasy/oil based but it works!!</li>
    <li> It worked wonder... my eye lashes grow.. no need eye lash curlers</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had really thin eyebrows since I overplucked them in middle school, and I&#x27;m tired of filling them in constantly. I was skeptical of this product since it was so cheap...but after about a month of using it on my eyebrows every night, my eyebrows are now thick enough that I don&#x27;t even need to fill them in anymore! Amazing product. I&#x27;m on my third bottle already.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017L4CVO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two pack of this product and used it for three months....absolutely bad and poor product, no results, NOTHING! IT IS A TOTAL WAIST OF MONEY! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT SINCE IT DOES NOT WORK THE WAY IT WAS ADVERTISED.</li>
    <li> About 2 years ago I lost my eyebrows due to a steroid shot my doctor gave me so I tried this product. I was extremely skeptical, but decided to try this product because I&#x27;m tired of my eyebrows rubbing off in the humidity. After one week I can say that I am so happy because I see new growth. When I would wash my eyebrows before I would be very delicate because the few hairs I have would just fall right out and now I feel like the root is much stronger. If you have an insecurity due to the lack of eyebrows give this a try, all of us have a different chemical makeup so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you you&#x27;re not out a lot of money and please don&#x27;t throw it away just give it to someone else to see if it works for their eyebrows. *Just don&#x27;t share if you used it for your lashes to avoid eye infections. :)</li>
    <li> If you use it as directed it actually works very well. My lashes look longer and thicker, and I was quite surprised.</li>
    <li> Well... I am not sure does it really help. But the only thing I can make sure is EASY TO GET INTO YOUR EYES. I use it before go to bed and make it affects during my sleeping. I can&#x27;t tell is it really helpful. But my eyes didn&#x27;t feel good when I woke up even I only polished very little on the top. When I stopped using it, soon I don&#x27;t feel bad any more.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for six weeks with no noticeable improvement in either lashes or brows.  The applicator provided was useless and should be removed from the packaging.  It is too &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; to apply the product.  I used my finger for application.  The product claimed to thicken brows and thicken and elongate lashes, it did neither one.  Please do not waste your time and money on this product.  If anyone has any ideas for a more superior product for brows please post it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement with continued use.</li>
    <li> its a great product. took me 4 weeks to see results, but now i have gorgeous, long eyelashes. i would recommend to a freind</li>
    <li> i applied twice a day- after waking up and before bed. gently massaged it on w/ fingers. Saw results in 4 days! noticeably longer lashes. will DEF be reordering</li>
    <li> Product is a bit strange.  Isn&#x27;t anything like the picture of honey colored liquid.  It is basically exactly vaseline petroleum jelly in a tiny tube with a tiny brush to try and coat your lashes and brows with, so its a bit messy and I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to know if it is doing anything more than just coating thick vaseline over the lashes and that is just making them darker and thicker looking and keeping them moist so they don&#x27;t break off or shed easily.  Smells like vaseline too but doesn&#x27;t irritate in any way.  Tiny brush is far more difficult to coat lashes with rather than a mascara type brush.  Seems you can buy a huge cheap jar of vaseline and wash off an old mascara brush and basically do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best help for my lashes. My eyebrows do not need as much help but my lashes looked very dry and short (like I had cut them, but I had not.) After using the Godefroy Double Lash, my eyelashes are really longer, fuller, and shiny. They look very good when I wear mascara. I gifted one of these to my friend who has longer lashes than I do, and she also said this product helped her lashes. I will buy it again. Also, It really does last long, since so little has to be used.</li>
    <li> So, it&#x27;s been about 2 months of pretty consistent use and woke up today to longer lashes. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I just wear it during the day because I&#x27;ll forget at night. I just commented to myself last week that I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was working, but yay! Today was noticeable!</li>
    <li> Did not see anything yet!!! Will not get this again!!!</li>
    <li> Just started using not sure of result yet, I will post results later!&lt;br /&gt;Seller is excellent no problems!</li>
    <li> It makes lashes and brows more flexible and therefore less breakable. But if you lost them partialy or fully, they will not grow back.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  I am not sure if I am seeing results or the results are not as I thought....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now and for the price I&#x27;m actually surprised on how well it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for my brows (which have been tortured since I was about fourteen). I have many spots where the hair no longer grows back. Using this I do see some of those spots growing back in but not all of them so my brows look very patchy. For the price, I would say it is worth trying because it does work. I just suggest getting your own brush to use to apply. The brush it comes with makes it hard to not get it in spots you don&#x27;t want. I went and got myself a cheap brow powder brush to use.</li>
    <li> When I decided to purchase this product, I didn&#x27;t know if it would work.  Overall, the reviews are decent.  If I could get results from a $12 product as opposed to a $50 product, I would be satisfied.  I started using this product on my eyebrows about 4-5 weeks ago.  My eyebrows suffered from over-plucking.  I could never make them grow back. Hair would grow in all the places I didn&#x27;t want it, but never to fill the gaps where I really needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening this product, I was surprised it was just an oil-based substance.  I honestly don&#x27;t know what I expected, but for something to make my eyebrows grow, I expected a different consistency...something magical!  Within a few weeks I noticed growth in areas that, for many years, didn&#x27;t have growth.  After being about 5 weeks into the nightly treatments, I must say I am extremely happy with the results.  The gaps are filled and my eyebrows are fuller. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on this product.  It was well worth the small investment.</li>
