      <li>but I love this</li>
      <li>Love adapters.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s easy to fix when i feel it move.  </li>
      <li>It is advertised as having dual voltage, but it is not as easy as it sounds.</li>
      <li>My hair kept getting stuck in the hinge part of the clamp and it damaged my hair very quickly.</li>

      <li>Do I need to say anymore than that :)&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money, and quick shipping</li>

      <li>Sturdy, well-made, super easy to use on the road, and big enough to create waves vs. tight curls.</li>
      <li>The curling wand package came wrapped with a set of tiny adapters, thus making it capable of use in Europe.</li>
      <li>Males curls that stay and look natural.  </li>
      <li>placed order from another company on line and price was far cheaper than above company and used.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>

<li> the curling iron plug and an adapter in order to hold them together long enough to use this in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> also place order from Amika iron for flat and curl function.</li>
<li> No need to have flat hair on vacation!</li>
<li> The European adapter plug for Italy was very loose and should be improved.</li>
<li> I just tried this dual voltage curling iron at home in the US and it worked very well on my thick, color-treated hair when I set it according to directions for my hair type.</li>
<li> The plug was too loose to stay in the socket</li>
<li> This curling wand works as expected and suits my needs quite well.</li>
<li> Directions indicate that the voltage will convert for me, all I need is the adapter that came with it, when I use it in countries that require the other voltage.</li>
<li> However, the prongs of the curling iron do not fit snugly into these or any other adapters I tried.</li>
<li> It is expensive</li>
<li> The adapters that came with it are worthless and the curling iron itself was not great.</li>
<li> Very awkward to accomplish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product.  Heats up quickly.  Shuts off automatically after an hour (but  would prefer a shut off in 30 minutes since it heats up so quickly).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking it to Europe for two weeks of travel.  My only problem with it is that the control for temperature settings is in a place that gets moved when I am using it.  I can&#x27;t avoid placing my fingers over the dial.  But it&#x27;s easy to fix when i feel it move.  Product arrived quickly and came with 2 adapters for use in Europe.</li>
    <li> Works great and love the free adapters.</li>
    <li> I have taken it overseas on two trips, and it works perfectly. The barrel at an inch and a half is larger than I would have liked, but there is no problem at all with the operation of this curling iron using 220 watts overseas or 110 watts here at home. Good product.</li>
    <li> i like that it has a converter; im using this in korea with 220v and it works well</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well-made, super easy to use on the road, and big enough to create waves vs. tight curls.</li>
    <li> Bought to use in the UK on our trips. Works fine.</li>
    <li> The European adapter plug for Italy was very loose and should be improved. It would fall out of the receptacle.</li>
    <li> This curling wand works as expected and suits my needs quite well. It has numerous settings, and it clamps the hair well. It is advertised as having dual voltage, but it is not as easy as it sounds. The curling wand package came wrapped with a set of tiny adapters, thus making it capable of use in Europe. However, the prongs of the curling iron do not fit snugly into these or any other adapters I tried. The adapters worked fine with other appliances, but the iron itself seems to be the problem. I had to jury-rig the curling iron plug and an adapter in order to hold them together long enough to use this in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a curling wand for the U.S., this is a good choice (although you might find a cheaper one that&#x27;s just as good). If you are looking for dual voltage, I would suggest finding a different product.</li>
    <li> Do I need to say anymore than that :)&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money, and quick shipping&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those looking for great product value</li>
    <li> Met expectations.  Fair price.</li>
    <li> Great! Perfect size, not to big and not to small.  Males curls that stay and look natural.  Great for intenational travel with dual voltage.  Heats up quickly.  Love adapters.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Finland and it worked great. It&#x27;s super easy to use and you get a set of converter plugs for it, too. No need to have flat hair on vacation!</li>
    <li> Product is good enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;But I placed order from company..David Electric Co. should avoid to order from this Product.&lt;br /&gt;Because Removed it from original packing, very very poor packing with very minimum support.&lt;br /&gt;The product was used , I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;Not brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Ofcourse I return it.&lt;br /&gt;I placed order from another company on line and price was far cheaper than above company and used.&lt;br /&gt;But corn air product is good and price is always reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I also place order from Amika iron for flat and curl function. I pay about $150 but titanium floating plate is very smooth and dual voltage. I have two now !!! Both are work out very well.&lt;br /&gt;I can use in overseas as well. It is expensive but I love this</li>
    <li> Am going to Europe this month, will let you know how it works when I return!  Does work fine in the U.S.</li>
    <li> Worked well in Italy since it is dual voltage.  The curling iron itself  tended to grab my hair instead of gliding easily.  .</li>
    <li> The plug was too loose to stay in the socket no matter how much I spread it apart.  Holding the plug in the socket with one hand left only one hand to engage the iron.  Very awkward to accomplish.</li>
    <li> This was a good item, but was disappointed it wasn&#x27;t actually a Europe Curling, it had a Europe connector !</li>
    <li> Bought this because it had the right voltage to take overseas. The adapters that came with it are worthless and the curling iron itself was not great. My hair kept getting stuck in the hinge part of the clamp and it damaged my hair very quickly.</li>

    <li> Most importantly it&#x27;s dual voltage and the right barrel size for what I was looking for.  Worked well on my trip - heats up quickly.  Not as easy to use as my Hot Tools at home but that didn&#x27;t come in dual voltage.  Came with an international adaptor.</li>
