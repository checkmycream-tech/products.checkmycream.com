      <li>So that was a nice reminder but not a scent for me.</li>

      <li>It is  not too strong.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance good price received quick thanks</li>
      <li>I lean more towards citrus, grapefruit-y type fragrances and run away from the sweet, flower-y perfumes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ready to order more and soon!.</li>
      <li>The only reason I bought this was because of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>Enjoy ladies</li>
      <li>DOESN&#x27;T SMELL CHEAP</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous fragrance.  </li>
      <li>sweet and strong.</li>
      <li>Today, Tomorrow, and Always are three of the best Avon has presented in long time that I REALLY like.  </li>
      <li>Very fresh and clean smell.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon, love the smell</li>
      <li>THIS IS SURELY SOME VERY QUALITY PERFUME.</li>
      <li>After I very hesitantly tried it, I couldn&#x27;t help myself; I had to have more</li>
      <li>It is a bit strong when you first spray, but tames after about 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for women who love the flowery scents.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is very pretty and the style fits the scent.</li>
      <li>just pretty and clean</li>
      <li>I love Amazing Grace by Philosophy, Chance by Chanel, Green Jade by Bulgari, and some grapefruit spray I bought at a boutique.</li>
      <li>Smells light and floral, not over powering, easy push down nozzel, sprays more like a mist.</li>
      <li>I am very selective when it comes to fragances but the fresh and clean notes of gardenia in \\&quot;Today\\</li>
      <li>I never understood why women spend so much on perfume,when you can get a great quality sent for less than $30 dollars.</li>
      <li>THIS PERFUME SMELLS AMAZING AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME.  </li>
      <li>Orders are shipped out very fast</li>
      <li>I like this very much.  </li>
      <li>Very affordable!</li>
      <li>BELIEVE THAT I COULD SMELL THIS SCENT JUST AS STRONGLY THE NEXT DAY.  </li>
      <li>I like is that you can really smell the gardenia in it.</li>
      <li>I found it online at a much cheaper price and will continue to do so.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very distinctive aspect.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this very gentle, subtle, clean smelling fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have a bunch of other perfumes, but none of them got so many compliments.</li>
      <li>all year round has a clean, crisp scent, and very long-lasting!</li>
      <li>Ordered Today a few months back after recieving a sample of it.  &lt;br /&gt;I loved it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost addictive, if a perfume can even be addictive :)  </li>
      <li>IT DEFINATELY SMELLS LIKE SOME HIGH END PERFUME</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for any women...</li>
      <li>I also highly recommend \\&quot;Danielle\\&quot; by Danielle Steel and \\&quot;Romeo\\&quot; by Romeo Gigli.</li>
      <li>I have this perfume and it is a breath of fresh air,it is not over powering and the scent lasts long.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Daughter loves this perfume</li>
    <li> awesome scent...great price</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive my item on Tuesday and it came today on the 4/18/15  i took it out of the box smelled it and it smells wonderful. It has a really nice  beautiful sweet scent. Amazon is the best. Orders are shipped out very fast I like that a lot. Lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame your store just lost out on my order because you didn&#x27;t give an important detail in your description: the SIZE!!</li>
    <li> WOW was so disappointed.  Bought it due to the reviews.  Reminds me of Moon Drops - A perfume my grandma used to use in the 1970s made by Revlon.  So that was a nice reminder but not a scent for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! don&#x27;t have an Avon lady so this is a great way to get what I want.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this very gentle, subtle, clean smelling fragrance.  Both my mom and I used to wear this many years ago and when my beautiful mom passed away I continued to use it because it reminds me of my mom every time I wear it.  I&#x27;ll be ready to order more and soon!.</li>
    <li> I know this perfume ever since it came out. I used it before and in Europe Avon it&#x27;s quite popular, so a lot of girls were walking around smelling like \\&quot;Today\\&quot;. No big deal, really. So I forgot about it until recently, when I was in a perfume shop and I smelled something similar, but not quite. So I jumped on Amazon soon as I got home and I ordered it. It arrived in 3 days.   I wore it at work the next day. It was like a perfume madness. I had at least 10 people, that I know and I don&#x27;t, asking me what perfume I was wearing. I have a bunch of other perfumes, but none of them got so many compliments. It&#x27;s just a warm, perfect for fall (too strong for the summer) perfume, reminding me of a garden of honeysuckles and soft white musk. It is not overwhelming, but persists all day long. And the price?! That&#x27;s the best part! Very affordable! Highly recommended for women who love the flowery scents.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fragrance. I bought this perfume for my mother and she adores this smell. I love it too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you (:</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this was because of the great reviews. I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and think its smells like old lady perfume. My dad didnt like it either, he is in his 50&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Ordered Today a few months back after recieving a sample of it.  &lt;br /&gt;I loved it and I ordered it and it is a beautiful scent. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I like is that you can really smell the gardenia in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts all day. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottle is very pretty and the style fits the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Avon for years - also used to sell it.  Today, Tomorrow, and Always are three of the best Avon has presented in long time that I REALLY like.  I think Always is the best of the three, then, Today.  For the money and the fragrance, Avon is the best.</li>
    <li> This seller is amazing! I ordered on Thursday, received order on Saturday! Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> A little stronger than I remembered it to be. Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES THIS SCENT</li>
    <li> My all time favorite cologne spray for work.  It has a wonderful light scent that does not overpower.</li>
    <li> Excellent scent. Always get compliments by women and men.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances, often prompting compliments.</li>
    <li> Ever since my mom started wearing this years ago, it&#x27;s been a favorite of mine. I lean more towards citrus, grapefruit-y type fragrances and run away from the sweet, flower-y perfumes. I love Amazing Grace by Philosophy, Chance by Chanel, Green Jade by Bulgari, and some grapefruit spray I bought at a boutique. Today falls somewhere in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an &amp;#34;older woman&amp;#34; scent, and it&#x27;s not a sickeningly sweet teenage candy spray.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very distinctive aspect. It&#x27;s almost addictive, if a perfume can even be addictive :)  It&#x27;s not offensive. It is a bit strong when you first spray, but tames after about 30 seconds. Even the initial spray isn&#x27;t off-putting. Just very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to chose just one perfume to wear, this would be it.</li>
    <li> this is a lovely fragrance for the warm months</li>
    <li> Never before have I received as many compliments (probably more than a hundred to date)on any frangance in my life and I am mid-forties.  Men and women alike, have actually stopped me to pay compliments or to even ask me what I am wearing.  I probably would&#x27;ve never bought \\&quot;Today\\&quot;, since I had never bought avon fragances before (never really liked one in the past); but,I was given a sample with an order of avon children&#x27;s products.  After I very hesitantly tried it, I couldn&#x27;t help myself; I had to have more so I order it and have been wearing it for approximately two years now. I wear it almost every day, sometimes even in the winter (I think it&#x27;s more of a spring/summer scent).  I am very selective when it comes to fragances but the fresh and clean notes of gardenia in \\&quot;Today\\&quot;  has made it one of my favorites!  Thank you Avon and Thank you Salma Hayek!!!!    I also highly recommend \\&quot;Danielle\\&quot; by Danielle Steel and \\&quot;Romeo\\&quot; by Romeo Gigli.</li>
    <li> Always Luv this fragrance. A friend from church bought me a bottle last year and I&#x27;ve been using it since then. I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> I definitely will order it again.</li>
    <li> sweet and strong. perfect for summer nights. not for young gilrs. it does not evaporate from your body.  the heavy glass bottle gives it distinction</li>
    <li> This fragrance was a complete surprise.  I was amazed that it came from Avon.  I will buy this perfume again.</li>
    <li> I love this scent...you will too :)</li>
    <li> The perfume is good but too costly for its price.</li>
    <li> I love love love this fragrance... I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 2 yrs... People always compliment on how good I smell... I highly recommend it for any women... U won&#x27;t be disappointed... Enjoy ladies</li>
    <li> Just got this perfume and it smelled nothing like what I know.will not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great smelling woman&#x27;s perfume, satisfied with the purchase of this product. Would buy this perfume again. Thanks amazon, love the smell</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time and you can&#x27;t beat the price plrice</li>
    <li> I have this perfume and it is a breath of fresh air,it is not over powering and the scent lasts long.The price is amazing and I always get compliments on it. I never understood why women spend so much on perfume,when you can get a great quality sent for less than $30 dollars.</li>
    <li> This is a bit different from anything I&#x27;ve worn before.  I like this very much.  It is  not too strong.</li>
    <li> I just started wearing perfume for work it does last a couple of hours but it smells a little too flowery for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my signature fragrance. Love it!</li>
    <li> Awful smell. I threw it away as it was not returnable to the seller.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous fragrance.  I am asked all the time what perfume am I wearing.  Very fresh and clean smell.</li>
    <li> Very good perfume for moms! Recommend it my mother loves it, so if you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas present or birthday gift for mom get her this</li>
    <li> My husband bought this perfume for me about 6 years ago. I loved it then, but now I just like it. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it smells a little different. Great packaging, I think it was shipped sooner than what I was expecting, awesome!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Smells light and floral, not over powering, easy push down nozzel, sprays more like a mist. This is the only perfume I wear and have used it since Avon first introduced it. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last longer!</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance good price received quick thanks</li>
    <li> So sooo fresh and cleAn fragrance!! I love it!!! 😍😍</li>
    <li> I AM NOT REALLY A PERFUME PERSON BUT DECIDED TO GET TODAY BY AVON.  I MUST SAY I DID NOT EXPECT THIS PERFUME TO SMELL SO GOOD.  IT DEFINATELY SMELLS LIKE SOME HIGH END PERFUME THAT YOU WOULD GET AT A DEPARTMENT STORE.  THIS PERFUME SMELLS AMAZING AND LASTS A VERY LONG TIME.  WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THIS SMELL.  THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PERFUME/SCENT I HAVE EVER OWNED.  AND THIS PARTICULAR PERFUME WORKS GREAT WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY.  IT SMELLS WONDERFUL!!!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PERFUME.  DOESN&#x27;T SMELL CHEAP AT ALL BUT VERY POTENT AND A GREAT SCENT THAT IS VERY PLEASING TO THE SENSES.  AVON DID A GOOD JOB WITH THIS ONE AND I AM GLAD I DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE THAT I COULD SMELL THIS SCENT JUST AS STRONGLY THE NEXT DAY.  THIS IS SURELY SOME VERY QUALITY PERFUME.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time.The smell is wonderful and I get compliments all the time. I have been using this product since Avon bought it out approx. 3-4 yrs. ago. I used to purchase it from Avon online, but somehow it&#x27;s gone viral and they seem to always have it on backorder.I found it online at a much cheaper price and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;Quick service. I got my product in excellent condition.Will use this supplier again.</li>
    <li> As remembered fragrance, soft and feminine</li>
    <li> Avon today Eau de Parfumerie Spray is just &amp;#34;Delightfull&amp;#34; one of the best from Avon. I recommend this product can use it all year round has a clean, crisp scent, and very long-lasting!</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is a little strong smelling. I would prefer cologne. Product was as described. Nothing wrong with the product itself, it&#x27;s all a matter of preference.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd? bottle of Today perfume by Avon through this seller...very quick delivery, never a problem. This scent is good anytime, anywhere, very pleasant, never overpowering or obnoxious...just pretty and clean I&#x27;m told. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after.</li>
