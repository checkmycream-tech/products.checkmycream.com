<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>

    <li> great gift for a little girl</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved the set, good variety of items, good price and fun.</li>
    <li> very affordable and came on time</li>
    <li> It was an ok purchase... not sure i would get it again but...</li>
    <li> What was posted in the picture is not what I received. There was no nail polish or lip gloss containers, just tubes. I should have read the reviews. I bought this as a gift for my niece and it looks cheap.</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter will love finding this in her stocking on Christmas morning!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> upset :(&lt;br /&gt;it came different as it appears in the picture. the picture shows 3 nail polishes and 2 jars with black cap, but the box i received doens&#x27;t have those...</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed and thank you very much</li>
    <li> my daughter love&#x27;s this set</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled with this make up kit pack. Good value for money- there&#x27;s a lot in the pack.</li>
    <li> got this for my granddaughter and she loves it thank you</li>
    <li> Fun little kit. Perfect for my 4 year old. She loved it.</li>
    <li> big hit with this.  she loves to paint finger nails and play dress up.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SERVICE</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a 5 year old.  Because of the price I thought it would be a small less substantial gift.  I was wrong!  This set is perfect for any little one and the price makes it even better.  I ended up ordering it for my niece for Christmas as well.</li>
    <li> Granddaughters love it.</li>
    <li> My item was shipped in a timely manner. I bought as a present for my niece and I know she is going to love it.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loved this soo much . The fake nails were so cute</li>
    <li> I bought this not only because it was frozen but because my daughter loves painting her nails!! Very disappointed to open it and see that there was no nail polish! Would have been nice to know that items very vary!</li>
    <li> It was everything my little granddaughter will love for Christmas at a reasonable price. Thank you for your product!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loved this. Cute little nails also.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. But by daughter loved it. The press on sticker nails don&#x27;t stay on at all</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> My granddaughter would love it.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Not worth your money. My little nice is going to be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved it !!!  Gave it to her for her birthday.</li>
    <li> The box was ripped on the top. I&#x27;m not sure if somebody tried to open it.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, its cute for those girls who like to mess with their mothers make up (:</li>
    <li> My 6 year old niece loved this gift at Christmas.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas gift for my Frozen fan niece.  She was so excited she was jumping up and down.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Perfect for the little ones.  Arrived on time and packaged well.  The zip case held it all and tucked nicely into the Christmas stockings.  Thanks for your good service</li>
    <li> This is beyond cute any lil girl will love this.cant wait for my niece to open it.shes obsessed with frozen</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter love it !!</li>
    <li> Fun gift for a child&#x27;s birthday.  Kept them entertained for a while after opening as well.</li>
    <li> Hide the nail polish.  But apart from that, this is really appropriate for a preschooler.  Everything is light enough that when she puts on 75 layers of it, your whole house isn&#x27;t in danger of staining.  She finds it less exciting to use light colors, but the sparkles really make up for it.</li>
    <li> My 4yr old daughter loves it😃</li>
    <li> The product arrived as described.</li>
    <li> This is beyond cute any lil girl will love this.cant wait for my niece to open it.shes obsessed with frozen</li>
    <li> Exactly as described in posted picture and explanation!</li>
    <li> Does not come with nail polish as pictured.</li>
    <li> So cute and very lovely for a girl who loves Frozen!</li>
    <li> Was a great buy for my daughter but was horribly packaged when I opened the package some of the items had dislocated from their spots inside and the press on nails had become separated from the sticker sheets and That they were on. I had to remove the stuff from the inside of the box and replace all of the items into their respective spot</li>
    <li> The girl who received this loved it.</li>
    <li> My granddaugher feels like a princess with this set.</li>
    <li> 2 words... dress up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I ever think buying this for my daughter was a good idea...</li>
    <li> My daughter was never into frozen until she learned they could sing I got her this for Christmas because she was almost 4 and getting into the makeup faze and figured she would love it its pretty messy so you def have to watch them but she loved it</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved this! Adorable!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap quality but&lt;br /&gt;Kids still like them.</li>
    <li> Loved this item and came in a timely manner</li>
    <li> It was late. But overall cute product.</li>
    <li> My Niece love it and me too.. I didn&#x27;t except it that it will be good ..but really the cosmetic set was good choice as gift</li>
    <li> Beautifully packaged and finely made each item is artfully done with the frozen theme and the cosmetic bag alone is worth the purchase..</li>
    <li> It does not have nail polish that we  were looking for. I would give it less than one star if I could</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Dress up day is fun with this</li>
    <li> Surprisingly I got the right box with everything in it. I was worried that I was going to get the bad one that everyone else has been getting but luckily I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> My sister loves it. But the pouch thingy isn&#x27;t that big to hold all em or even half of the individual products inside.</li>
    <li> As described, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> The hairclips that were included had the decorative piece broken off, so I just hot glued it before I wrapped it up for a gift</li>
    <li> The only thing it has going for it is the Frozen name.  None of the cosmetics show up on your face or nails, and it seemed to me that everything was pretty much petroleum jelly packaged as makeup which just ended up getting on everything and making it a sticky mess.  I know the kids love Frozen but find a different Frozen item that actually has something to do with the characters and actually works.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter loves the make-up kit. It&#x27;s well made, good quality. Only drawback is the shipping took 3 - 4 weeks. A long time to wait for a 4 year old.</li>
    <li> its ok....material is really cheap</li>
    <li> Great for little girls.</li>
    <li> this will be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter who loves frozen....i cant wait to give it to her</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas so we haven&#x27;t used it but so far from looks, it looks just like the makeup kit I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Check out a really cool rock version of the Frozen song &amp;#34;Let it go&amp;#34; http://youtu.be/LPhjWWOLPv8</li>
    <li> Very cheap looking and box was damaged.</li>
    <li> The product itself would&#x27;ve been great but the item came crumpled in it&#x27;s packaging. Everything inside was askew... Kind of made me wonder about giving it to my niece as a gift and if it would actually be safe.</li>
    <li> My niece is into frozen and saw a lot of products that were similar and she wanted this one, she loved if.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loved this set. She&#x27;s always asking me to put makeup on her but I feel she&#x27;s too young for the good stuff. She LOVES the lipgloss!</li>
    <li> 5 year old niece loved this gift</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect much out of items like this, and for a good reason.  My daughter was happy to get this until we opened it, the clips we&#x27;re broke, the naile Polish will not show up no matter how many coats you put on; this just leaves you with some lip gloss and small body stickers that done stick.</li>
    <li> Total junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Was apart in the case before I even opened it. Contacted the seller. They said to open it and fix it. Never a sorry or offer to help. Once I opened it the stuff is total junk. Told the seller again. They don&#x27;t care. Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
    <li> It was bought for a friends daughter she loves it great quality for the price thanks</li>
    <li> For the price, this is certainly not worth the money. It&#x27;s the quality of something from the dollar store. The nails do not stay on at all, and the the hair clips broke the second they were touched. The only nice piece in here is the mini 4&amp;#34; zipper bag. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, even if I saw it at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter love to play with it</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my niece, who is a big Frozen fan.  I can&#x27;t wait for her to open this gift!  She is going to LOVE this!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute kit but quality of makeup is cheap.</li>
    <li> Took about 1 week to receive. My daughter LOVES this! The best part were the mini press on nails. They were toddler size. My daughter is 4 and really enjoyed this kit. Comes with frozen hair clips too.</li>
    <li> I dont have anything negative to say about this, my girls loved it so I am a happy buyer</li>
    <li> I like it because was in good condition, compare with similar products this one have more quality.&lt;br /&gt;its handly small pieces</li>
    <li> Great set for my granddaughter</li>
    <li> granddaughter loves it. lots of lip glosses and other cosmetics. little girls love makeup and this was sure a hit</li>
    <li> Box was open and crushed we it arrived paints spilt out where dried out</li>
    <li> My six year old daughter usually will play with something then not touch it again. My daughter Plays with this make up set all the time. The kid make up that comes in this set is not cheap and the entire item was properly priced.</li>
    <li> This was very nicely packaged and good quality, every set I have purchased like this the nail polished is too thick and sometimes even dried up. My daughter loved this and it all fit perfectly inside the little makeup tote.</li>
    <li> The box came completely damaged.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed!! All nail polish and lip balms are missing..DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> came in a great time. Bigger than expected in a good way, girls love it!</li>
    <li> Well packaged, adorable little girl gift</li>
    <li> The age range listed on the item wasn&#x27;t quite right.  The item was much too &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it looks in the picture.  my 5 years old will love it.  fast delivery</li>
    <li> cute and great for my 6 year old!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great my granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> very happy with this item</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 7 year old. She will love having all of these girly things to play with.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter loved this!  Cute little purse comes with it to hold most of the items.</li>
    <li> disappointing and the stuff doesn&#x27;t fit in the bag.</li>
    <li> Came as advertised. What I expected and enjoyed very much by my niece for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My kid loved it. She is definitely a girly girl and was very happy. Delivery was fast and we are pleased.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old Granddaughter loves it. plays make up all the time</li>
    <li> Very pleased!  It arrived when expected and we are very pleased!</li>
    <li> Its great present for kids as the colors are not too strong and kids love it.</li>
    <li> This was just what my Great Granddaughter wanted.  Thank you so much</li>
    <li> This is a vdry good toy for my granddaughter bought it from her bday</li>
    <li> any little girl&#x27;s dream</li>
    <li> Everything was typical kid quality but the nails were super flat and would not stick to either of my girl&#x27;s nails.  They were super disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent , I recommend this purchase .</li>
    <li> The nail polish is washable.. which is good so that kids won&#x27;t stain clothing, carpet, furniture... but the downside is that it also washes off as soon as they wash their hands.  False nails didn&#x27;t stick much and came off in a matter of minutes... actually took me longer to put them all on than the few minutes they stayed on afterwards.... but was everything was pretty much as I expected.  Value was good overall.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t good for my daughter. I think she was too young.</li>
    <li> Disappointed ! It Didnt come with nail polishes &amp; hair clips look too cheap!</li>
    <li> Larger than I had expected but items were very cheap...nail polish, lip gloss was half filled.</li>
    <li> Except for some bids(sticker), that&#x27;s good for a girl. My daughter is satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> The nail polish is so sheer you need three coats to see any color - NOT what my daughter wants to do, sitting there, applying and waiting for that much to dry. It&#x27;s for kids, people! The stick on nails don&#x27;t stick for more than a few minutes and the &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; lip gloss (which you need to apply with a better brush because theirs stinks), is also so sheer as to only give a few sparkles, no color tint at all. Over all disappointing.</li>
    <li> Bought this once and the kids loved it so much had to buy it for another kid too! Perfect birthday present for a little girl!</li>
    <li> Price is to high for the quality of the make up. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like anything special. I ordered this for my nieces for Christmas. The packaging is torn and had several indentions. It looks like it has been through a lot. Pretty rough looking.</li>
    <li> Purchased for Grand-Daughter age 5 - she was &amp;#34; Elisa&amp;#34; for Halloween and this item came in handy</li>
    <li> The items  are wonderful my grand daughter  enjoyed  the gifts.</li>
    <li> This was a mistake to buy for my daughter its mega cheap and frankly I am pretty sure its laced with Lead and all sorts of other Chinese chemicals.  Avoid this product its really that bad</li>
    <li> Also Xmas gift for grandaughter</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these as gifts for 3-4yr old girls. I wasn&#x27;t sure if they&#x27;d be really messy, but I took a chance. The girls love them &amp; the parents have given no negative feedback.</li>
    <li> My niece freaked when she received this in the mail. I would say this is a win</li>
    <li> Disappointed the little cosmetic bag was ripped.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in the quality of this set. The nail decals in particular were barely stuck to the sheets they were on, and when you try to remove the nail decal sheets, which are taped into the box with cellophane tape, the decals all come loose or move out of place. There were a couple of cute lip glosses. I was using the pieces to populate an advent calendar I made, so I got some value out of it. But as an entire set in a box, it just seemed tacky and cheap. For nearly $20, I didn&#x27;t think this was a good value at all.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, great product! Tell a Friend! :)</li>
    <li> My six year old loves it!!</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered.  It will be well received.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Perfect for a 7 year olds first makeup</li>
    <li> This product comes well boxed and gives a good presentation.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of fun  items to enjoy. --Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is decent. Little girls will love it! The makeup bag is very cute and a good size. The make up is like any other play makeup, sticky, and crap lol! But that&#x27;s pretty much how all play make up is. The nail polish isn&#x27;t actually color nail polish, it come on as a light, LIGHT, color barely even noticeable. Any questions? just let me know! Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> My niece was very happy with this present.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas for our son&#x27;s daughters so I don&#x27;t have first hand knowledge. That said however; the gift was delivered in two days and according to our son the make up applies readily to nearly every surface..</li>
    <li> Came when expected, granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I think the best part of this set is the nail polish. I bought this as a gift for my daughter who loves frozen, thinking that this would be great for her. I was disappointed with the quality of the items in this set. They&#x27;re cheap and not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect match with the shoulder bag</li>
    <li> excellent. my dtr is still enjoying it</li>
    <li> She loved her make  up</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and my niece loved it!</li>
    <li> Disney&#x27;s Frozen Beauty Cosmetic Set for Kids description was right on. There were no items missing and the presentation and boy, both were intact. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not much different than what we saw in the stores.</li>
    <li> Got this kit for my daughter for Christmas and I thought it would be a nice little gift for her. Everything is extremely cheap and the nail stickers don&#x27;t even stick on your nails and the sparkles for your nails immediately fall off. The little carrying case is cute but that&#x27;s about the only positive.</li>
    <li> This item was not as described, it had no nail polish included.</li>
    <li> What little girl doesn&#x27;t want a Frozen beauty set for Christmas?!?!  It was one of the top presents under our tree!</li>
    <li> Really cute, bought for my niece! The only thing I would say is the nails are TINY, for a baby tiny and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I think she was even a little disappointed but she had fun trying to put them on my 1 year old.</li>
    <li> I liked the kit overall as there were some great pieces that any little girl would love.  But it was very small and the price crazy!  The nail polish doesn&#x27;t last very long on the nail and easily chips but that is almost a given as it a kids product.  The clips stay in the hair well and the little cosmetics bag is big enough to hold everything.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift and was very well received. With everyone&#x27;s love for frozen this is a great gift for little girls. I&#x27;ve seen this type of stuff at different stores and this price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Lovedddddd ittttttt! Every thing a little glam girl/boy could want.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a gift and she loved it. The items were packaged very well, and easy to use for a adolescent - great theme!</li>
    <li> Quality of cosmetics not great but the gift was enjoyed by the receiver.</li>
    <li> This is basically junky nail polish and 3 different iterations of lip gloss. The stickers don&#x27;t stick and the clips separated from the design immediately. I gave this 2 stars instead of one since my daughter loves anything Frozen related. In terms of quality, this deserves 1 star. You&#x27;re better off buying frozen coloring books or dolls.</li>
    <li> The package was bent askew and looked like it had been a but manhandled. The items inside looked pretty cheap.</li>
    <li> So cute and exactly what I though it would be. Was delivered in a timely manor.</li>
    <li> Good deal, shipped fast and product was as described.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!!! You don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s advertised in the box. The box did not even come with nail polish!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice make up set. Very bright nail polish. The lip stick is subtle. Nails did not have good adhesive.</li>
    <li> Most of the makeup consists of lip glosses but my toddler loves it so no complaints. She really LOVES the press on nails! We bought the set to go with tin purse. Excellent pairing</li>
    <li> This product was of decent quality. My god-daughter was very happy with it on her birthday.</li>
    <li> Excellent and grand-daughter loved it</li>
    <li> VERY nice.....My granddaughter will love it.</li>
    <li> Fake nails do not stick</li>
    <li> Great price for something little girls will love and use quickly.</li>
    <li> My daughter is gonna love this !!!!</li>
    <li> Cheap 99 cent store quality merchandise. My grand daughter begged me for this kit so much that when it came I gave it to her right away. She was so disappointed with especially the nails that she put the pieces in the little pouch and left if on her dresser. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t wait for Christmas to give it to her. Will not be purchasing and more Frozen products from this vendor.</li>
    <li> This came when it was supposed to but it was opened and wouldn&#x27;t seal back.</li>
    <li> My six year old granddaughter loves playing with this. She puts on the make-up and even does makeovers on me. Lol</li>
    <li> Granddaughter lived this</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture, this will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Thank you got it just in time and it was great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s safety to my girl. nail polish is easy to remove by water. nice quality.</li>
    <li> Its frozen make up. Kids loved it and the mess was nominal!</li>
    <li> The only problem was the box came damaged :(</li>
    <li> good product~~&lt;br /&gt;My nephew will like it..</li>
    <li> unfortunately did not see it or test it so i cant comment on this one</li>
