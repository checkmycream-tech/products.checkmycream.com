      <li>I put it on my shoulders and a delicious scent wafts gently up for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I also have the perfume, and many people comment on how nice it smells.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of warm vanilla.</li>
      <li>Most popular product as a gift</li>
      <li>The warm vanilla sugar is my favorite bath and body works scent.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really smells good on the wife!  </li>
      <li>It seems more sugar than vanilla and is very strong.</li>
      <li>but inside knew it was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very light,  and I like this product and would buy more.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It is one of her favorite scents from Bath and Body Works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t love the scent of this.  </li>
      <li>I like to wear a fragrance and therefore have tried many (mostly colognes).  </li>
      <li>Worked great for a gift, Was delivered fast.</li>
      <li>Can you tell that i love it?</li>
      <li>As much as I love vanillas and Bath and Body Works, this lotion just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>love the product for it&#x27;s purpose, but not for it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>need more</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this body lotion.</li>
      <li>Did I say I LOVE the scent?</li>
      <li>If your looking for a nice winter scent or just a good lotion with a nice scent to use after washing your dishes every night, I recommend buying a bottle of this for the shelf above your kitchen sink, your vanity, and another one for someone as a gift.</li>
      <li>I find that it does have a sweet warm vanilla scent without making you smell like a bakery.  </li>
      <li>Smelling like warm sugar cookies, this lotion has a sweet aroma that relaxes the senses.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I had found a vanilla scented product that I enjoyed very much.</li>
      <li>I do fine</li>
      <li>and I am happy to wear it occasionally but</li>
      <li>But as a scent on me, I think it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I own 3 big bottles of the Warm Vanilla Sugar lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this scent, but the last one purchased was more \\&quot;cookie-ish\\&quot; than vanilla sugar.</li>
      <li>BUT really, the only reason I buy this stuff is for the delicious smell!</li>
      <li>Love this and its so good for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this so much!</li>
      <li>As a lotion, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and does a great job of keeping my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I needed another bottle and was able to purchase this from Amazon and it is so nice to not have to go to the mall, especially during the Christmas season rush.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>The price was a good as getting it on sale at the local store.  </li>
      <li>3/4 full bottle.</li>
      <li>Overall, still a good product.</li>
      <li>Probably would be more of a summer or spring lotion since it feels very lightweight.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery love the lotion.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and never greasy.  </li>
      <li>Overall great product and my 2nd favorite scent by Bath and Body Works.</li>
      <li>Overall a pretty good scented lotion.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like strong smelling things, but when I buy a particular scent I do like to smell it.  </li>
      <li>Bought it for my mom, and she likes it very much.</li>
      <li>It puts a nice healthy glow to your skin when used upon the face and leaves the hands soft after using just a little after washing dishes.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying regular lotion and adding vanilla extract to it.</li>
      <li>The only thing I can think of to make this product better would be a subscribe and save option.</li>
      <li>(as they changed the formula and the new scent is completely different and not as nice</li>
      <li>This is a softly scented  lotion, so if you really like strong, knock you over scents, you may not like this as much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for softening the heels of tired, freshly soaked feet.</li>
      <li>The lotion formula is nothing special -- it will keep your hands soft</li>
      <li>I think if you really enjoy vanillas and are looking for something to soothe your dry skin, then this is worth the price.</li>
      <li>A classic!</li>
      <li>I really like the scent of vanilla or even sometimes a sugar and spice blend that comes out around Christmas and reminds me a little bit of baked cookies, so I thought \\&quot;Warm Vanilla</li>
      <li>I suspect that the seller put some other super cheap lotion in a Bath and Body Works bottle.</li>
      <li>Shipping was a bit much</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t become to much if you layer it with the spray fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have found this lotion to be very moisturizing  As well as soothing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I really like the scent of vanilla or even sometimes a sugar and spice blend that comes out around Christmas and reminds me a little bit of baked cookies, so I thought \\&quot;Warm Vanilla Sugar\\&quot; would be a good combination of the two.  This just did not work.  Whatever the scent is, some combination of butter and soap or something is way too overpowering.  Speaking of butter, the lotion is quite thick and tends to seal in your skin with a layer of greasy, slickness, that yes feels like when you have butter on your hands and it won&#x27;t come off.  After you put this lotion on, everything is slippery and your skin can&#x27;t breath for awhile until you work up enough heat I guess to baste it in.      I suppose if you have really dry skin, don&#x27;t mind not being able to grasp things for a couple hours after application and like a not so subtle aroma of butter, soap and I don&#x27;t know what, this would be a good lotion for you.    Happy Basting!</li>
    <li> I own 3 big bottles of the Warm Vanilla Sugar lotion. Can you tell that i love it? It smells sooooo gooood!!!! I love this so much! It makes my skin moisturized too! How could you not love this? It is fantastic! I love Bath and Body works! Overall great product and my 2nd favorite scent by Bath and Body Works.</li>
    <li> Supposedly this stuff was discontinued for a while and my wife was hoarding the last little bit of it she had left for months.  I was a hero for finding it here.  Shipping was a bit much but she&#x27;s happy and, um, moisturized and smells great too!</li>
    <li> Worked great for a gift, Was delivered fast. Perfect timing for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a little aromatherapy.  I don&#x27;t like strong smelling things, but when I buy a particular scent I do like to smell it.  You can hardly smell anything once it&#x27;s rubbed into your skin.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then you&#x27;ll be happy.  I wanted a fragrance  I could actually smell.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a quality lotion, not watered down - moisturizes well.  I keep it in my glove compartment for dry skin moments.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for something a little different now that we are coming into fall and winter, which is when I like something with a warmer scent profile for my body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is nice and rich and does not leave behind a greasy feel.  I do fine that I need to spend a ing time rubbing the lotion in to get it to absorb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the lotion scent, it does have the warm vanilla scent but to me it also smells a little floral as a back note and that is not something that I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a good lotion and I am happy to wear it occasionally but it will not be my every day choice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent, but the last one purchased was more \\&quot;cookie-ish\\&quot; than vanilla sugar. still nice, but not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> As much as I love vanillas and Bath and Body Works, this lotion just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. On other people, it smells so lovely. As a lotion, it&#x27;s very moisturizing and does a great job of keeping my skin feeling soft and smooth. It works for hours even after applying! But as a scent on me, I think it doesn&#x27;t fit. My body chemistry just doesn&#x27;t work well with this smell... I kind of think I smell &amp;#34;stale.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s also not very strong on me either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the product for it&#x27;s purpose, but not for it&#x27;s scent. Overall, still a good product. I think if you really enjoy vanillas and are looking for something to soothe your dry skin, then this is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I use it as a moisturizer after a shower and it smells delish.  I have been using Moonlight Path and ordered it as well but like the vanilla scent in just about anything.</li>
    <li> When i opened my package lotion was errywhere! Like someone let off a nut &amp; wrapped it in bubble wrap..</li>
    <li> Happy wife makes a happy man is oh so very true. Thanks for helping me make her have a Merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; but it does also moisturize my skin. That&#x27;s all I have to say about that.</li>
    <li> The scent is amazing! It smells like brown sugar mixed with vanilla bean. The lotion makes my skin feel really nice also. Great for winter. One of my all time favorites.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product three days ago, the item pictured was the old bottle.  I ordered it specifically because I was trying to buy the older product (as they changed the formula and the new scent is completely different and not as nice - I actually find it unpleasant).  When I received my order, it was the new bottle.  The item pictured was not the item sent.  They&#x27;ve since changed the picture on amazon.  But since I did not receive what I believed I ordered, I returned it.  I am very disappointed that B&amp;BW changed my favorite fragrance (the only one I&#x27;ve worn for the last TEN years).  I was hoping this was old stock someone was selling but inside knew it was too good to be true.  At least they changed the picture so you know what you&#x27;re getting now.</li>
    <li> It made a nice gift. The recipient was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I never hesitate in buying Bath and Body Work&lt;br /&gt;items as I know they will always go over well.</li>
    <li> The lotion formula is nothing special -- it will keep your hands soft BUT really, the only reason I buy this stuff is for the delicious smell!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and smells great and lasts a long time. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the vanilla scents.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that the lotion I received was actually Bath and Body Works. The lid was taped shut rather than shrink-wrapped. I suspect that the seller put some other super cheap lotion in a Bath and Body Works bottle. It barely has a scent, and the light scent it had was not the same as the cream lotion of the same scent that I bought elsewhere. It was not like any Bath and Body Works product I have used.</li>
    <li> Most popular product as a gift</li>
    <li> Smelling like warm sugar cookies, this lotion has a sweet aroma that relaxes the senses. It&#x27;s great for softening the heels of tired, freshly soaked feet. It&#x27;s great for dry skin. It puts a nice healthy glow to your skin when used upon the face and leaves the hands soft after using just a little after washing dishes. If your looking for a nice winter scent or just a good lotion with a nice scent to use after washing your dishes every night, I recommend buying a bottle of this for the shelf above your kitchen sink, your vanity, and another one for someone as a gift. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I had found a vanilla scented product that I enjoyed very much. After awhile I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I received a small bottle of Bath and Body Works  Warm Vanilla Sugar Lotion as a gift first. I fell in love with it. For its light  but lasting fragrance. I live in a cold weather state so I deal with dry chapped skin.  I have found this lotion to be very moisturizing  As well as soothing. Best of all it Isn&#x27;t greasy the way I have found some lotions to be. It doesn&#x27;t become to much if you layer it with the spray fragrance.  I find that it does have a sweet warm vanilla scent without making you smell like a bakery.  The only thing I can think of to make this product better would be a subscribe and save option. I would recommend it for any age group.</li>
    <li> Was not familiar with this fragrance before I ordered it.  It seems more sugar than vanilla and is very strong.</li>
    <li> It met her expectation ... And was a lovely surprises  to gift !!</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion.</li>
    <li> The scent is very light,  and I like this product and would buy more.</li>
    <li> It smells A-mazing!! And it definitely softens your skin. Probably will buy another(:</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  I also have the spritz and it all smells really good.  Good price as well!  Cheaper than in the store!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of warm vanilla. It is kind of like the bodycology vanilla sugar I buy from time to time.</li>
    <li> Love how wonderful this smells! Softens the skin, too</li>
    <li> The warm vanilla sugar is my favorite bath and body works scent.  I needed another bottle and was able to purchase this from Amazon and it is so nice to not have to go to the mall, especially during the Christmas season rush.  The price was a good as getting it on sale at the local store.  As always I am very please with this product.</li>
    <li> I like to wear a fragrance and therefore have tried many (mostly colognes).  None seemed to give me what I want, until I tried Warm Vanilla Sugar lotion.  I put it on my shoulders and a delicious scent wafts gently up for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I use this at night before going to bed and when I turn down my bed the next night, I can smell warm vanilla sugar.  Absorbs quickly and never greasy.  Did I say I LOVE the scent?</li>
    <li> Bath &amp; Body has created another great product.  This is not a heavy scent and it is definitely doing its job in the moisturizing department</li>
    <li> I bought this product to go with my vanilla body spray! It works wonders, but it honestly it not worth the cost. You&#x27;d be better off buying regular lotion and adding vanilla extract to it.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely amazing</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a wonderful fragrance which remains with me most of the day.  I also find that it really softens my skin.</li>
    <li> I have never bought this product from Amazon, but I do get it from Bath and Body Works (the price on Amazon is about the same as at Bath and Body Works).  It is, hands down, my favorite body lotion.  I put it on at bedtime, and over time, the scent has gotten into the comforter where I lay, so every time I lay down for bed there&#x27;s a very soft floral vanilla scent.  This is a softly scented  lotion, so if you really like strong, knock you over scents, you may not like this as much. I also have the perfume, and many people comment on how nice it smells.</li>
    <li> This stuff really smells good on the wife!  Men you will love it!</li>
    <li> this oil sure smells great. i don&#x27;t know about whether it will reduce my craving for chocolate but it&#x27;s still good stuff.</li>
    <li> The bottle was completely gross! It looked like it was refilled and used. 3/4 full bottle. Completely unhappy. Will never buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> Overall a pretty good scented lotion.  Not perhaps the best lotion or the strongest vanilla scent, but still good.</li>
    <li> It is one of her favorite scents from Bath and Body Works. She likes it and uses it every day. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> This is a lucious hand and body lotion. It smells delicious, just like Vanilla and sugar. It smells really sweet, and is so good for your skin! It is reasonably priced and you get alot of lotion for your money. I love it! Hope this helps,Pia</li>
    <li> smells very fragrant and a little goes a long way. Not as moisturizing as any oils I&#x27;ve used but it does the job considering this winter weather. Probably would be more of a summer or spring lotion since it feels very lightweight.</li>

    <li> I have noticed a couple of reviews here about the old bottle. Well for those using this product as long as myself I do so agree with you in every way!!  The old bottle has this UPC: 0637293183051 which it is a darker label, the lotion doesnt have none of this nonsense shea butter and/or Vit E.  It was old and plain vanilla sugar - even the texture and color of the lotion was almost beige unlike this new formula.  This new formula is crap, the lotion color is plain white, it has a an after smell that overpowers the vanilla scent and does not last even hours.&lt;br /&gt;For those still confused, the new UPC is this: 0667530919266&lt;br /&gt;BWW - what have you done?!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love the scent of this.  Perhaps I got a bad bottle.  The lotion quality was great, just couldn&#x27;t take the fragrance.  I&#x27;m going back to the Bath &amp; Body Works Raspberry Vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> Love this and its so good for dry skin.  need more</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents, smells so good. Bought for a friend of mine and she loved it as well :D</li>
