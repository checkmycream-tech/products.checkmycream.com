      <li>It is even more stunning in person-</li>
      <li>The bead work matches my dress perfectly, even better than the several hundred dollar ones at the bridal salon!</li>
      <li>The price was a fraction of the cost of the veils I had seen in the bridal boutiques and appeared to have more detail.</li>

      <li>came in quickly as promised, needed a little trimmimg of silver edging  and is beautiful !</li>
      <li>I hung mine on the back of a door for a couple months and it still needed a fair amount of steaming to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was EXACTLY what my daughter wanted!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>This is the exact same veil that my daughter had picked out at &#x27;that famous nationwide bridal salon&#x27; for $190!</li>
      <li>Thank you for helping my day extra special :)</li>
      <li>Please consider taking better care of the sewing and beading in the future!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant about purchasing my veil sight unseen, however after seeing the expensive prices of veils in the bridal salons and reading the excellent reviews on this one, I decided to go for it!</li>
      <li>just make sure you let it hang for a long time to get wrinkles out.  </li>
      <li>I WOULD CERTAINLY  RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO FUTIURE  BRIDES .  </li>
      <li>High quality and priced very affordable!</li>
      <li>; like, but needed to be ironed or steamed before use because it was very poofy when it came out of the package.</li>
      <li>There are a couple of errors with the scallop cut, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
      <li>It really was what you see.</li>
      <li>That really bothers me.</li>
      <li>I am using this for my wedding in July, is really beautiful just like the expensive ones at David&#x27;s Bridal</li>
      <li>Hope steaming the wrinkles out makes it a little more pliable.</li>
      <li>We decided that even if it arrived and we had to send it back, it was worth the gamble.</li>
      <li>I WAS ABLE TO UPGRADE  BY ADDING A LITTLE EXTRA BLING.</li>
      <li>It exceeded my expectations for such a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Yup, the exact same one, same quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s decent, the material is a little stiff, I expected it to be a little more free flowing.</li>
      <li>The package actually arrived a day or so early.</li>
      <li>but I have no regrets on this purchase.</li>
      <li>And even if the quality wasn&#x27;t quite the same, it&#x27;s only worn for a few hours, right?</li>

    <li> Excellent just as pictured n great price</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but i love this veil it matches my gown perfectly! Its beautiful and very detailed just like the picture</li>
    <li> Its perfect even prettier than the picture and better and cheaper than anything I found in the bridal store.</li>
    <li> It looks great, it really does. But looking closer at it, there&#x27;s a few spots where the beading is very loose and sticks out along with the thread. That really bothers me. I feel like there wasn&#x27;t enough time and care put into this veil, someone&#x27;s veil is supposed to be perfect and flawless. There are a couple of errors with the scallop cut, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Please consider taking better care of the sewing and beading in the future!</li>
    <li> Wore this for my wedding - it came on time and was good quality. Not too &amp;#34;fish-net&amp;#34; like, but needed to be ironed or steamed before use because it was very poofy when it came out of the package.</li>
    <li> Very close to my daughters gown, looked beautiful on her and together with the gown!</li>
    <li> This is the exact same veil that my daughter had picked out at &#x27;that famous nationwide bridal salon&#x27; for $190! She purchased her gown and decided to get the veil later. I was browsing Amazon one day and for some reason, thought I&#x27;d look to see what the selection was like for veils. I was stunned when I ran across this for $57. We decided that even if it arrived and we had to send it back, it was worth the gamble. And even if the quality wasn&#x27;t quite the same, it&#x27;s only worn for a few hours, right? Well, we got it and were pleased. We were back at the salon last week to buy the bridesmaid dresses and again I looked at the veil. Yup, the exact same one, same quality. Yes, we&#x27;re pleased!</li>
    <li> The detail on this veil was absolutely beautiful. Glad I found this company on Amazon Prime</li>
    <li> I honestly loved the condition!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great 2 tier veil! The price cannot be beat!&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a shorter one but I read the measurements and&lt;br /&gt;got it anyway so that my tailor could shorten it..&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will be using it for my wedding day ! :)</li>
    <li> I loved the veil! It was very pretty and good quality! http://www.onlineflexjob.com/BethanyDean</li>
    <li> Absolutely more beautiful than the picture!  The silver lining matches my wedding dress perfectly!!!  Thank you from a very happy bride to be :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this veil and received within a few days. The price was a fraction of the cost of the veils I had seen in the bridal boutiques and appeared to have more detail. Received the veil and it was absolutely gorgeous!! Went perfect with my dress! Didn&#x27;t know how I felt about purchasing something I couldn&#x27;t seen in person but I have no regrets on this purchase. Thank you for helping my day extra special :)</li>
    <li> Just beautiful, looked just as good as the expensive once you can find on a bridal salon, quite happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Beautiful veil. Very nice quality for a such a steal. Would definitely order again</li>
    <li> This veil is absolutely amazing and I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on my wedding day. I&#x27;m wearing it with a pearl colored wedding dress (off-white) but it looks great together</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Quality was very good. My daughter looked Beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful veil! I used it for my wedding and I absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find it for a better price in stores than this website!</li>
    <li> IT WAS NICE LOOKING  AND  SHIPMNT ARRIVED  IN GREAT TIME.. I WAS ABLE TO UPGRADE  BY ADDING A LITTLE EXTRA BLING. I WOULD CERTAINLY  RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO FUTIURE  BRIDES .  I AM  AN EVENT PLANNER AND I FOUND THE PRICE AND QUALITY  TO BE GREAT...</li>
    <li> This veil is gorgeous! I was hesitant about purchasing my veil sight unseen, however after seeing the expensive prices of veils in the bridal salons and reading the excellent reviews on this one, I decided to go for it! It is even more stunning in person- the pictures do not do it justice! The bead work matches my dress perfectly, even better than the several hundred dollar ones at the bridal salon! I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this veil to anybody! Arrived in just a few days! The veil comes folded in a plastic sleeve, and the recommendations say to leave it hang for 1-2 months before you plan to wear it. I&#x27;ve had it hanging for just 3 days and most of the wrinkles are already out of it! Equivalent quality to the veils in bridal salons at 1/5 of the price!</li>
    <li> Beautiful veil at great price! Resembles a $200 veil in David&#x27;s bridal!! This one was the perfect veil! Loveees it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. It really was what you see. Very important part of the outfit. lol SO glad it worked out!</li>
    <li> I am using this for my wedding in July, is really beautiful just like the expensive ones at David&#x27;s Bridal but at half the cost!</li>

    <li> The veil is absolutely beautiful!!!! It exceeded my expectations for such a reasonable price.  Matches the wedding dress perfectly!!!  The package actually arrived a day or so early. I am sooooooo very satisfied.  I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent, the material is a little stiff, I expected it to be a little more free flowing. Hope steaming the wrinkles out makes it a little more pliable.</li>
    <li> great product as described</li>
    <li> bought this veil before I even picked out my dress!  When I went to David&#x27;s bridal and found my perfect dress, upon trying it on, they gave me this exact veil to try on with my dress.  Looked great! just make sure you let it hang for a long time to get wrinkles out.  I hung mine on the back of a door for a couple months and it still needed a fair amount of steaming to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> Nice product and time was accurate</li>
    <li> Good quality and very affordable!</li>
    <li> This the veil  I wanted  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t  get from bridal  store..I did find cheaper  but I see Amazon.com was even cheaper  what was I thinking! !!</li>
    <li> High quality and priced very affordable!</li>
    <li> pictures don&#x27;t do this veil justice. Great bead work along the edges !!</li>
    <li> Looks cheap. Very light weight.  Rhinestones are ugly. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> came in quickly as promised, needed a little trimmimg of silver edging  and is beautiful !</li>
