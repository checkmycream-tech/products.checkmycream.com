      <li>goes on smooth u</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, the color is as described, and it wears well.  </li>
      <li>I had to order this online because it&#x27;s discontinued and no longer available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>Items appear new, as advertised, and the price was very worthwhile.</li>
      <li>Not the bubble gum shade but a soft beautiful rose/pink that makes me look natural and have the look of glowing skin.  </li>
      <li>Thinking &amp;#34;Blush&amp;#34; would be a nice soft color as it appeared online.</li>
      <li>Good quality lipstick that doesn&#x27;t dry my lips.  </li>
      <li>Nice color for me, stays on long, goes on smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>It is such a pretty tone, very light and neutral, and still very sexy- not a dull, solid color, it has a nice shimmer to it.  </li>
      <li>It is a diamond in the rough of brightly colored hues that L&#x27;Oreal has decided to keep, instead.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural and lovely.</li>
      <li>Price is right, too.</li>
      <li>Because were worth it ;)</li>
      <li>However, my screen is pretty true to the real color that an item is.  </li>
      <li>I love this lipstick - it is the only one I wear.  </li>
      <li>But the top is not so desirable to put back on.</li>
      <li>I realize that you can&#x27;t always tell the exact color because computer screens don&#x27;t always do things justice.</li>
      <li>This is evidently discontinued.</li>
      <li>Its a naturel coral shade with enough shimmer to give you a healthy &#x27;kiss me&#x27; look.</li>
      <li>I love the color and have used for several years</li>
      <li>My favorite L&#x27;Oreal color for so long.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, and completely sealed for safety.  </li>
      <li>a great everyday nude like pink, very pretty</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I absolutely love Gilded Pink.  </li>
      <li>This is a very light-colored natural-looking lipstick, and works well for my preferred low-maintenance look.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>After reading some of the reviews, I thought I wasted my money on a very neutral lipstick, but I was surprised at how nice and pretty it made my lips.</li>
      <li>I am extremely grateful that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>One has to fine the little notch on the top and cylinder in order to close it properly.  </li>
      <li>a nice soft golden pink color, but definitely feels a like lipstick.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I have been frustrated at not being able to find it in stores anymore, and am very happy to have found it here for a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I bought close to a dozen because I love this color and the $4 price tag was half what I was used to paying.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick for about 10 years and stores do not carry this particular color.</li>
      <li>I was thinking of something light and pink.  </li>
      <li>Also bought Golden Splendor (this is such a jazzy color) and Bronze Coin (this is a sultry color)-</li>
      <li>my advice for anyone who love with a content to get heavy handed with application is that this lipstick does have some sparkle built into it</li>
      <li>I tired it on, this color changed a bit on me (for the good)</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll look for a new color.  </li>
      <li>It adds a subtle touch of color that I find really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
      <li>Today I received a tube that was advertised as a soft blush.</li>
      <li>It can either be subdued and serious, or with a brighter lipliner and lipgloss, really sexy.  </li>
      <li>My wife purchased this looking for something with a little more pink in it.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely what I expected.</li>

    <li> The name and the color are misleading.  Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The color was more of a mauve than I wanted.</li>
    <li> excellent lipstick, doesn&#x27;t pull together and doesn&#x27;t spread, quality of a product remarkable, many thanks to the seller for fast delivery</li>
    <li> I miss this color...you can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Happy I found it....Ordered and it arrived in perfect condition.  Great Service!</li>
    <li> my favorite color and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lipstick.  It&#x27;s smooth, the color is as described, and it wears well.  Loreal makes good lipsticks.  The service was excellent too.</li>
    <li> still great lipstick just too light</li>
    <li> Glided pink is the perfect shade for my lips. It&#x27;s very natural looking. Will continue to buy this and other L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
    <li> Absolutely what I expected. Love this color!  So happy I could find it again!</li>
    <li> a really nice color, suitable for all skin types and complexions! I have a soft brown complexion and I thought it might be too pink for me but it ended up being perfect. my advice for anyone who love with a content to get heavy handed with application is that this lipstick does have some sparkle built into it and it&#x27;s quite noticeable if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
    <li> So pleased to find this!  Rich and creamy with a lovely scent.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> it is a dupe of mac viva glam iv lipstick i had long time ago .. goes on smooth u will like it</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal  is always great.  I just happen to order the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Just advertized.</li>
    <li> It is MY color, but I couldn&#x27;t buy it at the store.  They were sealed so I felt safe using them.</li>
    <li> I had to order this online because it&#x27;s discontinued and no longer available in the stores.  Good quality lipstick that doesn&#x27;t dry my lips.  It doesn&#x27;t wear long, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind reapplying.  Great simmery neutral on me.</li>
    <li> My favorite L&#x27;Oreal color for so long.  I am disappointed that it is not available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;word word word</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this looking for something with a little more pink in it.  Pink is in the name, but there is very little pink.  This matches her lips almost perfectly so it can only be considered a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> perfect classic lipstick.  good texture, lasts, well thought out color choices, sophisticated sheen.  I&#x27;ve stocked up so i won&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> a nice soft golden pink color, but definitely feels a like lipstick. Drying and sticks to dry patches on your lips.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.  Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I ordered 10 of these as L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued them which is very disappointing.  I love the color and have used for several years so not sure what I will do when I run out. I guess I&#x27;ll look for a new color.  This works with almost everything and is great for day time/office.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service.</li>
    <li> I bought close to a dozen because I love this color and the $4 price tag was half what I was used to paying.  Unfortunately, nearly half of these tubes had been tried at the store and re-sold to me.</li>
    <li> lipstick not sealed. Smelled old.....threw it away.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I thought I wasted my money on a very neutral lipstick, but I was surprised at how nice and pretty it made my lips. Its a naturel coral shade with enough shimmer to give you a healthy &#x27;kiss me&#x27; look. Perfect for everyday and running errands. Loreal is a brand you can trust for quality. Because were worth it ;)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color for me and lasts a good amount of time. I wear it over my lip liner and it gives just the look I like.</li>
    <li> Nice color, smooth.  But the top is not so desirable to put back on. One has to fine the little notch on the top and cylinder in order to close it properly.  I found that a nuisance.</li>
    <li> This is evidently discontinued. It just so happens to be my perfect shade!</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE THE COLOR TOO DARK AND RED</li>
    <li> Like the color, but texture is not as creamy as I wanted it to be.</li>
    <li> disappointed no color to the stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick for about 10 years and stores do not carry this particular color. I love that I can get it through here.</li>
    <li> Very, very happy with the shade of pink! Not the bubble gum shade but a soft beautiful rose/pink that makes me look natural and have the look of glowing skin.  Can be worn with a lot of shades of pink clothing. NOT bold, thank goodness.  I like a dreamy look. L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colour Riche has a lot of wonderful shades.  This \\&quot;Gilded Pink\\&quot; is one of my favorites.  Packaged safety for shipping which was on time. Also bought Golden Splendor (this is such a jazzy color) and Bronze Coin (this is a sultry color)- am really glad I bought them for their beautiful color and am feeling snazzy :)</li>
    <li> This color looks great on anyone at any time. Its great quality and a great purchase.</li>
    <li> The best lipstick to use is L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick - it is the only one I wear.  Like other reviewers, I have been frustrated at not being able to find it in stores anymore, and am very happy to have found it here for a reasonable price.  This is a very light-colored natural-looking lipstick, and works well for my preferred low-maintenance look.  It adds a subtle touch of color that I find really nice.</li>
    <li> I received my purchase earlier than expected.  Items appear new, as advertised, and the price was very worthwhile.</li>
    <li> This shade is very hard to find in stores. I was so happy I found it here on amazon!! Must be a very popular shade, and rightly so! This  adds the perfect natural color balance without looking over done!</li>
    <li> Nice color for me, stays on long, goes on smooth and creamy. Like it.</li>
    <li> a great everyday nude like pink, very pretty</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Gilded Pink.  It&#x27;s a pretty peach with slight tones of beige, gold, and pink.  It&#x27;s so natural and lovely.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am a lipstick fanatic. Last time I counted I had over 200 tubes. Still looking for the signature one. I purchased 8 of the L&#x27;oreal lipsticks and was very disappointed. When they arrived, not one of them looked like the color that was shown. I realize that you can&#x27;t always tell the exact color because computer screens don&#x27;t always do things justice. However, my screen is pretty true to the real color that an item is.  I am 60+ and have been told by a make-up artist that I should use softer shades. I picked out the softer color shades but when they arrived all but one was even close to the color I thought it would be. Today I received a tube that was advertised as a soft blush. I was thinking of something light and pink.  Thinking &amp;#34;Blush&amp;#34; would be a nice soft color as it appeared online. What I got was a medium bright wine color. It looked horrible. I will be putting these lipsticks in a basket for one of our basket parties.  The same applied for all the lipsticks. None of them even resembled the color of that was shown. From now on I will purchase my lipsticks from a department store where I can see the colors as they are meant to be.</li>
    <li> I tired it on, this color changed a bit on me (for the good) but I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to wear it all day so I couldn&#x27;t answer how long the product lasted during a day or had to be re-applied...therefore I gave it 4*</li>
    <li> I am extremely upset that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this color from stores.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I do cherish this item.  It is such a pretty tone, very light and neutral, and still very sexy- not a dull, solid color, it has a nice shimmer to it.  It is a diamond in the rough of brightly colored hues that L&#x27;Oreal has decided to keep, instead. I am extremely grateful that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my mom, but she said the color was somehow different than the ones she used to buy from shops before</li>
    <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what to expect, but this lipstick is phenomenal.  It can either be subdued and serious, or with a brighter lipliner and lipgloss, really sexy.  It is my favorite color lipstick now.  Lasts all day, still on after eating. Arrived quickly, and completely sealed for safety.  Price is right, too.</li>
