### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My granddaughter is very impressed with the quality of this lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Creamy and deliciously scented!</li>
      <li>This lipstick was perfection and smells so good too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s has a great pigment</li>
      <li>Which is great.</li>
      <li>Great coverage, too.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful (and not at all cheap).  </li>
      <li>It is really nice and creamy and feels great on the lips.</li>
      <li>It smells really good, too.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased when i received this package in the mail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen many people wearing these Lime Crime Lipsticks and they say they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick...</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I have to write twelve more words for this review.</li>
      <li>Ok...</li>
      <li>satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Really lovely.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am very excited to wear this lipstick to up coming underground shows.</li>
      <li>BEST BLACK EVER..</li>
      <li>This is the best black lipstick I have ever came in contact with.</li>
      <li>It looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>Smooth, but not too creamy.</li>
      <li>It applies nicely and lasts and is worth the higher cost.</li>
      <li>Make sure your lips are well conditioned before using it, because it is think and has a great stain, and will show off dead lip skin if it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money it costs.</li>
      <li>And they&#x27;re right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just right for any goth event.  </li>
      <li>All in all, Lime Crime is a new product I&#x27;ll most likely be investing in!:)</li>
      <li>This one produces the strong color desired and can be applied heavily to really show off the lips in about as much a sexy way as possible.</li>
      <li>This lipstick, however, gives the perfect solid black coloring to your lips.</li>
      <li>I wish the aroma of the lipstick was a bit better, and that it was a tad smoother, but this is finally a lipstick with superb color which unlike blacks from other companies really shows up instead of being so sheer when applied that it disappears.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a very good product that I will definitely buy again and also try other colors.</li>
      <li>package came very fast.</li>
      <li>I as well love the outside shell of the lipstick.</li>
      <li>though the ones I&#x27;ve brought previously have been the ones at either beauty supply stores or when Halloween comes out, Lime Crime Styletto is a great lipstick as far as lipsticks go.</li>
      <li>VERY PIGMENTED.</li>
      <li>Absolutely will buy again.</li>
      <li>Pure, opaque black color; creamy texture, moisturizing, moderate shine, and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>The actual lipstick:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been needing a good black lipstick.</li>
      <li>It does leave your lips feeling a bit dry while wearing it, which can be fixed with an application of lipgloss on top.</li>
      <li>It has a nice gloss that isn&#x27;t overly wet looking, and wears very well throughout a long day of picture taking and sweating.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented and creamy, and it was a true black.</li>
      <li>My first Lime Crime purchase and it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really expensive, and doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips, but the colors are very vibrant and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It holds on well, but not too well, which is a major plus.</li>
      <li>I like it so far considering it is my first black lipstick.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible halloween makeup black, it&#x27;s a great quality black that doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips or feel bad to wear or anything.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s not terrible halloween makeup black, it&#x27;s a great quality black that doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips or feel bad to wear or anything.  </li>
<li> You gotta apply it a few time to get the full on black affect.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t feel dry on the lips and doesn&#x27;t take too much coating to get the opaque black.</li>
<li> It take a lot of makeup remover to get off, but it wears terrifically and has a gorgeous purple color base.</li>
<li> Additionally, the price is reasonable, considering the quality (I think it could be a few dollars less-</li>
<li> A deep black is what I&#x27;ve seen, though you may have to layer.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s only cons is that it tends to get all over things when you eat, drink, or rub your face and it takes a little work to get off being that it sinks into the lines of your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many, but they all end up smelling bad and being greasy.</li>
<li> It came about 8 days before the expected delivery date.</li>
<li> This product may be expensive, but it is totally worth it.</li>
<li> I had been looking for a quality black lipstick for a while and had tried other brands.</li>
<li> and I MUST get other colors!</li>
<li> I had never found any that would give me the opaque black coloring that I wanted.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s black.  </li>
<li> Ugh when I say it&#x27;s black, it is BLACK.</li>
<li> I was afraid that the lipstick was going to melt (due to the hot weather conditions of late) in the mail</li>
<li> Some even dried my lips out and just wouldn&#x27;t stay on at all.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been searching for black lipstick that&#x27;s creamy and long-lasting, and this is it!  </li>
<li> It was in a small package wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
<li> Too bad I can&#x27;t wear it everyday because of my school!</li>
<li> , it doesn&#x27;t feather or fade in a terrible feathery manner like some lipsticks tend to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for black lipstick that&#x27;s creamy and long-lasting, and this is it!  Great coverage, too.  It&#x27;s just right for any goth event.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One coat does do the trick! Creamy and deliciously scented! I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Do not hesitate on this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is very impressed with the quality of this lipstick.  It applies nicely and lasts and is worth the higher cost.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when i received this package in the mail. It was in a small package wrapped in bubble wrap. I was afraid that the lipstick was going to melt (due to the hot weather conditions of late) in the mail but it did not. I was relieved! I as well love the outside shell of the lipstick. My first Lime Crime purchase and it won&#x27;t be my last. I am very excited to wear this lipstick to up coming underground shows. Peace out girl scout.</li>
    <li> The actual lipstick:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been needing a good black lipstick. I&#x27;ve gone through so many, but they all end up smelling bad and being greasy. Some even dried my lips out and just wouldn&#x27;t stay on at all.  I&#x27;ve seen many people wearing these Lime Crime Lipsticks and they say they&#x27;re amazing. Creamy and pigmented. And they&#x27;re right. This is the best black lipstick I have ever came in contact with. It is really nice and creamy and feels great on the lips. VERY PIGMENTED. Ugh when I say it&#x27;s black, it is BLACK. I love it. It smells really good, too. Kinda smelly like MAC lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping/Delivery:&lt;br /&gt;My package came very fast. It came about 8 days before the expected delivery date. Which is great.</li>
    <li> Pure, opaque black color; creamy texture, moisturizing, moderate shine, and pleasant smell. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t feather or fade in a terrible feathery manner like some lipsticks tend to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the ones I&#x27;ve brought previously have been the ones at either beauty supply stores or when Halloween comes out, Lime Crime Styletto is a great lipstick as far as lipsticks go. Additionally, the price is reasonable, considering the quality (I think it could be a few dollars less- but then again, it is vegan. :l)</li>
    <li> This lipstick was perfection and smells so good too! I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t meet my expectations but it exceeded them! Absolutely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Will be purchasing again. Smooth, but not too creamy. Really lovely. A deep black is what I&#x27;ve seen, though you may have to layer. All in all, Lime Crime is a new product I&#x27;ll most likely be investing in!:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lipstick.  It smells wonderful (and not at all cheap).  It&#x27;s creamy.  It&#x27;s black.  You will put it on, and you will like it.  It&#x27;s not terrible halloween makeup black, it&#x27;s a great quality black that doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips or feel bad to wear or anything.  Grab some.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick... It&#x27;s really expensive, and doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips, but the colors are very vibrant and gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought this lipstick. It&#x27;s worth the money it costs. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry on the lips and doesn&#x27;t take too much coating to get the opaque black. Too bad I can&#x27;t wear it everyday because of my school!</li>
    <li> I bought the color Styletto for a cosplay that I plan on doing and I love it. It&#x27;s very pigmented and creamy, and it was a true black. It has a nice gloss that isn&#x27;t overly wet looking, and wears very well throughout a long day of picture taking and sweating. It&#x27;s only cons is that it tends to get all over things when you eat, drink, or rub your face and it takes a little work to get off being that it sinks into the lines of your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good product that I will definitely buy again and also try other colors.</li>

    <li> BEST BLACK EVER.. SMELLS LIKE CAKE! Wore out to the club and didnt need to reapply for the 5 hours I was there.  Doe Deere has done it again!</li>
    <li> I like it so far considering it is my first black lipstick. You gotta apply it a few time to get the full on black affect.</li>
    <li> Opaque, creamy, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase. I have to write twelve more words for this review. Ok... There.</li>
    <li> I wish the aroma of the lipstick was a bit better, and that it was a tad smoother, but this is finally a lipstick with superb color which unlike blacks from other companies really shows up instead of being so sheer when applied that it disappears. This one produces the strong color desired and can be applied heavily to really show off the lips in about as much a sexy way as possible. It looks fantastic. It holds on well, but not too well, which is a major plus.</li>
    <li> This product may be expensive, but it is totally worth it.

    <li> I LOVE this lipstick. It&#x27;s has a great pigment and I MUST get other colors! I totally recommend this for anyone!</li>
