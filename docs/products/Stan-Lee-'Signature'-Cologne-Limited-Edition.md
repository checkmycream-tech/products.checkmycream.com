      <li>I was glad that I hadn&#x27;t planned it for a serious gift.</li>
      <li>Subtle, but sure to get an extra sniff and a comment from someone close!</li>

<li> hate to be so negative, because I adore Stan Lee.</li>
<li> Has whiffs of hackery, ego credit-hogging, lying in court, terrible cameos and even worse wigs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought it for my boyfriend (who is a HUGEE Stan Lee fan) last year for Christmas. We both love the smell of it so much that I bought it again for him this year! He smells like abhero with a hint of villany!</li>
    <li> Smells great perfect for any comic collector or spiderman fan.</li>
    <li> Smells like the mustache of a 90-year-old man. Five stars.</li>
    <li> smells great! have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this cologne. I had a lot of Christmas gifts shipped to my parents&#x27; house, and when I arrived, I immediately noticed a weird smell coming form the pile of boxes. After a lot of opening, I figured out that it was coming form the Stan Lee package. It was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever smelled those vending machine colognes in truck stops, you have a pretty good idea what this smells like. If I had to imagine the aroma of a 70&#x27;s swingers party, it&#x27;s this cologne - like incense, sweat, and musty shag carpeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to be so negative, because I adore Stan Lee. I just really didn&#x27;t like this cologne...and it wasn&#x27;t returnable.</li>
    <li> This is a scent that a mature man can wear without smelling like a GQ magazine sampler.  Subtle, but sure to get an extra sniff and a comment from someone close!</li>
    <li> This actually smells very good and manly! My husband got a huge kick out of it and enjoys wearing it daily. The scent is not too strong, which is offputting to me, but I think it lasts all day on him.</li>
    <li> The cologne was a gift for my son, the comic book geek.  The box had been opened and the bottle leaked.  I was glad that I hadn&#x27;t planned it for a serious gift.</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife loves the smell!</li>
    <li> It smells sooooo GOOD you have to get it.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT..... STAN LEE YOUR COLOGNE IS THE S@#%^ LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I was looking to order my boyfriend something for his birthday and he really loved the avengers cologne but I wanted to get him something different. I found the Stan lee one and was amazed at how many reviews it, and how quick it came. And it smells so damn good! I don&#x27;t know why I doubted Stan&#x27;s cologne (shame on me). He loves it and I love it.</li>
    <li> Greatest cologne ever! my boyfriend loved it and I will deffinetly be buying more!</li>
    <li> From the man who invented Batman, Sandman, The Watch Men and Captain America and Jack Ditko comes this fantastic fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Stan created this smell all on his own and it is 100% his creation with input from no-one else at all whatsoever apart from the people who designed the box, bottle and the actual liquid cologne itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. Has whiffs of hackery, ego credit-hogging, lying in court, terrible cameos and even worse wigs.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband since he is a big Marvel/Stan Lee fan.  I was somewhat nervous about buying it without being able to smell it first, and the description made it sound sort of spicy.  But when he wore it I absolutely loved it!  Not too spicy at all, really a very nice, sexy smell.  Not sure on how long the fragrance lasts though.</li>
    <li> Smells STANTASTIC! I think this is a fun gift for any Stan Lee fan! It smells great and Stan seemed to be having a blast when he was talking about it at New York Comic Con! Great holiday gift for men of all ages as it is just strong enough with layers of cedar and just enough citrus. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Brought for my husband he&#x27;s a big marvel fan. Everyone loves it his coworkers ask him what&#x27;s he wearing and where he got it from. I had to buy it again for him this year.</li>
    <li> Just as I dreamed it would be</li>
    <li> I bout this the first time when I went to comikoziee and it smelled so good I had to buy it. And when I found it on amazon I had to buy a back up just in case.</li>
    <li> My son LOVED this! Great fragrance for men</li>
    <li> Who knew this even existed for my Stan Lee fan!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews on amazon about how good this smelled i had to get it. The first time i smelled it, it didn&#x27;t seem like it was as good as everyone had said it was but it was still had a great scent to it. The only real problem i had with this was that the black box it was in was a little damaged but other than that it was alright.</li>
    <li> Pleased with the product itself, but the box the cologne came in was pretty beat up looking and obviously had already been opened.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son.He loves it.</li>
