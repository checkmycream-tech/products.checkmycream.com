      <li>BUT I love this soap!</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and lathers very well.</li>
      <li>I initially liked the smell, but then read a review comparing it to bubble gum.</li>

      <li>I honestly thought this was going to work for me</li>
      <li>The smell of this soap is kind of obnoxious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this soap.  Gentle.  Although it&#x27;s too expensive on Amazon--can find it for less at other stores.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> It leaves a residue on your towels and washrags. Not a good idea. Too bad, the other kind (liquid) is better.</li>
    <li> Makes me break out in cysts.</li>
    <li> Light, natural, barely-there scent--not too odorous. Slight bit of something for exfoliating rough bits. Useful amount of lather, not crazy-artificial amounts. Slow-dissolving. A late-winter find for my skin, which gets a bit ruddy where uncovered and very pale where covered.</li>
    <li> I was inspired to buy this by the movie Annie Hall.... Iv been using it for a little less than a week and LOVE it!! I am always having skin trouble and this has been clearing my skin up beautifully so far. Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> The soap works great for me. The smell is reminiscent of bubblegum, which I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m a fan because not only does it &amp;#34;kill&amp;#34; pimples before they can really form, it also got rid of a hugely annoying cystic zit that was recurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bar lasts a loooooong time. I&#x27;m still using the same bar I bought eight months ago. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but every other day (to give my skin a break), and it makes my skin feel really clean and soft after I wash it off. Then I moisturize with a light moisturizer (Oil of Olay, fragrance free) and that&#x27;s kept my skin nice and issue-free.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. I bought this at Ulta for $4.99 and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I had very oily skin and my acne has been progressively getting worst with pimples popping up everyday and cystic acne forming on both my cheeks. I was on the hunt for black soap when I read about it since regular store acne facial cleansers doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore. I found a few that I was interested in buying here at amazon, but they either come as an add on or in bulk but I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on something that I might end up not liking so I tried my luck in looking for it in stores. This soap smells good, not too strong and disappears in a few minutes. Makes my skin feel clean and tight without over drying it. I&#x27;ve been using this everyday, morning and night and it has really helped in controlling my breakouts and cystic acne (I still get them but not as big as they used to be and not as often anymore). This soap is bigger than the average soap so i cut it up into 3 pieces and so far 1/3 of the soap has lasted me for over a month (im still using it actually). On a side note, I once washed my face twice with this in one go and it stung like crazy on the second wash so I washed it off right away though it feels fine in one wash. Also, I&#x27;ve been taking various products and vitamins now which might also contribute to my skin getting better.</li>
    <li> this soap has done nothing for my skin. There&#x27;s no difference whatsoever. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again. It&#x27;s also quite large and lasts a long time, which are the positives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its doing much for my skin,  especially my face. But Im an asian woman who has developed dark under arms from shaving instead of plucking and this soap bar is magical! I&#x27;ve only used this soap for a week and it has already reduced the dark coloration by more than 50%  I&#x27;ve been struggling using loofas with different soap bars to reduce the darkness as hard as i can scrub but none has worked.</li>
    <li> This soap caused my skin to become very dry and I developed a burn mark on my nose. Just be aware of this soap!</li>
    <li> This soap didnt work out. It just made my face worse.</li>
    <li> This soap moisturizes well but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in clearing acne. Some people have mentioned they enjoy the smell but I can&#x27;t stand it - like a combination of bubblegum and fruit punch flavored medicine. I smell it on my skin for about an hour after showering and it bothers me so much I&#x27;ll have to discontinue.</li>
    <li> Love this soap but you can buy it for $5 at Walgreens. Smells great strips the oils from your face, which is good if you have bangs. If it dries your face skip a day of cleaning. First week will peel your face after that, no worries. Bought one and gave my friend half. I cut my half into another half&#x3D; I used 1/4 of it in about 2 months, also used it on chest and back to get rid of my bacne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but this isn&#x27;t really African black soap. Real African black soap is NOT BLACK it&#x27;s a medium to dark brown, you can see the organic material in it, and it&#x27;s a little soft. Not really soft but soft enough that when you push your finger hard into it, it sinks in some. If this works for you then great! But just know this isn&#x27;t traditional African black soap, they added dye and Lord knows what else in this</li>
    <li> This product has saved me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin, and now that I&#x27;m in my 20s, I started developing a lot of closed comedones, making my complexion bumpy no matter what. I tried peels, facial washes, scrubs, and manual exfoliation. I use this twice a day, tone/treat my pimples and affected areas with hydrogen peroxide, and then put on neosporin and olay daily moisturizer. It started working within a week I could see much improvement. I&#x27;m about 6 weeks in now and only a few marks remain. Closed comedones have drastically improved, and I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a natural and cost effective treatment!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this bar of soap (Shea Moisture African Black Soap: Face and Body Acne bar); however, I did not notice any change in regards to face and body acne. In fact, I got acne while using this bar of soap (not from the soap, mind you - I don&#x27;t think!). I know that acne is caused due to many factors including diet and lifestyle, so the acne part of this soap did not do any good for me. I did feel clean and refreshed after using it though! Perhaps this soap would work on other skin types. (My face is oily and not really sensitive.)</li>
    <li> Good soap, nice smell. Overall nice product.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!!! Do not use with washcloths you care about, as it will discolor them. My crisp white washcloths are now a dingy grey. 😕 I bought grey washcloths to use with this soap and that&#x27;s the ticket.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I have black spots on my chest from acne and scratching. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a week and the spots are slowly fading. The scent is amazing as well, not overpowering just a light fragrance that lingers on you ever after you are done using it. The bar is huge, it can last for about 2 months the only con is that it leaves a gray tint on the bottom of the shower when you are done but it can easily come off.</li>
    <li> Melted in the shower after just a couple uses. You&#x27;re better off with Skin Diver Bamboo Charcoal soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful! I never want to leave home without it. It keeps my skin soooooooooo soft and moist. I hate to see it go! I bought two bars. Going to have to re-up soon. They last a good little while just don&#x27;t leave it in the shower cause someone may be tempted to use it. This is my personal not for family.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this soap is for my skin type. I&#x27;m so happy that I recently discovered this brand because their hair and body products are amazing. I ended up purchasing the whole facial kit which contains the mask, moisturizer, toner (forgot if this is included), scrub, and bar soap from Target for $19.00 (GREAT deal). I have combo skin (oily forehead, dry cheeks) and after I use the bar my face feels EXTREMELY dry, like I don&#x27;t even want to blink my eyes, then when I use the moisturizer of course I feel okay, but I think this soap dried out my eyes because I&#x27;ve never had dry eyes. My face does feel clean though! But more dry than normal. No break outs or anything but I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. It&#x27;s only been about a week and a half so I&#x27;m going to give this a few more weeks before I move on to something else. They have a raw shea collection as well as a coconut and hibiscus collection which will probably work better for my skin type, so I def plan on trying those out (there&#x27;s a raw shea facial system on Target&#x27;s website for $19 also) Hope this review helped! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and btw it lathers great and has a nice soothing, not so strong smell. I placed it in a soap container right away so that I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues with staining or anything so had no issues with that either.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. At first I was skeptical because I didn&#x27;t see anything but as the days went on boom results. It&#x27;s a huge bar so it&#x27;s been lasting me for a month now and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Suffered from acne as a teenager and am experiencing some adult acne as I get older--I so wish I would have found this soap as a teenager because after a week of regular use, this has already noticeably helped clear up my skin!! Amazing product. I&#x27;ve fallen in love with Shea Moisture as of late because their products are very high quality and as a bonus they are even made in the USA! Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying this soap, especially if you&#x27;re suffering from acne.</li>
    <li> I love that this soap has helped with my itchy skin. It leaves the skin feeling super clean...but in a different way than Aveeno. I will purchase this again...love the results!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Removes all make up and it smells great too</li>
    <li> Great for the skin! I felt very cleaning sheet showering with this product...however, beware this will stain your shower! Probably best to use as a facial wash only in the sink.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff! Purchased at Walrgreens (cheaper there than on Amazon w/your Walgreens card)  I have acne prone skin and this has really helped I will be recommending to everyone in family because it works so well!</li>
    <li> This soap is a definite buy if you want your face clean. This soap leaves NOTHING behind! I strongly suggest, whether you have oily, dry, Combo skin whatever, to use a natural oil after washing with this because it strips the skin of not just the dirt and bacteria, but the natural oils as well. Use a coconut oil or almond oil after, these oils you can sleep with on your skin because they aren&#x27;t heavy and your skin will soak it up very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product. My favorite brand of Black Soap out there. It smells wonderful and lathers very well. I use it on my face, body and hair.</li>
    <li> Soap made my sensitive skin itch.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best soap. I recently was told to buy this face soap. I was so happy that I did. It makes your face feel fresh and clean. It does not leave behind a greasy feeling. It is great for acne prone skin. Pair it with their moisturizer and you are set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and this soap is amazing and it has thoroughly cleared my skin of any acne and prevents any from returning. Also, this soap last for months and for the price and effectiveness is the best deal you can find for the results it provides. However, it should be paired with the daily facial wash, as it does  exfoliate skin which helps clear up complexion, remove dead skin, and even out skin tone.</li>
    <li> Ok I RARELY write a review on Amazon, but I have to for this. I have suffered from annoying, mild acne my whole life and have been literally praying for a solution. And finally, I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but decided to try it for at least four weeks. After four weeks, my skin has cleared up almost perfectly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I clean once or twice a day. I just get my fingers wet, rub the top of the bar and lather it onto my face and rinse, and that&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m still looking for something else to make my skin look bright and fresh as I have noticed it looks dull without makeup, but at least this took care of my pimples! I highly recommend. And stick it out for at least a month cleaning twice a day, don&#x27;t expect results so fast or else you&#x27;ll miss out on how great this product works!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels really good when I put it on. But leaves my skin feeling excessively tight once washed off. Also, didn&#x27;t help with my acne as much as I was anticipating</li>
    <li> Went to Ulta on Saturday praying they had this because I hate waiting for products. And they DID! I picked up the last one on the self! Started using at soon as I got home and today is Monday I woke up and all the redness in my minor acne is gone! Let&#x27;s pray it helps control my breakouts before my 21st birthday!</li>
    <li> I stopped using a very popular and expensive brand acne wash, for this product!!! It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and clean, will not cause any excessive dryness or peeling. Smells wonderful and you can see the difference pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing soap. My skin is in love</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. My acne has been ongoing for about 5 years but got significantly worse when I went off of birth control a year ago. I&#x27;ve tried everything OTC, pills, and even the &#x27;no-wash&#x27; method. So when I stumbled on this I was hoping and praying that it would work. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t. However, I continued to use it just because it has no harsh chemicals, never once dried out my face, and overall had a good effect on my face (other than not making my acne any better). I&#x27;m so happy for the people that had it work for them. And I say give it a try because if nothing else, it will give your face a nice break from the harsh chemicals of other acne treatments. When I first got it, I gave a piece to my 7 year old niece who was getting weird breakouts on her face, and it didn&#x27;t work for her either.&lt;br /&gt;It is very messy like other reviewers have said. I got a dish for it to sit in so it would mess up my tub, but the dish is really quite nasty looking.&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that most of my acne is not cystic or whiteheads. Its mainly just blackheads and those annoying clogged pore bumps that cover pretty much my whole face. So maybe if you have more active acne it will work better for you.</li>
    <li> Such a disappointing product. Against my better judgement, I trusted the reviews and purchased this awful product. NOT sensitive skin friendly, despite what others have said! Painful red bumps appeared on my face after using this for less than a week. Stopped using this and I&#x27;m still waiting for the irritation to subside. I gave it two stars instead of one, because I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different. However, still extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I picked this up from Walgreen for $5.99 which isn&#x27;t a bad price. And this bar of soap is heavenly I&#x27;m 24 1/2 and I don&#x27;t have acne anymore but the scarring on my cheeks still remains and that&#x27;s been a insecurity of mines. I can say I have purchased a lot of drug store products (clean n clear, Nuetrogena etc) they are good but but this is great my scarring is going away and AND it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out the smell is vibrant :).) omg I aactually didn&#x27;t know you can use it on body Fyi will do asap. Never get rid of the PLEASE. Thank you #sheamoisture</li>
    <li> Started use on Saturday night, it is Wednesday morning. I had 4 or 5 painful cystic bumps that had been there a few weeks, I now only have 1 of those! Also my skin is a lot calmer and even toned! I&#x27;m excited about this after trying high end, low end, and everything in between to control my adult post partum breakouts!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial soap I have ever used.  Acne is finally under control and it does not iritate my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Ok...I bought this soap at the grocery store for 5 dollars,I have acne prone skin so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. For starters,the bar itself is massive! Definitely a good idea to cut it in half,for a 5 dollar price tag you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth. Second,it WILL leave your shower black. Even though it washes away pretty easily it&#x27;s still something to think about if you have a white shower. Lastly,I&#x27;d advise anyone with sensative skin to NOT use the bar itself on your body,the organic exfoliating content in it is very harsh,it actually cut my skin a little. I&#x27;d recommend just suding up the bar in your hands and lather the suds on your body. When I used the bar itself on my body my skin got very red. I do love the smell though and the ingredients and once I just used the suds on my skin it didn&#x27;t irritate,felt really refreshing. I might buy this again as its my first time using it,hopefully it helps relax my acne issues.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I used this product exclusively as a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Pleasant licorice scent that lasts for a while. I&#x27;ve often been complimented on it.&lt;br /&gt;+ Take before and after pictures with this. It rejuvenates your face and makes it glow. My face actually feels clean which is a feeling I&#x27;ve never gotten from most face washes.&lt;br /&gt;+ I&#x27;ve never had serious problems with acne/pimples, but get them on occasion. Having used this twice a day, it has aided in clearing up my face.&lt;br /&gt;+ It doesn&#x27;t have a laundry list of ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pretty expensive so I use it exclusively as a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to properly rinse and ensure that the soap does not remain on your body when you dry off because it will stain your towel and leave it with grey blotches.</li>
    <li> I could have saved hundreds, if not thousands of dollars had I found this soap sooner!  This soap cleared my plaque psoriasis in less than two weeks!!! I don&#x27;t even use it everyday and the psoriasis has not returned. Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a wonderful product.  I will take the discolored wash rags, soap scum whatever the negatives people have over my embarrassing psoriasis any day of the week. To me it smells good and washes out of shower pretty easy.  100% recommend.  Have already stocked up and will repurchase.  I buy mine at walgreens for 4.99. If you have been suffering like me (20+yrs) with psoriasis just give it a shot.  Way less expensive and toxic to your body then the next meds your doctor will try.</li>
    <li> I think I really enjoy soaps and lotions cause I was pretty excited to try this out! I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about it being wonderful for the skin. First, the packaging is very chic and simple. I think it&#x27;s attractive and appealing when products &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; nice. It smells lovely, kind of a fruity licorice maybe? Haha, anyways, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger but it smells refreshing in the shower. The 8oz bar is ridiculously big and very awkward to use. I got the larger one to get more bang for my buck, but its almost too big. I lather it up on my scrubby sponge thing and it works just great. Just enough suds and wonderful in place of shaving cream. I use shea alot, making my own lotions and salves, so I knew shea is very velvety and soft, and this soap is true to form. My face is very soft and the little skin bumps are all but gone. My arms and legs felt very soft, even without lotion after. Overall, I love this new soap, but I think I&#x27;ll cut it into manageable chunks. &#x27;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/28/2015:&lt;br /&gt;After just 4 days of use, I noticed my red patches are significantly less so. Whoop! Very happy with this soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap! Really clears up your skin.</li>
    <li> I like this for getting rid of acne but does it really have to dry my face out so badly that it hurts!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it . I recommend it to everyone that have acne or dry skin you gonna love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so many different acne treatments for my son&#x27;s acne and NOTHING helped like the African Black Soap. Within 4 DAYS his face was baby smooth again. Love it....</li>
    <li> Let me just start this off by saying this soap smells awful! I don&#x27;t know about you but when I use soap one of my main intentions is to smell good after I use it. This smell is just off putting I had to use another soap on top of it just to get rid of the smell and that defeats the purpose I feel like. I do love that it is all natural and believe it probably works well for acne, just not dry skin. Personally my dry skin felt a little dryer and I saw no improvement after a week of using it with a rash that has developed on my arm (which I had hoped the soap would help). So all and all decent product but not worth the price because of the awful scent it has.</li>
    <li> My skin is literally glowing now!! Everyone has noticed also. I wash my face with the soap. Then put on my illumask. Then apply the African Black Soap Lotion. It&#x27;s the best lotion ever.</li>
    <li> During the pregnancy of my second child I experienced quite a bit of acne. Little bumps appeared on my neck and the side of my face causing a lot of scars. I&#x27;m not one to wear make up and I enjoy just having my face bare. A few days after giving birth I decided to look for an African Black soap. Being West Indian I believe in the benefits of natural products. I came across Shea Moisture African Black Soap and based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. I used this in the shower on my body and face. Afterwards, I moisturize my face with organic coconut oil (I use coconut oil for my hair as well and I will use it for the rest of my life). This soap has done such a great job I no longer have acne and the scars are disappearing. Prior to buying this soap I was very frustrated because some facial products may work for a little while and then become the cause of my breakouts. It was not the case with this soap. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling moisturized but a bit dry. Overall, I will continue to buy this soap. I&#x27;m very happy and thankful I gave it a try</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Walgreens about a week ago and I absolutely love it paired with my asepxia moisturizing bar soap. My acne and some of my scars have gone away</li>
    <li> i have acne. I bought this soap because it does not contain any perfume and any chemicals. It smoths out my skin and does not irritate my skin. I love this soap. I personally recommend this soap to all the people with sensitive skin and people who are suffering from acne. Good luck</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so hard to find now at Target. Every time I check our nearby store, they are out of stock! I was using Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser which cleaned my skin well and left it soft but did nothing for my acne. I still use it in the morning, but use the charcoal soap at night after taking off all my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My older sister said she was using an african charcoal soap so that&#x27;s why I thought I&#x27;d try this one out. I have used two of these bar soaps so far on my face and my face was the clearest it has been in years. My acne is hormonal by the way for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ran out and can&#x27;t find it at the store. My cheeks and chin have begun to break out again after a good 8 months of clear skin and healed acne scars. I was trying to be cheap and avoid shipping charges from buying online but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve used all kinds of acne skin care products, even ProActive. None have worked for me the way this charcoal soap has. I guess more natural products are the better route for hormonal acne ( which was confirmed by a dermatologist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am still using this soap, and it is the only soap I use on my face. Use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and mild and works very nice. Top shelf product, no doubt. Best part, no chemicals to enter your body!</li>
    <li> Great natural and cruelty-free facial cleanser.  Deep cleans while not overly drying (as most bars are). I had some hormonal acne prior to using this soap, and I noticed some reduction in my that-time-of-the-month acne. Nothing dramatic, but it was definitely as good or better than other cleansers I had been paying a fortune for.  Note:  I got this for less than $5 at Walgreens (not sure if they were running a special or if Amazon&#x27;s price is on the high side).  Either way, it will last me forever and works better than others I&#x27;ve tried at five times the price.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing!!!! This soap is the best thing that every happen to my face, never thought in a million years that i will find a soap that agree with my skin. never use soap on my face because i could not find one, now that i did, i will always use it. (Please Shea Moisture never stop making this product it is the best every).</li>
    <li> This soap does not do anything for my skin.  I actually experienced more break outs since using it.</li>
    <li> I was using fair and white african black soap which worked SO WELL but decided to give this soap a try when my fair and white finished/ using this soap my face started to develop pimples  out of no where! i started developing small bumps along my chin and pimples on my forehead and cheek. realizing this i sttopped using this product and went back to my FAIR AND WHITE african black soap. now the pimples that developed from shea mosture are now good and my face is smoothing out again. i will never buy this product again and defnittley would not recomend this product to any body. instead i recommend the FAIR AND WHITE AFRICAN BLACK SOAP my skin has been getting a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap. I use it exclusively on my face (I use the liquid form for body wash) and use it a minimum of every other day. I have nothing negative to say. I can&#x27;t really say whether my skin has improved since using it, but I certainly like it. The scent took me a little while to get used to, and there&#x27;s little bits of something within the soap that could possibly be exfoliating if the bar was applied directly to the skin, however, I don&#x27;t use it in that manner so I see no benefits to it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this soap, it makes my skin feel great, and I like to think that I&#x27;m doing something to improve it (even if I&#x27;m not actually seeing results!)</li>
    <li> This is the only non antibacterial soap that keeps my underarm odor in check.</li>
    <li> This is a good soap, and I like this company&#x27;s products in general. However, I think that the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus is a much better soap for me. Plus this black soap stains my shower! The grey-black residue does scrub away easily, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I just think that the Coconut soap is the best - much better than this one!</li>
    <li> I picked this soap up at Wal-Mart a week ago and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I had just finished a bar of another popular brand of black soap, and was about to go in &amp;quot;panic mode&amp;quot; because I kept forgetting to go to the hair supply store and pick it up and going back to regular bath soap was definitely not an option! It costs a little more but it is so worth it! My stretch marks are fading quickly and this is a huge plus since I&#x27;m losing weight. Also my complexion is becoming even and my once scaly hands are now soft with a beautiful cocoa tone....lol. My knees were dark and now they are lighter....and last but not least, I have a luminous glow all over. I love the sweet scent, rich lather and everything about this product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok in comparison to other Shea Moisture products that I have tried... Smells like bubblegum.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference with me personally.  Kept my skin drier, but my pores were harder to keep clean over my previous Neutrogena facial soap.  This is something that will vary widely person to person though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Universally applicable though: It will stain lighter color washcloths, left a stain on my tub where water would drip off it, and the scent is S-T-R-O-N-G!  It smells good, but it dominated my drafty 950 square foot apartment for several weeks and was overwhelming in the bathroom at first.  The UPS guy even commented on the scent once when dropping off a package..they could definitely ease up on the fragrance!</li>
    <li> A good soap, all natural. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was super excited to buy this because I heard it removes every trace of makeup and prevents acne. I tried it for almost 2 weeks and it has made me break out these painful red cystic acne that I didn&#x27;t have before. I know my skin and when a product works for me...it helps clear my acne and prevent it. I don&#x27;t really purge and if I do it isn&#x27;t inflammed acne that feels like it&#x27;s going to start growing a family of it&#x27;s own. I really appreciate them for trying but I read online that true african black soap isn&#x27;t dyed black, it&#x27;s an earthy color and smells earthy. This freakin&#x27; smells like a urinal with the fruty scent to stop it from smelling like pure piss...yup. I love the company they&#x27;re great, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. If you have recently recovered from acne and your skin is still really sensitive to products especially new ones, don&#x27;t try this unless your face is clear and you are just looking to try things. It wasn&#x27;t for me, everyone is different, maybe it&#x27;ll work for you but it didn&#x27;t for me. Sorry Shea Moisture, I am giving my honest review.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Shea Moisture African Black Soap Bar from a local store.  I purchased this product because I read that African Black Soap can reduce redness and alleviate the symptoms of breakouts.  I use it on my face only.  I do agree that this soap does not have a pleasant smell, but I follow it with the Coconut Hibiscus Bar which smell a lot better.  Using these two products in combination with the Olive Green Tea Lotion (full body use) have transformed my skin.  My heartbreaking breakouts have significantly improved.  When I started to use the African Black Soap I had blemishes and existing bumps.  I started using this product a little over a week ago, and I have no new bumps and all traces of the initial problem no longer exist.  I do believe; however, the blemishes were reduced with the use of the Coconut Hibiscus Bar as it has brightening properties.  Also the Olive Green Tea Lotion has reduced signs of aging, such as crows feet and laugh lines.  I complete this regimen twice daily:  African Black Soap, Coconut Hibiscus, and the Olive Green Tea Lotion using cold water.  I hope this review helps because this product helped me.  Thank you for your time. ---Tina---</li>
    <li> Great product, makes my skin feel clean a oil free. So far so good. This soap feels great! Wish I would have heard about this soap years ago.</li>
    <li> Originally bought this for my eczema which I have everywhere. I did not really see a difference with the way my skin felt according to my eczema. However I did use it on my face day and night and it has been the only thing to clear up my skin! I&#x27;ve had bad acne since I was 13 (now 21) and have been to many different dermatologists. FINALLY something that works for me! I had stopped using it for about a week and a half because I wanted to see if this acne scar fader would help but I realized that I was getting acne again and by using this soap bar, my acne was gone within two days. I love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is that of artificial bubblegum. I don&#x27;t find that very pleasant but that is the only real downside of it.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this product but I just found too many things wrong with it. I purchased this on a whim at Walgreens. I thought Shea Moisture has a pretty good reputation for their products so why not? I have used raw African black soap before. Genuine black soap isn&#x27;t actually the color black. It looks more like a big brown, gritty, sandy rock and it&#x27;s very hard until contact with water then it almost kind of melts down and softens. It suds very, very easily and very heavily with no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was surprised when I first opened the packaging at home, to find that this bar of soap is actually black. And the ingredients says African black soap *BASE* as the first ingredient. This lead me to think it&#x27;s not entirely African black soap, but an additive. When I used it for the first time I noticed immediately that it lathers very differently from real black soap. The lather is a dark gray color ...maybe from the palm ash? Or maybe dye? Not sure why the suds are gray, but real black soap does not do that. The next thing was the scent. I couldn&#x27;t really describe it before I read reviews on here that compared it to a urinal cake and that&#x27;s pretty accurate. The smell of this soap is kind of obnoxious. Real black soap lacks much of a scent. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. Spend your money on raw African black soap and leave this stuff alone. It&#x27;s not worth the price and it should not be marketed as true black soap.</li>
    <li> I actually like this soap so far. Yes it will dirty up the tub but not being lazy with a magic eraser cures this problem. The smell I actually like it&#x27;s light and goes well with my hemp cucumber lotion and isn&#x27;t overpowering in the shower. Price wasn&#x27;t a issue for me I wanted to see how it help with my face issues and so far it&#x27;s looking better and feels great :)</li>
    <li> causes no irritation,feels natural,lathers well. I recommend it to people with sensitive skin and to those,who are tired of salicylic acid containing products</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. Makes my skin smooth and love how it cleanses my face.</li>
    <li> I have had acne every since my early teens. I have tried numerous products and been left disappointed. However upon trying this product I was surprised at the results. I use this soap twice a day and I have seen a great improvement.The smell of the soap is not bad, almost like candy, but its not to strong and doesn&#x27;t linger around for a long time. The acne that I had on my cheeks and chin are going away and my face is all around clearer. I would recommend this product however I would also suggest to use a dark wash cloth since I noticed that this soap can leave a black stain.</li>
    <li> moisturizing and exfoliating- great for winter skin!</li>
    <li> So I actually got this from Walgreens believe it or not haha.  I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child now and my acne got really bad (as it did with my first) and it was so awful. All over my back and chest. ): I seriously tried everything from buying things off amazon that people swore by, even proactive. So within like 2 or 3 days I noticed a TREMENDOUS difference! This stuff is seriously amazing :D and it&#x27;s totally affordable and lasts a super long time. I love that it&#x27;s all natural. The only thing I noticed was that it is a little bit drying but other than that I give it 10 stars!</li>
    <li> Smells Great &amp; Doesn&#x27;t dry my face out like my last brand of AFB</li>
    <li> does. not. work. save your money for the real thing.</li>
    <li> ah man, this soap cleared my acne scars in a week. i stopped using it after that. i only use it when i have really bad breakouts</li>
    <li> Ditto Ditto Ditto from my other reviews of Shea Moisture products.  I love the soap, the large size it comes in, and that the scent not only lingers on me but in my bathroom as well.  There are several comments knocking the price of the soap and saying its cheaper at Target or Walmart.  It is cheaper because the bar of soap at those retailers is smaller, 3oz compared to the 8oz sold online.  That is the reason for the price difference.  The retailers don&#x27;t often have the 8oz size in stock.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this soap for himself &amp; he says he likes it because of the smell. He constantly gets ingrown hairs &amp; says this soap didn&#x27;t give him any noticeable difference. I used it too once &amp; was a little weird-ed out when it produced dark grey bubbles. LOL. But it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with a strange and intense bout of acne, and this was the only product that made a noticeable difference. I personally enjoy the smell, which I think is fairly mild.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product twice from Target and will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original skin-care regimen of Apricot facial scrub w/2% salicylic acid, Aveeno face wash weith 2% salicylic acid, and Proactiv Repairing Lotion was expensive but was the best solution for my acne prone skin.  I have since been able to replace the Aveeno &amp; the Proactiv with this SheaMoisture African Black Soap used in tandem with the apricot facial scrub (a Walgreens generic brand).  The SheaMoisture African Black Soap removes the oil perfectly, calms the skin, and has helped me be blemish free for over a month. Even though it has shea butter, it still leaves my face feeling AND looking dry and tight.  I therefore use a 3rd product (Mary Kay Emolient Cream) to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is my exact regimen which is yielding even better results than my original regimen that had more expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face twice a day (after I wake up in the morning and before I go to bed at night). Each time I wash, I use both the facial scrub and SheaMoisture African Black Soap. The secret to maintaining a healing and moisturized face is to add a dab or Mary Kay Emolient cream either to the apricot scrub or to the SheaMoisture African Black Soap and then cleanse as normal. I alternate between which one I use the emolient with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mornings:&lt;br /&gt;Wash face normally with SheaMoisture African Black Soap and then rinse thoroughly. Then I squeeze a dab of Apricot Facial Scrub into my hand along with a dab of Mary Kay Emolient Cream and mix it together. Then I apply the mixture to my face and gently rub into my face as one would usually do with a facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evenings:&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face gently with Apricot Facial Scrub and rinse thoroughly.  Then I lather some SheaMoisture African Black Soap into my hand.  I Add a dab of Mary Kay Emolient Cream into the lather and mix it up thoroughly.  I cleanse my face with the mixture as normal making sure I have a good thick lather, cleansing my whole face and neck for about a minute or two. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I also wash my hair with SheaMoisture African Black Soap (by itself)  and then follow-up with a moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback of this soap is that it leaves a black film or residue in the shower or on the sink. This is easily wiped away with a cleaning cloth.ve a good thick lather, cleansing my whole face and neck for about a minute or two. Rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I also wash my hair with SheaMoisture African Black Soap (by itself)  and then follow-up with a moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback of this soap is that it leaves a black film or residue in the shower or on the sink.

    <li> $4.99 on Shea Moisture dot com</li>
    <li> First of all, this soap can be purchased for 4 or so dollars at walmart. I was excited to see black soap at walmart, how convenient! I hadn&#x27;t used black soap in a while and realized how great it would be to have some again because of my pregnancy body acne breakouts I am experiencing.  However, I was skeptical to the quality because, well, it is walmart. I have used good black soaps in the past and swear by then for sensitive, problem skin. The night I bought it I used it in the shower, first thing I noticed is how, well, black it is. Surely dyed. I have bought authentic bulk black soap imported out of africa and higher end brand black soaps, and they are more of an earthy dark brown. The suds are gray- again, surely dyed. The smell is strong and seems very artificial, although not necessarily unpleasant... this one rang an alarm for me because heavily fragranced products are a nono for sensitive or problem skin. Lo and behold, once I got out of the shower I fell into a pretty terrible itch-fest that lasted a while, assumedly from the fragrance. That being said, it did leave my skin feeling pretty smooth and nice, but after two or three uses I tossed it and decided to go to the whole foods store to pick up a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone who doesn&#x27;t have very sensitive skin who is not familiar with nicer black soap might be satisfied with this product, but that is the only customer I can imagine would give this a positive rating. If you are looking for the real benefits of african black soap I&#x27;d suggest Out of Africa or maybe Nubian Heritage, both of which are available at whole food stores and some of the bigger natural product/vitamin stores.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING! My face completely cleared up within 4 days! COMPLETELY! It makes my skin feel really soft, and it smells like cookies! I&#x27;d reccommend it to anyone with acne.</li>
    <li> been using for about a month last a long time and seems to clean skin very different than regular soap.</li>
    <li> This soap has helped my acne prone skin ever since beginning use. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry. My skin feels so soft after using it as well. It also smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a problem skin treatment pack at Target. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. It contained this soap, a moisturizer, facial scrub, and mask. I didn&#x27;t experience the radical instant clearing of my skin that other reviewers encountered, but my skin did start to clear up after a few weeks. My acne is now about the same as when I use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but my skin is soft and moist, not dried out, red, and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that this soap smells a bit like a urinal cake (and now I can&#x27;t scrub that image out of my mind when I use it!). It is all natural, from the ingredient list, so it isn&#x27;t chemicals that cause it, but it still is a bit bothersome. My favorite thing in the pack by far is the moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t see it on Amazon, nor did I find the pack as a whole, but I highly recommend the moisturizer.  I like the mask, though I don&#x27;t know if it makes a huge difference or not. I find the soft beads in the facial scrub somewhat useless, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did this different, I would buy a different brand of black soap, and use the Shea Moisture problem skin moisturizer on top, then maybe use the mask once a week. I think the moisturizer is the gem of their problem skin line.</li>
    <li> This soap is very moisturizing and great for the winter months.  The bar lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t get gross like traditional soaps.  Be warned, with white tubs you might notice a darker buildup due to the color of the soap.  No big deal though.</li>
    <li> My daughter is enjoying how her face feels after washing with this soap, she doesn&#x27;t know if it is actually helping her acne.</li>
    <li> Perfect for heavy acne</li>
    <li> i like the fact that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients........but OMG i have never seen so much soap scum in my life.  for a natural product i don&#x27;t know why there is so much soap scum.  is it because the black soap scum is more visible....idk.  i have other natural soaps and it doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum.  i just couldn&#x27;t deal with it.  i will NEVER buy this product again.  i would&#x27;ve given it one star but i don&#x27;t wanna be too harsh since it is a natural product. sorry but this was a horrible soap for me.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with ABS (African Black Soap), but I feel like it is not a realistic representation of what ABS is or what it can do for your skin. As another reviewer mentioned, this bar does have dye in it (the lather is grey) and authentic ABS does not have dye in it. Essentially, I feel like this particular ABS bar is a highly commercialized, watered down version. That&#x27;s why I call it a &amp;#34;soft introduction to ABS&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;I still continued to have the same amount of acne as I did before I tried this ABS bar. I feel like if I used a more authentic version of the soap, I would probably have more significant results. The shea butter in the bar did moisturize my skin and there was no residue left behind. (Residue left in finger nail beds is a HUGE red flag for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;This bar smells like black licorice. I am not much of a fan of black licorice (smell OR taste), but the scent does not linger on your skin after bathing with it. For that reason, I found the scent to be okay. It did not effect my willingness to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I would not buy this ABS bar again. I would like to try other brands. However, I am still giving Shea Moisture a shot and trialing some of their other soap bars (&amp;#34;Lavender &amp; Wild Orchid&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Raw Shea Butter&amp;#34;). Using these bars back to back, I will be looking to see if I notice that I am getting any other benefits that shea butter is known for (texture, tone, scar fading, etc).</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years.  If I stop and try to use something else the acne comes back. One bar goes a long way.  I usually ask my husband to cut the bar in half for me when I buy them.</li>
    <li> This soap is starting to clear up dark spots on my cheeks and forehead. It&#x27;ll take a good 3 week use to start seeing an ounce of results, but it works! It&#x27;ll probably clear up faster with a toner as well, but the soap works fine for me. It smells good and it&#x27;s not so harsh either. Here&#x27;s how I work it into my skin routine shown here: http://youtu.be/chws8Ojs1c0</li>
    <li> This soap is absolutely amazing, it&#x27;s unfortunate for the people it didn&#x27;t work for but for me and my girlfriend we are so grateful my friend recommended this. She suffers from cystic acne and has tried varies face washes and sensitive washes. But a friend of mine said this worked for his girl friend so I ordered some for her and then told her about it and she gave it a shot, within about two days she noticed an improvement weeks later most of her acne is gone, I started to use this because I live in the hot desert I&#x27;ve never had a problem with acne but during the summer I get a kind of oily face specifically my nose which causes some black heads, and when I use other face wash it cause irritation or acne because I have sensitive skin. This soap is great it took care of my summer oily face/nose/blackheads and is working well on my girlfriends acne; more then any other product and I&#x27;m so glad. I would recommend to anyone who is having problems with eczema or acne and even oily skin on their face. I did notice for me it doesn&#x27;t  happen to her my face became slightly dry but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of how it pulls and the gunk out. I just used face lotion it wasn&#x27;t severe, I use this every day now and she even started making a body wash with parts water and an old body wash bottle. The best part is no chemicals!</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from acne but I do get break outs here and there, especially around that time of month. Anyways, I have been using this soap for about a week now and I can say that my skin looks great. I use it on my face and back. Smooth and clear, and the soap actually smells fantastic in my opinion.  The downside to this soap is that it really is quite drying. My back can handle it, but my face can not especially during the winter time when I have a weird problem of dry skin when my skin normally is on the oilier side during warmer seasons. I am still trying to figure out a good moisturizer to use that is also natural and light, because the soap may work great but a moisturizer alone can make a face break out, clog pores, along other things which kind of defeats the purpose of the soap&#x27;s properties. Given the drying out effects of the soap, a moisturizer is almost a must so I think that makes it a bit harder to review the soap by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I still love it though. I would recommend it to anyone as long as they know a moisturizer is in place after the wash.</li>
    <li> The smell of this soap is horrid and is also very strong and will fill the room. I had to re-bath 4 hours later to get the odor and film off of me. The soap is a moisture oriented soap. You can feel it on your skin hours after you bath. This is not what I expect from a soap of any type though I am sure someone would enjoy that film type feeling this soap leaves on one&#x27;s skin. I am shocked that anyone would consider the smell anything but sickening. In the trash this soap goes.</li>
    <li> When I saw this product in Target I thought I would give it a try since I love the  Shea Moisture brand. It said it could be used for getting rid of body acne and could also be used for acne prone skin of the face. When I used it in the shower it gave me a squeeky clean feeling and after a couple of days my bacne was gone. However when I used it on my face and neck, the next day my skin had broken out horribly. This is not to say that it will happen to everyone though. My skin is just very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Great product. The soap leaves your skin feeling soft and moist. Very good for problem skin</li>
    <li> My skin loves this soap.  I am 40 &amp; have somewhat oily skin.  I feel clean, without over-drying, after using it.</li>
    <li> The 4-pc set (sold at Target) was given to me by someone who received it as a gift and they did not want it. I&#x27;ve been a Dove facial care person for years, but, I have switched to using this product exclusively. I had no expectations or knowledge about the product. After a couple of months of use (only 1 bar of soap--that I&#x27;m still using--and the balancing moisturizer--I&#x27;ve not opened the other 2 items included), my skin is RADIANT, unblemished, and baby soft. I did not have severe acne. I would describe my &#x27;before&#x27; skin as blemished, especially around the chin; a few spots on the cheeks and even less on the forehead. I can&#x27;t remember my face feeling this way before. The moisturizer makes your skin feel velvety silk and gives it the look of having on a light foundation.  Makeup glides on more evenly when I use. I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct difference on the days that I use only Dove--not bad, just not as soft and no glow. I will continue to use these products and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have started using it as my facial soap and am amazed at how much clearer my skin is.</li>
    <li> As someone whose skin can&#x27;t tolerate salicylic acid and who has tried African soap in another brand, I was pretty eager to give this a try. On the first day, my skin seemed to be noticeably better and I was shocked to find such quick results. Since then, I have broken out in hives all over my face and have had them now for three days. These are the painful, red, Don&#x27;t-Touch-Me hives, not the simply ugly ones. The areas where my face hurts the most is where my face is usually the driest. As a result of the hiving, I&#x27;m beginning to question if all of the ingredients are as natural as the label would have me to believe. Regardless, I&#x27;m not here to bag on the product because it has done wonders for two of my cousins and my sister. If you do have sensitive skin, I&#x27;m telling you to be extremely cautious and perhaps try the product first on a different part of your body (chest or back), then slowly migrate to your face (forehead, then chin, then a cheek, and so on and so forth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To perhaps see if this post is related to you: I have sensitive skin and I have combination skin, where my cheeks and the area around my mouth are dry.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It helps with my daughter&#x27;s ezcema &amp; it also shrinks my large pores!</li>
    <li> As a soap I guess I would say it&#x27;s OK.  But there&#x27;s black dye in it that turns everything black.  It has such a strong perfume in it that makes it smell awful.  I would not suggest this to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased my bar from Walmarts for $4.99 after having it suggested by other skin psoriasis sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light lather that appears grey but washes off easily. It has a very luxe, silky feeling when washing and a pleasant scent that I found to be a bit stronger in the shower than when the soap is dry. It left my skin feeling silky and soft though I did still need to apply lotion afterwards since I have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it did help with any body acne I had on my back and helped ease the dry, itchy feeling of my skin psoriasis. I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive/trouble skin. It&#x27;s a great natural bar soap for the price!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and I also appreciate the clean non-chemical scent. The bars are hard milled and last a long time.&lt;br /&gt; Yes, these bars cost a bit more than the typical major brands, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m giving some small measure of support to a home grown African business. At least I hope I am.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the guy that uses whatever soap my wife happened to leave in the soap dish. That changed when we bought our first bar of African Black Soap. I&#x27;ve purchased dozens of bars in the last 2 years, but this one is my favorite. I don&#x27;t use it to treat any skin issues like many other reviewers say, but this soap leaves me feeling fresh in clean in a whole different way. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Deep cleans pores, can be used as a spot treatment, great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: $4.00 at Target, makes tub dirtier, drys out skin, makes skin itchy (for some people), do not use everyday, do not use on entire face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used this soap everything went great. It lathers GREAT and has a nice smell. It didnt make my skin dry on the first day but I put on lotion like I always do when im done bathing. The second day, I bathed with this soap again and this time my skin was dry. Im African American so my dry skin turned gray. I put on alot of lotion and the moisture still hasnt come back to my skin (5th day now). By day 3 I decided not use this soap again until the moisture came back in my skin. I figured its best to only use this soap once a week and not everyday. But the soap lathers so well, its presence is still in my bathing wash rag. All of it doesnt come out. Thats good if you like the soap. Me I want it out because it dried my skin. I also notices that the gray bubbles from the soap made my tub dirty. Its only me thats uses the tub so I only clean it once or twice a week. If you plan on using this soap you will need to clean the tub more than twice a week. By day 4, I noticed small breakouts on my legs like very smal pimples with little white stuff in it. I thought this was the soap just pushing out the dirt but it wasnt. I am now itchy all over the place. I did some research today and I found that African Black Soap itself makes some people itchy. So im either having an allergic reaction or a side effect that others experience with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all of this was going on I did get 2 pimples on my face. Not from the soap just acne from a chemical peel. So I used this soap as an ACNE SPOT TREATMENT. Just take one end of a q-tip, wet it a little, rub it against the soap and rub the pimple. Wet the other end of the q-tip and wet pimple to remove soap, pat dry add acne creams. THIS WORKS. And it might be the only reason why ill keep this soap. Both pimples were gone the next day. I wouldnt dare use this on my whole face because of how drying it was on my body and now my reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR FIRST TIMERS: Dont put this on your face, test it out by putting it on your body and see what happens.his soap. Both pimples were gone the next day. I wouldnt dare use this on my whole face because of how drying it was on my body and now my reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR FIRST TIMERS: Dont put this on your face, test it out by putting it on your body and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at walgreens.com for about 5 bucks, so i would recommend buying all Shea Moisture products from walgreens.com. BUT I love this soap! I have terrible psoriasis as well as MCS (multiple chemical syndrome) so basic hygiene and beauty products are just one awful experiment after another, they always make it worse or dont help at all; that is until i decided to try this amazing soap! It restored the moisture to my try skin, make my psoriasis calm and almost disapear, and over all just makes my skin feel amazing! No more painful showers or psoriasis for me! I use the entire line of African Black Soap products from shea moisture. Buy this if you have psoriasis or sensitivity to chemicals!</li>
    <li> I like this for it&#x27;s ability to help with acne. But, does it really have to be so drying that it hurts!!!!!</li>
    <li> both me and my friend have super sensitive skin.  He has cystic acne and rosacea, while i just have dermatitis.  This soap has been FANTASTIC for both of us.  its moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t strip off all the oil and calms the redness.  His face is clearing up and he&#x27;&#x27;s considering buying more products from this brand to clear up the rest of his body.  Citruses can be too strong for us, so its a challenge to find a soap that helps with acne and doesn&#x27;t leave us both flaking.  Best used with soft water, as hard water inhibits a good lather, and I don&#x27;t think it works as well.  Plus you are doing good by buying from them, what&#x27;s not to love????</li>
    <li> A friend recommended it, and I got it from Walgreen and its been just wonderful. Compared to some pricey products I have used, I am impressed with how my face is looking now. Almost spotless. Only downside is, stained my wash cloth. I guess black soap is black soap. The smell is fine.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after loving their moisture retention shampoo &amp; restorative conditioner on my fine, curly, blonde hair. I have been using this soap on my face twice a day for about a year. It has a mild fruity scent and is gentle enough for my 30-something sensitive skin,  and has cleared up my lifelong acne problem.  Do use a moisturizer, as it can be a bit drying if you already have drier skin, but is not irritating.</li>
    <li> I personally can&#x27;t use this on my face. Just know that your skin will more than likely not &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; when using this because it has no additives in it that a chemical face wash would so, if you are using it and start breaking out, you need to stop using this because you may be allergic to whatever is in it. Other than that, it is a good soap and makes my skin on my body feel soft and moisturized although, I still recommend lotion after use. The smell is okay. After using it for a while the smell agrees with me more. Shea Moisture products do have interesting smells. This one is a mixture or baby powder and bananas. Do a patch test if you&#x27;re going to use this on your face.</li>
    <li> The soap just isn&#x27;t for me. I started developing a few pimples and assumed it was part of the purging process - bringing everything up to the surface. But then more pimples started popping up in places I&#x27;d never had acne before and I started developing cystic acne along my jaw - also something new for me.  When I discontinued using the soap and switched to cetaphil, the acne that had developed went away. I&#x27;ve used lots of soap that hasn&#x27;t worked, but I&#x27;ve never had this adverse of a reaction.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap out because one of my friends raved about it. I never get razor burn when I use this soap; I used to get it all the time. It works wonderfully for getting rid of body acne, as well. I have very sensitive skin, and this is a rare product that doesn&#x27;t result in hives. I still need to use moisturizer after using this soap in the winter, however.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the smell. It&#x27;s light and clean, but still nice. I convinced my mother and father to switch to this soap as well, but my mother thinks the smell is bad and does not like the grey foam it can make. That doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, since it doesn&#x27;t leave a dark residue. I do not buy this soap on amazon, however, since the price is double what it is at local stores.</li>
    <li> I can not emphasize how much I adore this product. You would swear I work for the company. My back, shoulders, and face break out all the time and within a few days of use I can tell my skin is clearing up nicely. It isn&#x27;t drying either. Side note that I suffer from rosacea and this has helped with my redness and itchy skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who is a makeup artist suggested I try African Black soap for an acne problem I&#x27;ve had throughout my 20s. I picked this one up from target instead of the one she suggested (which is more of a paste than a hard soap) and I wish I had just gotten the one she recommended. This soap irritated my skin and made it more sensitive than ever and didn&#x27;t get rid of any acne. I&#x27;ve used the soap for three months now, so it&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t give it a chance. I won&#x27;t buy this a second time.</li>
    <li> Helps clear up minor blemishes. As good as most more expensive treatments but way less expensive. I could only find it on Amazon. Big name chain stores do not carry it.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend !</li>
    <li> Great soap has helped my son with his dry skin and ecsama  took 1 star off for price. I know it&#x27;s good but pricey</li>
    <li> I admit, the gray suds were a little strange!  But it&#x27;s no big deal once you get over the initial surprise lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a pleasant smell overall.  It seems more drying than the Dove soap I have traditionally used because it rinses more \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;, but I was getting desperate for something to help with my dry, itchy skin in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a couple of days, wasn&#x27;t sure, so I went back to my Dove soap.  Well, my skin was instantly much more itchy and irritated.  So I&#x27;m back to using it.  My skin feels pretty soft...overall it&#x27;s less irritated.  So I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s helping a bit!  Worth a shot, the bar is big for what it costs (I got mine for $4.99 at Walgreens) :)</li>
    <li> I started using Shea Moisture Hair Products and I love how it made my hair feel!!! I was having a horrible time with adult acne and ingrown hairs down under and within a couple of days everything was clear!! I came back to buy 3 more so I could make sure I would have some!!</li>
    <li> Before you try a $200 facial cleansing system, hand over big $$$ to a dermatologist or give up on your skin altogether, try Shea Moisture African Black Soap.  My acne, as an adult, has been far worse than it ever was when I was a teenager.  Immediately, I noticed how much cleaner my skin felt than it had before without feeling dried out.  Within a week, the change was noticeable and after a few months all my friends and family began to notice how clear my skin was.  I am happy to say after more than 6 months use, I barely break out...not even before my period! Oh, and if you&#x27;re careful to pat the bar dry after washing your face, one bar will last about 12 weeks.</li>
    <li> The quality of the soap is very good, it also works well for my teenaged daughter&#x27;s acne and my skin after being in the elements for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> My favorite facial bar ever. I still suffer from acne as an adult, and black soap has always helped my skin. Shea Moisture&#x27;s version of it is by far the best. Less abrasive and harsh than the pure black soap you might find, but still powerful.</li>
    <li> Weeks ago I bought their soap (for over $5) one piece, to try and I liked the continuous smell of it that continued to smell even when it became just a little piece of it left. It is called &amp;#34;Raw Shea Butter Soap&amp;#34; w/extracts of Frankincense &amp; Myrrh 8 oz. 230 g.&amp;#34; and I saved the wrapping &amp;#34;paper&amp;#34; in its entirety. Then I bought another two bars, exactly the same one kind and started using it and became very disappointed to see that there is no smell in this piece and it just smells like a simple &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; household soap that I can buy for 50 cents a piece at some stores. I feel cheated. I went to Walmart again and I noticed that two the same bars of the soap are still there on the same shelve weeks later, unsold, but with slightly cut open ends. Apparently people are already aware of this issue and are smelling this soap before buying it (or rather not buying). So now I am stuck with two bars of this soap that are unpacked unwrapped, so I can not return them to the store and I am out of around $11 for 2 bars of soap that I can buy for $1. I would like a resolution to this matter. No matter how small amount I&#x27;m writing reviews of a variety of goods and submit them to magazines, newspapers and online review sites. UPDATE: the manufacturer of this soap shipped me two soaps as replacements. Never received, because they never gave me a tracking number and 2 weeks later either the soaps were stolen off the street or were mis-delivered or stolen by UPS. The soap manufacturer has sent UPS to my house and I signed &amp;#34;NON RECEIPT&amp;#34; and they got their money back from UPS and the manufacturer of the soaps stopped responding and ignore me since. Do they think I&#x27;ve stolen the $12 worth of soaps? They must be insane! They definitely lost a prospective customer and more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everybody is complaining about the price. I buy my husband a six-pack of Lever soap for about $2 less than one bar of the black soap. However, and this is the big point, by the time my husband is done using those easily squishy, used up quickly soap bars, I still have at least 1/3 of the soap bar left. It has a milled soap quality about that seems to last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Seems to really clean with a little drying effect which is great for oily skin especially</li>
    <li> I love this soap and swear by it.  I have combination skin and I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t make the dryness worse and my oily spots are still oil prone.  However it has been pretty effective at evening out my skin tone and eliminating redness along with keeping my psoriasis in check, and that&#x27;s why I continue to buy it.  It smells kind of like bananas to me, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  This is not for everyone, if you have very sensitive skin you may have trouble because it&#x27;s a very strong soap and if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturizer your skin will be SO dry.</li>
    <li> Wow! this stuff is great been using it for only 3 days face already looks and feel better I highly recommend this for people with acne .</li>
    <li> I have this as my staple product for my face and body. The smell is pleasant and it leaves my skin clean and even feels as it is &#x27;detoxifying&#x27; by removing excess dirt and oil. Afterwards I follow up with the Shea moisture toner and then the lotion. My simple skin regimen.</li>
    <li> Best soap for my skin. I have acne and break out a lot but this soap helps me keep the breakouts down to one or two pimples. I cannot use anything else. I ordered this 4 times already and I will keep ordering it. Satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I honestly thought this was going to work for me but it didn&#x27;t. I already have mild eczema n this just flared it up even more. I noticed while using it that my skin felt dry after my shower and I&#x27;ve only ever had that feeling with dial soap. I figured out would get better but I&#x27;ve been scratching more and coming up with more bruises bc of it. This is definitely not the soap for me.</li>
    <li> I just received the soap. It came a day earlier than expected which makes me really happy. It&#x27;s packaged nicely and the size isn&#x27;t an issue like other reviewers have said. It has a nice smell to it altho I&#x27;ll have to update once I use it.</li>
    <li> It has helps my kerotosis pilaris on my arms. I notice a dramatic change in the softness of my skin with just a couple uses. I also use it to wash my face. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone and so far this soap is a miracle.</li>
    <li> While this soap IS black, it does not make your skin black, or stain black.  The soap goes on clear and produces clear suds.  I also do not believe it is for African skin as the name and description implies.  It is just simply a good gentle soap with a wonderful fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon this by chance at my local Target store.  I was looking for an Organic body soap, but this one stood out as different.  Very different!  Not only because of the name and look of the bar, but because it was so affordable!  Usually Organic soaps, or any Organic product in general, are so expensive!  Not this one.  So I picked it up, along with the body wash of the same brand. (WOW I just realized they want a ton of $$ for this here on Amazon! Let me tell you, I would not have bought this for more than $5.  Perhaps it was a pricing error at Target, and if so, I need to run down and buy it all up at the lower price!  Do yourself a favor and look for it in the store before buying it online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does not dry your face out, nor does it make it oily.  It has been a perfect addition to my face cleaning ritual, and I am so happy I gave it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this gentle soap!  It cleans well, and does not leave any residue on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this bar from the local store next to my house. actually got surprised how expensive it is listed over here. you can definitely get it much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans the body very good. pleasant smell. also when it gets to the eyes it hurts a lot-so it is not good for the face. did not try to wash the hair with it-but I doubt it would be good for this purpose..I did not like is that it is gets messy-as black color. size is good-it is twice bigger than average bar.&lt;br /&gt;I would not pay more than 5$ though.</li>
    <li> Only when I use this continuously does my problem areas stay clear. I love it, but don&#x27;t like to travel with bar soap. So if I have a trip, my skin gradually gets worse in my problem areas.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this soap. At first I liked the smell because it was fruity and flowery and reminded me of something. Then it hit me, it smells just like a urinal cake in a public restroom! That&#x27;s why it smelled familiar. If you can get over that smell and you need soap that will really dry you out then this soap is for you. It really really over dries my skin. I guess if your skin is oily this would be great for you. Not my favorite soap from them.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  The bar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Cleared my Adult Acne</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap omg</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it smells. Not horrible, but not good. The other Black Soap by Nubian Heritage smells sooo good! This was sealed when I bought it and I couldn&#x27;t smell it til I got home :( I purchased this at a beauty supply store because no one carried the Nubian Heritage in my area. As far as it working, It just must not be for me. I have oily skin type and the shea moisture just seems unnecessary for me. It left my face and especially my forehead shiny for the whole day. NOt sure if it cleared any blemishes. I only used it one time. I think I&#x27;ll just use it on my body. I suppose it can do no harm to the rest. One good thing though is that it supposedly benefits women in Africa or something, so I guess it&#x27;s for a good cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I didn&#x27;t like it but so many others do so I still would recommend it</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and my acne is hormonal. I got this soap at Walgreens and after one day of use I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement, it has calmed the redness and has dried out new breakouts on my cheeks and chin. There&#x27;s a slight dryness in my T-zone but nothing overbearing. It&#x27;s gentle and it smells so good. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Shaved with a dull razor... Ingrowns on legs gone within days! Evens out skin tone and texture! Smells nice not an overpowering smell and washes with a tingly, squeaky clean feel. I have combination skin so it moisturizes dry areas and balances oily t-zone! I get a lot of compliments on my skin seeming to have a sort of glow!!! Skin will feel supple and soft! Not to mention, it&#x27;s all natural so no harsh chemicals- this soap will clear up any type of skin condition with diligence! Love love love this soap!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was eager to try this product. Big mistake! I&#x27;m now 25 and have been fighting acne since 15. I wanted a more natural skin regimen. This bar smells great, lathers well, and left my skin feeling squeaky clean. This is why I was so caught off guard when after just a couple of days my face broke out worse than it EVER has! I thought this period would pass and used this bar for a full month before I finally gave up. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t pay much for it. Let me say again that the bumps and pimples were horrific. Now I&#x27;m back to using Aveeno.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this soap.. a full sample. This product is great.. I am in my 30&#x27;s and I still have pimple problems as if I was a teenager. This soap worked for me, I have a dry/oily skin.. mixed. my breakouts are around my lips, chin. I always have dark scars on my face which I would cover with makeup.. but after using this product, my skin is clear.. the scars are mostly gone. I  have been using it for about 2 to 3 weeks, and I am very please with the results. thanks for the sample, and i&#x27;ll be buying it.</li>
    <li> Good soap........I&#x27;m still clean</li>
    <li> I hardly EVER review products but man, oh man! I just had to vent out the frustrations on this one. Let me preface this by saying that I don&#x27;t have horribly troubled acne so I wasn&#x27;t expecting the Holy Grail of acne products given that this product is under $10. Given that I get one or two hormonal acne pimples a month, I was simply looking for a product to keep my acne at bay in order to give my old, dark scars a chance to heal. I used this product for about a month to really give it a chance and allow my skin to adjust to it and I now have absolutely radiant skin--oh wait, no.. I have 5 red, painful pimples on my right cheek and 2 red, painful pimples on my left cheek. Not to mention, I have brand new scars from recent pimples and a scar that is the size of a dime on my right cheek from the Holy Trinity of pimples that decided to cluster and erupt together in the past month. I will NEVER ever ever use this product again and I wouldn&#x27;t refer it to my worst enemy. IF there was an option to give a negative star, I most definitely would.</li>
    <li> Just ordered and waiting to see if it works wonders for my skin.  I have had problems with back acne for years and I started having issues with acne in my 20&#x27;s on my face.  So far i haven&#x27;t been experiencing any skin problems since using this product. Lately it doesn&#x27;t matter what soap product I use, it has been causing my skin to get irritated to the point some people have been asking if I have eczema.  I don&#x27;t know what happened but I never had that experience before until recently. But so far since using this product my skin feels exfoliated and soft.  It smells realllyyyyyyyyy good and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin experiencing break outs or irritations .</li>
    <li> I discovered this through a free sample an I must say I am hooked! I&#x27;m 27 and suffer the occasional breakout, this stuff does a great job at clearing that up! i recommend this to anyone with oily acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so soft and my skin is becoming a lot healthier! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my body since I&#x27;ve had a breakout of eczema all over my chest. The eczema is getting better after 1 week&#x27;s use so I decided to use a tiny little bit on my face during my shower since I had started to breakout along my hair line and the pimples went away that night! Great if you don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin. I love the way this soap makes my skin feel squeaky clean without being overly drying. Hopefully, it&#x27;ll fully help the eczema​!</li>
    <li> This is the first African Black Soap product I have tried. The first thing I noticed was the smell. I initially liked the smell, but then read a review comparing it to bubble gum. I now cannot get that association out of my head and it drives me crazy! Regardless, this soap feels great on my body and has helped a tiny bit with a few small spots of acne on my shoulders. I did try it on my face also, but I was getting a tad red after using for a few days consistently, so I will be going back to a more gentle cleanser for my face. Lastly, look for this product at your local drugstore or Target before buying on Amazon. I purchased this product at CVS for about $6.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wonderful soap yesterday and have used it twice.  LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly sensitive skin and I must be very careful with the products I use from head to toe. I suffer from the occasional breakout and have enlarged pores with troublesome blackheads on my face.  Due to my skin sensitivity I am not able to tolerate acne products.  After just 2 uses of this soap the last 2 evenings, an upcoming blemish is disappearing and my pores are noticeably smaller. I have also had no allergic reaction to this product, no doubt due to it&#x27;s natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply the soap I wet my face and rubbed the soap bar over my wet skin.  I then massaged the soap on my skin and it produced a nice creamy lather. The scent is pleasant and light.  The soap rinses easily and leaves my skin squeaky clean which worried me at first.  Squeaky clean seems to be synonymous with dry.  But what was so surprising is that when my skin dried it felt so soft and moisturized! I almost did not need to apply moisturizer.  But of course I followed up with my homemade mixture of African Shea butter whipped with coconut oil and my skin just glows!  Try it, you will love it too.</li>
    <li> it did not work as good as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for my very oily acne prone skin and it works better than the proactiv bar... But i will never by it on here again... I can get this same bar for only $4.99 @ the local walgreens, walmart and target or online if i want to shop online. Dont spend a fortune on this one bar. Its a rip off from these sellers.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really take my zits off, but I will re-purchase again bc it left my face so smooth and clean. I don&#x27;t think I can use another soap</li>
</ol>
