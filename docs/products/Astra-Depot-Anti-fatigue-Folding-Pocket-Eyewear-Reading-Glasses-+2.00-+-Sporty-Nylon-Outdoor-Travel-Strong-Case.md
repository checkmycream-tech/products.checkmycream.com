      <li>Great stuff thanks</li>
      <li>well, most of the time</li>
      <li>Strong&gt; and priced appropriately.</li>
      <li>my grandkids think they are &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; and love to unfold them for me.  </li>
      <li>I love these glasses.</li>
      <li>nice protective case and the compact glasses fit easily into my pocket</li>
      <li>so they fit in your pants pocket better.</li>
      <li>They were bent out of the box but we&#x27;re easily straightened.</li>
      <li>Work fine.</li>
      <li>These didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>The hinge on one of the side pieces over extends and no amount of bending could make them fit  my head.  </li>
      <li>The four stars, by the way, are for the ones I originally purchased.</li>
      <li>Good glasses, they are larger than some foldable glasses.</li>
      <li>Plus they&#x27;re pretty secure when in case.</li>
      <li>Easy to unfold, clear lenses and comfortable.</li>
      <li>Certainly worth the price.</li>
      <li>They are well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I liked the glasses well enough vs the case to get them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price enticed me but it wasn&#x27;t even worth the couple of dollars.</li>
      <li>The case started fraying pretty quickly and I keep these in my pocket and after a month, the handle on the zipper broke off.  </li>
      <li>Ouseltna and at the right time .  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like how they fold up as I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to get it caught but the case is fantastic and to store in my purse without scratches is nice.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, my regular glasses have been in my car because they are too large to fit in my pocket and do not know what to do with them if I bring them into a restaurant or a store.  </li>
      <li>This fits easily into my pocket, and the case keeps them safe and prevents them from slipping out of the pocket.  </li>
      <li>inside purse ok, but not male front pockets.</li>
      <li>They are clear and comfortable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for my brief use shopping or reading menus so for the price, I&#x27;m keeping glasses.</li>
      <li>So I really needed replacements.  </li>
      <li>very convenient</li>
      <li>Thanks for these glasses.</li>
      <li>Much sturdier than I had anticipated, although I smashed them between my leg and my steering wheel while getting in my truck.</li>
      <li>I still used them and am about to get a new pair as I have lost the pair that the case was wearing out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t like the product ,cos  the hands loose up quickly, would prefer the hands in plastic</li>
      <li>Appears sturdy, lens and frame good, folds easy, unfortunately one nose prong is lower than the other and not adjustable.  </li>
      <li>I love that these glasses fold up and only need a small space to store in a purse orocket.</li>
      <li>Well built glasses, being portable nice but a little bulky wish case was a little thiner</li>
      <li>Not really suitable for everyday wear, but a good pair to keep in the car or backpack for emergencies.</li>
      <li>The only negative thing is that you have to make sure you fold them carefully when you put them back into the case.  </li>

    <li> These are so handy can be taken anywhere- very useful!</li>
    <li> nice case and glasses  real handy to carry around  GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the product ,cos  the hands loose up quickly, would prefer the hands in plastic</li>
    <li> Love the case the glasses come in but the glasses themselves a bit uncomfortable to wear so gave them away</li>
    <li> Great stuff thanks www.simonna.tv</li>
    <li> I loved the glasses. They were sturdy and held up well. The case started fraying pretty quickly and I keep these in my pocket and after a month, the handle on the zipper broke off.  I still used them and am about to get a new pair as I have lost the pair that the case was wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;So I liked the glasses well enough vs the case to get them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another set with a different folding style and crappy nose pieces and I&#x27;m using them until I can get these again.</li>
    <li> Thanks for these glasses. Very beautiful. Strong&gt; and priced appropriately. Ouseltna and at the right time .  thank you for amazon</li>
    <li> Nice, compact, and sturdy. Plus they&#x27;re pretty secure when in case. Not really suitable for everyday wear, but a good pair to keep in the car or backpack for emergencies. Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> product as described and great delivery. would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Nice and convenient glasses to have when you need them</li>
    <li> Good glasses, they are larger than some foldable glasses. Which is a nice feature</li>
    <li> Just what I need for pocket or purse.  Appears sturdy, lens and frame good, folds easy, unfortunately one nose prong is lower than the other and not adjustable.  A fluke or bad design?  It&#x27;s okay for my brief use shopping or reading menus so for the price, I&#x27;m keeping glasses.</li>
    <li> There have been many times that I have found myself in a restaurant not being able to read the menu.  Most of the time, my regular glasses have been in my car because they are too large to fit in my pocket and do not know what to do with them if I bring them into a restaurant or a store.  The fold up glasses come in a case and fit nicely into my pocket.  The only negative thing is that you have to make sure you fold them carefully when you put them back into the case.  In the case, they are safe.</li>
    <li> I love these folding readers and they&#x27;re nice quality.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t your typical review. I just wanted to point out a potential problem with this style of glasses. I had two pair of these for several years and they held up well. I don&#x27;t know if they were the same brand or not, but I believe these can have the same problem. That is, when folded, over time the lenses began to show scratches. The scratches were caused by the opposite ear piece rubbing against the lens. The next time I will place a piece of cloth, something like the microfiber cloth that comes with the glasses, between each earpiece and opposite lens. I will likely buy at least a pair of these to replace the ones worn out. The four stars, by the way, are for the ones I originally purchased.</li>
    <li> Love these glasses.  The case is excellent for keeping the glasses from bending and breaking.  Fits nice in the pocket for easy carry.</li>
    <li> I love that these glasses fold up and only need a small space to store in a purse orocket. my grandkids think they are &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; and love to unfold them for me.  They are clear and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Work fine. They were bent out of the box but we&#x27;re easily straightened. They told easily and the case fires nicely in my pocket. The three star rating is because they are flimsy. But they were also inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I had a pair of foldable glasses before for over 20 years but left them at a restaurant somewhere.  So I really needed replacements.  These didn&#x27;t fit the bill.  The nose pieces were so far apart that they just slip down my nose.  The hinge on one of the side pieces over extends and no amount of bending could make them fit  my head.  They seem to be for a much much bigger head and nose. I have to hold them on with my hand to use them.  I&#x27;ll be buying ones that I can try on.  The price enticed me but it wasn&#x27;t even worth the couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> Very handy and easy to store.</li>
    <li> glasses are great nice size lenses are great for reading and close work. Case lasted about a week then the zipper just wouldn&#x27;t close</li>
    <li> These reading glasses are perfect !  Easy to unfold, clear lenses and comfortable. I keep these in my car as I always forgot my glasses when going to a restaurant !</li>
    <li> They are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Much sturdier than I had anticipated, although I smashed them between my leg and my steering wheel while getting in my truck. I&#x27;ll be ordering another pair. Although I chipped the glass and popped it out, they still work great. I use them as a spare pair in the nightstand.</li>
    <li> Threw case away because once I unzipped it to take glasses out, it never zipped correctly..... As for the glasses, there is very good clarity in the lenses but the folding ear pieces are flimsy and cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Glasses great, case OK. Clip on case would be better.</li>
    <li> Good lenses. sturdy case. good price.</li>
    <li> I did like these glasses and would have give them 5 stars, but I lost them within a week. So they got 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The glasses seem to be above average quality for this category. I comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth. My only complaint is that the case is fatter than I thought so it does not fit unobtrusively in the pocket of my jeans.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like how they fold up as I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to get it caught but the case is fantastic and to store in my purse without scratches is nice. I don&#x27;t think I will buy another pair though as I don&#x27;t like the way it folds compared to my walgreens pair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to carry around reading glasses without needing a bag or purse.  This fits easily into my pocket, and the case keeps them safe and prevents them from slipping out of the pocket.  They close easily, work well and are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Handy way to carry your reading glasses. Although I like the case, I chose to use a small soft case that I already had. Now I just carry reading glasses and have them when I need them. The price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B  Denver, Colorado</li>
    <li> My husband will actually keep up with this small case and have glasses when he needs them - well, most of the time</li>
    <li> Compact and convenient to carry.</li>
    <li> Flimsy, uncomfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Fits inside purse ok, but not male front pockets.</li>
    <li> I love these glasses. They are great to carry along in my shirt pocket at work and I don&#x27;t have to worry about scratching them when they are in the protective case.</li>
    <li> Practical and handy. Despite the many joints, the product seems reliable and resistent.</li>
    <li> Great value.  very convenient</li>
    <li> nice protective case and the compact glasses fit easily into my pocket</li>
    <li> Well built glasses, being portable nice but a little bulky wish case was a little thiner so they fit in your pants pocket better.</li>
    <li> Great Glasses and cases!</li>
