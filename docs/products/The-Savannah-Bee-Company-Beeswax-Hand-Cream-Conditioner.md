<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I flirted with buying this hand cream for months, but I finally caved when winter weather attacked my hands. I&#x27;m a very busy mom of infant twins, so I wash my hands a billion times a day (true fact!). This hand cream heals and protects my skin like no other. I found it for several dollars less at my local Whole Foods, but it may have been on sale. I would buy it at the list price if needed, though. Even if it didn&#x27;t soothe and heal my chapped hands, I would probably buy it because of vanity. This stuff makes my hands look 15 years younger! it also smells great and does not include soy - a huge plus for someone who has a contact allergy to soy. (It does contain tree nut oils, though, so avoid if that&#x27;s an issue for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my jar on top of my desk where I can apply it each evening before I start writing. True Fact #2: I have killed off 200% fewer characters since I started using this hand cream. It&#x27;s that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should probably go ahead and buy this little jar of magic.</li>
    <li> Really love this product!</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!  This is the best hand creme I&#x27;ve ever used,and  I have tried  a lot of them!!!  No matter what I tried, my hands were still dry and cracked.  This is the only one that worked without feeling greasy!!!</li>
    <li> My husband has a weird skin condition that causes his hands to blister and peel. None of his doctors have ever been able to diagnose the condition other to say it&#x27;s an immune response. After years of trial and error, we found the Savannah Bee hand cream and it works miracles on his hands! It&#x27;s not too greasy and keeps his hands moist and keeps them from peeling. yay!</li>
    <li> I am usually really picky about the texture of hand creams.  This one is a whipped texture, which does leave a little greasiness to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I really love the smell of it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my excema.  A good product overall.</li>
    <li> This is the best Hand cream  ever!!!  My hands, arms, nails and cuticles all  are in better condition since finding this product then they were years ago,  my hands no longer give away my age!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Bee cream is phenomenal!!!! It is the most amazing thing because it truly moisturizes. I will be using this forever!! Thank you so so much Savannah Bee Company for making a very safe product that works so incredibly well !</li>

    <li> Terrific hand cream.  I used to swear by Burt&#x27;s Bees, but didn&#x27;t like the greasiness.  This absorbs much more quickly and isn&#x27;t too greasy to begin with.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite hand cream.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me for my dried out hands.  After first application my hands healed quickly.  I highly recommend it.</li>

    <li> I got this for my mother for Christmas and she loves it! I used it myself and was impressed with the product: creamy, not greasy, with a light pleasant scent. Definately a quality hand cream, highly reccommended! :D</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will keep buyin again and again. Price is competitive with the store.</li>
    <li> This hand cream did the trick, but I couldn&#x27;t really take the scent. Even wearing gloves at bedtime, the smell got to me. It is good and greaseless if you don&#x27;t mind the scent. I am just sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> smooths  hands and smells great too.  !!!!!!!!! Love it</li>
    <li> This hand cream is a keeper.  It&#x27;s the consistency of whipped cream and it&#x27;s cool and soothing when you put it on.  It&#x27;s very hard for me to not have my fingers turn into bloody pulps in winter, but this really helps and it makes me feel a bit more human in February.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite hand cream.  It&#x27;s the only thing that helps me with my dry hands in the winter.  I love the purity of the ingredients.</li>
