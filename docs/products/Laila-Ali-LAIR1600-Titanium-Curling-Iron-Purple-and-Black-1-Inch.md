      <li>and this is right up there with the best.</li>
      <li>Love this curling iron!</li>

      <li>I can control the temperature easily and it leaves my hair looking amazing.</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic, it is well-made, gets hot, and creates gorgeous curls!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>I keep it in my bathroom--I love the swivel feature which makes it easier to curl longer hair with the greatest of ease--I&#x27;d love to meet her and give Ms. Ali a big hug for designing it the way that she did!!!  </li>
      <li>Buy this, it&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
      <li>I have not used it yet but looks fine.</li>
      <li>Fabulous for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the reason why I liked this curling iron: It has a nice ergonomic design, easy and comfortable to hold when curling the hair at the back of the head.</li>
      <li>As they didn&#x27;t have one available when I bought the blowdryer as I would have bought one then.</li>
      <li>Very easy to hold and heats up super fast.</li>
      <li>I love how much quicker I can curl my hair now.</li>
      <li>It heats up really hot and very quickly.</li>
      <li>Some of these curling irons were a bust while others were adequate.</li>
      <li>Worth the price</li>
      <li>Absolutely love how well the high heat actually keeps curls in my hair without dowsing my hair in hairspray. :)</li>
      <li>The price is right and the handle is purple.</li>
      <li>First of all, this item was not for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>My Daughter used it, now she wants one too!</li>
      <li>I saw the curls this iron made and they were pretty and so will you be when you make this purchase...</li>
      <li>Very upset!</li>
      <li>This item was the deal of the day for $13 and was pure trash.</li>
      <li>No one wants to stand around and wait for a curling iron to heat up.</li>
      <li>Large enough to hold more hair (the length) and has the several settings for you to decide on, depending on your hair and type.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>it was brand new</li>
      <li>It does heat up super fast and the clamp holds hair tightly.</li>
      <li>, my old curler would take me a full 30 seconds each strand, this does the job after 15 each strand, sometimes less than that!</li>
      <li>Iron does not get hot and doesnt make curls due to lack of heat.</li>
      <li>It really hits up in no time flat (a matter of seconds as is promised on the box), and the fact that I&#x27;ve got three settings from which to choose makes curling long hair a breeze!  </li>

<li> I had to order among the toasters and vacuums and other items curling irons.</li>
<li> I have really thick long hair!</li>
<li> I was skeptical because it was so inexpensive, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
<li> It was firm and you need that to make a tighter curl.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months now and it seems to be a well designed curling iron for the price.</li>
<li> The item does not have automatic shut off and is hard to work with the small rubber area on the iron.</li>
<li> so that is highly unlikely.</li>
<li> I have tried a lot of expensive hair tools</li>
<li> seems difficult to handle</li>
<li> (Maybe i got a bad iron)</li>

    <li> Fabulous for my fine hair. Heats up in seconds. I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months now and it seems to be a well designed curling iron for the price. It does heat up super fast and the clamp holds hair tightly. The lower cost is reflected in two ways:&lt;br /&gt;The electrical cord is sort of flimsy and there is no surge protector at the plug.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have an automatic shut off. If you use it in the morning and forget to turn it off you could have a fire on your hands. If I had realized that before purchasing, I probably would have continued shopping around.</li>
    <li> Very easy to hold and heats up super fast. I love how much quicker I can curl my hair now. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed African American hair and I absolutely love this curling iron. I can control the temperature easily and it leaves my hair looking amazing. My curls hold all day.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron!</li>
    <li> I started with the Laila Ali hair blow dryer in purple and when I needed a curling iron and found this one in purple I had to have it. I couldn&#x27;t believe my luck! As they didn&#x27;t have one available when I bought the blowdryer as I would have bought one then. It heats up really hot and very quickly. Works great for any type of curling for hair. I have really thick long hair! I would recommend this iron to anyone it is also good for straighening1 too.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used. I have tried a lot of expensive hair tools and this is right up there with the best. The price is fantastic, it is well-made, gets hot, and creates gorgeous curls! This is the only curling iron I plan on using and almost want to buy one for back-up. Definitely grab it now, ladies!</li>
    <li> My Daughter used it, now she wants one too! I was skeptical because it was so inexpensive, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I received it!!!  It really hits up in no time flat (a matter of seconds as is promised on the box), and the fact that I&#x27;ve got three settings from which to choose makes curling long hair a breeze!  I was going to pack it in my luggage so that whenever I get away it would go with me, but I decided to use it just to test it out/I keep it in my bathroom--I love the swivel feature which makes it easier to curl longer hair with the greatest of ease--I&#x27;d love to meet her and give Ms. Ali a big hug for designing it the way that she did!!!  Keep selling that curling iron.</li>
    <li> have not used it yet. seems difficult to handle so once someone shows me how I will make an additional comment. the price was great that&#x27;s the reason for the purchase.</li>
    <li> The item does not have automatic shut off and is hard to work with the small rubber area on the iron.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet but looks fine.</li>
    <li> Very Nicely made product for the price compared to some of the over priced curling iron&#x27;s sold at Sally Beauty. Good temp settings for ethnic hair.... Worth the price</li>
    <li> First of all, this item was not for me. My sister is  a fan of hair maintenance. She is one of those people who goes to get her hair done at the beauty parlor once a week. A time ago in my work career, I was a small appliance manager for a major department store. I had to order among the toasters and vacuums and other items curling irons. Some of these curling irons were a bust while others were adequate. Every now and again I would come across a curling iron that sold well and was never returned for defects. This Laila Ali 1 inch Curling Iron is the best i&#x27;ve seen for a great price. Here&#x27;s the reason why I liked this curling iron: It has a nice ergonomic design, easy and comfortable to hold when curling the hair at the back of the head. The spring at the barrel was not flimsy...It was firm and you need that to make a tighter curl. The barrel heated up within a minute and maintained its heat. No one wants to stand around and wait for a curling iron to heat up. It has a nice sturdy kickstand. Although this item is not rated for commercial use, It has that solid and sturdy feel. I saw the curls this iron made and they were pretty and so will you be when you make this purchase...The price is right and the handle is purple. Amazon has another great bargain. Don&#x27;t miss this one.</li>
    <li> This item was the deal of the day for $13 and was pure trash. Iron does not get hot and doesnt make curls due to lack of heat. Very upset! (Maybe i got a bad iron) it was brand new so that is highly unlikely. Save yourself and get something else.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this curling iron, it does the job! I always have issues because I have thick hair, this curled my hair fast, my old curler would take me a full 30 seconds each strand, this does the job after 15 each strand, sometimes less than that! I would recommend if you have lots of hair and long too!</li>
    <li> This is a great durable curling iron. I hope it stays with me for a while. Great product Laila Ali!</li>
    <li> It got the job done, but the shiny silver coating is peeling after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> A great one for this price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love how well the high heat actually keeps curls in my hair without dowsing my hair in hairspray. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Highly recommend!! Large enough to hold more hair (the length) and has the several settings for you to decide on, depending on your hair and type. Buy this, it&#x27;s worth the money!!</li>
