      <li>I love this product, it does damage hair</li>
      <li>I love this kit.   </li>
      <li>If you do intend to use this product, buy more than you think you will need.</li>
      <li>Manic Panic Flash Lightening is our favorite precolor kit...</li>
      <li>I have used plenty of Manic Panic products and I love them.</li>
      <li>I just wish I had more</li>
      <li>My friend actually was really impressed and wanted to get some for herself.</li>
      <li>I put Punky colour in my bangs and it turned out really bright and pretty :) over all I love this bleach</li>
      <li>I kept it in my hair for 65 minutes exactly, after that it stopped processing, but boy did it do a good job of lifting the parts that I got evenly.      </li>
      <li>The bleaching effect is awesome, but the amount is not very much.</li>
      <li>It bleached my hair very quickly.</li>
      <li>3 shades lifted easily.</li>
      <li>Its a great, effective simple product if you just use it right.</li>
      <li>and I thought it&#x27;d be good to go and try new things....</li>
      <li>But it went fine.</li>
      <li>Petroleum jelly is a huge help with that.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have light hair so on the box</li>
      <li>I have this light brownish color</li>
      <li>used this product on a light brown hair, after 25 min</li>
      <li>, it will &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; the scalp even more and damage your hair, this product is powerful at 40% volume</li>
      <li>WHICH WAS ALREADY LIGHT BROWN.  </li>
      <li>Its pretty powerful and its nice not having to sit around and wait forever and a day for the bleach to work.  </li>
      <li>Its amazing how high in lightness it gets you in just one box of this stuff.  </li>
      <li>buy 2 boxes and make sure you check often the color and do not over bleach for first time</li>
      <li>I was excited when I bought this product, I usually bleach my hair with the bleaching kit in Splat Hair dye (which works wonderfully [for me])</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>but it was when I did a full strand that my scalp peeled for like 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I ended up going to Sally&#x27;s and getting bleach and developer and it was a good thing as there wasn&#x27;t enough in this kit to do my hair.  </li>
      <li>overall results is good for those who wish to look good and at the same time save cost!</li>
      <li>but I was bleaching only parts of my hair so it was good.</li>
      <li>And the product worked exactly as you would expect being as strong as it is.  </li>
      <li>Haha, lovely product though, works perfectly, worth the price.</li>
      <li>This lifted the color perfectly to a snow white, and with proper after care,</li>
      <li>I researched bleaching/toning products &amp; Manic Panic came up &amp; is very much a product familiar 2 me.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty good color.</li>
      <li>Do your ends first!</li>
      <li>This stuff is AMAZING &amp; am in the process of making yet my 3rd purchase of this product &amp; will continue 2 buy this product</li>
      <li>I used the Manic Panic Vampire Red and the tone was nice and even despite the orange tips.</li>
      <li>on my sons much more sensitive heads</li>
      <li>tHIS PRODUCT IS POWERFUL</li>
      <li>(: it came super  fast, too!</li>
      <li>I got this pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>if used right Manic panic is the easiest and safest hair product out there...</li>
      <li>It is truly amazing to be able to shop from home  and also get such value at the same time.</li>
      <li>The bleach worked great, but it&#x27;s too little to use for your whole head.</li>
      <li>Be smart!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and quick and even came with extras.</li>
      <li>this stuff is very very</li>
      <li>I left it on for about 60 minutes and it came out a copper color but very light towards the roots.</li>
      <li>Good product and fast shipping due to my prime membership.  </li>
      <li>This is a hard to find product so was happy to find it here on amazon;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I Higthly recomented this product, perfect for bleaching your hair, I like so much the result that I definitily buy again. If you had a lot a hair, you will had to buy 2 or 3 boxes because one isn&#x27;t enought in that case.</li>
    <li> Wonderful experience with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Although the portion is really small.&lt;br /&gt;The overall results is good for those who wish to look good and at the same time save cost!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and one box wasn&#x27;t even enough. I did get 2 boxes and that was hardly enough. I had blotches so I had to bleach my hair again.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would be stronger, wanted very light streaks to dye red in my dark brown hair, got orange.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t burn. Was evenly dyed. Worked fast. My hair was actually softer after I bleached it. Will buy again. Will suggest to others</li>
    <li> Ive bleached my hair blonde with this all the time,  Its amazing how high in lightness it gets you in just one box of this stuff.  How ever the box is very small, if you have really really short hair, 1 box would do the trick, but if you have medium or long hair 2 or 3 would do the trick if your trying to dye everything.</li>
    <li> mixed product as directed &amp; applied to my bangs, which i intended to dye a deep red. product did not say how long to leave on black hair so i followed the directions for the dark brown hair. i only left the product on for 30 minutes. please keep in mind that my hair was (yes, i said WAS) in a good, healthy condition.....as i was rinsing the product from my hair, i noticed quite a bit of hair in the sink that had fallen out. after towel-drying my hair, i combed it &amp; my bangs that had hung down further than my armpits were all broken off (more like fried off) to chin level.....almost 3 inches!!!     i wasn&#x27;t sure what to do because of the damage so i called a friend that is a licensed stylest. she came over &amp; we dyed it red as was intended, however, due to the extensive damage &amp; stripping caused by this product, my hair is now a horrid orangey-pink kinda color (extremely similar to a clowns wig). &amp; because my hair is now so damaged, even she, being a licensed stylest, said that there wasn&#x27;t anything that could  be done about the color until the hair had some time to heal. i don&#x27;t believe i have ever been so disappointed with a product in all my life.......</li>
    <li> I bought this to try bleaching my hair for the first time. I have extremely dark brown hair, mistakable for black. It took about an hour leaving this in to get my hair down to an interesting copper-orangish-yellow-blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reapplying for another 15 minutes took -some- of my hair down to a sweet yellow, which is what I wanted so that I could get a greenish color from my turqouise hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t burn when it got on my scalp, but in the sideburns area it started to burn after maybe 45 min but it didnt get any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason I didn&#x27;t give this five stars is because when I opened up the little tub with the powder in it and picked up, the bag was not sealed tightly enough so it sent all of the finest of that powder in my face. Otherwise, the tub was convenient to store the powder in since I only used a little bit at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I added some sugar under the advice of a hair stylist friend to help my results. Not sure what it was supposed to do but maybe it affected my results.</li>
    <li> I was attempting to bleach my whole head, and this was not enough to do the trick, sadly. I had to go out and buy another box. But it bleached my hair very well, the bit there was in there.</li>
    <li> My son wanted me to bleach out his hair and go blue for a concert we recently went to.  I of course bleached it first, and I used this product, had to leave it on for 90 minutes due to his reddish brown hair color, and he loved it so much, we didnt go blue! Good product and fast shipping due to my prime membership.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark brown/black hair. I have been bleaching and dying my hair red for over twelve years now. I have tried every bleaching product there is. Loreal, Clairol, you name it, I&#x27;ve used it multiple times. With all of the products I tried I had the same results. I had to leave the bleach on for up to 8 hours for it to get light enough. The bleach itself burned and itched from the moment I began to apply it. My hair never got blond no matter how long I left each and every product on. When I rinsed the bleach out my hair felt like straw. And the color was completely uneven. It was patchy. Light in some places and darker in others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this bleach a try and was unbelievably surprised. After not even 30 minutes my hair was light enough to where I could rinse out the bleach. My scalp never itched or burned. For the first time ever my hair did not feel like straw when I rinsed out the bleach. In fact it felt silky and in better condition than before I bleached it. And again for the first time ever my hair turned out being all the same color. There are no dark patches. It&#x27;s an all over even color which is going to make dying it so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product enough. This is by far the best bleach I have ever used.</li>
    <li> it made my hair extra bright but only use if your planning on dying another blonde on top because it comes out a slight yellow/orange tint. but from its original black, this made my hair super light</li>
    <li> My hair is black and using this once got my hair between blonde and an orange copper color.I used to use the bleach that came in Splat but that damaged my hair way too much while this product left my hair soft and hardly damaged. Manic Panic products never cease to amaze me, always amazing colors and quality. I will continue to use this bleach on my hair. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have never dyed my hair before, but I knew what to expect because I&#x27;ve done my research. I was expecting this product to have semi-good instructions. I was WRONG. The instructions were vague, and it told me to \\&quot;Add enough developer.\\&quot; How much is enough?! Half the bottle? The whole bottle? Barely any? Well, once I added what I thought was \\&quot;enough\\&quot;, I applied it to my hair. Such a mistake. It immediately began to burn and itch. I took it out after ten minutes and my hair is stringy and fried, and a terrible orangutan orange. I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> This bleach is surprisingly gentle on hair, don&#x27;t leave it on too long because as with all bleaches it will fry your hair but that being said it works wonders.  It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation on my scalp but on my sons much more sensitive heads it did cause some minor irritation so if you have very sensitive skin be careful to keep this away from it as much as possible.  Petroleum jelly is a huge help with that.</li>
    <li> Manic Panic is the worst dye I&#x27;ve ever come across, but the bleach is the worst there&#x27;s no way to not hit your scalp if you want good results, however you will receive a free skin peel on your scalp. Please do not use it is unsafe, try punky color or hot topic.</li>
    <li> Me and my brother both use this before we dye our hair with the manic panic dyes.  My hair is naturally light brown and his medium brown and both of us have yellowish blonde after 30 min, pale yellow after 60 min, and platinum hair after 90 min.  I defiantly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t just lighten your hair... it turns you into a platinum blonde, ready to use whatever color you&#x27;d like on your hair without worry. I made the mistake of using a national brand lightning kit I purchased at a drug store, and my hair was completely orange. Upset, I found this on Amazon and decided to try it out. This took all of the orange out and got my naturally very dark hair as blonde as can be for my auburn dye.</li>
    <li> I bought this to bleach out my hair and eventually get white hair. It worked within 30 min and I have dark brown hair. I also only bought one box because I have pretty short hair...but apparently not short enough, ran out of bleach with only half of my head done. So I ended up buying another bleach which didn&#x27;t get to work as well before I had to wash out this bleach. So now I know ALWAYS GET 2 BOXES JUST IN CASE. Also it didn&#x27;t burn my scalp so thats&#x27;s good. It also dries out your hair so remember to condition like crazy.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of Manic Panic products and I love them. The bleach worked great, but it&#x27;s too little to use for your whole head. I ordered two boxes which contain a little container in which you mix the bleach powder&amp;peroxide[both included], along with some gloves, a tint brush, and a cap. [a set in both boxes]. However i used both containers and they still weren&#x27;t enough to do my whole head. I have long hair, but it is layered so over half of my hair is around my ears. If you do intend to use this product, buy more than you think you will need. Otherwise use cheaper bleach because drugstore bleach is just as effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one for manic panic lover, this is a good bleach kit, which is easy to use and give you a very good result. For me, it didn&#x27;t damage my hair. Defiantly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does damage hair but you have to know how to use it and how to protect you&#x27;re hair and take care of it afterwards. I will be ordering this product again. I highly suggest it to anyone who is trying to bleach their hair from black to a lighter color. Please know when bleaching your hair from black to blonde know that you will have to order two, and use them a month or two apart to protect your hair.</li>
    <li> Used MP Flash Lightening with the bleach bath method and it turned out beautifully! Went from medium brown to gold in one application. 3 shades lifted easily. Can&#x27;t wair for second application. Cannot stress this enough: DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BLEACHING. While package was being shipped I spent the week learning different methods and how to treat your hair before and after.</li>
    <li> I used the 40 vol bleach kit and I had never bleached my hair before. It was previously a reddish brown color. I left it on for about 60 minutes and it came out a copper color but very light towards the roots. I bought two of the bleach kits, and it wasn&#x27;t enough for me to get it all even. I still have some dark spots in some areas. My hair is a little passed my ribs, and pretty thin, so next time I think I&#x27;d buy about 4 just to be safe... Also, I have eczema on my scalp so it&#x27;s pretty red and swollen in some places, but that&#x27;s just for me and it did burn in those areas. Just something to be aware of if you have eczema, but the swelling is starting to go down a bit after putting it under fridged cold water. Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty good color. Ad I don&#x27;t mind the copper color or that it&#x27;s still dark brown in some places, dying it orange soon!</li>
    <li> If you can follow directions, you won&#x27;t have any issues with this kit.  You might need a friend to help you, so be prepared!  Also, be careful not to over-bleach.</li>
    <li> Manic Panic worked as always. Perfect for me.  l left it in for full 90 min because my hair is kinda bleach resistant. I can;t wait to add color!</li>
    <li> This bleach got my hair to basically platinum blonde after leaving it on for just under half an hour. I am a male with kinda short hair so I didn&#x27;t need more than one box. One was enough to cover my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like straw, like most other lightening kits. It actually left my hair feeling softer than before I bleached. There was a bit of a harsh smell, but that comes with pretty much any bleaching kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this from now on whenever I need to lighten my hair.</li>
    <li> completly f&#x27;d my hair up.. i had to go get my hair cut to fix this .. and still have LOTS of brake every time i brush my hair.. omg ...</li>
    <li> This prouduct did not lighten my hair as well as I was hoping, but it was more effective than the stuff you buy at the store.(: it came super  fast, too!</li>
    <li> I love using this item. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn my scalp and my hair turns out great. Except when I got this package it was torn open and dented.</li>
    <li> It came on time and it defiantly made my way hair blond.  But it also caused my hair to fall out. Never using this again.</li>
    <li> I got this pretty quick.  And the product worked exactly as you would expect being as strong as it is.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great product if your needing a strong bleach product. Be sure your hair is in good condition before using rthis product. This is a hard to find product so was happy to find it here on amazon;</li>
    <li> I love the different and high quality things I buy on Amazon. It is truly amazing to be able to shop from home  and also get such value at the same time.</li>
    <li> First off shipping was so fast. It came two days early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my mom to help me out with applying it. I mixed together the powder and cream and then applied and instantly it started working and I have very dark hair, Close to black. I got to a medium blonde within ten minutes.. The only thing bad for me was I had a slight reaction to the bleach, My ears and temples were very red but After a few hours this didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great bleach, I never even have to leave it in for the full 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> didnt fry my hair. aDecent amount of bleach and devoloper, made my hair almost white,doesnt smell bad, doesnt turn hair yellow (my hair was green before i put it in so i dont know if your hair will turn yellow if you have darker hair) hair dye stuck well ( i used punky color)</li>
    <li> The best product ever , it dye all types of hair, from black to dark blond to a sweet yellow sunny hair color what is the great base for the final color.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on a light brown hair, after 25 min the hair was almost white , on a tick black hair it take around 60 to 90 min, the maximum time you can lightening your hair is 2 hours but under control and on a healthy hair , and trust me the hair was so soft and shiny after not compared to other products, however it burns the client skin a little especially on the temples where the skin is mostly warm , I suggest adding some lite real sugar to the mix ( no sweet-low or splender ) do not heat up the mix, it will &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; the scalp even more and damage your hair, this product is powerful at 40% volume so be very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP : never put the bleach on the close roots do it after you finish with the rest of the hair, the roots will be bleached always faster than the rest of the hair , so if you want one equal color do it at the end .&lt;br /&gt;I use one package box for highlights or roots, for shoulder length buy 2 boxes and make sure you check often the color and do not over bleach for first time</li>
    <li> It bleached my hair very quickly. I ended up keeping the bleach in for overnight becauase the first time i did it for two hours and i have dirty blonde hair and it barely bleached it. It was also expensive and I wasn&#x27;t happy that I even had to buy it in the first place because the hair dye should&#x27;ve worked without having me to bleach it in the first place.</li>
    <li> I love this product but here&#x27;s the deal...if you have semi-long hair, one kit is probably not enough to get your whole head as one even tint. Granted I did not use anything to separate my hair piece by piece so that I got it section by section, I managed to get to the almost platinum blond color required to use the Virgin Snow toner I got (I&#x27;m going for pure white hair or a very light gray). But using TWO kits, I only got half of my hair the correct color for dye: the front half and my roots are very pale after only ONE round of bleaching (this is on a dark dark brown set of hair, so this stuff is very very strong!!)and the rest is still a brassy and/or medium blonde color. I kept it in my hair for 65 minutes exactly, after that it stopped processing, but boy did it do a good job of lifting the parts that I got evenly.      My only wish is that 1) the kits came with a MUCH larger amount of bleach powder and 2)they had a tool that I could use to sort of &#x27;wash&#x27; the bleach in like a shampoo type situation, instead of using that feeble little tint brush..that way there&#x27;s no mistaking whether or not my whole head would come out in one even shade.    Another thing of note as well; I had VERY little breakage, next to none. Minus the fact that I shampooed afterwards, my hair is still pretty healthy and not too frizzy or hard after such an intense bleach. I was shocked because everyone was saying it was gonna DESTROY my hair when in fact, it didn&#x27;t. But nonetheless I will (and do suggest) continuing to conditioning the hair extremely well.    I definitely recommend the product overall, it works extremely well! Just make sure you have enough to go around evenly and have an extra hand to help you or at least use mirrors + something to separate your hair into sections.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works great in my hair. I would definitely recommend it. &amp; I will definitely use it again if needed. I love Manic Panic.</li>
    <li> Really dried out my hair and my scalp hated it. Did strand test no problem but it was when I did a full strand that my scalp peeled for like 2 weeks. I&#x27;ll stick to henna.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. Perhaps my red hair was just too red to really process? I just did a couple highlighting strips and this was pretty ineffective. It lightened maybe two shades lighter in two hours? And yes, I have bleached my red hair before with other products, and this one pales in comparison.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It bleached my hair in no time and worked the way a product should. Shipping was fast and quick and even came with extras. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I bought this product, I usually bleach my hair with the bleaching kit in Splat Hair dye (which works wonderfully [for me]) and I thought it&#x27;d be good to go and try new things....well when I used this product it didn&#x27;t do much at all (I have naturally black hair). I had left it in my hair for longer than the box said to because I figured I&#x27;d have to wait longer because my hair is so dark. The product burned my scalp and damaged my hair worse than usual, the tips of my hair were rubber-like. I don&#x27;t recommend Manic Panic unless you&#x27;re coloring it some crazy color</li>
    <li> It really sucked the color out of my hair in no time.  A bit of warning for anyone new to bleaching.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  (as though you needed reminding *laughs*)  In all seriousness though, if you keep it on too long or decide in a few months to rebleach the color out of your hair, there is a distinct possibility of your hair turning into pudding with so many applications.  Being a newb myself, I ended up getting bored with my purple streaks within a month&#x27;s time and ended up rebleaching.  Some of my hair turned into a mixture of pudding and straw.  Luckily, my hair was salvageable by using other products to help it recoup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find yourself in a similar situation where you have bleached your hair into a massive pile of almost a goopy nature, I can advise you in some fashion (although, I am no pro)  I ended up cutting off the goopy parts and then using a protein spray from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  This particular spray was a leave-in treatment that had placenta...yes, you heard me, Pla-freaking-centa.  Gross, right?  But after about two or three weeks, my hair was very nearly back to normal.  With all the chemical treatments with dyes and bleaching I didn&#x27;t want to use any ordinary hair care product and use MORE chemicals (stay away from anything with dimethicone in it, it&#x27;ll only give you temporary smoothing results until it dries your hair out even MORE-this I learned from a hair care professional)  so I ended up slathering coconut oil on my hair about once or twice a week for added moisturizing.  It helped a great deal.  Although my damaged hair isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s also not breaking, or stretchy goo anymore either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, be mindful of how long you leave this bleach in and also mindful of how often you do it.  Its pretty powerful and its nice not having to sit around and wait forever and a day for the bleach to work.  I&#x27;d use this product again, just not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY BLEACHING!!</li>
    <li> The bleaching effect is awesome, but the amount is not very much. If you have thick hair, or hair longer than shoulder length but two boxes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bleached or dyed my hair before, so for my first go around I hit some youtube videos for info. I&#x27;ve know about Manic Panic for years. Admittedly, I just like the name. I was just doing a 2inch wide by 4inch tall, forehead to neck mohawk, and used about half of the powder. It came out clean and near white. I&#x27;d let my hair around the mohawk grow out (laziness), and the bleached hair was just as soft as the non bleached. I used to have long hair, and will back up that you&#x27;d need two, maybe three to bleach it right. Good product.</li>
    <li> Manic Panic Flash Lightening is our favorite precolor kit... we both have sensitive skin and have Never had problems with it we have used both 30 volume and 40 Volume if used right Manic panic is the easiest and safest hair product out there...</li>
    <li> I have very dark brown hair &amp; this product took it to platinum in record time. Be prepared to spend on conditioner though, the process is very drying.</li>
    <li> This is the best bleach kit we have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of my daughters have an affinity for Manic Panic hair dyes.  One daughter has fine textured, shoulder length, dark blonde hair and the other has very thick, short, dark brown hair.  This bleach works well on both of them without totally frying the hair.  We have tried other bleach and developers and have returned to this bleach kit every time.  The bleach creates a very platinum blonde base that is porous enough to take up a really nice saturation of Manic Panic dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have had dye absorption problems when we used other brands of bleach.  The hair was not left porous enough and the dye washed out too quickly.  We have had much better luck with the Manic Panic Flash Lightening 40 Volume Maximum Lift Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend two kits if you have long hair or anything more than medium length thick hair.</li>
    <li> As a multi-ethnic male w/basically black hair, I do enjoy coloring my hair from time 2 time. Lately tho, I have been longing 2 bleach my hair Bone White &amp; none of the store products like L&#x27;Oreal or what have U never really gets it 2 where I want or need. In fact, in store products, when bleaching dark hair like mine leave it orange &amp; just plain unattractive 4 me. I researched bleaching/toning products &amp; Manic Panic came up &amp; is very much a product familiar 2 me. After purchasing Manic Panics bleaching kit (&amp; virgin snow white toner), I have been nothing short of pleased. This stuff is AMAZING &amp; am in the process of making yet my 3rd purchase of this product &amp; will continue 2 buy this product cuz not only is it worth the price but it does X-ACTLY what I need &amp; want it 2 do. I was STUNNED as 2 how much was actually lifted from my hair &amp; how light it was. I love this product &amp; is my go-2 product whenever I want bleaching done.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT! IT TOOK ABOUT 30 MINS TO DYE A CHUNK OF MY HAIR IN THE FRONT WHICH WAS ALREADY LIGHT BROWN.  tHIS PRODUCT IS POWERFUL SO BE CAREFUL! IT IS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT IT WORKS! I WOULD BUT 2 BOXES FOR LONG HAIR.  THIS WAS A GREAT PRODUCT! CAME WITH GLOVES, BRUSH AND MIX. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. I had dyed jet black hair (originally dark brown) that has been dyed MANY times. This lifted the color perfectly to a snow white, and with proper after care, won&#x27;t make your hair fall out. Key words: WITH PROPER AFTERCARE. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Pulls ALL the color out of my dark brown hair fast and easily. I can get to platinum with no yellow undertones in about 20 min if I use foil and really do it right. If you have never bleached your hair yourself be smart and do your homework. Maybe google some tips from stylists and/or watch some youtube videos. Yes it will destroy your hair if you leave it on too long. Yes it will burn your scalp if you just slather it on first thing and then wait 30 min. Be smart! Do your ends first! Keep them warm with foil then apply to roots at the end of the process(also helps to not shampoo for about a weeks so your scalp can protect itself). Its a great, effective simple product if you just use it right. Plus, if you use the Manic Panic&#x27;s conditioning color afterwards it will help with some of the drying/damage from the bleach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this kit before and its the only thing that will lighten my hair enough to be dyed. I love this kit.   I recommend having a good conditioner on standby, otherwise your hair will be super fried. :)</li>
    <li> Loved it, it did what it needed without ruining my hair to the point of sorrow. Just don&#x27;t mix it all together and put the top on it! The bleach expands and explodes! Who knew?! Haha, lovely product though, works perfectly, worth the price.</li>
    <li> This had everything! Anything you would need to use to bleach your hair, you&#x27;re going to have in here. Well, minus the clips and hair brush :P At first when I looked in and was disappointed at first because I didn&#x27;t see everything in the box at first but then i opened the little tub/mixing bowl and it had the rest of the things there. The one thing I would say is that it did have very little bleach in it, which I could see would be disappointing to some people but I was bleaching only parts of my hair so it was good. I just wish I had more so I can keep doing it, but I&#x27;ll just buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have light hair so on the box it said to leave the bleach in for 60-90 minutes and I was so worried to do that because I thought it would like deep fry my hair or something, but I got the guts to try it and I left it in for 90 minutes and it still came out a bit orange-ish (nothing a little toner wont fix). To my surprise my hair was NOT fried! It was only lightly damaged, but I mean let&#x27;s be serious, when you bleach your hair you are bound to damage it, but this really took me by surprise! My bleached hair bits still feel soft! My friend actually was really impressed and wanted to get some for herself. But yeah, I was worried about like it damaging my hair and what not but it&#x27;s actually a terrific bleach to use. I&#x27;ve used other ones before and they roasted my hair after sitting in for 20 minutes so this is like magic. I would recommend this to anyone looking to use it.</li>
    <li> i used it and it did what it was surpossed to but i wouldn&#x27;t do it again and wouldnt recommend it</li>
    <li> I had a chemical spill in my bathroom &amp; ended up tossing my usual Ion bleach to be on the safe side. Instead of replacing the big bottle of developer &amp; bucket of powder, I got the Manic Panic flash lightening kit. I was too nervous to leave it on for longer than 45 minutes but that took me close to pale blonde. It also left my scalp itchy and dry for days. My hair appreciated it even less than my scalp did. My hair is still in a fairly fragile way (even though it&#x27;s been over a week since), I have to be so careful of breakage. Is it worse than the average brand of bleach? Probably not but I&#x27;m still going back to Ion sensitive scalp developer 30v which doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp as much and was easier for my hair to recover from.</li>
    <li> Did not come with everything listed on the box! So big let down on that front. Had to go out and buy it to actually use it. Which is an irritation.</li>
    <li> I followed the time line on the instructions but when I checked it at the suggested time I still had orange tips (my hair was medium brown) so I let it set for 2 more hours and the tips had only faded a little so I just went ahead and colored it. I used the Manic Panic Vampire Red and the tone was nice and even despite the orange tips. Great product you just have to be patient :)</li>
    <li> Like other reviews posted you definitely need more than one box if you&#x27;re looking to bleach you&#x27;re entire head.</li>
    <li> I wanted to ddedduse Manic Panic&#x27;s Wildfire but needed to bleach first.  I probably should have used 2 kits to get my hair to \\&quot;lemon yellow\\&quot; but I only had 1.  Someone wrote to add sugar, so I did &amp; it didn&#x27;t burn.  My hair was yellow to light orange but the haircolor covered it.  All in all a good experience!</li>
    <li> So I went over to a friends house to do the bleaching (My first time and I didn&#x27;t want to do it myself just in case I messed up) I have this light brownish color and I left the product in my hair for about 30-45 min and My hair came out the perfect color. It has high lights and has different shades of blonde. IT WASN&#x27;T BRASSY, so I didn&#x27;t need a toner. I put Punky colour in my bangs and it turned out really bright and pretty :) over all I love this bleach and I am  going to use this again. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I usually use Splat bleach, and this turned out way more amazing than Splat usually does, my hair is very thick and dark brown and it turned it pretty much entirely all a light blonde/white color. Great for bleaching before adding color dye. :D</li>
    <li> I have dark brown, nearing black natural hair color. At the time I had hair down to the middle of my back, but I cut it off up to my chin before using this and boy I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 kits. While I have short hair, it is thick and I barely had enough to do my head. With one kit. Again, I&#x27;m glad I got 2 because, while my natural highlights became platinum blonde along with my bangs and the hair around my face, the rest was a dark orange/light brown and apparently I had missed spots, but I know I didn&#x27;t because I sectioned off my hair doing each part. Needless to say my hair was fried and I&#x27;d recommend a deep conditioner to be used right after. Morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a full 24 hours before I used the 2nd kit and started with the tips first as they were the darkest and waited the full 90 minutes. I came out more blonde, but now less orange. Needless to day I need to tone it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson if you have dark brown/nearing black hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy 2 to 3 kits. (it is not a lot of powder)&lt;br /&gt;Go from tips to root. (The tips take the longest.)&lt;br /&gt;Start with the back of your head. (might want a friend for this if hair is longer than your shoulders)&lt;br /&gt;Have a deep conditioner ready. (wait for hair to dry naturally. Do not use blow dryer. Your hair is already like straw don&#x27;t make it worse.)&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;ve used shampoo and your deep conditioner (as the box says) wait for it to dry naturally, then only condition it again.&lt;br /&gt;Condition repeatedly morning and night if you can.&lt;br /&gt;Have a toner ready. (you&#x27;re likely to be orange or brassy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy yourself as a blonde...or dye your hair your chosen color.</li>
    <li> This was my first time bleaching my hair, and I have to admit I was pretty freaked out. Thought it would fizz away, lol. But it went fine. Applying wasn&#x27;t too difficult, athough it is a pretty runny solution, so be careful. It has super strong fumes, so use it somewhere with great ventilation. Once I applied and wrapped it up, I checked it every so often for the color I wanted, then rinsed when ready. I imagine all bleach damages hair somewhat, and this one is no exception. But it wasn&#x27;t bad. I only applied it to the ends, which were already long and somewhat damaged anyway, not to mention dyed several times before. Here, two months later, with regular conditioning, the split ends are hardly noticable. It worked well for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I used this kit on the underside of my 26 inch long hair, before coloring it with a Punky Color product. My hair is naturally dark brown, but had previously been bleached and dyed purple with a Splat product, and then dyed back to my natural color. While this kit didn&#x27;t completely remove the purple stain under the brown dye, it faded it to a very light pink, to the point that once the teal dye was applied, you couldn&#x27;t tell it was once purple. I applied it myself, it was simple to do, and it achieved the results I was looking for. I let it process for 2 hours, wrapped it plastic and a heating pad.</li>
    <li> It would&#x27;ve been cheaper to go to a discount store and buy bleach and developer but it seemed easiest this way at the time. It takes FOREVER to work and when it does it bleaches a lot less that I thought for 40Vol developer. There&#x27;s barely any in here but it did come with a brush, cap, and bowl so it was conveniently package just needs to be repriced!</li>
    <li> I ended up going to Sally&#x27;s and getting bleach and developer and it was a good thing as there wasn&#x27;t enough in this kit to do my hair.  I have thick hair but it&#x27;s very short and I would have needed at least two of these kits to bleach my hair.  I also mixed a 30 developer with this as I decided that the 40 would be too strong.  If you&#x27;re wanted to just dye little bits of your hair this would be okay but it would be cheaper to just buy the bleach and developer separate.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!  I&#x27;ve used this brand any time I need to bleach my hair.  Word of advice if you plan on bleaching your hair and don&#x27;t want it to get fried chemical style, pre condition your hair.  I&#x27;m getting ready to bleach again to get it all the way blonde and I preconditioned with Aussie 3 minute miracle every day for a week and don&#x27;t shampoo.  Maybe not the best thing to do but better than chemically fried hair.</li>
