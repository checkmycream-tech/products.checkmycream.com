      <li>TO SELL MORE!!!  </li>
      <li>this stuff is great</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, great service with shipping and all.</li>
      <li>The sportin waves is a great product for 360 waves.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a  shame too  because Murray&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work or smell as good</li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>good good good good goooooooood stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so good, I send it to my family members overseas</li>
      <li>It gives me those awesome waves that have my short cut looking awesome.</li>
      <li>My wife and I laughed when we saw that a seller had put this on amazon, but we liked the price so, voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At $3 a can most places, the is a product you MUST experiment with!</li>
      <li>more and voila- dashing again!</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic!</li>
      <li>Hair feels like if there is nothing in it, but gives hair a nice sheen.</li>
      <li>Sets quickly, soft and touchable (like to keep it that way for the ladies ;D ), smells good, awesome separation and control.</li>
      <li>I hope they never stop making it :)</li>
      <li>I love this pomade.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years, but the latest ones I have purchased have a thinner, greasier feel to the product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>the other formula lasted a long time worked  perfectly and smelled great.  </li>
      <li>It was cheap and worked well for spiking my hair up in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;</li>
      <li>The product itself is great and it also came four days earlier than It said on the delivery date. .</li>
      <li>This is the best hair gel that I have found for my coarse straight hair.  </li>
      <li>Original and genuin product</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dapper, simple, weightless, gorgeous styling on the cheap.</li>
      <li>It also has a cool cumulative effect-</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot at a time and it has a fairly appealing scent.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the product doesn&#x27;t work as well and seems to just lay on my hair rather than creating any hold that can be properly styled.</li>
      <li>Rubs in easy and is soft.  </li>
      <li>The new formula is BS!!!</li>
      <li>does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Then you can run a comb through your hair to get the gel spread pretty evenly throughout.</li>
      <li>but overall, I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>it holds my hair exactly how i like it for as long as i want and it washes away very cleanly with just a rinse of water.</li>
      <li>This is the most badass hair product I&#x27;ve stumbled across in a long time.</li>
      <li>but you can wash out the wax on your hands after application easily with simply water.  </li>
      <li>this new bs doesn&#x27;t work  and doesn&#x27;t smell as good and its  almost gone after a few weeks.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I used to really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo it out for days at a time, but every day my hair seems to look a little better for it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally use hair gel, but this stuff gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It even looks shinier, smells different (a cheap, greasy smell) compared to the prior ones.</li>
      <li>When i was first starting to use grease to get 360 waves, i used this same exact</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and you can run you finger through your hair and it is soft.</li>
      <li>Soft, sheeny, effortless styling.</li>
      <li>Not heavy and didn&#x27;t clump my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it literally all of my life, and I&#x27;m 30 years old.</li>
      <li>I keep my hair short most of the time due to the fact that it curls once over an inch long</li>
      <li>it doesnt leave your hair grey/ashy looking like most products, i have black hair that is very straight an thick</li>
      <li>the original but its 10 times  better than this crap</li>
      <li>Sometimes one application doesn&#x27;t keep humidity out on the most brutal days (important consideration in the Deep South), but if the oil-based protection starts to flag a bit</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use hair gel, but this stuff gets the job done. You simply get your hair a little wet, put some on your fingers, and run them through your hair. Then you can run a comb through your hair to get the gel spread pretty evenly throughout. You really don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot at a time and it has a fairly appealing scent.</li>
    <li> This is the most badass hair product I&#x27;ve stumbled across in a long time. I&#x27;m a white guy with thick, curly, longish hair. I get out of the shower, towel dry or blow dry my hair to dampness, and run a generous portion of Sportin&#x27; Waves through. Soft, sheeny, effortless styling. Sets quickly, soft and touchable (like to keep it that way for the ladies ;D ), smells good, awesome separation and control. This stuff is magic! Sometimes one application doesn&#x27;t keep humidity out on the most brutal days (important consideration in the Deep South), but if the oil-based protection starts to flag a bit I just apply a dab more and voila- dashing again! It also has a cool cumulative effect- I don&#x27;t shampoo it out for days at a time, but every day my hair seems to look a little better for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dapper, simple, weightless, gorgeous styling on the cheap. Everyone has different hair and thus different styling needs, but I think I&#x27;m going to start buying this stuff by the case. At $3 a can most places, the is a product you MUST experiment with!</li>
    <li> I used to really like this stuff. It was cheap and worked well for spiking my hair up in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSITIVES&lt;br /&gt;1. Not heavy and didn&#x27;t clump my hair&lt;br /&gt;2. It kept my hair in place&lt;br /&gt;3. No smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;1. Caused my forehead to breakout (once I switched to a different gel, I stopped breaking out&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t work well when your hairs too wet</li>
    <li> Have been using it for last 2 years to spike my hair after I dry them.&lt;br /&gt;Now girls check me out.</li>
    <li> The new formula is BS!!! I know why they made  this &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; crap too. TO SELL MORE!!!  the other formula lasted a long time worked  perfectly and smelled great.  this new bs doesn&#x27;t work  and doesn&#x27;t smell as good and its  almost gone after a few weeks. guess I gotta use Murray&#x27;s now.  it&#x27;s a  shame too  because Murray&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work or smell as good the original but its 10 times  better than this crap</li>
    <li> my son use this product and he likes it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels stiff after I rinse. So greasy also..</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff since 1997 when I discovered it by accident at the drug store. I keep my hair short most of the time due to the fact that it curls once over an inch long and I only need a bit of pomade here and there when the my hair gets longer between haircuts. This stuff is so good, I send it to my family members overseas everytime I get a chance. I hope they never stop making it :)</li>
    <li> works its wonder if applied regularly.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great I&#x27;m a white dude with average length hair and kinda of thick. Get out of the shower, dry your hair with a towel take about of tablespoon of this stuff rub it between your fingers and then through your hair and style it the way you want. Once your hair is dry it stays the way you styled it. Also The next morning when you wake up you can restyle it back to way you had it ,Talking about no bed hair. It is not greasy and you can run you finger through your hair and it is soft. this probably the greatest cheapest stuff on earth</li>
    <li> Shipment was a bit slow but overall, I am satisfied. Original and genuin product</li>
    <li> Rubs in easy and is soft.  I prefer this over Dax and others.  Washes out easier.  Don&#x27;t know why I have to write something in the review box.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great and it also came four days earlier than It said on the delivery date. .</li>
    <li> sportin waves is the only hair product i will ever use. it doesnt leave your hair grey/ashy looking like most products, i have black hair that is very straight an thick and this is the only stuff that will hold my hair down without making me look like a porcupine.  it holds my hair exactly how i like it for as long as i want and it washes away very cleanly with just a rinse of water.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade. I&#x27;ve been using it literally all of my life, and I&#x27;m 30 years old. It gives me those awesome waves that have my short cut looking awesome. I love this stuff.</li>

Most importantly, the product doesn&#x27;t work as well and seems to just lay on my hair rather than creating any hold that can be properly styled.</li>
    <li> The sportin waves is a great product for 360 waves.When i was first starting to use grease to get 360 waves, i used this same exact product.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Not greasy.  Hair feels like if there is nothing in it, but gives hair a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> good stuff. good good good good goooooooood stuff. it works. just like the title says. does exactly what it says it does.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. My wife and I laughed when we saw that a seller had put this on amazon, but we liked the price so, voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service with shipping and all.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel that I have found for my coarse straight hair.  I use very little of it and it will keep my hair in place, all day long.  It does not flake nor does it feel oily.  It is somewhat waxy on your hands but you can wash out the wax on your hands after application easily with simply water.  I bought 4 cans of it so I can share them with my family and relatives.</li>
