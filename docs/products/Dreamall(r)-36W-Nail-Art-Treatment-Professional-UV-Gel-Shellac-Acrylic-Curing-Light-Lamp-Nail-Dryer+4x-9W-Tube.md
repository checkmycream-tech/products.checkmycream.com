      <li>I would have to say invest the money on something better</li>
      <li>kind of cheaply made...</li>
      <li>The product its self, as far as curing, was great.</li>
      <li>It was a great product but only lasted 6 months.</li>
      <li>When I received my light it had a defect.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a handful of uses the light started to smell wierd and smoke started comming from the light.</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller to get a refund and they are only willing to refund $10 do to their &amp;#34;loss of profit.&amp;#34; However they are the ones selling defective FIRE HAZZARD light!!!</li>
      <li>They loosened easily but I was willing to deal with that.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described!  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was my first time using the shellac email products with Dreamall curer.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as advertised, I have had no problems with it at all.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t use it for the first time till over a month after I bought it.</li>
      <li>If I would have gone to the nail salon, I would only have been able to get my nails done once.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works much better than the last one I ordered that just did not cure the gel polish at all.</li>
      <li>every time I use it I have to mess with bulbs to get them to come on... wish I would have spent a bit more and got a better one... but its ok</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than air dry.</li>
      <li>and if I have it on the timer all light just flicker constantly!</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>the far left light don&#x27;t work...</li>
      <li>The dryer came with 4 lights after the irst use, one light bulb became loose and fell &amp; broke</li>
      <li>I thought that I had gotten a defective light but after reading reviews, this has happened to other buyers as well.</li>
      <li>it looks new</li>
      <li>Gave three stars because the timer doesn&#x27;t work and item was described as new</li>
      <li>but it arrived before the date stated appears to work, is a little flimsy but it is cheap</li>
      <li>Got here early.</li>

<li> Smoke started pouring out of the back where the cord is connected to the base.</li>
<li> Was not happy at all!</li>
<li> so for the price that wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
<li> Bad quality.</li>
<li> And dangerous!</li>
<li> What a piece of crap.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not happy at all! Did not work and they wanted a photo or video of turning it on or the default. I could not do that for them.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 1 star because I got this in November and I used it about 3-4 times and the lights started to flicker and the back started part started making weird noises and it burned out completely. I would have to say invest the money on something better that&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Gave it to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.</li>
    <li> It was a great product but only lasted 6 months. I love doing my own nails so I was using it  at least once a week so for the price that wasn&#x27;t so bad. If I would have gone to the nail salon, I would only have been able to get my nails done once. The product its self, as far as curing, was great.</li>
    <li> Great machine. It works just like the one in the salon. If you have watched your manicurist carefully, you can do this yourself. It looks like a professional did my nails.</li>
    <li> Broke after 2nd use. Waste of money. And dangerous! Seems like it shorted somehow and smoke came out of the machine and it never worked again. I would have returned it but I didn&#x27;t use it for the first time till over a month after I bought it. Bad quality.</li>
    <li> I received this 24 days after paying for it. Then only to have some weird two pole plugin on it that I&#x27;m unable to use.  Will have to return and get my money back. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This works okay the timer stopped working right away which kinda sucks.</li>
    <li> It was my first time using the shellac email products with Dreamall curer. I am very happy it worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I actually give it 0 stars.... DO NOT BUY!!! YOU WONT GET YOUR PRODUCT OR YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!</li>
    <li> Got here early. Love this.</li>
    <li> The dryer came with 4 lights after the irst use, one light bulb became loose and fell &amp; broke</li>
    <li> If only it had instruction about the switches does not tell you what there for.</li>
    <li> i got it thank you love it</li>
    <li> Works great, love it! Works exactly as advertised, I have had no problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> Gave three stars because the timer doesn&#x27;t work and item was described as new it looks new but when I recieved it, it was wrapped in bubble wrap (not in a box) the lights came in a box, no instructions, no pamphlet nothing</li>
    <li> When I received my light it had a defect.....the far left light don&#x27;t work...it&#x27;s not the bulb it&#x27;s the socket...and if I have it on the timer all light just flicker constantly! I realize it was onlly, 20 bucks but come on!!</li>
    <li> Received my nail dryer, plugged it in and nothing.  When I pick it up I hear a screw rolling around in the case and something else moving around in there. Never got it to work.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than air dry.</li>
    <li> This product worked less than 24 hours and the seller has yet to replace it with a new one as we agreed upon.</li>
    <li> kind of cheaply made... every time I use it I have to mess with bulbs to get them to come on... wish I would have spent a bit more and got a better one... but its ok</li>
    <li> Arrived very early in perfect condition! Excellent job. Works great and great price. Plug-in is compatible for U.S. Plenty space for all five fingers.</li>
    <li> Aside from one of the bulbs not working when I installed them it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;cured my nails just as it is supposed to&lt;br /&gt;it works much better than the last one I ordered that just did not cure the gel polish at all.</li>
    <li> Got home really fast, put the lights, and it work really good!!!! And the price is real cheap, thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in June and by the third use, the bulbs we already flickering. They loosened easily but I was willing to deal with that. Yesterday, however, I started smelling something odd. Smoke started pouring out of the back where the cord is connected to the base. Won&#x27;t be using it anymore since its a fire hazard. And now it&#x27;s past the return time. What a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realise that it was coming from China but it arrived before the date stated appears to work, is a little flimsy but it is cheap I&#x27;m happy I wou recommend if you&#x27;re happy to wait.</li>
    <li> Ninguno de las dos maquinas trabajaron y una de las maquinas estaba quebrada y los focos estaban tofos quebrados</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;After a handful of uses the light started to smell wierd and smoke started comming from the light. I thought that I had gotten a defective light but after reading reviews, this has happened to other buyers as well. I contacted the seller to get a refund and they are only willing to refund $10 do to their &amp;#34;loss of profit.&amp;#34; However they are the ones selling defective FIRE HAZZARD light!!!</li>
