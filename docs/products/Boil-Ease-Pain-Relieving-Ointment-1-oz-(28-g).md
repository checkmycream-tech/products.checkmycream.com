      <li>But I was slightly dissapointed because when I opened the package, it smelled sooo strong of the medicine.</li>
      <li>20% benzocaine is the only true painkiller for topical needs.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY stuff that really works.  </li>
      <li>surgeon prescribed oral and topical pain medicine and Ichthammol Ointment 20% strength, while allowing antibiotics to reduce my whole body infection.  </li>

<li> This \\&quot;pain relieving\\&quot; product is white and has a different ingredient list than the old black salve I wish it still was.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not the same as the old Boil Ease black \\&quot;Drawing</li>
<li> and they last a long time.</li>
<li> but it may have some drawing properties for some; good to have something especially for annoying boils.</li>
<li> The product was outdated and watery nevertheless, I refunded quickly by Amazon.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know if I love it, this was bought for someone else, so can&#x27;t give a five-star rating, sorry!</li>
<li> From the first day it cuts the pain in at least half.</li>
<li> It is the only product that I have used for the past 6 years that relieves the pain.  </li>
<li> Maybe the ingredients have had to change over the years due to regulations.  </li>
<li> I use boil-ease for mosquito bites, bee stings and other summer itches.</li>
<li> He described walking down a corridor with rooms on either side, and until each room is opened and cleaned out...</li>
<li> /&gt;Amazon need to remove sellers like you from their list because it can bring their reputation down as well.</li>
<li> If you are looking for black salve as Boil Ease used to be years ago, don&#x27;t be duped into buying this item, Boil Ease \\&quot;Pain</li>
<li> In less than 8 hours Ichthammol opened the boil, reducing my pain.  </li>
<li> I have tried many products for recurring boils - minor boils and major painful horrible multiple</li>
<li> The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful.</li>
<li> I have tried at least 50 other products to try to stop this most horrible pain.  </li>
<li> It made me feel like it might have been used already so made me a little hesitant to use it myself!</li>
<li> When I purchased Boil Ease in the past it worked for what I needed.  </li>
<li> you require pain relief, this will do the job, but if you are looking for something to get draw out the pus and getrid of a nasty boil quickly, look for some other product.</li>
<li> This company&#x27;s reputation and customer service is down right awful!</li>
<li> This time, I think I ordered the wrong ointment and can&#x27;t say one way or the other if it has anything to do with the results, which were negative.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t the black salve we had used some years ago--the active ingredient is benzocaine</li>
<li> Then it will at LEAST reduce the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some for \\&quot;just-in-case\\&quot;!</li>
<li> Very hard to find in our area.  </li>
<li> After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit.</li>
<li> Also, it seems to make the area less painful.</li>
<li> A boil is very painful and can last for a couple weeks.</li>
<li> I had order the wrong product.</li>
<li> What is wrong with you people?</li>
<li> /&gt;Ichthammol is a petroleum derivative, black vaseline type tool, expensive, feels and smells horrible.  </li>
<li> Remember there are other sellers besides you, and it is just awful</li>
<li> /&gt;The ointment does numb the pain of the boil, but it isn&#x27;t a drawing salve.</li>
<li> The surgeon informed me it is impossible to remedy</li>
<li> For all I care your business has already gained a bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Relief of painful boils.</li>
<li> Ichthammol caused the boil to reopen repeatedly, evacuating fluids and aided reducing the infection while I painfully awaited surgery.  </li>
<li> Boil wasn&#x27;t that painful</li>

    <li> I suffer from a skin condition called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I&#x27;ve been using Boil Ease for several months now and it does help reduce the pain a bit. It&#x27;s not as strong as prescription meds but it&#x27;s a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very hard to find in our area.  So glad Amaazon has it.  It numbs and helps heal, even my dog uses it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for black salve as Boil Ease used to be years ago, don&#x27;t be duped into buying this item, Boil Ease \\&quot;Pain Relieving Ointment.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s not the same as the old Boil Ease black \\&quot;Drawing Salve\\&quot; was.  This \\&quot;pain relieving\\&quot; product is white and has a different ingredient list than the old black salve I wish it still was.</li>
    <li> It does noy work very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if technically the thing on my dogs ankle was a boil, but was hoping this stuff  would help draw out the gunk in it and it really didn&#x27;t do much of anything after several days  use. Others have been satisfied, but honestly I&#x27;d give it half a star but to be fair I was using  it on my dog and probably the skin is tougher than what you&#x27;d encounter with your average boil.  If there is such a thing.</li>
    <li> This company&#x27;s reputation and customer service is down right awful! What is wrong with you people? Why can&#x27;t you treat your customers right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at your seller&#x27;s profile and you are lying when you quote \\&quot;About Seller American Wholesale is committed to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service.\\&quot; You meant to say providing the lowest standard of customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was my order just like all you wanted was my money. I tell you I thank the Lord I did not order the $300.00 worth of merchandise that I needed from you. I was told not to and to always start out with small ordered when first ordering from a company. For all I care your business has already gained a bad reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon need to remove sellers like you from their list because it can bring their reputation down as well. Remember there are other sellers besides you, and it is just awful I have to file a claim because you would not respond to your never will be your customer!!!</li>
    <li> It did not reach my expectations it was no help to my problem</li>
    <li> anyone with boil problems need to take zinc.  50 to 100 mg for preventive maintenance. Double the dosage for when you have them.</li>
    <li> Boil Ease works!  I have tried many products for recurring boils - minor boils and major painful horrible multiple boils that you think you have to go to the Emergency Room to heal.  But Boil Ease and frequent hot compresses work every time!</li>
    <li> Note that the current product says it&#x27;s a pain reliever.  It says nothing about helping to open and drain the boil.  Maybe the ingredients have had to change over the years due to regulations.  But I remember this product being different and more effective years ago.</li>
    <li> I got this when I needed to get rid of a boil under my arm. I was disappointed to see it wasn&#x27;t the black salve we had used some years ago--the active ingredient is benzocaine 20%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ointment does numb the pain of the boil, but it isn&#x27;t a drawing salve. The boil doesn&#x27;t come to a quicker end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you require pain relief, this will do the job, but if you are looking for something to get draw out the pus and getrid of a nasty boil quickly, look for some other product.</li>
    <li> Save your money. This didn&#x27;t help at all!</li>
    <li> I had order the wrong product. I knew what I want and thought this was it until I read the package and realized I was not trying to treat a boil but prevent one from forming in the first place. The return process was seamless, quick and painless. The funds were returned to my account in a week. Kudos to the seller for being so expeditious and understanding.</li>
    <li> Boil Ease Ointment Fast Relief From the Pain of Boils - 1 Oz.&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone ever GETS a boil. BUT.. IF you are one that DOES!&lt;br /&gt;Thank Goodness for this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It speeds the \\&quot;opening\\&quot; of boils, and if NOT helping in that way.. Then it will at LEAST reduce the pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some for \\&quot;just-in-case\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This product works as described, it is not intended to replace medical advise/attention, but works to relieve pain. I recommend following directions.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to have around if you have a minor burn while cooking. Immediate relief and also good to relieve pain from bruises etc.</li>
    <li> Only used it once on a boil; seemed to help.  Boil wasn&#x27;t that painful but it may have some drawing properties for some; good to have something especially for annoying boils.</li>
    <li> good, but not as good as old formula</li>
    <li> Bought a new Boil Ease over twelve years ago and has been working fine for a long time.  Just bought a new one and it just works as efficiently as the first one.  This is a great medicine product for boil or acne on the body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using boil ease for years and it works very well, however, this particular product was defective.  It actually had grit in it. Called the manufacturer and they happily replaced it. Recommend the product highly</li>
    <li> 20% benzocaine is the only true painkiller for topical needs.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; boil ease had the ichthamol  in it and worked wonders. This is just a pain reliever and you will have to buy the salve separately.</li>
    <li> This product works for pimples or boils and does the job fast and well. A boil is very painful and can last for a couple weeks. This product helps it go away in about 4 days. It can be a bit greasy but it&#x27;s worth it to get rid of a boil. On a pimple you could use it at night only. Would recommend! This is my second tube and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> THIS CREAM WORKS WONDERS FOR CYSTS</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if I love it, this was bought for someone else, so can&#x27;t give a five-star rating, sorry!</li>
    <li> My general practitioner prescribed antibiotics and had me try Boil Ease in lieu of sending me to a surgeon, in conjunction with epsom salt soakings...after suffering with a boil for ten days.  This white cream product did not draw out the boil and epson salts only helped marginally in reducing the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the GP sent me to a surgeon.  The surgeon informed me it is impossible to remedy boils with creams and lotions.  He described walking down a corridor with rooms on either side, and until each room is opened and cleaned out...the boil will simply recur.  Once opened up via surgery, surgeons scrub out the rooms and pack them with antibiotics and pain medications.  I appreciate a GP recommending alternative useful medications, known to get results without surgery.  However, my first visit with this condition warranted faster action, as I was visibily pale (from infection), in considerable pain, and sleep deprived.  He is no longer my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surgeon prescribed oral and topical pain medicine and Ichthammol Ointment 20% strength, while allowing antibiotics to reduce my whole body infection.  I continued epson salt soakings follwed by pain medicine applications topped with Ichthammol ointment.  In less than 8 hours Ichthammol opened the boil, reducing my pain.  Ichthammol caused the boil to reopen repeatedly, evacuating fluids and aided reducing the infection while I painfully awaited surgery.  Boil Ease accomplished none of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ichthammol is a petroleum derivative, black vaseline type tool, expensive, feels and smells horrible.  I tell people it \\&quot;Could (proverbially) suck a golf ball through a garden hose\\&quot;...and recommend they try it on chiggers, bee stings, and all insect bites...to draw out toxins.</li>
    <li> I recently had two boils come up on my skin; I remembered as a child my mother used \\&quot;Boil-Ease\\&quot; so, I ordered it.  I was amazed at how fast it worked, without all the  pain! I highly recommend it to your  patrons.</li>
    <li> Relief of painful boils. It does what it says and I will probably purchase more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> Had my boil for almost a week notHing worked but THIS PRODUCT the same day I used  it the boil pooped and the pain went away instantly</li>
    <li> I have to use this occasionally and always keep on hand.  Thankfully I have had no occasion to have to use this recently.  I have used it before and it works great.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!!! It does just what is says it does!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome product!! I only wish that I had ordered it sooner!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use boil-ease for mosquito bites, bee stings and other summer itches. It is an excellent pain reliever for minor skin abrasions of any kind. I can&#x27;t do without it in the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the many years.  It is effective on reducing boils quickly.  I was pleased with the low price too.</li>
    <li> Boil Ease is an excellent ointment to use on a painful boil.  My understanding is that the ointment no longer can be considered a drawing salve, but I find it still seems to speed the process. Also, it seems to make the area less painful.</li>
    <li> this is a really good product.i would recconmend to anyone that has a boil.best to wait for the boil to drain befor applying.this is a livesafer.like the fact you dont need a  prescription for this.shipping was excellent...thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY stuff that really works.  I&#x27;ve had my boils lanced, taken antibiotics and seen multiple dermatologists and doctors.  This does the job.  I just wish they would invent something that keeps the boils from returning but ... until then I have Boil Ease!</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Fast relief!!</li>
    <li> The product was outdated and watery nevertheless, I refunded quickly by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this to relieve the pain from shingles.  It is the only product that I have used for the past 6 years that relieves the pain.  I have tried at least 50 other products to try to stop this most horrible pain.  It takes two or three days to work fully.  From the first day it cuts the pain in at least half.</li>
    <li> I suffer from HS and bought it for this. This is great for itches as well. It numbs the area so you can forget about it, i.e. mosquito bite, etc. I also use it for my edges. After I got my hair braided it was tight and annoying and I am using it for a few days until my hair loosens a bit. I will also use if for my eyebrows when I pluck. Apply first, leave for a few minutes, then wipe. The product should have numbed the area long enough and makes tweezing/waxing less painful. I will buy many times.</li>
    <li> When I purchased Boil Ease in the past it worked for what I needed.  This time, I think I ordered the wrong ointment and can&#x27;t say one way or the other if it has anything to do with the results, which were negative.  I will continue to use Boil Ease for what it was intended and not for what I needed now.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.  The local pharmacy was out of stock.</li>
    <li> good stuff . it works</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, but product did not help with pain.  Not sellers fault.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find this product as I have been searching everywhere for it! But I was slightly dissapointed because when I opened the package, it smelled sooo strong of the medicine. And when I opened the box to get the tube out...the lid was un-screwed!! It made me feel like it might have been used already so made me a little hesitant to use it myself! But that was the only downfall of it. The product itself is good and works well.</li>
    <li> Really works to ease the pain. Glad I ordered</li>
