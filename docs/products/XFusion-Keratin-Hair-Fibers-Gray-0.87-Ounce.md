### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very very happy with this product and will be buying again!</li>
      <li>Sprinkle it on your scalp wherever you see sparse spots and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Seems to work best for me.  </li>
      <li>I use the hairspray too, it has a delightful smell and is not aerosol, which is a plus.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the product it did its job</li>
      <li>Love it!!!!</li>
      <li>Just sprinkle it on the top of your scalp and your done!!!  </li>
      <li>This product does a VERY good job of filling in thinning areas of hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>The color is great now that I have turned gray.</li>
      <li>It worked great for covering, but I seem to be allergic because I had nosebleeds.</li>
      <li>Great price, about 40% the price than at the salon.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>It sticks amazingly well and does not come out till I wash it out.  </li>
      <li>Got this product at my hairdresser and liked it.  </li>
      <li>t&#x27;s perfect - fills in completely and invisibly - she is delighted -</li>
      <li>but I can say honestly, for me, that it has been a really GREAT product that leaves me feeling like I have a full head of hair now.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A VERY FINE POWDER THAT JUST FLIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.  </li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the thinning of my hair on top.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>If you use the add-on applicator top, you have to remove the shaker top from the container.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It works just fine like it is.</li>
      <li>Makes thinning areas look as if you have a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>Better yet, it has stayed put, except for the time I thoughtlessly rubbed at it and found that I had sprinkled a bit into my highly sensitive eyes.  </li>
      <li>but the result is well worth my time.</li>
      <li>I had some hesitation about paying this much for the product, but now I see that it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I use sparingly and only on top.</li>
      <li>After reading the positive reviews, I decided to give the product a try.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time two days ago and was absolutely amazed at the results - as was my sister, who noticed immediately.  </li>
      <li>This product does camouflage my large cowlick.  </li>
      <li>Shipped on time and very satisfactory.</li>
      <li>It is really helpful with thinning gray hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Works great to cover my thin spots.  </li>
      <li>At only 63 years of age and despite diet changes, I have been rather dejected over the fact that the huge bald spot at the front of my head was steadily growing.  </li>
      <li>The light brown works much better than the dark brown because it is possible to apply it unevenly and then it is more noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I mix the grey with a light brown as that is what my hair is now.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safe and not a chemical, and I sprinkle it lightly on the thin spots after I fix my hair.</li>
      <li>As an older person with very thinning hair, I appreciate the product as it does what it says when used properly.  </li>
      <li>Noting the warning from others about overdoing it, I pulled the adhesive covering only about a third of the way back and sprinkled lightly, fluffing the hair around the spot gently all the while.  </li>
      <li>MY BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN A COATING OF DARK POWDER THAT SMEARED WHEN I TRIED TO CLEAN IT UP.  </li>
      <li>It does not flake off or rub off during sleep -- no  messy pillow.</li>
      <li>So far this works for me.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s probably not something that that you&#x27;ll use everyday unless you buy it by the barrel, but for those occasions where you want your hair to look full and natural this is what your need.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I was very self conscious of the way my pink scalp would shine though and was looking for affordable remedies.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, the irritation was minimal and short-lived, but one does need to be careful.</li>
      <li>This actually works and it looks natural.</li>
      <li>Makes hair look thicker, no pink scalp showing through.  </li>
      <li>Tried other more expensive brands and have to admit this product is as good as the others...if not superior.  </li>
      <li>Right before my eyes and after only a few shakes, the bald spot all but disappeared.  </li>

    <li> I used this product for the first time two days ago and was absolutely amazed at the results - as was my sister, who noticed immediately.  At only 63 years of age and despite diet changes, I have been rather dejected over the fact that the huge bald spot at the front of my head was steadily growing.  Noting the warning from others about overdoing it, I pulled the adhesive covering only about a third of the way back and sprinkled lightly, fluffing the hair around the spot gently all the while.  Right before my eyes and after only a few shakes, the bald spot all but disappeared.  Better yet, it has stayed put, except for the time I thoughtlessly rubbed at it and found that I had sprinkled a bit into my highly sensitive eyes.  Fortunately, the irritation was minimal and short-lived, but one does need to be careful. I will be from now on, as this product&#x27;s taken years off my appearance - a definite keeper!</li>
    <li> Great price, about 40% the price than at the salon. Where has this Miricale Hair thickener been the past 20 yrs?  It truly works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product over a year and I love it.  It fills in the balding spots in my scalp.  The only negative thing I could add is that sometimes it flakes all over my bathroom floor - but the benefits outweigh the negative.  Shipping of this product is prompt and usally arrives before the target date.</li>
    <li> Product can work, but this particular order seemed to be mixed with larger, white paper-like particles which I didn&#x27;t notice till half used.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews, I decided to give the product a try.  It does everything it says it will.  Makes hair look thicker, no pink scalp showing through.  It does not flake off or rub off during sleep -- no  messy pillow. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product it did its job</li>
    <li> I do not particularly like this product.  It does not stay on my scalp like the Toppik I have been using.  I will not order this again.  I will just stick with my Toppik.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product does a VERY good job of filling in thinning areas of hair.  I was skeptical that this would really work but I can say honestly, for me, that it has been a really GREAT product that leaves me feeling like I have a full head of hair now.  It requires daily use but the result is well worth my time.</li>
    <li> Got this product at my hairdresser and liked it.  She doesn&#x27;t always have it on hand so I ordered it. She said it&#x27;s actually shredded sheep&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s safe and not a chemical, and I sprinkle it lightly on the thin spots after I fix my hair. My hairdresser matched it to my hair color.</li>
    <li> helps cover a shiny scalp</li>
    <li> You can mix some of this with another color and get kind-of grey.</li>
    <li> Update. Not sure this is actual product by XFusion. It was NOT sealed with their standard seal. In spite of that, whatever it is, it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it really helps with thinning hair. It is really helpful with thinning gray hair.</li>
    <li> It does what I hoped, covers my scalp showing through where hair has thinned out. I use sparingly and only on top.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I highly recommend to anyone dealing with thin hair.  It covers the scalp with the same color as hair so there is no flesh colored scalp showing through</li>
    <li> hi - got it for my neighbor - (i&#x27;ll never be grey that you can see, that is) t&#x27;s perfect - fills in completely and invisibly - she is delighted -</li>
    <li> Works great to cover my thin spots.  Ordered again!</li>
    <li> It worked great for covering, but I seem to be allergic because I had nosebleeds. I wish I could continue to use it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it was exactly what I expected.  Shipped on time and very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> No more pink scalp!!!  I love it....makes my hair look thicker, and it just washes out!!!  Just sprinkle it on the top of your scalp and your done!!!  Love it....Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Tried other more expensive brands and have to admit this product is as good as the others...if not superior.  It does in fact, when used properly,  give the illusion of a fuller head of hair, so  If you&#x27;re looking for a temporary hair fix, you might give this product a try!</li>
    <li> WHAT A MESS!  THIS IS A VERY FINE POWDER THAT JUST FLIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.  MY BATHROOM WAS COVERED IN A COATING OF DARK POWDER THAT SMEARED WHEN I TRIED TO CLEAN IT UP.  NOT TO MENTION THE TOWEL I PUT OVER MY SHOULDERS TO PROTECT MY CLOTHING.  FOR ME, THIS WAS A MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY.  IT DOES MAKE HAIR LOOK THICKER, BUT JUST GET IT WET AND IT&#x27;S GONE!</li>
    <li> As an older person with very thinning hair, I appreciate the product as it does what it says when used properly.  This seller has always been prompt and reliable for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Xfusion product for two or three years now.  My hair is getting very thin on top ( I think because of long term anticoagulation therapy) and this product makes it possible for me to be the only one who knows about it.  Except for my hairdresser, of course.  It sticks amazingly well and does not come out till I wash it out.  I use the hairspray too, it has a delightful smell and is not aerosol, which is a plus.  I mix the grey with a light brown as that is what my hair is now.  Only think I wish they might consider is mixing some of the colors themselves.  The light brown works much better than the dark brown because it is possible to apply it unevenly and then it is more noticeable.  I use the adaptor rather than shaking the product on my hair.  Seems to work best for me.  PLEASE do not change or stop making this product.  It works just fine like it is.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Sprinkle it on your scalp wherever you see sparse spots and it works wonderfully.The color is great now that I have turned gray.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> This actually works and it looks natural. If you have thinning hair and the scalp showing through, then this is a must. I would recommend getting the dispenser since it is hard to apply evenly to the back of the head. I had some hesitation about paying this much for the product, but now I see that it is worth every penny. If you use the add-on applicator top, you have to remove the shaker top from the container. Be very careful that you don&#x27;t lose your grip or you&#x27;ll end of with the product all over the floor with no hope of recovery. Xfusion washes out so it&#x27;s probably not something that that you&#x27;ll use everyday unless you buy it by the barrel, but for those occasions where you want your hair to look full and natural this is what your need.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced this to me.  My hair is thinning due to medications and this fills in on the scalp and makes my hair look thicker.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Makes thinning areas look as if you have a full head of hair.  Comb out before going to bed because powder residue will stain pillows.</li>
    <li> This product does camouflage my large cowlick.  So far this works for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the thinning of my hair on top. I was very self conscious of the way my pink scalp would shine though and was looking for affordable remedies. This did it! I sprinkle it on the thin spots after I shower and blow dry my hair and it stays in until I wash my hair again. I am very very happy with this product and will be buying again!</li>
