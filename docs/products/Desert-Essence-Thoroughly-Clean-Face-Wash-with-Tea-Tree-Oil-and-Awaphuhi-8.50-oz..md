      <li>Plus I tend to be a little reactive to some skincare products but this was great!</li>

      <li>I will admit the consistence of the cleanser is like liquid/water but as soon as you message the product in your hands the foaming action is really good.</li>
      <li>Picked up this product because I read so many good reviews about this facial wash.</li>
      <li>This face wash requires a specific process to be effective: lather your face with the soap and warm water and wash for about a minute before rinsing it with</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne-prone skin or burn in cuts or anything, but this soap hates eyeballs and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>

      <li>Quick shipping.</li>

      <li>This face wash is really nice - my skin feels clean &amp; fresh after I use it, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out like with some cleansers.</li>
      <li>I am trying to use more natural products and bought this at a health food store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely uninterested in even looking for anything better.  </li>
      <li>The combo is simple yet effective.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just such a basic expectation that on principle, I can&#x27;t rate a good thing more than 3 stars if they can&#x27;t even get the product to me.</li>

    <li> This face wash is really nice - my skin feels clean &amp; fresh after I use it, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out like with some cleansers.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a long time ago and it worked wonders for clearing up my face. I couldn&#x27;t find it in my usual stores so I decided to go online. I would buy from this seller again, I received the product very quickly. My only thing is that they changed the bottle and must have changed the formula a little. The bottle shown in the picture is different that what I received and the face wash seems a little different, it lathers more. Although I will say be careful when you use the pump, the liquid squirts out very far and fast. I had it up on the ledge in my shower, which was about eye level and it squirted directly in my eye. I couldn&#x27;t open my eye for a half and hour and it was very painful. For those accident prone people out there like me, be aware. :)    This is one of my must have products for my face. Tea tree oil really works to clear up acne prone skin without drying your face out.</li>
    <li> Why I chose this product  I chose this product because it&#x27;s 100% natural, 100% vegan (contains no animal products) and is not tested on animals. All great selling points for me.    My Opinion    I love this product! If I didn&#x27;t love it I would honestly say so, but I loved this so much that I bought the larger [[ASIN:B000EHWBDS Thoroughly Clean Face Wash 32 fl oz]]as its MUCH cheaper. I use this daily with a gentle flannel and my breakouts are kept to a minimum (no small feat considering how much I sweat! - I work in the fitness industry). Now it does smell a little of antiseptic, but it&#x27;s a natural smell and not overpowering. Plus you only need a LITTLE each time as it goes a LONG way! The 32oz bottle I bought below has lasted around 8 months so far, and I have just under half the bottle left.     I really wish I&#x27;d known about this face wash in my teens (if it was around then? lol) as it really seems to suit my skin type leaving my face smooth and refreshed without drying it out. Plus I tend to be a little reactive to some skincare products but this was great! Also if you have acne prone teens I&#x27;d suggest trying this for sure!      Anyway just my opinion on this product</li>
    <li> Been buying this for years at Trader Joes. They stopped carrying it and came out with their own product. NOT the same. I love this stuff. Have gotten several friends hooked on it. Before I started using, I bought only expensive name-brand cleansing lotions. What a waste!</li>
    <li> Love using this on my skin. It burned at first but over time my skin became used to it and my skin has cleared up.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this stuff, because my younger sister had really good results.  The smell is kinda weird, but not bad.  It does definitely help with my oily skin (but is too drying for me).  I really like that it is all natural, but it hasn&#x27;t helped with my pimples and I think my skin might even be bumpier than usual.  This stuff is also really runny.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the large bottle.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again. :(</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item through Trader Joe&#x27;s before, but cannot find it at my local store anymore which is a shame because I love this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily and acne prone skin but also have areas of dryness and this is perfect for everything.  I use it once a day or once every other day.  It helps keep the oil away and does not over-dry my face, but my face feels perfectly clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not smell froofy or girly.  It is very natural smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer bottle is improved both design wise and aesthetically than what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will purchase it again.  It lasts a long time even with daily use so I may not purchase for a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to see if it will help clear up my face but it didn&#x27;t  but my skin is  different from others it might work for others but it doesnt work for me thanks anyways!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this cleanser when I first started using it. I am trying to use more natural products and bought this at a health food store. Within 3 weeks, I started breaking out horribly, in places where I never got zits before. I gave it another week and the breakouts just got worse. I purchased the Dudu-Osun black soap as a replacement and started taking Vitamin B5 and my face is finally starting to clear up, but I still have a lot of marks on my face from the breakouts. So if you start using this and a month later can&#x27;t figure out why your skin is freaking out, it could very well be this product causing your issues. Use with caution folks....wish I would have never picked this up. Would have saved me a lot of trouble.</li>
    <li> My sister first introduced me to this product. It really improved her skin problems. When I saw it on Amazon, I ordered it, because I was having some facial skin issues. It is truly amazing.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever had. Although I have to admit that I am generally not a big fan of the smell of tee trea oil and this basically smells like nothing but tea tree oil. BUT it works wonders on my skin and I will have to give it lots of credit for that.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any skin problems, pimples, blemishes or anything else of that sort since I started using this product and that has been for well over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;People even give me compliments for my fantastic skin now. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: works wonders, cleans amazingly, 100% better than all those harsh chemicals they \\&quot;throw after you\\&quot; at drugstores ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s: smells horrible (my personal opinion since I dislike tea tree oil), burns like fire if you get it in your eyes, it&#x27;s very runny which takes some getting used to, also some people might find it disturbing that this product doesn&#x27;t lather much (however that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t clean your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way in my case the CON&#x27;s don&#x27;t really matter as I am thrilled to have finally found a face wash that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or have me scratch my skin off.</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash for sensitive skin. It leaves a great feel on my face and seems to be cleaning well... although I changed some other things in my routine - like adding the burts bees exfoliator beforehand and moisturizing with cold pressed virgin organic coconut oil (hippie, I know) - so it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s just this stuff working the magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pump doesn&#x27;t work. The liquid oozes out the side of the pump (near the base) instead of coming out the top. It&#x27;s just such a basic expectation that on principle, I can&#x27;t rate a good thing more than 3 stars if they can&#x27;t even get the product to me. I have to screw off the top and leak it onto my hands (spilling/losing a lot in the process) to get the stuff out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to a face wash that I bought at Trader Joes, but since there isn&#x27;t a store near me, I have found this Desert Essence wash. I really like this one better because it isn&#x27;t over powering in the tea tree oil scent. This wash really helps keeps those pimples away! I do occasionally get a hormonal pimple but it&#x27;s just one...not the vast amounts that I used to get. I also do not have the cystic acne bumps along my forehead anymore after using this and the Clean&amp;Clear moisturizer as my only face care.  I like use this as a body soap as well, I get lazy and like to do one stop shopping so to speak. I am on my third bottle and they seem to last a good long while since it&#x27;s a very runny, liquidy soap...it will lather and foam up.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne since I was 14 (now 33).  After reading positive remarks about tea tree oil fighting acne, I have given a few products a try, but had little to no improvement with my acne.  Despite having poor results in the past, I nonetheless decided to try this tea tree oil face wash from Desert Essence.  And the results have been great.  My acne has totally cleared up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, I have also been combining this face wash with this Topix Benzoyl Peroxide ointment  [[ASIN:B00F5DFFYS B00F5DFFYS]] (benzoyl peroxide is a common active ingredient found in many acne medications).  I have used other benzoyl peroxide products in the past, with no success.  But these two products together have made a major impact on my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note however, when used together every day, my skin got very dry.  I had to taper off my usage of both to every other day.  After doing that, my skin has felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints with this product is that it smells a little weird and the consistency is very watery.  There is really no foaming action and it wont suds up much at all.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and it made me break out worse! I also causes my face to be a dirt magnet after a few hours of and oily looking face.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a few weeks and it hasn&#x27;t done much to clear up my complexion. It does leave your skin feeling clean and fresh. I will continue using the product. As others mentioned, be very careful to keep it out of your eyes as it will burn. It also tends to get into my nose when rinsing my face and burns a little. Also careful when pumping the product into your hand or wash cloth as it is pumped out with a lot of pressure and can sometimes splash up into your eyes.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this face wash. I use it daily in combination with the Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick (highly recommended also). I have struggled with acne for the last 10+ years and have tried nearly every face wash/treatment under the sun. Most products dry out my face, leave a filmy cover over my face, and/or simply don&#x27;t help. Within days of using the Desert Essence face wash, my face actually felt CLEAN and started clearing up very quickly. The Blemish Touch Stick is perfect to use both after washing my face and throughout the day to keep spots/blemishes in check. This is the first time since I was in high school that I feel comfortable without putting on make up, because my face is so clear and clean! In addition to being in love with this face wash, I&#x27;m becoming obsessed with the Desert Essence line of products because of their natural ingredients and lack of animal testing. If you are looking for a few face wash, I highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
    <li> I use  dessert essence face wash all the time. my daughter love it too. it dryed my face a little but the clean feeling you can not get with different face wash i tryed.</li>
    <li> My skin is beautiful from using this cleanser! A little helpful information: When I purchased this i did not know it was for &amp;#34;oily to combination skin.&amp;#34; Since my skin is dry to normal, this product is drying on my skin, but a little moisturizer right after washing easily solves that problem. Also, I wish I could use it to was off eye makeup, but you must not put it in your eyes. It&#x27;s also very runny, like squirting water into your hand. But the effects are undeniable! I love it.</li>
    <li> Good product which works well with my skin. In addition I find the price excellent for the quality and amount of the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great wash for oily/ acne prone skin, leaves my sensitive skin clean and tight feeling without irritating.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter but have used it several times for my oily skin. Like it and it cleans well.</li>
    <li> Picked up this product because I read so many good reviews about this facial wash. I usually cleanse my face with Clean and Clear which is also a really good cleanser. I wear concealer and pressed powder on my face so at night when I clean my face, I want squeaky clean result before I go to bed. I will admit the consistence of the cleanser is like liquid/water but as soon as you message the product in your hands the foaming action is really good. After washing my face twice, I used my astringent to see how much make up or basic residue was left on my face, to my surprise there was very little. I like this cleanser because it is a great product to get all the bad stuff off my face. A lot of reviewers complained about the product leaving your face dry, all I have to say about that is, moisturizing is a MUST after using any cleanser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how it has the consistency of water. I do like that it gets the job done though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for several months, and I have noticed my complexion has definitely gotten better.  This was one of the steps I have used to improve my complexion and get rid of my mild acne.  I use this twice a day, morning and night.  Then follow up with \\&quot;Every day Jack&#x27;s\\&quot; face lotion since Thoroughly Clean leaves my face slightly dry.  Also, for shaving, I use an electric razor and shave once my face drys after washing it.  Then follow up with the face lotion.  This is a pretty effective product with the Tea Tree Oil that is a natural antiseptic, and the Jojoba Oil as a natural moisturizer.  The combo is simple yet effective.  Also, the price is pretty good and the bottle with pump lasts forever!  I would recommend to anyone with normal/oily skin prone to acne or not.</li>
    <li> I recently discovered tea tree oil as an astringent for my face.  I have this, the face wipes, and the afterwash balm.  There is an initial smell to it, but it goes away fairly quickly.  For me, the minutes of tea tree smell is overshadowed by how effective it is at cleansing my skin and cutting down on breakouts and redness.  LOVE the tea tree products.</li>
    <li> The bottle shown is not the one you will get just FYI. Also when I contacted the seller to get a full ingredient list before my purchase, I never got a response. Still haven&#x27;t. As far as results from actual use, that is TBA....</li>
    <li> I got this face wash because Fox News had a segment about how the fragrances in a lot of soaps aren&#x27;t tested and could be dangerous. They mentioned this brand as one which didn&#x27;t have any dangerous chemicals or fragrances, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it really dried my skin! I don&#x27;t like using it if I&#x27;m going to go out after my shower! Also, the consistency is really thin and watery. It just runs through your hands before you get a chance to put it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t get it again</li>
    <li> I really love this for daily face washing.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and leaves it feeling nice and soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the only product I&#x27;ve stuck with religiously.  I&#x27;m completely uninterested in even looking for anything better.  It&#x27;s so nice not to have a tight dry face after washing it, but actually have something that removes makeup.  It has always been gentle on my sensitive skin.  I really love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, clear the pump regularly.  If a little gunks up in the pump it could squirt out erratically and getting this soap in your eye is literally the worst pain I&#x27;ve ever felt.  It BURNS something wicked.  I use eye makeup remover pads on my eyes because this soap will never go anywhere near my eyes.  I would sleep with my eye makeup on before I use this in such a risky area, it hurts that badly.  It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne-prone skin or burn in cuts or anything, but this soap hates eyeballs and I&#x27;m pretty sure wants to melt them inside my head.</li>
    <li> I used to use a different brand of Tea Tree Oil face wash but this brand turned out to be just as good.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff twice a day - I am on my first bottle and I really like it so far. It gets the greasy feeling off your face and every time I use it, I actually think to myself &amp;#34;wow, my face feels thoroughly clean&amp;#34; - as nerdy as that sounds.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times using it, it might sting a bit (from the tea tree oil) but after that it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;Only &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; is the fact that it is kind of runny - but it suds up really nicely.</li>
    <li> i love this product because it&#x27;s truly all-natural.  only problem is that it can dry you out easily, especially if you have sensitive skin.  I normally don&#x27;t have too sensitive of skin and can use it occassionally, but not daily.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells STRONG. I can barely use it on my face because it makes me gag. I was really hoping for something to clear up my acne, but clearly, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I bought it in the hope of controlling my breakout. But instead, I had more when using this and the queen Helene mint julep mask. Although its not pricy I won&#x27;t repurchase. The smell itself is already a turnoff. It&#x27;s sooooo strong and smells awlful. It gives me a headache. I don&#x27;t look forward to using it at all. I think good skin care products should make you happy while working at the same time.</li>
    <li> ive been using this for 6 years. it really makes my skin feel clean and healthy its one of the best products ive used</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin since I was a teenager and have tried a lot of things to no avail. I don&#x27;t like using things that will dry out my skin and make it even MORE greasy by the end of the day and I don&#x27;t like using harsh chemicals on my face. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year (probably my 3rd bottle by now) and can&#x27;t complain at all. Just a quick rinse is really refreshing and leaves your skin feeling clean and tight but not too dry. It definitely helps keep the acne at bay too. I used to use Proactiv every day but since I started using this I will usually only use the lotion every other night.</li>
    <li> This is the only think that helped with the constant break outs I started having as a 30 year old! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had used a Tea Tree based face wash before like 2 years back (Oriflame Tea Tree face wash) and it was great but, you don&#x27;t get Oriflame here.So, I was looking for a face wash with the same ingredient. I came across this one, saw the reviews and bought it. I have an acne prone skin. Currently I just have blemishes which I wanted to get rid off.I have used this face wash twice only, and have amazing results already. First off, as soon as I use the face wash, my face feels so clean and fresh (more than normal). Secondly, my face had become clear in just two uses. I just use a moisturizer after this and I am done. I love this face wash so much that its even better than the previous tea tree one as it has more ingredients i guess. Buy it! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this face wash by Desert Essence. I own a couple of their products but I use this one religiously now. I was having trouble with different face washes for a while, I wanted them to help with my blemishes but often the ones that did help also dried out my skin. This face wash is an excellent alternative to more popular face washes, it cleans the skin without over-drying it. This face wash requires a specific process to be effective: lather your face with the soap and warm water and wash for about a minute before rinsing it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warm water opens up your pores to let the soap cleanse deeply into your skin and the cold water closes up the pores again for cleaner, soft skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I was introduced to it through a sibling, but could not find it in my local area.  I am happy to say I have found it on amazon so I can order it anytime I need it.  It&#x27;s a great product and should be tried by everyone!</li>
    <li> Like this stuff.  Leaves face very clean and toned.&lt;br /&gt;Helps to shrink my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Nice clean, natural odor that comes mainly from the Hawaiian white ginger.&lt;br /&gt;The ginger really stimulates, tones and evens my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The best I have ever used....</li>
    <li> I suffered with seborric dermatitis since my teen years. I am now 68. Yes, I know that is a long time. I have used various creams and soaps over  the years, with very limited relief. Even prescription steroidal creams and potions did not come close to curing this awful condition, which caused red patches around my nose and mouth, in my eyebrows, and on my neck, with flare-ups of flaking, and constant burning and itching.&lt;br /&gt;  Late last year I tried oil of oregano, after looking for natural cures online. It was recommended by many users who had skin conditions similar to mine. That helped reduce the flaking and itching, but burned my skin and made the redness even worse.&lt;br /&gt;  Then my daughter bought Desert Essence Face Wash, for oily and combination skin, and gave it to me to try. She also gave me Earth&#x27;s Care Face Balm. Both of these contain tea tree oil. I followed the directions, and started using the 2 products twice a day, morning and night. The results were noticeable within a couple days. The redness and itching were reduced significantly. After about 10 days, my face looked almost normal; the unsightly red patches were gone, and so was the flaking. Now I have tried reducing the regimen to once a day, and using only the face wash, with good results. For me, it seems like a miracle cure, after suffering with this condition for so long.&lt;br /&gt;  To date, I have continued with the combination of Face Wash and Face Balm for about 2 months, using both sparingly. I estimate the 8.5 oz. Desert Essence Face Wash will last at least 3 more months, and the same for the balm. I highly recommend both products. I additionally like the Face Wash because it makes my skin feel super clean and fresh. I like the scent; it does not seem harsh at all.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how clean your face feels after you use it. The tea tree oil makes you have a pleasant tingle on your skin and helps treat acne. I love that this is a natural product that doesnt use harsh chemicals on your face. I will be buying more of this when I run low. I also love that you get a nice size bottle for the price. This is a WIN for me!</li>
    <li> There is such a clean feeling after using this it&#x27;s just like heaven.  Also i find it seems to promote healing of blemishes and my skin seems to glow!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised but it felt a little harsh.  I shall continue to use it but probably I&#x27;ll water it down some.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a new product to replace the more expensive face wash I usually buy at Sephora. Oh God, I was pleased. My face feels so clean and so tight. My blemishes start disappearing as soon as I started using the product. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the result. I highly recommend this face wash to anyone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now.  I have tried many other products throughout the last 20 years.  This is the best!  I am 64 with dry skin. This product does an excellent job of cleaning your facial skin without leaving it dry and tight. It lasts forever because it only takes a small amount to clean your entire face.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good only keeps skin a bit dry.  Prertty much met my expectations....I would order again\..\\\  Dont hesitate to buy.  I love Amazon Prime.... Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> great product - first time using it and my skin is happy that I am washing it with au natural stuff</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Quick shipping. It is effective enough to keep my face blemish free but mild enough for my sensitive skin. Great combo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a stickler for all-natural ingredients, but some of the ingredients in high-powered acne products do concern me as they are banned in other countries. This face was works as well or better than any other face wash I&#x27;ve used and leaves your face feeling clean and healthy. I use it as directed by other reviewers- diluted by about half and find it is perfect for controlling oil and acne.</li>
    <li> this is very very drying but when i need some serious help with my face and my face is very oily, this is the only thing that will do. i dont use it unless its dead summer though, but regularly all year round i use it to clean my makeup brushes because its the only thing that gets bit of makeup off. strongest face wash i have, but not made all s***ty by fragrances and menthol or SA or BP.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product for washing my face. I wouldn&#x27;t think of using something like a commercial deodorant bar soap to wash my face now. I developed a type of chronic rosacea after I had gall bladder surgery. This face wash keeps it under control with adding milk thistle to my diet. It&#x27;s also great to wash your face with after shaving. Very soothing. It lathers too like you would not believe. Just a couple pumps is all that is needed. Buy the quart size for refills. This is a great size for traveling with too. Once you start using this you will never go back to what you were previously using. I guarantee it.</li>
    <li> There are hints of ginger and tea tree oil that tingle and give a cooling sensation. It leaves my face feeling cool and clean, not dry. However, the dispensing pump is over sensitive, possibly designed to dispense thicker liquids (like lotion), so the face wash comes out much faster than is necessary.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after reading all the positive reviews.  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have extremely oily skin, and this helps so much during the long humid days.  Also, I purchased a detox kit from another company and they told me to expect some discoloration during the removal process due to exfoliation.  Well guess what??  There was none!  This cleaner completely cleans and exfoliates my face every morning and night! One word of caution:  do not get it in your eyes and do not use more than twice a day (morning and night). I will definitely be buying this for a long time to come.  Thank you DE!</li>
    <li> Its is a mild feeling on the skin and not too drying. But ever get it in your eye, this product is the worste I have ever by accident gotten in my eye. Be careful</li>
    <li> I received a different product. Bottle in a different shape. It is a cleanser and I suppose it works ; the smell of it is similar to an old nasty soap ( that&#x27;s the tea tree smell ). I would by again.</li>
    <li> I really love how my skin feels after using this. Very clean and oil free, almost tight. I think if you have dry or sensitive skin, this would probably be too strong though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is that the pump on my bottle was broken when it arrived, but hopefully that&#x27;s an isolated incident. Also be very careful to keep this out of your eyes. Even a little bit leaking in has made my eyes red and hurt for awhile afterwards.</li>
