      <li>And they are STRONG.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a bit of the smell in this as well but not as strong and it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a very good moisturizer for dry cuticles in the winter.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve made my own but tea tree oil is so very smelly.  </li>
      <li>As usual, Nailtek has the best nail products for my nails!  </li>
      <li>Works about as good as similar products.  </li>
      <li>but since I&#x27;m battling nail fungus right now, I&#x27;m using one drop per nail, placed beneath the free edge so that it flows around the side walls and cuticle without dripping everywhere.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>It does seem to sink in and all but disappear, leaving my bare nails with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
      <li>It smells great and really does hydrate your cuticles if you are prone to dry cuticles.</li>
      <li>I does not have an offensive odor, just takes some time to be absorbed.</li>
      <li>It just takes some time to be absorbed.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy looking cuticles.</li>
      <li>The cuticle oil must help the lotion to absorb quickly because I have no greasy feel afterwards and my hands feel very hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It really helped reduce the brittleness of my nails!</li>
      <li>I finally have healthy nails again.</li>
      <li>would HIGHLY recommend!!</li>

      <li>Really improves cuticle health and appearance.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>My cuticles look and feel much nicer.  </li>
      <li>Within the first week of using it my cuticles were amazingly soft and nourished.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend trying this.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how long my nails are right now!</li>
      <li>(nothing comes close to it that I know of for soft, peeling nail syndrome!).  </li>
      <li>It makes my cuticles feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and keeps them soft and supple.</li>
      <li>it keeps them soft.</li>
      <li>Keeps nails (cuticles) soft and pliable and holds a shine on nails and fingers.</li>
      <li>:  This stuff really needs to come in a bigger bottle as a supplement to using hand lotion.  </li>
      <li>I use it for my cuticles, but I also have trouble with my hands cracking from being so dry (I live in the desert of southern Arizona where we have almost no humidity for most of the year!).  </li>
      <li>Tip for dry cuticles: try undistilled cider (live culture), around and ujnder the nails.  </li>

<li> I think if if I didn&#x27;t have extra dry skin, this would be enough.</li>
<li> But I recently found something else for my extra dry cuticles.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little too early to know if it&#x27;s going to deal well with the fungus</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time</li>
<li> but I can say that the dry areas of my nails do disappear when I put it on</li>
<li> have been using it for about 2 months every night and am only half way through the bottle.</li>
<li> /&gt;There are no real instructions that come with this</li>

<li> Now I use it every other day.</li>
<li> I used it everyday for about 3 months.</li>
<li> After I put this on, I usually put on hand lotion</li>
<li> I&#x27;m anxious to see if they eventually stay that way even after hand washing.  </li>
<li> But if your cuticles are so bad they bleed, go for something from Curel for extra dry skin.</li>
<li> It kills a bacteria that causes dry cuticles and that awful &#x27;white stuff&#x27;, and worked well for me.</li>
<li> I have REALLY thin nails.  </li>
<li> The oil promotes healing of my dry cuticles (which i have a very bad habit of picking) and strengthens my nails.</li>
<li> Wrong product received and I truly wanted to try this oil .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great oil for nails. My manicurist loves it too.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY thin nails.  After a couple days of using this product, my nails grow.  And they are STRONG.  I love all the Nail Tek products, but this is the best.  Put on your nails before a date, and you don&#x27;t need polish.  :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it for years. it is great for cuticles and especially for toenails. it keeps them soft.</li>
    <li> This product works. Great. My.cuticles are n better shape I use it&lt;br /&gt;2-3 times a week I will purchase. Again</li>
    <li> Received and has helped with my personal cuticle problem. Cracked Cuticle and after about a week looked much better. Packaged well and on time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time but I feel that it is already working. It just takes some time to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> Works about as good as similar products.  Tip for dry cuticles: try undistilled cider (live culture), around and ujnder the nails.  It kills a bacteria that causes dry cuticles and that awful &#x27;white stuff&#x27;, and worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried other cuticle products but they either don&#x27;t work well, too oily, etc. This one&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I use it for my cuticles, but I also have trouble with my hands cracking from being so dry (I live in the desert of southern Arizona where we have almost no humidity for most of the year!).  So I put it on my fingertips as well as my nails.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling.  Highly recommend trying this.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be pleased with the product and the results.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my cuticles feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and keeps them soft and supple.</li>
    <li> But I recently found something else for my extra dry cuticles. This is easy to use and smells good. Tea Tree oil is always nice stuff. I think if if I didn&#x27;t have extra dry skin, this would be enough. But if your cuticles are so bad they bleed, go for something from Curel for extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have always used NailTeK Nail Strengthener (nothing comes close to it that I know of for soft, peeling nail syndrome!).  I ssaw this product and gave it a whirl.  It is also superb.  The oil penetrates thoroughly, no staining the sheets or furniture.  Great product for treating the cuticles and skin around finger and toe nails.</li>
    <li> I GET A NAIL FUNGUS EVERY YEAR DURING THE SUMMER WHEN I&#x27;M CONSTANTLY WEARING NAIL POLISH ON MY TOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE USED THIS ALL SUMMER AND IT KEPT THE FUNGUS AWAY. I JUST FILL A Q-TIP WITH IT AND DAB UNDER THE NAILS AND ALL AROUND THE NAIL BED .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> Best product ever for your nails but be sure to get the cuticle oil with the Tee Tree product in it. I finally have healthy nails again. I used it everyday for about 3 months. Now I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what was needed at the time. Keeps nails (cuticles) soft and pliable and holds a shine on nails and fingers.</li>
    <li> As usual, Nailtek has the best nail products for my nails!  I am definitely a fan of this product for anyone that has had problems with growing nails. . . ever!</li>
    <li> This is a very good moisturizer for dry cuticles in the winter.  I am very pleased with the results of using it everyday for three weeks.  It is so soothing after doing the dishes in bleach water. My cuticles look and feel much nicer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants healthy looking cuticles.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Within the first week of using it my cuticles were amazingly soft and nourished. My cuticle area became healthier and in turn my nails started doing better.</li>
    <li> ...aa......................................................................................... Wrong product received and I truly wanted to try this oil . I already had ridge filler &amp; II &amp; III</li>
    <li> I got this product for the tea tree oil in it.  I&#x27;ve made my own but tea tree oil is so very smelly.  There&#x27;s a bit of the smell in this as well but not as strong and it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no real instructions that come with this but Nail Tek has a You Tube channel and they have a video on how to use it.  They recommend one drop for five nails but since I&#x27;m battling nail fungus right now, I&#x27;m using one drop per nail, placed beneath the free edge so that it flows around the side walls and cuticle without dripping everywhere.  The eye dropper is very handy to get just the right size droplet.  I&#x27;ve been putting this on after hand washing.  It&#x27;s a little too early to know if it&#x27;s going to deal well with the fungus but I can say that the dry areas of my nails do disappear when I put it on and it does seem to last until the next hand washing.  I&#x27;m anxious to see if they eventually stay that way even after hand washing.  It does seem to sink in and all but disappear, leaving my bare nails with a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This stuff really needs to come in a bigger bottle as a supplement to using hand lotion.  After I put this on, I usually put on hand lotion and I&#x27;ve noticed that this gives my regular hand lotion a sort of moisture boost that I can feel immediately.  I am someone who can&#x27;t stand to have dry hands and the only lotion I can use that doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling icky is Curel.  The cuticle oil must help the lotion to absorb quickly because I have no greasy feel afterwards and my hands feel very hydrated.  A very nice bonus.</li>
    <li> It smells great and really does hydrate your cuticles if you are prone to dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> Stopped my cuticles from tearing and bleeding.  I does not have an offensive odor, just takes some time to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> This production is amazing!  It really works. I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Really improves cuticle health and appearance.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 2 months every night and am only half way through the bottle. The oil promotes healing of my dry cuticles (which i have a very bad habit of picking) and strengthens my nails. I can&#x27;t believe how long my nails are right now! i have had to clip my nails back instead of them breaking.&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. It really helped reduce the brittleness of my nails!</li>
