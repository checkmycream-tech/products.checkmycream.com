<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to start with the whole &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not big on reviewing, but I have to for this product.&amp;#34;  OK, now that we have that out of the way, this product has completely changed my skin.  MY SKIN: My 26-year-old skin is pretty dry but not to the point of flakiness. I get a little oil around the creases of my nostrils but that&#x27;s about it. Ever since I went to law school and basically started living as a grown-up under tons of stress, I&#x27;ve had something unpleasant on or around my chin. The rest of my face is pretty clear, although I have slightly uneven complexion and very fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.  MY WEATHER: Los Angeles dry heat.  MY REGIMEN: Acure or some organic-y face wash, Thayer&#x27;s rose toner (within 2 minutes of washing my face/taking a shower), Eminence Strawberry Rhubarb Serum, moisturizer (I switch this up), eye cream (I switch this up), and SPF 50 on top of all of that in the mornings. I drink at least 3 liters of water per day.  MY EMINENCE STRAWBERRY RHUBARB DEPENDENCY: Since using this product, my skin has evened out and my hormonal chin cystic and surface acne is gone (for ALL weeks of the month) if I am consistent with my routine. If I go one week without the serum, I tend to break out. I know it sounds silly, but I feel beautiful when I have clear skin and when I use this product.  MY RESPONSE TO THE HATERS: The scent is not offensive whatsoever. When people said &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; I expected full on Lip Smackers/Victoria&#x27;s Secret stench but it is nothing like that and the scent disappears within a minute or two. As for the stickiness, this also goes away as your skin absorbs the serum within a minute or two.  This product has completely changed my skin and my confidence. If you have skin anything like mine, you should definitely give this serum a shot.</li>
    <li> Appeared to be a knock-off. The product labeling was different that that of the bottle I had purchased through a licensed esthetician.</li>
    <li> This product is very refreshing to use on face. It smells like fresh crushed strawberries. Makes my skin smooth and soft. A little goes a long way. If you don&#x27;t like fruity smells this is not for you!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add if you have problems with dry skin, cracks &amp; splits. This stuff is your answer. I have used everything wax, medications thru  Dermatolagist. Gentle soaps, lotion after each hand washing. I put this on my hands &amp; instant relief. So now I put on at night, rub in well, then put on my Cotten gloves. Next morning soft beautiful hands. Thank you eminences.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already gone through one vial. Ready to re-order!</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product!  my skin still feels buoyant and hydrated the next morning after I&#x27;ve put this on.  The feel and lovely berry smell of the product make it a ritual I look forward to each night.  I also like knowing that I&#x27;m using pure, organic ingredients on my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this serum for about 2 months, figuring that I would give it a fair try.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; --pleasant fragrance, if you like fruity scents.  The scent does fade some as it dries, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;  --little bit goes a long way.  One bottle lasted me about 1-1/2 - 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;  --My sensitive skin did not react adversely to this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--strong fragrance (if you don&#x27;t care for fruity scents, or don&#x27;t want them on your face...)&lt;br /&gt;  --takes a bit longer to \\&quot;set\\&quot; or dry than other serums&lt;br /&gt;  --seems a little sticky even after drying.&lt;br /&gt;  --I did not notice any changes in my skin (good or bad) while using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression:&lt;br /&gt;--not worth the cost, given other choices.  Eminence has some nice products... But this one wasn&#x27;t for me...</li>
    <li> Excellent product.100%organic.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that it smells like strawberry pie and feels amazing on your skin....soaks right in.  Love at first smell.</li>
    <li> strawberry is my favorite fruit but my skin never absorb it well and always stay on my face shining! ah...</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell and texture of this serum. I tried different serums from Eminence and this one is one of my favorite.</li>
    <li> The Eminence Strawberry Rhubarb Hyaluronic Serum smells nature of Strawberry but the serum a bit of thin comparing with Eminence Stone Crop Serum. If the Strawberry Rhubarb Hyaluronic Serum becomes a little bit of thick which is better.</li>
    <li> But its a little too &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; of a sent for me. I wish it didn&#x27;t smell so sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it works nice for me.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin look younger.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking and feeling smooth and happy. I really like this product. A little goes a long way. I use it on damp skin with damp fingertips.</li>
    <li> I had a facial and Eminence was recommended and I tried it and like it very much.  My skin is aging and needs an extra boost.  This is it!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad last along time you only need a lil bit to go along way!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My skin looks and feels amazing</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Feel like I have a dewy glow after using this. Usually apply to my full face at night and just under my eyes, before makeup, in the morning. I think it helps with the bags big time!</li>
    <li> This product dries your skin I wish I never purchased it.</li>
    <li> .....every morning after cleansing with Eminence and moisturizing with Eminence.  Lovely fragrance and a good base for the start of your day.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this serum. The product absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> smells great, very sweet smell, however kind of sticky too. The stickiness resolves after it dries.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, at the insistence of an aesthetician in Palm Springs.  I can&#x27;t always afford a facial or enzyme peel (except on a very, very occasional vacation), and this stuff is terrific!</li>
    <li> I love Eminence products!  Originally I used this too much and my skin had a little reaction to it, but then it recovered and my skin looked amazing!  They also sent me a load of samples, which was nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product two times, and both times it came unsealed,  which is totally unacceptable for cosmetic product. Sending it back!</li>
    <li> super nice smell like fresh strawberries but I still like the Stone Crop Serum much better. It is not so sticky on the skin.</li>
    <li> Best skin care ever! This stuff smells so good I want to drink it and it geives your face such a refreshing glow! Will never go back to anything else</li>
    <li> I had been using this serum for a number of months for very dehydrated skin. It seemed to be working but I didn&#x27;t realize how well until I tried switching to a less expensive hyaluronic serum. Over the course of a month my skin became progressively worse (dry and fine lines becoming very obvious). When I switched back to this serum my skin immediately looked hydrated again. Now I use it twice a day instead of just once and my skin looks even better than before. I find this serum more hydrating than the Stone Crop serum. I also use the Stone Crop cleanser which is great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Eminence never fails to produce an amazing product.  I use this as a base under the tinted moisturizer because I needed a bit more moisture than what the moisturizer offered (for my summer product).  Great product and smells delicious.  REVISED 5 Start to 2 Star 3/31/15 I received my order yesterday and although I have always loved this product, I will be hesitant to order it here again.  Normally this product arrives in an Eminence box with a seal around the stopper.  What arrived was only wrapped in bubble wrap with no seal.  The UPC code was also marked out, which I have heard is an indicator of an expired product.  The bottle is also the old packaging.</li>
    <li> awesome fragrance and light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! A little pricey for how often I need to refill it, but it works and feels great. I have dry skin and this just makes it feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> the only product I have used that does not leave me oily, skin feels smooth, especially during hot humid summer months. you don&#x27;t need much, a little really goes a long way. it is fantastic!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Seller shipped really fast as well! I have combination skin with areas of really dry patches. When I was getting a facial, the esthitician recommended this. It is the only product I have found to hydrate my skin. I put it on before bed and one jar lasted me around 6 months. The smell is fruity but I like it</li>
    <li> I swim daily &amp; this serum combats the damage done by the chlorine. I live in a dry high altitude climate so I use the whole product line to keep my skin moist &amp; healthy.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! I can&#x27;t find it in any store anymore, and if I do find it... They want an arm and a leg for it! This stuff is amazing! If you&#x27;re thinking of trying this stuff, do it! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I began Monoi Age Correcting Exfolient morning and night, Bamboo serum on my neck, strawberry rhubarb serum on face with the Monoi day and/or night cream.  My skin is very dry and flaky.  The exfolient is gentle and keeps the dry flaky skin away and the other Eminence products have completely changed the look of my skin and best of all, my skin feels hydrated.  If you use them as directed, the products last an amazingly long time too!</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my skin! It is super hydrating.  When you hear about your skin &amp;#34;drinking in&amp;#34; a product, this is it! I use it as a base layer each night under a light moisturizer.  I had normal to dry skin but now it&#x27;s just normal.  Oh, and the smell? My kids want to eat my face-in a good way ;)</li>
    <li> I started using this product over a year ago.  Once you get over the Strawberry smell it is  a great product.  You do need to use a moisturizer in the winter, but can be used alone in the summer.  Good price.</li>
    <li> A natural lifer, and a surprise exfoliant.  Makes face feel tight after application and hours after.  Have been using for three years.</li>
    <li> Not happy that when I received the product it was not in a box. I am unsure if what I got had been used prior to me receipt of it.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t able to read the ingredient list or full directions on usage.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells wonderful…too early for seeing results yet but I am enjoying it.</li>
    <li> amazing line, amazing product</li>
    <li> Miracle product for skin hydration. Referred by dermatologist -a little goes a long way. Smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  My esthetician uses this on me at the salon.  It is far cheaper here than through the salon even with my discount.  I use it everyday and would not be without it.  It leaves the skin moist, no greasy or oil.  It heals boo boos well and has an exfoliant action.  Though very mild it does have great effects.  My pores look smaller and my face feels soft and subtle.  Im in my 60&#x27;s and no one believes my skin.  Eminence line is superb.</li>
    <li> Lovely!  I look forward to applying this daily!</li>
    <li> This is heavy and a little sticky so not exactly the texture I was looking for!  I do think this is a good Night Product under a moisturizer. It just didn&#x27;t wow me!</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt. Only problem with item is that it contains hydrolized wheat protein and I am gluten intolerant. Will not be able to use.</li>
