<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Used it to make homemade shaving cream. Not as foamy as I wished (my issue). Still, great base for any homemade cream salve. Why spend more for somone else to make your creams.</li>
    <li> This product  was recommended to me by a friend. I have spent a lot of money over the years on lotions, creams, oils, and butters for my dry skin. Since I have tried so many products in the past I was skeptical but decided to give it a try and hey for this price why not. I applied it at night on one side of my body and put my current lotion on the other side. The difference was amazing. In the morning the Simply Shea side was super soft and I didn&#x27;t need to apply anything for the day time. I am very happy I purchased this. I highly recommend you give it a try. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great Shea Butter.  This 1 pound size comes in 4 sticks.  The sticks are wrapped in a really nice paper and covered with a clear cover that is easy to remove.  It feels great on your skin after applying to your arm, legs or anywhere.  I have 2 great grand babies coming and the new moms are using this on their bellies to help reduce the itching.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  It&#x27;s packaged in individual sticks, so you can easily use portions for separate purposes - mix one with essentials oils, liquefy another for hair treatment, and save another to rub directly on skin.  This shea butter smells wonderful; I am storing the unused sticks in with my lingerie to take advantage of its luxurious fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My FAVORITE use for it so far is treating the dry cracked skin on my heels and elbows.  After just three days, I have seen significant improvement!</li>
    <li> Things I love about Simply Shea Butter:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Arrived as promised, simply packaged&lt;br /&gt;2.  What feels initially like a grainy substance liquefies to a lovely moisturizing clear cream on the skin&lt;br /&gt;3.  Even after sleeping all night the moisture and softness from the shea butter remain in the morning&lt;br /&gt;4.  No additives so no chance of allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;5.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to a friend that makes lotions.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Simply awesome! This a great product and I love that Simply Shea Butter is responsible with their eco packaging.  Being a musician, I really have to take care of my cuticles. I use Simply Shea mostly for this reason, but it&#x27;s good to know it has so many other uses. Also, the company shipped the product very quickly and there were no problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Very usefull and multipurpose product. This can be used by its own or even used in homemade recipes for face and body and also hair.</li>
    <li> Love just by itself but it is so nice and easy to Mix with and other ingredients to make great fluffy lotions and creams&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
    <li> Love it, so many uses! Arrived quickly and since there were 4 (I think) bricks of it in the package, I gave some away as gifts! I keep one brick on the bathroom counter so I never forget to lube up my dry hands and cuticles.</li>
    <li> Nice texture and will reorder</li>
    <li> I LOVE Simply Shea Butter!!!  I use many natural products and this was my first time using shea butter and it&#x27;s amazing.  It has this wonderful unique smell and I put a tiny bit on my hands and rub it onto my face in the morning after my shower and before I go to bed and I swear it only took a couple of days to see the difference in my skin.  I also use a tiny amount on my hair and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks.  It comes in four tubs which makes it easy to use; I gave one to my daughter who also loves it and mixes her essential oils in it for massage.    This is a great product; I am so impressed and it is now a permanent part of my daily beauty regime.</li>
    <li> This arrived in very nice packaging and sealed.  I chose this product because of the 100% guarantee.  After searching many other brands and reading the comments,  this is the only one I felt comfortable purchasing online.  I have not used it yet,  but I am impressed with the packaging.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she likes it a lot. I made the mistake of ordering it around Christmas time but it surprisingly showed up within a few days. It came in a very small and easy to open box but there was a lot inside. Very little plastic, almost all of it was biodegradable cardboard.  Thank goodness. I wish more companies could package stuff like this.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I received my packages of Shea-Butter immediately.  My daughters and I have been using it and it&#x27;s made a huge difference.  Especially my oldest daughter, who&#x27;s eczema is a difficult problem to treat.&lt;br /&gt;Listen, anyone who knows me knows I&#x27;m a pessimist by nature, but even I have to admit I was very happy.</li>
    <li> Great price and superior product. I use it in many homemade lotion recipes and each one has been great. I like that it is portioned out already, I will continue to buy this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin silky smooth. Loved the butter tray. Looking forward to using the recipes! Made my hands feel great!</li>
    <li> Love the convenience of the pre-measured bars,</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shea butter. I have purchased a few others and this one is the softest I have used. It is conveniently packed in these neat little trays that can be used which i love they are adorable. I recently made whipped body butter with this and it was so easy and quick and left my skin silky smooth. I will definitely be ordering this again. I have become addicted to making my own products ! Especially after using this it made it very easy. There was no need to use a double boiler at all with this and it still smells and feels the same. (will add pictures)</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin smooth and silky</li>
    <li> I received the product in a package is not as pictured, but came in a plastic bag  also smell is not good just like any other product that I bought and it is oily</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Not grainy like others I&#x27;ve purchased. It comes packaged in nice small loaf type blocks. Worked perfect for making lotion bars!</li>
    <li> I get really dry skin on my feet and hands living in the North East. We get very cold dry winters. So I&#x27;ve was looking for something to help with that.   I ordered this at the recommendation of a friend of mine and am very happy with the results. It has really helped me alleviate the dryness around my hands and feet. I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a week. The results so far have been really good. It&#x27;s really simple to just break off some from the bars they come in, rub it in your hands, and apply the lotion as needed.  The trays are another great feature. It makes them easy to store and just use what&#x27;s needed.  Anyway - good product and I would recommend it. I will also likely purchase it again.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Great product!  The sizes the bars come in are perfect for my recipe and the order arrived very quickly. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Since starting to go swimming 2 days a week, I&#x27;ve found that the skin on my face and my hands has become very dry, to the point where it has started to become sore and cracked in places. I tried many different creams and lotions with a little to no help. I needed something more effective. I came across this raw shea butter and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package with Shea Butter to be honest I was shocked.  I opened the package and found 4 pack with lumps of &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; exactly like pictured. It does have a slightly strange smell, more like a nutty smell and it isn&#x27;t particularly strong. After I take a tiny bit and rub in my palm it melted easily and I was able to apply to my skin. As soon as I applied some shea butter I could feel a soothing and healing effect. After only a few days the skin feels more or less completely healed. Shea butter is a great moisturizer, amazingly good for itchy, sore, flaky skin, and wrinkles. This has been a miracle cure for me. It has helped my dry skin so much, I wish I had discovered it years ago. I even begun using this elsewhere: hair, feet, and face. It is keeping my skin healthy and soft. I love this shea butter so much, I found a homemade whipped body butter recipe and I start making my own natural cream by mixing shea butter with almond , coconut, argan oils. It is really nice!</li>
    <li> Love this natural product. Body heat melts it into skin. Perfect, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free with a promotional code. It is simply wonderful. I am sure all of us have had lotion that contains Shea-butter. But once you&#x27;ve tried pure Shea-butter, you won&#x27;t feel the need to use any lotion. When I first touched it, it reminded me of moon sand (child&#x27;s toy). Once you start rubbing it together, it melts just like butter. And you really don&#x27;t need a whole lot, even though it seems like you want to just take a dollop- even that is too much. I use it to target my cuticles and the rough areas surrounding it. It makes a big difference. Once it dries, your hands will feel soft, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love Shea Butter and use it daily to moisturize my skin after showering. The texture of this one was exceptionally difficult to remove from the jar. I actually have been keeping it on my radiator to so that it is liquified so I can actually remove it from the jar! They were all over the place.  It does moisturize my skin, but the grit and the longer time to apply were not worth it in the end. I am reviewing this product unbiased as I received this free.</li>
    <li> This is pure Shea Butter which you cannot easily get in stores. My favorite feature of Simply Shea Butter is that it already comes in usable sticks! We love shea butter for our dry skin especially in winters and this is the best quality you can get! I was very lucky to get to try this for my honest unbiased opinion. This came packaged very well &amp; very fast!  This Would last a long time as a little bit is enough at a time. Before use I soften it a bit in the microwave then apply directly on my skin twice a day. This makes my skin super soft &amp; well moisturized in this harsh New York winter. This is a wonderful product offered at a great price. I highly recommend this. I will be ordering more when I run out. This would make a great gift too for anyone that is trying to use more natural skin care products!  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Love the all natural individual stored container.</li>
    <li> Great Shea butter, as many out there. What I really love about this one is that is packed in 4 blocks each 4oz. That&#x27;s absolutely perfect for home made creams etc. much easier than trying to break an amount from a big 1 lb block. Will order again!! Thanks for the great idea and making things easier to use!</li>
    <li> it has a funny smell to it but i guess this is how it supposed to smell.  love it and it&#x27;s excellent.  i use it as is warmed up in the microwave and i oil my son&#x27;s entire body</li>
    <li> Awesome shea butter!! It is so soft and melts so easily into the skin! I can&#x27;t wait to whip this up with my favorite scented oil!! Also the containers that the shea comes in is GENIUS!!! I love that you can just pop them in the microwave.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it! Ordered on a Wednesday &amp; package was delivered Saturday afternoon. One thing too remember is that Shea Butter is a SEALANT not a moisturizer. Apply a moisturizer of your choice first, oils if used(coconut works amazingly on relaxed and natural hair) then apply the Shea Butter. You&#x27;ll love the results... Just give it time and remember nothing works overnight.</li>
    <li> I have 4 year old daughter who is absolutely beautiful, however her hair is very difficult to manage. We use conditioner and have tried all the &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; products for hair like hers. This not only helped my dry hands but softened her hair and keeps it tame. There is no question that I will buy this product again and if your even thinking about it, do it.</li>
    <li> As a California girl trying to survive her first New York winter this product has saved my skin. I&#x27;ve been searching for something to help with my seriously dry itchy skin and this is it. I greatly appreciate the fact that this product is in it&#x27;s pure raw form and therefore isn&#x27;t overly perfumed. I will definitely be buying this again! I love it!</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness!! I was soo excited to receive this in the mail and it arrived just before Christmas as promised. I love the packaging of this Shea Butter Sticks. I am new to making my own homemade products and I have seen how some shea butters arrive from other Companys in ugly plastic bags. This one comes with their own eco friendly dish that you can use to prepare your shea butter. I am soo excited to use this in my recipes and experiment with it to make some homemade beneficial goodness. I plan to add essential oils to this to &amp; other great ideas. Very nice and creamy and moisturizing to the skin. Nothing like organic African Ivory Shea Butter from Ghana.</li>
    <li> I have used every kind of lotion possible and never had these results!! I also would have never thought making my own was the answer! The Raw is incredible and has changed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t understand the microwave part until I got the recipe book - took it too a whole new level. You can keep it raw or make the recipes either way incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am addicted!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter!  The packaging is unique, as nobody else uses sticks, just like you would on a butter dish. It has a great look and smell, and is visually pleasing in shape and form.</li>
    <li> Good quality Shea-Butter</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! I love the way it&#x27;s packaged, and the shea butter is high quality. It really helps my dry skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love, love the product !!  I whipped one unit and use it daily as a lip moisturizer.  It works better than anything I have tried in the past.  No more dry cracked lips. Makes lips feel soft, moist and subtle with no greasy feeling.  Have told falmily and friends to give it a try.</li>
    <li> This box of Shea-butter contains 4 rectangular slabs of Shea gently wrapped to protect the velvety butter.  Unlike many other Shea butters, there are no nasty chemicals and nothing to water down the quality.  This can either be used as is, or as one of the helpful recipes per instruction on the company&#x27;s website.  I melt a tiny bit of Shea butter in a dish and rub it on my rough elbows and knees...it is really amazing how smooth my skin is starting to feel.  My skin becomes really dry during the winter and this provides just the right amount of moisture, my skin soaks it right up.  I love the gentle scent.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin. I&#x27;ve used my fair share of lotions and moisturizers and for me, I&#x27;ve found that Shea butter works the best. I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It&#x27;s simple and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
    <li> I do not normally give reviews, however, on this product I absolutely had too. First of all, I try many different products for certain things such as eczema, dry skin; basically everything and just cannot seem to find that &amp;#34;perfect product&amp;#34; I am not a huge fan of non-organic products because I definitely believe that if you can go with organic - do it. Now the reason I am writing this review is because not only has this product pretty much cleared my child&#x27;s eczema, along with my nephews.....but no more dry skin. Now another HUGE things is that my baby recently had a pretty bad diaper rash. I, of course, tried destin and it seemed to only make it worse, then the dr gave me recommendations, but again, not fond of medicine and at this point the rash was so bad it was bleeding...Well, I applied the Simply Shea Butter on the rash and the rash was GONE by the next day. Absolutely LOVE this product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is very pure Shea Butter.  U cannot buy this in stores. I have psoriasis and this is helping so much with the redness and peeling.  I soften it a bit in the microwave then apply directly on my skin twice a day. This makes your skin so soft.  This is a wonderful product at a great price. I highly recommend this. I will be ordering more when I run out. Thanks so much . :-)</li>
    <li> Seller kept me updated on item delivery.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Perfect size- I like the individual bars and it made great body butter.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and dyshidrotic eczema, so I am constantly on the lookout for lotions, creams or body butters that can provide relief -- particularly in the winter, when the arctic temperatures in my home state of Montana make my skin feel even drier. I had the opportunity to try this product for free in exchange for a review and I&#x27;m incredibly grateful because it is honestly better than the plethora of lotions and creams I have in my bathroom cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast -- the package actually arrived a day or two before the estimated delivery date -- and the product was well-packed. The shea butter is divided into four, four-ounce bars that are packed in cardboard trays, each topped with a small sheet of wax paper. When I opened the box, the bars were all nice and secure, and none had escaped their packaging; it helps that the seller ships them in a sturdy, perfectly-sized box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test out the product, I peeled the wax paper off one of the bars and gently ran my fingers over its surface -- the amount, though minuscule, was literally all I needed to thoroughly moisturize my hands, elbows and lips. As I smoothed it on, I was honestly surprised by how fast it soothed my dry, irritated skin and delivered relief. That burning, stinging feeling I&#x27;ve been fighting all winter -- gone. I can&#x27;t wait to do more with it and plan to give some of the bars to family members who also suffer from eczema and other skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this product is that it comes with a little card that directs you to a website where you can download a free ebook that&#x27;s filled with great recipes for shea butter creams, lotions, salves, balms and even deodorant. I&#x27;m looking forward to making a shea butter/coconut oil whipped body cream, as well as my own homemade minty \\&quot;chapstick.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that some other reviewers mentioned that the product was a bit greasy. It is greasy, but not unpleasantly so, and it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to rub it in to the point where it isn&#x27;t greasy. Also, when I was looking through the free ebook, I noticed that some of the recipes suggested adding a small amount of cornstarch or arrowroot to whipped shea butter to make it feel less greasy on the skin. I may try that if I find that the greasiness is unpleasant when the product is applied over larger portions of the body, but so far, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.int where it isn&#x27;t greasy.

    <li> I have never used Shea-Butter before. But after hearing from a few friends on how much they think I&#x27;d like it, I went ahead and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the winter I get very bad dry hands so I started using shea butter. It has helped my hands out tremendously, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I also a fan of tattoos and have many myself. I am active in putting lotion on my tattooed filled arms. I continue to do so, but however now at night I have been using the butter before bed and have notice a difference, not in the tattoos, but my skin. I recommended this product. I am looking forward in discovering what else I can use this product for.</li>
    <li> Love the way Shea butter makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! I love how it is separated into four recyclable containers. This allows me to use the online recipe guide to create mixtures of skin lotion and conditioner that are tailored to my preferences.  A pure and wonderful Shea-Butter! Makes my skin feel so silky soft  - I will say I did like that I could add essential oils in my recipes - the truly organic qualities of this incredible product do need you add a scent that resonates with your palate.  :)</li>
    <li> Great product! Each bar comes in it&#x27;s own tray. The shea butter is wonderful. You can use it directly on your&lt;br /&gt;skin or make other products out of it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for organic shea butter, to make lotion, I was having a hard time finding a shea butter that didn&#x27;t have a strong smell, this is perfect, I love that it came in the 4 different dishes of 4oz. I feel geat using it on my family I Made my own recipe, 4oz of Shea butter 1/4 coconut oil, 2 tbs of olive oil,2tbs of vitamin e, 10 drops of sandalwood essential oil, 15 drops of lavander essential oil , and 5 drops of helichrysum.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast I received this order! For the price,I got more than I expected!  Wonderful price, great product, and neat packaging!  I received this product at a received price in exchangefor my lhonest opinion.</li>
    <li> Wow! This product is really the best solution on the market for dry, allergy-prone skin. I have extremely dry skin. In fact, I have been prescribed a wide range of products by my doctor and allergist to help with almost leather-like skin on my elbows. I was concerned about using the prescriptions, because they have the side-effect of thinning your skin. Enter the raw, organic Shea-Butter. Since I know I am extremely sensitive, I&#x27;ve waited three months to post this review to ensure I would have no &#x27;build-up&#x27; reaction to the product. I can&#x27;t even do allergy testing because my skin reacts to the test &amp;#34;saline&amp;#34;! I can say 3 months in that I haven&#x27;t had any type of reaction and my skin is smoother than it has been in years- without my prescriptions! I&#x27;ve even been using the product on my 8 year old son&#x27;s hands that have a tendency to get so dry they bleed during the winter months. I was a little wary of the product when it arrived- what was I going to do with these &amp;#34;blocks&amp;#34; of Shea-Butter? While the booklet of recipes and suggestions was great, I really was looking for a quick, easy solution to fit into my hectic schedule. I found I could chop up &#x27;slivers&#x27; of the product and place them in a zip-lock bag. After I shower each evening, I take out one sliver and warm it in my hands until it is malleable. I then rub it gently across my rough areas of skin until it dissolves into my skin. This process seems to really lock in moisture and I wake up every morning with my skin softer and more supple than the day before. I have now gone through 1 block and am starting on my second block. At this rate, the product will be very economical, as I&#x27;ll go through about 4 blocks a year. That is MUCH cheaper than the prescriptions I was having to use, that weren&#x27;t as effective! I&#x27;ll definitely order another set soon!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my homemade recipe use! I love that it comes in 4 individual trays. Great product.</li>
    <li> An ideal product in four convenient trays.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my wife and daughter as a Christmas gift and they absolutely love it. I really like the way it smells, and my daughter really likes the way it works on her psoriasis.</li>
    <li> We received Simply Shea Butter as a Christmas gift and love, love, love it!!!  We all benefitted greatly as our Colorado skin was in winter super suffer mode!  Our 21 year old son suffers from eczema over much of his body, and definitely enjoyed the soothing nature of Simply Shea Butter.  I made a body butter with my mixer using a little grape seed oil, a block of the Simply Shea, and a few drops of a scented oil.  I probably will leave out the scent next time, but the cream is wonderful!!!  We love Simply Shea Butter!!!</li>
    <li> This product does what it says and gives relief from dry skin. Both my daughter and I have dry skin (especially in winter) and she&#x27;s very allergic to any dyes or artificial additives. So we have to go with a natural product like this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try on my infant who has dry skin. It arrive quickly and was nicely packaged into 4 loaves of raw Shea butter. I love that it&#x27;s unscented, and free from dyes and additives. I warmed it in the microwave just enough to make it soft and easy to spread. Nice texture and seemed to lessen his skin irritation (redness).</li>
    <li> I used it to make my first-time home made lip balm.  It worked perfect.  I like it.  I will make more lip balms as gifts to my fiend.</li>
    <li> I just received this and I tried it and it very greasy so just use a little bit. So far it works.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing smells so good and works great!</li>
    <li> OMG....I love this Product will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s soft enough to scoop right out of the little paper tub it comes in withougt having to resort to heating it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Very pure, nothing weird in it like sticks or shells or anything like that. Just high quality Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Love this butter.  I like that it comes in the little trays.  It the perfect amount.  I mixed it with different oils that I use for both my hair &amp; body.</li>
    <li> It is really no different then any other Shea butter I have tried.  I would say this is more geared to someone who will use it for making handmade items.  I really don&#x27;t like the packaging.  I like to have mine in a container that I can close.  But I do like that it is separated in 4oz blocks for making handmade items.  A bonus is the recipe book.  But its really more for beginners.  You get a link for it after you get the product.  But the recipes you can find online if you just google Shea Butter recipes also.  Tell me how this is made in China?  I am so tired of things coming from China.  I think that gets me the most.  Ugh!</li>
    <li> This Simply Shea Butter is great! I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance and have allergies. I love how mild and essentially hypoallergenic this product is for me. When I want a little fragrance I add it to my lavender lotion. I love the recipes that are provided. My skin is normally very dry and sensitive with reactions to most over the counter lotions. This product moisturizes and protects my skin from drying and cracking without irritation. I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs, feet and hands with great results. I live in a dry climate and Its the only remedy that works for my hands. I love it and my family loves it! If you want soft, smooth skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice consistency and quality. Perfect for my little homemade skincare projects! Very smooth and nourishing. Blends very well with essential oils.</li>
