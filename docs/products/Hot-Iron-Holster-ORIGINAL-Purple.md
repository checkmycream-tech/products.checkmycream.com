      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and the color is beautiful.</li>
      <li>This product is perfect for flat irons.</li>
      <li>I hung this off the side of the toilet tank and it works perfectly!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just fine against a surface like in the picture</li>
      <li>Wife loves it, uses it  all the time in fact she loved it so much she ordered one for my daughter.</li>
      <li>It keeps her from burning more holes on the top of the toilet seat lid which keeps me happy.</li>
      <li>Pretty amazing that it stays put as shown.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s never fallen and sticks well to a smooth surface.</li>
      <li>Such a great concept and</li>
      <li>I have it on the toilet tank, and it sits to the side, very unobtrusive (a bamboo tray filled with beauty products happens to sit on top of it, hiding the flat surface of it, but it clings perfect without needing the tray on top).</li>
      <li>Great concept but wish it was stiff in the right angle where it goes over the edge because the surface I use it on is a table top</li>
      <li>This product is great, it sticks extremely well</li>
      <li>This safely stores my hot hair tools while I get ready and out of the way.  </li>

      <li>Exactly what my wife wanted for traveling.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>The holster holds both my hair dryer and hot curling iron, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about scorching or melting anything on my counter.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>I like the Hot Iron Holster.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
      <li>I was ALWAYS knocking my flat iron off the counter and worrying about either someone else or one of my cats touching it when it was hot.</li>
      <li>Now my flat iron can stay out of the way and no one gets burnt. :)</li>
      <li>Very functional.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and under $10</li>
      <li>Sticks very well to any counter surface I have and serves it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
      <li>It holds my flat iron (1&amp;#34;, but should be fine with wider ones), with no problem.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my mother and she loves not having to worry about where to set her hot curling iron all the time or having to be sure that the tiny little stand (that gets hot also) is in just the right spot.</li>
      <li>The hot portion of her straightener sits completely inside</li>
      <li>No need to let it cool before you pack just roll it right up and no more leg burns from trying to hold the hot styler while adjusting your hair!</li>
      <li>I once accidents left my curling iron on all day and came back to find everything safe.</li>
      <li>Would highly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how I ever had a flat iron without having a Hot Iron Holster as well!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this, wish I had gotten it sooner, but really didn&#x27;t care for that hot pink color.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>wow</li>
      <li>The picture would lead you to believe that this hangs completely perpendicular to the floor.  </li>
      <li>It does retain heat and can get really hot, so be careful not to lean against anything that may get damaged or burned.</li>
      <li>The material can get extremely hot too so be careful.</li>
      <li>those that are curious, I did try it also on the thin edge of my sink, and it worked great there too, even though it isn&#x27;t flat.</li>

    <li> OMG, so many burnewd fingers saved with this ideal lholder for not just one but two irons. I love it.</li>
    <li> Holds my blow dryer and straightener very nicely.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my curling iron handy and easy to get to.  It&#x27;s never fallen and sticks well to a smooth surface. I once accidents left my curling iron on all day and came back to find everything safe. (I definitely don&#x27;t recommend doing that).</li>
    <li> I tried hanging this on my pedestal sink, and it keeps falling off. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a tiny bathroom with no counter space. I&#x27;ve actually been letting my flat iron just lie in the sink while I use it, and  I used a thick wool &amp;#34;hotpad&amp;#34; on a wood shelf to let it sit while it cools. Not a great solution. This thing clings like crazy! I have it on the toilet tank, and it sits to the side, very unobtrusive (a bamboo tray filled with beauty products happens to sit on top of it, hiding the flat surface of it, but it clings perfect without needing the tray on top). You have to almost peel it off it clings so well. I have it in purple, which matches my decor. It holds my flat iron (1&amp;#34;, but should be fine with wider ones), with no problem. I highly recommend this, wish I had gotten it sooner, but really didn&#x27;t care for that hot pink color.&lt;br /&gt;For those that are curious, I did try it also on the thin edge of my sink, and it worked great there too, even though it isn&#x27;t flat.</li>
    <li> Do not think twice about buying this product!!!!!  It is wonderful!!!  I have 2 young children, and I can safely put my hot straightener in the holster without fear of anyone getting burned.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it sticks extremely well, I just wish it was bigger.  It doesn&#x27;t quite hold my curling iron, flat iron, and hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Only buy this if you&#x27;re NEVER going to move it from it&#x27;s designated spot. I moved mine twice and it no longer stuck to the surface. Waste of money</li>
    <li> As advertised. Works. Holds more than one item depending on size. Would highly. Recommend to anyone who uses flat iron at home and worries about. Turning off</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay as well as I hoped, probably my counter, but love the concept.</li>
    <li> Does NOT stick to everything.  I bought this for my sons bathroom for when we visit and&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t Stivers&lt;br /&gt;Ck to counter top. Useless to me.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this item.  The holster holds both my hair dryer and hot curling iron, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about scorching or melting anything on my counter.  The holster stays in place without fail.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Saw the commercial and immediately thought of college students with very little room -  These are great and safe_ no more worrying about burns or fires!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, uses it  all the time in fact she loved it so much she ordered one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> This is the best item I purchased this year!  It is big enough to hole my flat iron and my barrel iron and it holds on tight!  I plan on getting EVERYONE one of these for Christmas this year.  Fast shipping and under $10 wow thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> The picture would lead you to believe that this hangs completely perpendicular to the floor.  That is not the case common sense should have prevailed and we should have realized that a heavy object placed in the pouch will weigh it down.  It works the way it&#x27;s advertised and sticks to the sink, but it almost looks as if anything inside of it is about a &amp;#34;sneeze&amp;#34; away from being dumped on the floor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother and she loves not having to worry about where to set her hot curling iron all the time or having to be sure that the tiny little stand (that gets hot also) is in just the right spot. Incredible invention that makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Such a great concept and it works too. My very tiny bathroom has no counter space and needed some place to put my flat iron. And here it is. It stays right where you put it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product!  Will probably buy another for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I hung this off the side of the toilet tank and it works perfectly!! What an ingenious product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was expecting and it is great to have for my straightener.  I no longer worry that I will put burn marks on my counter.</li>
    <li> Great quality and works perfectly with flat or curling irons. My niece loved it when she opened it for Christmas and says it is great!</li>
    <li> Great concept but wish it was stiff in the right angle where it goes over the edge because the surface I use it on is a table top not a counter like in the photo . so when I stick anything in the pocket it tends to Buckle and  fold back under the table because of the weight  and the iron or blowdryer can fall out. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just fine against a surface like in the picture but that&#x27;s not what I need it for . Also wish it was a larger pocket because my blow dryer does not go all the way in . The material can get extremely hot too so be careful.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very functional.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for bathroom vanity with limited space.  This safely stores my hot hair tools while I get ready and out of the way.  It does retain heat and can get really hot, so be careful not to lean against anything that may get damaged or burned.</li>
    <li> Starting to fall down for&lt;br /&gt; The counter but overall it still holds up.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to where to place my hot curling iron.  Will probably order more as gifts at Christmas.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my wife wanted for traveling. Packaged perfect</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says, no problems.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! It keeps her from burning more holes on the top of the toilet seat lid which keeps me happy. The hot portion of her straightener sits completely inside so we don&#x27;t have to worry about kids bumping it either.</li>
    <li> I got these for all the girls in my life for christmas and they are fantastic!! Weather its for your room, bathroom, or traveling I love these. No need to let it cool before you pack just roll it right up and no more leg burns from trying to hold the hot styler while adjusting your hair!</li>
    <li> Whoever invented this is a genius. It doesn&#x27;t melt even if the flat iron gets left on. It&#x27;s very soft and the color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for flat irons. It also sticks to any hard surface. I love it!</li>
    <li> I like the Hot Iron Holster. Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say but that it actually works like the description says.  Sticks very well to any counter surface I have and serves it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing that it stays put as shown.  Definitely improves the cluttered look of my iron just laying on the counter.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product, im thinking about buying some for my family memebers. It helps by providing more space</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  It holds up/sticks to our bathroom counter top and never slips off...pretty impressive!</li>
    <li> Works great and I love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever had a flat iron without having a Hot Iron Holster as well! I was ALWAYS knocking my flat iron off the counter and worrying about either someone else or one of my cats touching it when it was hot. This product adheres to the counter great. It has not fallen off at all. Now my flat iron can stay out of the way and no one gets burnt. :)</li>
    <li> Love it.  It keeps the hot appliance off the counter where it can accidentally burn nearby objects. Plus it is a good place to put an appliance while it cools.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful for travel, and they make great gifts. I gave some to friends, and they loved them. I will buy more to give as gifts.</li>
