    <li> This is a great product but there are two drawbacks:  I am very fair complected (Irish-American redhead), and this color is way too dark for my skin, so I have to mix it with another beauty balm to lighten the shade.  Also, I really wish it was SPF 30 (it&#x27;s only 15).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:  Great coverage, and since I apply beauty balm to my whole face, I love that this stuff doesn&#x27;t make the skin around my eyes sting at all!  Very gentle!  I also haven&#x27;t had any pore-clogging problems with it, which is also great.  It&#x27;s nice that in the summertime, I can use a bit more of this to adjust for darkening of my complexion in case I get any sun.  Please keep in mind that I&#x27;m also using it in conjunction with a beauty balm from Lancome.</li>
    <li> Nice bb cream, a nice color for medium to tan skin, without looking like Casper!</li>
    <li> Have roseacea and this provides perfect coverage, not too oily</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product. I am using it for more than a year and it works perfectly. I recommended it</li>
    <li> This product really good.</li>
    <li> I have bought other (much more expensive) BB creams that were paraben free and was disappointed.  This was just what I was looking for!  It has just the right amount of coverage, lasts well, and blends easily.  You can also build coverage.  This is my daily go to.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product.  Initially it was available locally, now I can only find online.  It is works well under foundation as a base or alone for days when I&#x27;m looking for light coverage.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Its tint means this cream won&#x27;t work for everyone--yet the product description doesn&#x27;t mention that it has a tint. A complete waste of my money, thanks Dr. Lewinn!</li>
    <li> Covers well but doesn&#x27;t blends easily, and I live in Florida and it&#x27;s not dark enough for my completion.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Product hydrates skin just perfectly under make up- not greasy and color perfect for light to medium skin tones.  My daughter has ivory skin and it&#x27;s too dark for her.  SPF is always good</li>
    <li> This is a good match for my skin color and blends well. Since the SPF is only 15, I use a sunscreen underneath this BB cream. I will continue to buy and enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product..an anti-aging cream plus foundation..goes a long way too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream before...I like the feel on my face- no stinging.  I especially purchase it because it also serves as a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;The cream very nicely gives my face a more even appearance without any caking.  Yes, I definitely with purchase Kinerase products&lt;br /&gt;again.  Yes,  Amazon seems to have the best price.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, it makes everyones skin look flawless. I recommend it over more expensive bb creams you can find.</li>
    <li> Wonderful B B cream, keeps skin moist not oily and really makes a difference in how I feel about the skin of my face.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream provided more coverage than i expected and made my skin look great.  The only downside was that the day after I wear it, I always notice a large blemish.  My skin is moderately sensitive, so if you have sensitive skin, you might want to pass.  If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, the product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> One box was old and dry</li>
    <li> Item was a perfect match to my skin. Love the feel and look of it. I would definitely buy this again. Great price also!</li>
