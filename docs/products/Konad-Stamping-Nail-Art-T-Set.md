      <li>The top coat is sureme.  </li>
      <li>The biggest surprise was the top coat.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use and really good quality.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stamping is fast, was easy to learn how to do, and the results were amazing!  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It is so fun to do my own nails and look like it came right out of a salon!</li>
      <li>I was so happy I ordered several more plates and bottles of special polish.  </li>
      <li>Also, once you apply the Konad top coat, the images really stand out and look even better.  </li>
      <li>I really like this and after looking at lots of tutorials on how to use this it was very easy.  </li>
      <li>Watch out, it can be very addicting!  :)</li>
      <li>If I wanted to be able to change out the stamping, I could have used a regular top coat and then remove the stamping and top coat with non-acetone remover to do something</li>
      <li>This is fun!</li>
      <li>I purchased this kit to try out the Konad special polish and stamper.</li>
      <li>The paint dries quickly</li>
      <li>I will use this top coat whenever I use regular nail polish and plan on buying more when it runs out.</li>
      <li>This nail art set is a good one, the scraper and stamp are a higher quality than the larger set.  </li>
      <li>They never fail me!</li>
      <li>It dries super fast and keeps your stamping art protected and looking good for several days.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(I did use an old rewards card instead of the included strapper, as I had read in many reviews that the metal strapper tends to scratch the plate.  </li>
      <li>This  product is amazing ,the only down side is that the nail polish don&#x27;t stay long,but other wise the scraper ,the stamper and plates are in a good quality</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>i tried others but KONAD is the best , a bit expensive but worth it .....</li>
      <li>Need to do it super fast..</li>
      <li>Since I had stamped on top of the finished gel, all I had to do was remove the stamping with non-acetone remover and try again (no need to completely redo the whole nail).  </li>
      <li>Good little stamping kit.</li>
      <li>I fully recomend this products to anyone who&#x27;s interested in nail art.</li>
      <li>We tried several times to make sure that we were doing it correctly, but it smeared and the transfer never worked.</li>
      <li>Really like it!</li>
      <li>I then applied another gel top coat and the stamping will last the length of the gel manicure (hopefully about 2 weeks!).  </li>
      <li>My first try with the stamp resulted in a perfect image, but not perfect placement.  </li>
      <li>Watch videos on youtube because it is very tricky to learn to apply but can be mastered with lots of practice.</li>
      <li>Fast reliable shipping.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
      <li>I felt comfortable with the purchase after reading the reviews, but I was so embarrassed the next day when she told me that she couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
      <li>I have purchased several more stamping kits, but I always seem go back to my Konad!  </li>
      <li>I like it better than the standard double ended stamper</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect to get your nails looking like the pictures on your first try, or even your second.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 14 year old niece for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at the professional look once I was done.  </li>
      <li>Good bye to my expensive manis and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit my first time using this product took me a couple of tries to get it</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and dries hard.</li>

    <li> Guys always choose KONAD ... i tried others but KONAD is the best , a bit expensive but worth it .....</li>
    <li> This nail art set is a good one, the scraper and stamp are a higher quality than the larger set.  The quality of the scraper and stamp in the set with the larger amount of plates is low quality so if you want more plates order them alone.</li>
    <li> Need to do it super fast..else the stamper dosent pick the image..</li>

    <li> Good little stamping kit. Fast reliable shipping. Really like it!</li>

    <li> This  product is amazing ,the only down side is that the nail polish don&#x27;t stay long,but other wise the scraper ,the stamper and plates are in a good quality</li>
    <li> Fast shipping works great luv it</li>
    <li> Just received this and tried it immediately.  It worked just as instructions said. I really liked it.  Will purchase more plates soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old niece for Christmas. I felt comfortable with the purchase after reading the reviews, but I was so embarrassed the next day when she told me that she couldn&#x27;t get it to work. We tried several times to make sure that we were doing it correctly, but it smeared and the transfer never worked. I can not recommend the product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this nail stamping set. It is a great set to get just to check it out to see if it is something you are into.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Simple as that. Stamper doesn&#x27;t pick polish up of the image plate. Maybe there is some secret to the process...but we couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
    <li> I received this Konad stamping kit for my birthday along with the Sensationail gel polish kit ([[ASIN:B007YQURGU SensatioNail by Nailene Gel Polish Starter Kit, Raspberry Wine, 1 kit]]).  Stamping was made to go with gel nails!  I completed all the layers of the gel manicure then stamped on top.  My first try with the stamp resulted in a perfect image, but not perfect placement.  Since I had stamped on top of the finished gel, all I had to do was remove the stamping with non-acetone remover and try again (no need to completely redo the whole nail).  The non-acetone remover only removes the stamp, it doesn&#x27;t affect the gel at all.  So within 30 minutes I had 10 perfectly stamped nails.  I then applied another gel top coat and the stamping will last the length of the gel manicure (hopefully about 2 weeks!).  If I wanted to be able to change out the stamping, I could have used a regular top coat and then remove the stamping and top coat with non-acetone remover to do something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamping is fast, was easy to learn how to do, and the results were amazing!  I will be adding other plates to my wish list!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I did use an old rewards card instead of the included strapper, as I had read in many reviews that the metal strapper tends to scratch the plate.  The card worked great every time.)</li>
    <li> This stamping kit is great! I&#x27;ll admit my first time using this product took me a couple of tries to get it right but once I did, it was perfect. The stamp detail transferred perfectly on my nails. I was amazed at the professional look once I was done.  Good bye to my expensive manis and Hello to my at home kit!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically leave reviews, but I&#x27;m trying to start! This works great for me. I didn&#x27;t go with 5 stars just because I really only like two of the designs.</li>
    <li> I really like this and after looking at lots of tutorials on how to use this it was very easy.  I&#x27;m going to be buying more plates from amazon.</li>
    <li> In love! Great quality, easy to use! :)</li>
    <li> For those who have never done nail stamping before, this takes practice.  Don&#x27;t expect to get your nails looking like the pictures on your first try, or even your second.  It took me 5 tries to get one image on one nail, but I got it there and it does work.  I used the plate that comes in this kit and the white nail paint.  The paint dries quickly so you have to learn the rhythm to get it on the stamper and then on the nail.  And once you get it there, you can smear the paint by over-brushing with the top coat.  I&#x27;m looking forward to practicing some more.  This is fun!</li>
    <li> I had never tried any kind of nail stamping.  However, after receiving my Konad Stamping Nail Art-T Kit, I was instantly hooked.  I had watched a few tutorials on Youtube so I knew a litte bit about how to use the kit.  From one tutorial I learned that using an expired credit card or gift card as a scrapper is easier and keeps you from scratching up your plate.  I did my nails in less than half and hour. Also, once you apply the Konad top coat, the images really stand out and look even better.  The top coat is sureme.  It dries super fast and keeps your stamping art protected and looking good for several days.  I was so happy I ordered several more plates and bottles of special polish.  Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper kit and think you are getting a good deal...Konad is by far the best!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several more stamping kits, but I always seem go back to my Konad!  They never fail me!</li>
