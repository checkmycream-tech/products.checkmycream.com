    <li> This product was recommended on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; and it is one of the best ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> We have two climates, hot very hot and cold.  This stuff does work very well, our sun/age spots are going away.</li>
    <li> I have been applying this product to 3 dark spots on my cheek for the past 7 weeks, twice a day. Both my husband and I feel the spots are fading, but I should have taken before pics!</li>
    <li> I love the Boots No7 moisturizer so I purchased the Spot Corrector too. I&#x27;s still waiting to see if the results are as good as advertised since I want to give it a couple of weeks. Although you don&#x27;t apply a lot when you use it, the product seems a little pricey for what you get. But if it works, it will definitely be worth it.</li>
    <li> Do not order this product.  My personal information was hacked.  When I received the order some weeks later, the packaging was weird.  Then I noticed that the mailing address was mine, however the billing address had a Russian name out of Miami, Florida.  I am no longer ordering from Amazon unless they assure my information has not been stolen.  And, just how are they going to do that?  I don&#x27;t think they can.  L.C.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it took awhile but I can see the fading now.  I don&#x27;t have much faith in a lot of fading products but I really think this has something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have not had he product long but am looking forward to using it. I have heard a lot of good feedback on the No 7 line so I am trying it</li>
    <li> Looks the same a month later.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done much for my age spot but started putting it on as an eye cream as have got really dark pigmentation under the eyes giving off a purple hue. This product has reduced this significantly. So I&#x27;m very pleased...also found that my skin around the eyes seems a lot firmer.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for four days now and I can already see a difference in my age spots. Thanks Dr. Oz for letting me know about this product.</li>
    <li> I am mid forties, going through some very real hormonal changes and have been (judgement-free zone here I hope) a lifelong indoor tanning bed user since 16 years of age.  I developed a few (pretty sizable)dark spots on the left side of my face, which I&#x27;d like to attribute to sun while driving since I&#x27;m in the car a lot for my job.... but I live in Pittsburgh. Boots No7 age spot corrector has almost completely faded them entirely!  Its the only product I&#x27;ve tried to actually do what it says. They have been there at least 3 years. I bought it 9 days ago &amp; have used it 1 time every day before moisturizer &amp; makeup &amp; when I remembered, again before bed.  Women spend lots of time, money &amp; hope on beauty products, finally one delivers.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it claimed. It makes my skin look much liter and smoother. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> i love how its working already .... BUT dont like the cost</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see the results, I don&#x27;t believe it really lightens up dark spots.I have tried other dark spot correctors, I was expecting good results from this one because of the No 7 reputation, sorry to say I am hugely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Did not see any real results, serum works way better overall</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting these horrible hyper pigmentation scars along my jawline from plucking little annoying hairs that started coming in since I turned 30. Well, today is day #4 of using this tube morning and night, and the marks are almost completely gone. I can&#x27;t believe it. Amazing stuff!!! I usually don&#x27;t buy drugstore products, more of a dept store/ Sephora cosmetics and face products girl, but not this time. Trust me, it works.</li>
    <li> Still have the 2 spot that I bought the product for but the recommended time of use has not passed yet.  I am hopeful.</li>
    <li> No review until I have used it for 2  months...Can really say until then. I want to be completely honest.</li>
    <li> After three weeks I see no difference.  Big disappointment. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t spend the money on this.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money...it just doesn&#x27;t work.  I applied as directed, there were no results.  Try a different product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work as I had hoped.  It really didn&#x27;t work at all. I would not recommend it.</li>
