### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I had been wanting to get one, but the best ones were $60 and up.</li>

      <li>Very nice set for the price.</li>
      <li>They work well and are good quality.</li>
      <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t perfect, but I think this is a good set for beginners or someone who really wants a versatile brush set.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice case.  </li>
      <li>The brushes come nicely packed &amp; wrapped up, also face brushes come with a brush guard, always nice to have.</li>
      <li>The lip brushes are nice, I feel like a pro when I use those.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d eventually like to replace these with an expencive professional style set, but as a person who doesn&#x27;t do make up for a living, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Very cheap product.</li>
      <li>If you want a good deal on a great assortment of brushes, I would definitely suggest these.</li>
      <li>and I just love them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like them</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Hello it&#x27;s a bargain-under 30 dollars and free shipping!</li>
      <li>Okay so I read all of the reviews</li>
      <li>I love this set.  </li>
      <li>a nice shop! ;]</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brushes are great: What you should ALWAYS do when acquiring new brushes NO MATTER where you get them is shampoo and condition them.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic, your make up gets better finish</li>
      <li>, your brushes are fine.</li>
      <li>And then there was a huge tear in the the case (the mesh casing).</li>
      <li>and you can tell they are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>and I offer free tutorials in my university campus.</li>
      <li>even the case they come in is cheap material  </li>
      <li>There are so many of them for such a good price.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly MAC has a really good cheap one for around 12 dollars that works just GREAT and if you apply makeup almost everyday, make it a habit to clean them every other week or more</li>
      <li>I was excited about this product but when I used it</li>
      <li>Given that these are inexpencive brushes, i have to say i&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
      <li>They are not top of the line, I imagine, but they work great for me!!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter makeup brush set, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
      <li>This is not a bad set to get, (for the price)</li>
      <li>I read the reviews many times over the last week or so before purchasing on many brush sets.</li>
      <li>To me it wasn&#x27;t even worth the 20 something dollars.</li>
      <li>This product is truly worth its price</li>
      <li>not professionally] I have my own tutorials and</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t all do what I&#x27;m sure Bobbi Brown or Mac brushes can, but they&#x27;re a cute little set for getting started or maybe just for travel.</li>
      <li>The eye brushes were okay, some were soft and not too much shedding there.</li>
      <li>However, I am a makeup artist in theater and these brushes, for the price, were exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The hairs fall out of some brushes at first, maybe after the first 15 or so uses, but then thats it</li>
      <li>The first wash, the three biggest brushes lost a bit of bristles.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased.</li>
      <li>And there are too many of the same type brushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this set many times since purchasing 3 weeks ago and have had no problems with shedding or with the ones I use for mineral foundation, blush, or with different styles of mineral eyeshadow picking up the powders.</li>
      <li>This was my first makeup brush set.</li>
      <li>The only good things in this kit are the smaller brushes.</li>
      <li>I am not a makeup expert or anything, and this is the first brush set I have owned, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, it arrived on time, and the costumer service was very convenient when I had my questions.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve made a great investment for I had bought individual brushes in the past that really did not amaze me.</li>
      <li>Buy the main ones you are looking for seperately.</li>
      <li>and I mean this will all the honestly I can because it would matter to me if someone is going to be mislead and overrated by a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get this brush kit and based on the other reviews, I thought I found a total bargain.</li>
      <li>However, once I got past that phase I really got to enjoy using them.  </li>
      <li>There is a bit of a shedding phase with these for the first few uses, particularly the large brushes.  </li>
      <li>Far away.</li>
      <li>Not for professional use</li>
      <li>, watch a tutorial on how to use them because even though they are not NUMBERED, PROFESSIONAL brushes do not need to be in order to know WHICH to use and HOW to use them.</li>
      <li>Overall decent.</li>
      <li>I can barely use it on the sensitive eye area.  </li>
      <li>There is a wide variety of brushes in this set an dthey held up pretty well when i washed them.</li>
      <li>Under normal circumstances, I would&#x27;ve given these 4 stars, but because of the price AND how well the brushes worked for me, I gave an extra star for the price.</li>
      <li>The brushes are soft, but why do they separate from the entire handle of the brush??</li>
      <li>their brush set had plenty of volume and was soft enough not to cause the eyelids any premature aging effects.</li>
      <li>Would have prefered a few less brushes with more volume to the bristles.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Regarding its quality: They are VERY smooth and shed very little and while taken care of properly they can last you a VERY long time.</li>
      <li>What I got was a hot mess.</li>
      <li>I lost a couple of hairs in the bigger brushes but other than that they have held up very well.</li>
      <li>so cannot speak to how well they would work in a professional environment, but can tell you that, if used properly and cleaned regularly and properly, they will take care of you.</li>
      <li>I thought the quality was poor and I ended up investing in high end brushes instead, worth the extra money.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t really mind though, because after that wash there was no more bristles lost.</li>
<li> The ones that are supposed to be soft are, the ones that are supposed to be stiff are, and the ones that are supposed to be thick, lush, and soft are.</li>
<li> I found the bristles on some are a little soft, but you just have to adjust your application technique.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist</li>
<li> this set a couple of times and let them dry.</li>
<li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be using every single brush every single day anyways.     </li>
<li> The eyeshadow brushes were a little flimsy, the bristles to me weren&#x27;t taut enough.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is that the brushes do not have enough volume to the hairs.  </li>
<li> Not even just one or two, there was a lot of shedding and the brush was rough.</li>
<li> Somehow I expected them to be bigger-ish,</li>
<li> I ordered these as well as another brand of brushes, a \\&quot;better\\&quot; brand,\\&quot; and returned the other set.</li>
<li> the bristles are always coming ou and the hairs are very rough  </li>
<li> These would be okay for a starter thing if you only used the eye brushes, the other ones were horrible.</li>
<li> To speed up getting past the shedding phase, I&#x27;d recommend as soon as you get them that you wash them with shampoo, pulling out the loose hairs.  </li>
<li> If you want less than satisfactory brushes, then this company is for you.</li>
<li> I previously owned a brush set from Target and</li>
<li> this is a waste of money  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even washed them a few times and they&#x27;ve lasted.</li>
<li> None of them needed to be re-formed as they dried correctly.</li>
<li> First off the case smells, like everyone said, but I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad.</li>
<li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use it on myself for everyday use, at least not the face ones.</li>
<li> Secondly, the face brushes were very poor quality.</li>
<li> I do not know if maybe I got a bad batch or what, but I should have just spent the extra money and bought a set from sigmabeauty.com.</li>
<li> and it is really hard.  </li>
<li> these are just relaly cheap, terrible brushes  </li>
<li> This company should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a lousy product!</li>
<li> and by that I mean YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> Beyond disappointed.</li>
<li> This can be annoying to some people, but to me I just swish it away with the fan brush (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for FYI).         </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve never used makeup brushes before, so I was in the market for an inexpensive set that could get me started.  There is a bit of a shedding phase with these for the first few uses, particularly the large brushes.  However, once I got past that phase I really got to enjoy using them.  To speed up getting past the shedding phase, I&#x27;d recommend as soon as you get them that you wash them with shampoo, pulling out the loose hairs.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter makeup brush set, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Very nice set for the price. Was purchased as a gift by the wife, she kept them, hehe.  Recommended by my wife!</li>
    <li> the bristles are always coming ou and the hairs are very rough  these are just relaly cheap, terrible brushes  theyre was you get for the price  even the case they come in is cheap material  this is a waste of money  and i threw out the package it came in, so i cannot return it</li>
    <li> I am not a makeup expert or anything, and this is the first brush set I have owned, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to. The brushes aren&#x27;t perfect, but I think this is a good set for beginners or someone who really wants a versatile brush set. Some hairs do start to shed after a while, but nothing too major, so far (and I&#x27;ve owned them for a few months, now). Overall, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  I have just about any and every makeup brush I could ever need.  I just recently went to use the eyeliner brush though and it is really hard.  I can barely use it on the sensitive eye area.  I need to figure out what to do to soften it up - soak in baby oil or something.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product but when I used it I was very disappointed. The brushes shed soooooo much and the bigger ones aren&#x27;t firm enough nor do they have enough volume to do anything with. The only good things in this kit are the smaller brushes. They do apply eye shadow well. But a horrible buy for the price. Very cheap product. One brush was falling apart when I opened it. And there are too many of the same type brushes.Tip: Buy the main ones you are looking for seperately. Tip: Go to an art supply store like Michael&#x27;s or Joann&#x27;s for brushes, specifically eye shadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this brush kit and based on the other reviews, I thought I found a total bargain. What I got was a hot mess. The brushes are soft, but why do they separate from the entire handle of the brush?? And then there was a huge tear in the the case (the mesh casing). I do not know if maybe I got a bad batch or what, but I should have just spent the extra money and bought a set from sigmabeauty.com. Also, I have almost 4 of the same type of brush. Beyond disappointed. This company should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a lousy product! BOO HISS! Beware divas and divos. If you want less than satisfactory brushes, then this company is for you. If not, click away. Far away.</li>
    <li> Given that these are inexpencive brushes, i have to say i&#x27;m pretty pleased. I&#x27;d eventually like to replace these with an expencive professional style set, but as a person who doesn&#x27;t do make up for a living, this is perfect. The hairs fall out of some brushes at first, maybe after the first 15 or so uses, but then thats it, your brushes are fine. I found the bristles on some are a little soft, but you just have to adjust your application technique. 4.5/5 for overall quality.</li>
    <li> So if you want a quick-want to know review in my opinion is you SHOULD get this item.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it arrived on time, and the costumer service was very convenient when I had my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve been applying make-up since the age of 14[although not professionally] I have my own tutorials and how-to&#x27;s and I offer free tutorials in my university campus. Now, keep in mind I&#x27;m in grad school now so YES I have been doing this for over a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are great: What you should ALWAYS do when acquiring new brushes NO MATTER where you get them is shampoo and condition them. I recommend you buy them at the nearest store for make up or hair appliances.  Doing so will prevent them from shedding while during use and will get ride of the excess oils and germs ANY PACKAGING could cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, watch a tutorial on how to use them because even though they are not NUMBERED, PROFESSIONAL brushes do not need to be in order to know WHICH to use and HOW to use them. I&#x27;ve made a great investment for I had bought individual brushes in the past that really did not amaze me. This product is truly worth its price and I mean this will all the honestly I can because it would matter to me if someone is going to be mislead and overrated by a seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing you should do is BUY a cleanser. Surprisingly MAC has a really good cheap one for around 12 dollars that works just GREAT and if you apply makeup almost everyday, make it a habit to clean them every other week or more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding its quality: They are VERY smooth and shed very little and while taken care of properly they can last you a VERY long time. and by that I mean YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice shop! ;]</li>
    <li> I read the reviews many times over the last week or so before purchasing on many brush sets. I decided to take a chance on these and I am so glad I did. I ordered these as well as another brand of brushes, a \\&quot;better\\&quot; brand,\\&quot; and returned the other set. Upon receipt, I shampoo&#x27;d this set a couple of times and let them dry. None of them needed to be re-formed as they dried correctly. I&#x27;ve used this set many times since purchasing 3 weeks ago and have had no problems with shedding or with the ones I use for mineral foundation, blush, or with different styles of mineral eyeshadow picking up the powders. Under normal circumstances, I would&#x27;ve given these 4 stars, but because of the price AND how well the brushes worked for me, I gave an extra star for the price. The ones that are supposed to be soft are, the ones that are supposed to be stiff are, and the ones that are supposed to be thick, lush, and soft are. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist so cannot speak to how well they would work in a professional environment, but can tell you that, if used properly and cleaned regularly and properly, they will take care of you.</li>
    <li> You know that for the price you&#x27;re not getting MAC cosmetic brushes. However, I am a makeup artist in theater and these brushes, for the price, were exactly what I needed. They don&#x27;t even shed. If you want a good deal on a great assortment of brushes, I would definitely suggest these. I&#x27;ve even washed them a few times and they&#x27;ve lasted.</li>
    <li> Okay so I read all of the reviews and I decided I was going to chance it and buy them anyways. First off the case smells, like everyone said, but I didn&#x27;t think it was that bad. Secondly, the face brushes were very poor quality. I ran my fingers over the fan brush and the others, and bristles were falling out. Not even just one or two, there was a lot of shedding and the brush was rough. I would not use that on anyones face. The eye brushes were okay, some were soft and not too much shedding there. I&#x27;m an aspiring and certified makeup artist with a budget, and this was not up to my standards. To me it wasn&#x27;t even worth the 20 something dollars. I ended up returning it the very next day. These would be okay for a starter thing if you only used the eye brushes, the other ones were horrible. Not for professional use and I wouldn&#x27;t use it on myself for everyday use, at least not the face ones. All in all I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup brush set recently.  It comes in a nice case.  The only complaint I have is that the brushes do not have enough volume to the hairs.  Would have prefered a few less brushes with more volume to the bristles.  I previously owned a brush set from Target and their brush set had plenty of volume and was soft enough not to cause the eyelids any premature aging effects.</li>
    <li> The brushes come nicely packed &amp; wrapped up, also face brushes come with a brush guard, always nice to have. Brushes do have a lot of fall out. and you can tell they are cheaply made. If your looking for a variety of brushes for a low price. Or even just starting out in makeup. This is not a bad set to get, (for the price)</li>
    <li> There is a wide variety of brushes in this set an dthey held up pretty well when i washed them. I lost a couple of hairs in the bigger brushes but other than that they have held up very well.</li>
    <li> This was my first makeup brush set. I had been wanting to get one, but the best ones were $60 and up.I settled for this one because of its great price. Hello it&#x27;s a bargain-under 30 dollars and free shipping! I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to be using every single brush every single day anyways.     The eyeshadow brushes were a little flimsy, the bristles to me weren&#x27;t taut enough. But I also saw this as an advantage for the blending brushes-you need it to be flexible for sweeping color. The lip brushes are nice, I feel like a pro when I use those.    The first wash, the three biggest brushes lost a bit of bristles. I don&#x27;t really mind though, because after that wash there was no more bristles lost. The eyeshadow brushes do create a lot of fallout. This can be annoying to some people, but to me I just swish it away with the fan brush (that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for FYI).         Overall decent. If you&#x27;re looking for a big set of fancy lookin&#x27; brushes, get these. They don&#x27;t all do what I&#x27;m sure Bobbi Brown or Mac brushes can, but they&#x27;re a cute little set for getting started or maybe just for travel.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, your make up gets better finish and you can make shadows that you never imagine</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift for Christmas and I just love them. There are so many of them for such a good price. They work well and are good quality. They are not top of the line, I imagine, but they work great for me!!</li>
    <li> I thought the quality was poor and I ended up investing in high end brushes instead, worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> The makeup brushes arrived as scheduled.  Somehow I expected them to be bigger-ish, but yeah!  I initially planned them as a b-day gift for an aspiring dancer (it took forever to find), but Christmas is closer now.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll like them</li>
