      <li>They both work really great.</li>
      <li>These are very nice and worked for my daughter to make her &amp;#34;cheer curls&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The best thing to note with these rollers is that because they do give you a more authentic curl, it is best to use a setting lotion to prevent friz.</li>

      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the hot sticks!</li>

      <li>I love these curlers!</li>
      <li>This works amazing.  </li>
      <li>They give you a nice spiral curl and I love them.</li>
      <li>i should&#x27;ve known better because it did nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>I thought I would get more of a spiral curl/</li>
      <li>or longer, even better curl.  </li>
      <li>They seemed easy to use&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>Perfect temp, tight, full curls, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>They heat up quickly and, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>When I got these I was excited for a change of pace</li>
      <li>When I got these curlers for Christmas, I was excited.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this set if you have a lot of hair that needs to be perfect for a long time.</li>
      <li>Bought for my wife who was looking for the kind of flexible curlers this set offers, in part to curl hair on our granddaughters.</li>
      <li>The easy placement and the curly results are appreciated.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to have a low heat setting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These sticks give a tighter curl which was the style I am wearing requires right now.</li>
      <li>I am always looking for a new way to do vintage hair and these are a great alternative to wet sets like sleeping in pincurls, or sponge rollers.</li>
      <li>These are so hot that we couldn&#x27;t even handle them.</li>
      <li>After using this, I am scared to put it away after my first attempt, during which I almost dropped the container.</li>
      <li>I bought this set because it had more rollers in it than the basic hotsticks.  </li>
      <li>The two different sizes give more options on what style of curls that you want to do.</li>
      <li>They were exactly as advertised and the shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>I bought both these ones and the Conair brand of hot sticks.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t have any problem with the rollers being too hot or burning my fingers.  </li>
      <li>Hot sticks hold curls all day.  </li>
      <li>These hot sticks are really hot and the heat burns your fingers.</li>
      <li>the 20 set rollers, only the 14 roller sets and 6 more rollers makes the difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It also has a hot, titanium base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>These take a long time to cool.&lt;br /&gt;There are some nice aspects to these curlers, for instance, heating is quick and does not waste time.</li>
      <li>The ends of hair tend to frizz and be straight if you don&#x27;t get them curled just right.</li>
      <li>Didnt really get hot.  </li>
      <li>and now I got one with all large sticks</li>
      <li>Product does not heat up as fast or well as the conair version.</li>
      <li>The heating is quick but you need to make sure you waited long enough because there is no indication to tell you when this is ready.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that these curlers get super hot.</li>
      <li>Good price with this seller, because other sellers cost double this seller.  </li>
      <li>I did like these ones a little better because they are not quite as hot to touch as the Conair brand.</li>
      <li>Not only does it burn your fingers, but when trying to get a full length curl the curlers also burn parts of your scalp</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these curlers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item if you have this type of hair.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived with only 19 Hot Sticks!  </li>
      <li>should definitely buy these hot sticks if you can deal with this.</li>
      <li>It certainly works better for me than the Hot Rollers previously purchased that cam in a big box, with an array of various sizes rollers, most useless for my type of hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also sticks cool down faster which is a con for my hair type.</li>
      <li>My hair came out super curly with tight ringlets.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this for medium to long hair length.  </li>
      <li>Curls are a little too full for short hair.</li>
      <li>My only objection: there is no light to indicate the intensity of the sticks and such light or  reading would have helped.  </li>
      <li>This is a waste of fifty five bucks, and I will not be suggesting these hot sticks to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;-Piper</li>
      <li>I have very long and straight hair that never holds curls on any other type of rollers.</li>

<li> When you remove the &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; just help them glide down, if you need wild curls just &amp;#34;ruffle&amp;#34; the tresses</li>
<li> The BABYLISS seems to work well for my type of hair coarse, thick and straight.  </li>
<li> My hair stayed curly all day long.</li>
<li> but this was not what I expected.</li>
<li> The only problem is she is very thick hair and there just aren&#x27;t enough to do all her hair at once.</li>
<li> A little difficult to tell when these are ready but other than that... works</li>
<li> I have very long thick hair.</li>
<li> return no good for me , not as expected.</li>
<li> I took the small ones out</li>
<li> , it was difficult to set curlers in the back of my head because there is nothing in place to catch the hair.</li>
<li> It was hard to roll hair around them without burning our fingers.</li>
<li> Not good for thick hair.  </li>
<li> The spiral sticks caused my hair to kink so it looked horrible when I removed the rollers.</li>

    <li> The BABYLISS seems to work well for my type of hair coarse, thick and straight.

My only objection: there is no light to indicate the intensity of the sticks and such light or  reading would have helped.  Have only used twice so far.&lt;br /&gt;ALLTISSIMA4BEST</li>
    <li> if i could give this product a zero i would. i bought this because a friend of min swore by it. i should&#x27;ve known better because it did nothing for my hair. it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Didnt really get hot.  RETURNED</li>
    <li> These were nice-sized, you have to develop a technique to use them. The ends of hair tend to frizz and be straight if you don&#x27;t get them curled just right.</li>
    <li> I love these curlers! They give you a nice spiral curl and I love them. They were exactly as advertised and the shipping was fast! I highly recommend these curlers.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have very long thick hair. The tightness with which you wrap the hair matters and also how close to scalp you roll the stick. Play with both to get the results you want</li>
    <li> Posted by Elizabeth Martinez, I bought this set because I have used hotsticks for years, but Conair no longer carries the 20 set rollers, only the 14 roller sets and 6 more rollers makes the difference in my hair.  I have very long and straight hair that never holds curls on any other type of rollers. Hot sticks hold curls all day.  They heat up quickly and, easy to use.  Leave on 10 min. or longer, even better curl.  I highly recommend this item if you have this type of hair.  Good price with this seller, because other sellers cost double this seller.  Thank you for coming up with this 20 roller set.</li>
    <li> return no good for me , not as expected.</li>
    <li> Product does not heat up as fast or well as the conair version. Also sticks cool down faster which is a con for my hair type.</li>

    <li> Bought for my wife who was looking for the kind of flexible curlers this set offers, in part to curl hair on our granddaughters. It works great!</li>
    <li> When I got these curlers for Christmas, I was excited. They seemed easy to use&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely buy these hot sticks if you can deal with this. These hot sticks are really hot and the heat burns your fingers. Not only does it burn your fingers, but when trying to get a full length curl the curlers also burn parts of your scalp The heating is quick but you need to make sure you waited long enough because there is no indication to tell you when this is ready. After using this, I am scared to put it away after my first attempt, during which I almost dropped the container. These take a long time to cool.&lt;br /&gt;There are some nice aspects to these curlers, for instance, heating is quick and does not waste time. The two different sizes give more options on what style of curls that you want to do. In my opinion, through all the pain you know in the end your hair looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I think you should not buy these, stick to your curling iron. It does the same job, but does not burn you.  When I got these I was excited for a change of pace but this was not what I expected. This is a waste of fifty five bucks, and I will not be suggesting these hot sticks to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;-Piper</li>
    <li> These are very nice and worked for my daughter to make her &amp;#34;cheer curls&amp;#34;.  The only problem is she is very thick hair and there just aren&#x27;t enough to do all her hair at once.</li>
    <li> Will take some practice but a good item.</li>
    <li> This works great. My hair came out super curly with tight ringlets. It was a bit frizzy when I removed the curlers, but relaxed over the next hour. My hair stayed curly all day long. The only downside is that these curlers get super hot. It would be nice to have a low heat setting. I couldn&#x27;t use these every day...the intense heat would destroy my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it was difficult to set curlers in the back of my head because there is nothing in place to catch the hair. Maybe this will become easier as I get used to the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the hot sticks!</li>
    <li> This works amazing.  Gave me beautiful curls very quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect temp, tight, full curls, easy to use.  Didn&#x27;t have any problem with the rollers being too hot or burning my fingers.  Would highly recommend this for medium to long hair length.  Curls are a little too full for short hair.</li>
    <li> I got two of these. I took the small ones out and now I got one with all large sticks</li>
    <li> These are so hot that we couldn&#x27;t even handle them. It was hard to roll hair around them without burning our fingers. I can&#x27;t imagine the damage they do to hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter was in a production this year that required perfect Nellie Olson style curls.  I bought this set because it had more rollers in it than the basic hotsticks.  It also has a hot, titanium base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, she had absolutely perfect curls.  She was actually the example of how the hair is supposed to look.  The curls lasted all night, and were even partly there in the morning.  I would highly recommend this set if you have a lot of hair that needs to be perfect for a long time.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t stay in my hair.  Not good for thick hair.  Did not meet my expectations.  I thought I would get more of a spiral curl/</li>
    <li> The easy placement and the curly results are appreciated.  When you remove the &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; just help them glide down, if you need wild curls just &amp;#34;ruffle&amp;#34; the tresses</li>
    <li> No complaints on the service of the seller or the delivery time, the product just didn&#x27;t work for my hair. The spiral sticks caused my hair to kink so it looked horrible when I removed the rollers.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan, but it could have been user error. Made kinks in my hair.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to tell when these are ready but other than that... works</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a new way to do vintage hair and these are a great alternative to wet sets like sleeping in pincurls, or sponge rollers. I bought both these ones and the Conair brand of hot sticks. They both work really great. I did like these ones a little better because they are not quite as hot to touch as the Conair brand. I was doing vintage hairstyles yesterday for a 1940&#x27;s ball and used these on several people&#x27;s hair. They worked on everyone that I used them on, even the ladies that swore their hair does not hold curl. The best thing to note with these rollers is that because they do give you a more authentic curl, it is best to use a setting lotion to prevent friz. I would definitely recommend these as I was skeptical prior to use:)</li>
    <li> Item arrived with only 19 Hot Sticks!  Package was sealed correctly.</li>
