      <li>Overall good buy!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect combination when used with the other products sold by Suave.</li>
      <li>Overall, I was very impressed and will continue to use this product to keep my hair looking salon fresh.  </li>
      <li>Silver can is easy to hold</li>
      <li>Strong hold hairspray, once you put it in, you cannot put fingers thru hair.</li>
      <li>This is a good hairspray if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on those high end salon brands.  </li>
      <li>I bought Nexxus Maxximum Super Hold Styling and Finishing Mist and like it a lot better.</li>
      <li>It manages to hold the hair in place &amp; yet maintain softness, which was important to me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap to.</li>
      <li>It smells like light perfume.</li>
      <li>I bought this once with a free coupon and have never switched after 5 years.</li>
      <li>love this hairspray for the price it works just as good if not better than the higher priced items and it smells great</li>
      <li>I was even more impressed with how LIGHTWEIGHT it goes on-like a mist, really; and wow, is my hair SO SOFT!!!  </li>
      <li>They really need to mention how strong and feminine the scent is, because it is VERY strong.</li>
      <li>This works well, sprays on a fine mist and holds adequately well.  </li>
      <li>First off, I really love the smell of this hairspray.</li>
      <li>Everyone I know likes to touch my hair; it&#x27;s naturally red &amp; full of bouncy, perfect curls &amp; SO soft &amp; shiny-</li>
      <li>, Suave Professionals line is true to its name in quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I figured this would be a nice, lightweight finishing hairspray, not a heavy mega-hold one.</li>
      <li>Definitely a good back up hair spray for the price.</li>
      <li>The price is right and has a light girly smell.</li>
      <li>I prefer unscented sprays and although this is mild, it is still a bit sweet for me.</li>
      <li>Good hold, soft finish and a real bargain at the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and I will continue to use this brand in the future.</li>
      <li>I love to use this product when I curl my hair, it&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t get too firm to the point that I look like a 10 year old playing house.</li>
      <li>Its soft and your able to brush your hair after in spray it.</li>
      <li>The hold is great without being stiff.  </li>
      <li>Does the job right.</li>
      <li>The hold it gives you is just right,</li>
      <li>Other than that, for normal use and hold, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>I really liked Suave Professional when it was in the black can -- the sprayer tip was more gentle, and with fine hair, it didn&#x27;t blow my hair all over the place when the spray came out.</li>
      <li>; ) ;  lok hahaha true</li>
      <li>Was extremely happy to have found this product offered - it has been extremely hard to find in stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This spray is really good at keeping your hair to stay like you want all day. It&#x27;s great and all until the spray dries and stays on all day till you try and comb it out. It kind of puts your hair into a crunchy nest. Awesome start but bad finish.</li>
    <li> This is a good hairspray if you don&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on those high end salon brands.  This works well, sprays on a fine mist and holds adequately well.  I have medium length hair and other sprays were either too wet or too stiff.  This hairspray does not contain water.  A lot of hairsprays do. I always check because the sprays that contain water are too wet going on and leave a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look when they dry.  I bought it for the first time yesterday because the previous one I tried that cost nearly $6.00 left my hair so stiff and dull looking that I threw it out.  This spray leaves the hair touchable, yet holds the style.  The fragrance is a bit \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t last.  No conflict with perfume or lotions.  Excellent buy.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I suggest other brands if you are picky and don&#x27;t mind spending extra money but this is great for the price and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is stated, performance-wise. It&#x27;s just a shame that it is EXCESSIVELY fragrant. It is closer to the strength of perfumes than it is to your normal styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know I am a man, but I have used plenty of hairsprays/other styling products that don&#x27;t make me smell like flowers. They really need to mention how strong and feminine the scent is, because it is VERY strong.</li>
    <li> The hold is good for this hairspray, but it made my hair dull and matte looking. I bought Nexxus Maxximum Super Hold Styling and Finishing Mist and like it a lot better. Too bad it costs more than twice as much as the Suave.</li>
    <li> I love the price of this hairspray. It works well, without feeling too stiff. The smell is pleasant as well. The only bad thing is if you find you need more hold and spray more than usual, you will see a fine build up on your hair. Other than that, for normal use and hold, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products on my hair, but decided to do it up and got myself this hairspray.  It holds, definitely not all day, but can leave white flakes in your hair.  I would guarantee there are better products out there though they may be pricier.</li>
    <li> This is the hairspray I was looking for, but thought I&#x27;d have to spend 5x&#x27;s as much to find.  A nice surprise, Suave Professionals line is true to its name in quality and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item along with [[ASIN:B002VA4FX0 Suave Professionals Shampoo, Almond &amp; Shea Butter for Dry, Damaged Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] and [[ASIN:B002VA4FXU Suave Professionals Conditioner, Almond &amp; Shea Butter for Dry, Damaged Hair, 14.5-ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]] to attempt to get back a look I&#x27;ve lost through flat iron styling and color treating my shoulder-length, forty-something hair.  Both the shampoo and conditioner did a fantastic job at moisturizing, softening and bringing back my hair&#x27;s shine, and then the scary part... how to keep the style in place and not mess up the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professionals Hairspray in the &#x27;touchable finish, extra hold&#x27; worked very well for me.  No sticky residue - touchable - and yet it holds my hair in place.  The spray is very fine and comes out of the container with a great deal of force.  Short bursts worked the best for me to put the finishing touches on my flat-ironed style.  The spray had no dulling affect on my hair&#x27;s shine and no &#x27;just sprayed&#x27; scent lingered.  Overall, I was very impressed and will continue to use this product to keep my hair looking salon fresh.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray!  Smells great. Holds well without being stiff.  I use this with my 3 daughters all with different hair types.  Only use this one!</li>
    <li> I chose the cheapest hairspray possible to do what it needed to do, it makes my hair stay in place and isn&#x27;t hard after i use it, my hair actually moves! love it</li>
    <li> I love the hairspray.  I think it gives a moderately-firm hold without looking like you sprayed glue on your head.  My husband says the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough but it&#x27;s because he also uses a firm hold gel so his frame of reference is different and he&#x27;s holding a tight haircut vs. long locks.  For women&#x27;s bangs and curls, it will hold them without making them look plastic.  I like the smell too, it&#x27;s light and fresh and dissipates quickly so it won&#x27;t interfere with your perfumes or other products.</li>
    <li> Was extremely happy to have found this product offered - it has been extremely hard to find in stores. Very fine mist, fabulous hold and smells good too.</li>
    <li> I bought this once with a free coupon and have never switched after 5 years.Absolutely love that it is lightweight yet still holds.  I like that it is not sticky or stiff.  I do get frustrated that once in awhile I get a bottle where the spray clogs, but not enough to make me switch.</li>
    <li> It holds softly.  Not a still spray which is what I was after.  Holds styles for most of the work day.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love to use this product when I curl my hair, it&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t get too firm to the point that I look like a 10 year old playing house.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect combination when used with the other products sold by Suave. I like the fragrance. The hold it gives you is just right,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent hairspray, but don&#x27;t spray it too close to your head or too much as it will clump up into visible white blobs.</li>
    <li> I just reviewed a &amp;#34;touchable finish&amp;#34; spray by Cristophe and linked back to this Suave spray as a comparison - and then discovered that I never wrote a review here. I have been using this spray for several months and am very happy with it. I have tried more expensive sprays - and am willing to pay the premium if I found something I felt was worth it. While Elnett and Sebastian are setting the standard in the salon industry these days, they are at least 6x more expensive than the Suave Professionals and IMHO not worth the price. This spray holds just as well while leaving your hair &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34; as the more expensive sprays. I only dropped a star because of the fragrance - I prefer unscented sprays and although this is mild, it is still a bit sweet for me. But the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and won&#x27;t interfere with your own perfume so it&#x27;s only a minor nuisance. A great product at a great price...</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t hold my curls not one bit, I might as well put nothing in my hair. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray for the price it works just as good if not better than the higher priced items and it smells great holds my hair in place all day love it!</li>
    <li> Salon quality without the salon price! Use this for any hair style I do holds great and smells good to.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but does the trick. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but I&#x27;m really sensitive to smells so it may not bother you. Better for just daily use, but not for like date curls or something. I liked it for school days. It&#x27;s cheap to. Definitely a good back up hair spray for the price. The bottle fits really good in the hands which I liked! Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. I found that it wore off halfway through the day. Also, I realized I was allergic to it. I got a red, itchy rash on my head and ears and even the tops of my shoulders. Once I stopped using it, the rash went away. I even started using it again to test it out, sure enough the rash came back. I&#x27;ve never been allergic to any hair product. (And I&#x27;ve used a LOT of hair products...!) You might want to try out a sample of this stuff before you buy it. (Even though committing to buy it won&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!)</li>
    <li> Good hold, soft finish and a real bargain at the price. I used to buy the Big Hair brand that was more than 4x the cost and I am just as happy with this.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals hair spray works great. The price is right and has a light girly smell. I will buy this hair spray again.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair that requires an extra duty hair spray.  This was okay but I&#x27;ve used better.  Would buy again only if the price remains low.  Otherwise will stick to better-holding brands.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I am soooo happy I decided to give it a try. First off, I really love the smell of this hairspray. It&#x27;s really sweet and it makes my hair smell so wonderful. Second off, it is a flexible hold that gives off a smooth finish without making your hair crunchy. I use this product everyday to keep frizzies from ruining my hair and to give it extra hold without making my hair stuff.</li>
    <li> The hold is very good and smells nice.  I do feel though, that after I apply, my hair is a bit dry.  It does not bother me as much.  for the price, it is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This is really not a &amp;#34;Touchable Finish&amp;#34;, but it is Extra Hold, so they didn&#x27;t completely lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keep in mind, if your hair is dry, or even slightly moist/damp when you spray this, it WILL hold right away, and to re-style, you will have to wash your hair out again with more water, or else you will be faced with that dreaded flakiness that comes from too much gel/hairspray. And here I thought I escaped that back in middle school! ARGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Tresemme&#x27;s Extra Hold (http://www.amazon.com/TRESemme-Freeze-Hold-Spray-Ounce/dp/B004KQ9JMA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358836442&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;tresemme+hairspray) as it does the same thing, but if you need to restyle it, just adding a little water to your hair, and then restyling will work. And if you do want to dry re-style, it does not cause flakiness. But for heaven&#x27;s sakes, don&#x27;t get that 6-pack, it&#x27;s actually more expensive, vs. buying a single one at Walgreens or CVS!</li>
    <li> Good for wet weather and tight doo&#x27;s.  It smells like light perfume. Does not clog . Silver can is easy to hold</li>
    <li> I love the scent to it. It holds my two daughter&#x27;s hair styles and mine. Each of us have different hair types. My only disappointment is the flaky residue it can create. Not leaving the &#x27;touchable finish&#x27; it claims.</li>
    <li> .... especially for naturally curly/wavy hair.  Works better than the salon products for 10x as much!  I&#x27;d highly recommend;  best around!</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchaseWhen I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> Been using this for the past few weeks.  Holds well, but my hair is so soft and touchable.  Good scent.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product.Just enough to keep your hair neat. If  your the kind of person that likes your hair  not to move all day i dont suggest this. Its soft and your able to brush your hair after in spray it.</li>
    <li> This hairspray has very nice hold.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the spray is uniform to apply, holds great, but doesn&#x27;t look or feel sticky.</li>
    <li> Love them smell and the hold is great!  Got this at a good price too!  This is as good or better than pricier brands.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells good. Does the job right. I specifically bought since I have curly hair. My curls stay tight.</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to the Extra Hold label without spraying multiple layers to prevent wind gusts.  And still I&#x27;m left with a white residue for over spraying from the water-down formula.  I will not buy ever again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good cheap hairspray that smells fantastic, this is it. By far not the best money can buy, but I love it and use it in a pinch when I&#x27;m out of my $16/bottle Bed Head Masterpiece hairspray. Love the scent. Same price at Wal-Mart, but would rather order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door anyday than have to fight the WM crowd.</li>
    <li> love this product but can not get amymore</li>
    <li> Best, most touchable hairspray that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  The hold is great without being stiff.  FAR too many hairsprays go on wet and ruin your style.  This hairspray mists on perfectly.</li>
    <li> It might be the best product in the world or whatever, it&#x27;s useless if you can&#x27;t use it. There was no sprey cap on top of the bottle (it&#x27;s missing). You cannot return it as they have &amp;#34;we-don&#x27;t-take-back-hazardous, flamable-things&amp;#34; policy.</li>
    <li> It smells like perfume and gets the job done. I&#x27;m very satisfied and I will continue to use this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought this hairspray to go along with my Remington curling wand and it was meant to be perfect! It has a very good hold. Overall good buy! Thanks -5stars</li>
    <li> This hairspray is significantly stiffer than most.... If you don&#x27;t used car to limit your spraying to just a couple of seconds, your hair will have a hard shell. Garnier, at a similar price, is noticeably softer.</li>
    <li> I figured this would be a nice, lightweight finishing hairspray, not a heavy mega-hold one. Wrong. It also has a flowery smell that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used hairspray in many, many years-I don&#x27;t like the crunchy, sticky feel, so I quit using it a long time ago.  I wondered why no one had came up with a &#x27;touchable, soft&#x27; hairspray...enter this Suave Hair Spray!!&lt;br /&gt;  It has a great scent, first of all, I was impressed.  I was even more impressed with how LIGHTWEIGHT it goes on-like a mist, really; and wow, is my hair SO SOFT!!!  It manages to hold the hair in place &amp; yet maintain softness, which was important to me.  Everyone I know likes to touch my hair; it&#x27;s naturally red &amp; full of bouncy, perfect curls &amp; SO soft &amp; shiny-even strangers have come up to me &amp; wanted to touch my hair.  I like it to remain soft-this hairspray is FANTASTIC!!!!!  I will definitely NEVER buy another brand/style again...this is AMAZING!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;**It also lasts a really long time; I use it 2-4 times a week &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure it will last around 6 months, maybe longer.  I L-O-V-E this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;*****VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!*****</li>
    <li> I really liked Suave Professional when it was in the black can -- the sprayer tip was more gentle, and with fine hair, it didn&#x27;t blow my hair all over the place when the spray came out. This one I have to hold it at arm&#x27;s length so the sprayer doesn&#x27;t kill my hairstyle. I do however like the new scent and it holds just as good as before, which is why I still gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> ) ;it is very strong and crisps you hair dont waste money buy better !!!!&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl; ) ;  lok hahaha true</li>
    <li> This hairspray really hold up, keeps your hair in place. A little goes a long ways. Strong hold hairspray, once you put it in, you cannot put fingers thru hair.</li>
