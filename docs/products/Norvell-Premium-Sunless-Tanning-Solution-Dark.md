<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived with a broken cap.... Not sure how long the solution will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many sunless solutions for my spray tan machine and this one takes the cake! yes its more expensive but ladies its worth it. Once this color starts to fade off of me I for once dont look like I have a skin eating disorder and my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t look at me and ask whats wrong with your skin LOL. Its the perfect golden tan.. the only thing I dont care for is the smell afterwards but A girl can&#x27;t complain when It looks like Ive been in the bahamas all week laying out.</li>
    <li> my wife got this for me to spray her. and I got to tell you I am not a professional tan guy but this worked great. just need to take it easy when spraying but works great. you have to move evenly up and down and wait until it dries first. put little more than it needs after first shower it looks great</li>
    <li> I bought this for a spray tan machine that I just got. The spray that came with it was terrible so I searched the internet and found that this has really good reviews.  I love the color!  It goes on great and I have yet to have any problems with being orange.  It looks very natural every time and I am fair to begin with.  I actually just bought my 2nd bottle today.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am really happy witn this product. It looks very natural and has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product it has a great color and no streak it smells good and has some instant color and after your first shower it stays for me up 2 a week and a few days I will definitely order more but this size bottle will last awhile I live it in my spray tan machine... I also put a little in a small spray bottle to touch up on Face neck and chest if I need to</li>
    <li> First time I have used this! Beautiful color on all skin tones and very long lasting! I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Worked well on multiple people with multiple skin shades.</li>
    <li> Just the right color.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunless tanning solution i have ever purchased.. I love the smell and gives me a perfect color on my skin.</li>
    <li> Color is great and it came to my house fast. I won&#x27;t use any solution but Norvell.</li>
    <li> I love this sunless tanner it looks completely natural  the whole bottle last me months! It gives you an instant bronze so you know where you are putting the product on  your body and it last for about a week. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it with the spray gun but I guess your supposed to but I just would put some in my daily lotion and shake it up, apply it with my tanning mit and it work just like if I used a spray gun lol and the whole bottle lasted me more than a couple months.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff,  if you wanna be TAN then it&#x27;s the stuff for you. It&#x27;s not meant to be a light tan. But it doesn&#x27;t streak at all.</li>
    <li> Amending my previous review (which had 5 stars)...&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this product for over a year now. Before this I used Suntana (which was mediocre)  and once I found Norvell- I thought this would be my forever solution; however, after my last two purchases, I am sad to say I will not buy this product again. I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients have changed or what- but I can tell you it&#x27;s not the same as is used to be. It peels and flakes off of my skin and leaves awful patches after a couple of days- it&#x27;s horrible! Very disappointed and a little put out that I now have to find a new solution to call my own again. I know I can scratch Suntana and Norvell of my list.</li>
    <li> I am an estetician and this stuff smells great and looks great on. It&#x27;s not orange. Love it</li>
    <li> I use this spray tan solution all the time. It is by far the best product out there to give you a great looking tan. This spray tan solution has a maximum 6 month shelf life. We ordered this product in the end of October, it was delivered in November but the born on day was July 2013, which only gives us a 30 day window to use. If you use the solution after its 6 month shelf life you will not get as good of a tan and it will fade quickly. Beware of sellers like \\&quot;I Shop Happy\\&quot; who are selling you a product that will expire in 30 days. The product is AMAZING, the seller - not so much!</li>
    <li> This solution is perfect. I wont use anything else. and came promptly. I would highly recommend it for anyone into spray tans.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Clients love the color!</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! It goes on even , and lasts about a week. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other products.. The color is natural and gorgeous. I am naturally very pale and always get compliments on my awesome tan!</li>
    <li> I have used this and loved it for 2 years but for some reason the last 2 orders I have purchased have not been keeping the color that I used to obtain from this product.  I don&#x27;t know what has changed but the color is not lasting as long as before.  It used to last at least a week but now for some reason it only last MAYBE 3 days.  Not happy with the change?????</li>
    <li> This product is great, color is flawless, and last awhile, fades gradually, and does not smell!! Everyone, I have sprayed loves this color!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff tan lasts a good 4-5 days looks brown not fake at all highly recommend</li>
    <li> absolutely love the color that it gives your skin , no orange tint at all many compliments on this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried nearly ever kind of tanning solution available and nothing really compares. Great color, sent, and it is no where near as sticky on your skin as the other solutions I have tried.  I love the instant bronzers and the color seems to hold for about 5 to 6 days before I need to spray again.</li>
    <li> I do airbrush tans for a living and decided to purchase this product after reading decent reviews. Every single customer that I used it on looked orange and even more orange in the sunlight. I was so embarrassed and had to refund them their money!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, this color can go on pretty dark if you apply it enough.  The color doesn&#x27;t last long.  I can shower the next day and most of it comes off.  The smell is good &amp; very light.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t order again since it doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough.</li>
    <li> I love this solution!  It dries much better than others, doesn&#x27;t smell as strong, and there is no orange tint.  A very nice brown color. Will be buying this solution again.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;m naturally super super duper pale and this stuff gives a great deep dark tan that isn&#x27;t orange.  All of my friends have been asking about my tan and say it looks really natural.  It has a bronzer that goes on when you apply so you can see that you&#x27;re applying it evenly and get an idea of how dark it will be... And then the real &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; develops over the next few hours and makes it even darker.  I usually do it an hour before I go to bed and when I wake up I have a gorgeous dark tan.  I use this with my Luminess Tan spray tan machine and just fill up the bottles that came with the machine with this.  It works great and it&#x27;s way cheaper than spending $45 on a spray tan every other week at a salon.  OH and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on your clothes or bedding.. A++++ for that. Nobody likes orange sheets!  I will be buying this again- I might even try the Venetian color next</li>
    <li> I am loving this color so far, it stays sticky for about an hour after application.  I love the dark guide color, it makes it much easier to apply.  This may be my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product, i have tried several products and this is by far the best solution i have used for sunless tans.</li>
    <li> No orange color on my fair skin, I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. A client favorite for a &#x27;medium&#x27; tan!</li>
    <li> Seems to give a very natural looking tan - no orange color like so many others.  Also lasts through showering.  Will buy again and can highly recommend to others with spray tanning equipment.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and looks great!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this product.  I usually bye her the ocean brand  tanning liquid but I decided to try this out instead. The spray  doesn&#x27;t turn up right away but in a couple of hours it gets really dark!</li>
    <li> Great product (happy customers great results) excellent customer support.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different tanning solutions and was hesitant to try a new one but this one is amazing! The colour looks great and lasts longer than expected. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Color looks natural and fades well.</li>
    <li> It gives me the perfect tan and is not streaky. It doesn&#x27;t clog my machine like other spray tans I have purchased it the past.  Also the tan fades well.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Evens out perfectly, and is fool proof! Also everyone can be dark! I&#x27;ve used this on fair to dark, and its always perfect! I own my own salon, and this is the only color I keep! If customers want natural, I just use 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Let me start by first off saying that I have tried just about every self-tanner out there.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with an orangy and/or inconsistant color.  I&#x27;ve tried Mystic Tanning - which I found to be just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;  and spray tans done by professionals @ salons.  I found the spray tans to be - by FAR - the most realistic looking tan...but the price was crazy and I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep it up.  I saw that the salon I was going to was using this brand - Norvell Amber Sun Dark and decided to buy it myself.  My husband uses this solution in his air compressor (nothing fancy...just a normal compressor) - there are a ton of youtube video&#x27;s on how to properly tan someone using this method.  I LOVE this solution - it is bronzy and not at all orange or brassy looking.  There is a smell afterwards but it&#x27;s not bad...kind of smells like tanning lotion.  I like that this has a bronzing agent in it because you can see where it&#x27;s going and make sure its even.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine using a solution without the bronzer in it - I&#x27;ve tried before and I felt I was working blindly; guessing if it was consistant - and then the next day after it fully develops, it&#x27;s too late to fix it.  I highly recommend this product.  I have very fair skin and this Dark solution is perfect for me.  Usually I do 2 full passes of this and then we go back to see if we need to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; anywhere.  You will be immediately tan so you&#x27;ll be able to see where you need to apply more.  As with all self tanners, it helps to exfoliate first.  I always apply the night before (you will feel a bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; for several hours afterwards) and by the next morning, I can shower to get that extra bronzer off, and the tan remaining is perfect.  It definately is on the dark side - but its very realistic.  I&#x27;ve gotten SO many compliments on this.  I also like the &amp;#34;Venetian&amp;#34; formula....but this one is my favorite.  By Day 4 I see fading in areas but it&#x27;s still ok.  Day 5,  I simply exfoliate really well to even it out as much as I can and then re-apply.  Doing this maintains my tan. This whole bottle is the cost of 1 spray tan in my area.  I&#x27;d say I get about 8 spray tans out of this bottle and I apply pretty heavily.  Highly recommend this product!!ate really well to even it out as much as I can and then re-apply.  Doing this maintains my tan. This whole bottle is the cost of 1 spray tan in my area.  I&#x27;d say I get about 8 spray tans out of this bottle and I apply pretty heavily.  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Give a perfect looking tan without looking orange or fake.  I get compliments all the time when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Thought I would take a chance and try out spray tanning myself. I ordered and received quickly! Opend and tried.  I was so surprised by the smell! It was GREAT! Will diff be ordering again!! :)</li>
    <li> Good tanning color. It is natural and not orange.</li>
    <li> Best spray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Best tanning solution ever!  It leaves a very natural looking color and no smell at all!  When it dries it leaves your skin feeling super soft.  Besides the natural color it does not leave you sticky, which is one of the best parts!</li>
    <li> I keep thinking that sunless tanning is supposed to last through at least one shower... Maybe I&#x27;m mistaken because this clearly doesn&#x27;t. Nice color, though- not orange</li>
    <li> Love it! My clients love it! A definite most have for my mobile air brush tanning biz!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping from seller, very pleased! My husband bought me the maxi mist spray tan machine for Christmas and I was not a fan of the solutions that came with it ( it streaked easily and took forever to dry ). I&#x27;m a regular spray tanner and Norvell is what the salon I visit uses. Keep in mind this was only the SECOND time my husband has ever used a spray tan machine and it was FLAWLESS. I think if he can do it anyone can. It Literally took maybe 10 minutes (I had him do two coats) was dry almost immediately and also smells amazing! I will not use any other brand!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I buy tanning solution for myself using it in my air brush machine! I always feel so over whelmed with buying/trying new products when it&#x27;s so expensive! This color is good! Not amazingly perfect (haven&#x27;t found that yet) but I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this tanning solution it doesnt have that usual bad smell but as far as the color; color was great looks natural but I feel like it did not last as long as my ocean tanning solution.  Its hard to say because my sister loved this solution better and I loved the ocean solution better but I purchased this stuff because it was way way cheaper then the ocean at time of purchase.  I would say if you are on the fence try it because for the price it is really good and does smell nice and like I said my sister loves it</li>
    <li> Great solution! Does not have an orange color and looks just like the color I would get when I went to the salon. I use this solution with a tent and machine that I also purchased here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Thus solution is great</li>
    <li> I alway use Norvell Product for my spray tans! It smells great and has such a good color. I bought this 33 oz bottle while i waited for my gallon to arive i needed it ASAP. I think the bottle i got was expired, it smelt moldy and the color wasnt the same as my other Norvell soltions (Same Amber sun DARK). I can see that the make date was 10/2013 but im not sure what happened?</li>
    <li> I spray tan once a week from my home and I have used almost all of norvell&#x27;s products, this particular color isn&#x27;t dark enough for my taste but the color is still great and would be beautiful for someone with lighter skin. It sprays on super dark but lightens a good bit after you shower off the bronzer.  You are left with a natural looking tan. I would say it lasts like 4 days before it starts to lighten, it all depends on your skin type and if you maintain it and moisturize it, it would last longer.</li>
    <li> Great product!  The smell is amazing and it works great with my MaxiMist.</li>
    <li> Love it! My clients favorite shade</li>
    <li> Great color.  Lasts for days</li>
    <li> Best natural tan color. Sprays on great! Long lasting and good smell.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly, sooner than expected actually. The seller was very nice with a thank you note and a card for future discounts. The bottle is much bigger than I imagined, it&#x27;s going to last me a very long time. My airbrush gun would not work - so I put on a latex glove and rubbed the liquid onto my skin. Even doing that, the results were much more even looking than one would expect. I&#x27;m sure the darker tint for a guide color helped too, you can see exactly where you&#x27;re putting it. The end color was awesome. It was just barely orange tinted (not really noticeable unless you&#x27;re looking hard for it), and I think it was only like that because the liquid was so dark and I&#x27;m naturally porcelain skinned. I love it and recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Norvell is great but  I received the wrong color.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the misleading language of this product description.  It is a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; solution and it also says &amp;#34;double dark solution.&amp;#34;  This is way off from being dark.  My wife is fairer skinned and during summer likes to have a dark tan.  We have used Tan Envy solutions that had come with our sprayer and were a bit dissatisfied with the inconsistency between solutions.  Some were very runny, some were not dark enough, and another one had too much orange.  So we were looking for a professional solution that could match the Tan Envy darkness, but be easier to spray and possibly less residue during sleep.  The solution did spray very well.  It is very easy to apply and does not run.  It goes on very light, you have to pay attention closely to where you are spraying.  Once finished spraying, I had a feeling that it would not be that dark.  Maybe if you are an albino that lives in Minnesota, this might seem dark to you.  However, the next morning after my wife showered, I couldn&#x27;t really tell that I even sprayed her.  It was not &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; at all.  This might be a good solution for a winter coat, but if you are looking for a deeper darker summer tan, this is not the product for that.  Also, it was a bit more orange tone than I would have expected.  Not terrible, but you can see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find out which Norvell product is the darkest, but they are not very clear even on their website.  So I probably will just stick with the Tan Envy 10.5% or 11.5%.</li>
    <li> I only use Norvell and the solution in this bottle I purchased was extremely orange. It was completely different from any Norvell solution I have ever purchased. The normal solution has a green undertone and what I purchased obviously was orange. Do not buy from this specific company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the solutions.  I like the Norvell the best because smells great (similar to roses, kinda like moraccan oil scent), it has a great color, washes off my shower walls, makes skin so soft and even looking, makes my makeup look better, and even washes out of my clothes if it rubs off!  About me, I have extremely pale skin; seriously though, like zero color when it comes to the sun.  I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and milky irish peaches and cream skin that has zero pigment.  Thankfully pale is coming back in and I have to admit, I do have beautiful skin... but everyone looks healthier, sexier and thinner with a tan.  Since purchasing my very own professional airbrush machine with an HVLP gun and spraying myself in the shower, I have everyone fooled that I have a natural beautiful tan all year long.  I get asked if I&#x27;m Scandinavian all time and people comment that I have that &amp;#34;good skin&amp;#34; that tans once it hits the sun!  Joke&#x27;s on them!</li>
    <li> Excellent spray pattern and color.</li>
    <li> Works great for very fair skin tones.also enriched an end of the summer tan.I would recommend it to be tried out for all types because its even smells like summer this one has received smiles from.all .</li>
    <li> I was acually nervous to buy this because i was reading reviews on alot of sellers and people were saying that they thought some places were selling knock offs. i took a chance and it is exactlly what i thought it would be, also This item came ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> I really like this solution! It&#x27;s better than others I have tried. Good color &amp; easy to tell where you&#x27;re applying it.</li>
    <li> Was really excited to try this product, but was disappointed to find that it turns me an orangey color.  I bought this brand/solution after doing extensive research and hearing that most professionals ranked this one the best as it turned their clients a more brown color than orange.  I&#x27;ll keep trying different solutions until I find the one that works with my body chemistry.</li>
    <li> This color is a perfect shade for all skin types. It is not sticky and applies very evenly. It&#x27;s the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this color and have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> The same exact solution my mystic spray tan salon used so I bought my own spray machine and now save tons of money! This is absolutely the best solution around and it makes you look a natural dark tanned shade with looking streaky or fake.</li>
    <li> How many tans do you get out of this bottle on average?</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  I apply more for darker tan. LOVE!</li>
    <li> this is the 3rd 1 iv used  last the longest and goes on good A vA a a a a a</li>
    <li> Kinda turned out orange looking. Guess it was the skin tone or something. Still worked well and still won the pagent.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipper</li>
    <li> This is a great solution if you are looking for a deep, dark brown color. I have clients that really love it! Make sure you are a medium skin tone when using this product as you do not want to look unnatural!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe negative reviews from people with an unverified purchase.  I really think it&#x27;s the competition.&lt;br /&gt;My unit came with samples of Ocean brand.  It was ok but I wanted to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very beautiful golden natural tan color.  Smells good.  A little sticky but I spray myself at night and wear a robe around until I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder for sure.</li>
    <li> Works like the pros. I love this product. I use my own artist&#x27;s airbrush. I get super dark..</li>
    <li> The bottle was dated for February and I got it in March, so it was technically already expired.... So I was initially let down, but as soon as i used it i got over that disappointment very quickly. It is quick drying, which is a major plus for me. It&#x27;s so natural looking and it last for a week. Annnnd it doesn&#x27;t stink! I&#x27;m in love! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> easy to use and clean up. The tone on skin is perfect, no orange or yellow cast. It is not the dark pigment professional bodybuilders use, a more natural soft brown that looks healthy and realistic.</li>
    <li> much better than the products i have been using in the past.  Alot less orange and more of a tan.</li>
    <li> many compliments on my tan looks like I&#x27;ve been at the beach but haven&#x27;t a must try.</li>
    <li> The color when you initially spray a client is beautiful but it comes off very quickly and unevenly. It also takes a very long time to dry. I would recommend this product to someone who is going to be sprayed right before an event and is not going to shower before hand. It is a natural tan with no orange tint.</li>
    <li> Love the color! Very natural brown color with one coat. Will purchase again in future. Fades nicely. Good color for three days then fades but lasts for total if 1 week.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Dries super, super fast and color looks so natural.  I&#x27;ve been sunless spray tanning for about 10 years and this product is the best I have ever used.  Color last long on me.  At least for 7 days.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice color !</li>
    <li> The product got here when it was supposed to but the cap was broken and more than half the solution leaked out into the box and stained my floor and not only do I not get half the solution I paid for but I cannot take it anywhere to do tans because it does not have a functional cap to seal it. I do like this solution however just disappointed in the situation in general.</li>
    <li> Purchasing again at the moment. This will be my second bottle. Gives excellent color and lasts long. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I am looking forward to using this product I have not had a chance yet it looks amazing I know it will be perfect</li>
    <li> I love this product, and will be making this a regular purchase, this product really covers with the right amount of color, and looks great days after,</li>
    <li> Dark and smooth smells like a stripper.</li>
    <li> Love all of Norvell&#x27;s products.. they make great solution!  This is my first solution purchase, although I have been paying for spray tans for years, and I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> I have been using a level 8 and 8.5 DHA and was reluctant to try this color as I thought it would be way to dark for me....boy was I wrong, it is perfect! It is dark yet subtle. It is not orange at all and the solution smells great. It fades nicely also!</li>
    <li> The wife says this stuff is the bomb.com so I guess she likes it. She uses it instead of what came in her spray kit and has ordered it several times so it must be good.</li>
    <li> smells great, amazing color, this will be my staple for our airbrush tanning system!</li>
    <li> After trying most solutions, I found this to be a better fit for me and everyone i spray. Love the violet  tone that cancels out the orange color a lot of self tanners have. Goes on well, and last!</li>
    <li> This solution dried my skin to a point where oil and lotions would not even begin to moisturize it back to a somewhat normal appearance. Just over 6 weeks and my skin is somewhat back to normal with consistent oil and lotion applications.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find that this too, washes off easily like another solution I purchased from Amazon,  Now I am wondering if these products are the real thing.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping! Great product, natural color, quick drying &amp; no weird smell</li>
    <li> The scent is good and not at all overwhelming and the product goes on well with a good color. However, it fades quickly and comes off very blotchy. It was fun to try but I will stick to Jamaica-me-tan.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY tanning solutions and this is definitely the BEST. I have a spray tan machine, but I tried using a powder puff with this product and it came out AMAZING. Not sticky at all. That is the ONE thing that will make me never buy a tanning product is how sticky it is after it is applied. I put it on in the morning and left it on all day and I could not tell I had it on. I will definitely buy this again and again. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality of a product. Did not turn my wife or myself orange at all. Nice natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> Great! Was worried it would be old but it was excellent and color turned out perfect</li>
    <li> Use this if you want to look 50 shades of grey! OMG, it&#x27;s awful.  I will go back to OMG Cherry!  Stay away!!! Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> Color is nice and bronze, applies evenly.  The smell is not bad like some other spray tan products.</li>
    <li> The spray tan Faded way too quick, I would  prefer &amp;#34;Vani t&amp;#34; but they are too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Peace out&lt;br /&gt;brian</li>
    <li> product is a very nice golden color. ive tanned people that are very fair skin and the color came out amazing. Very happy with product....will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I really like this procduct it goes on smooth and not sticky. smells great too .I will continue to use this solution.</li>
    <li> Ok does not last long has a kind of strong oder.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the color!! This does not look orange on me (even though I think I applied a bit excessively with my airbrush spray gun - we need to practice!) and has a decent smell! LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Solution is great but the bottle leaks so I have to be careful.  I keep mine in the frig to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> The Dark gives a great color without being orange. I&#x27;m fair to medium color and one coat is all it takes for me. If I do more than that it&#x27;s too dark. The color last for about 5-7 days depending how much you exfoliate. Wanting to try a lighter color for winter.</li>
    <li> It works well with the spray gun, just isn&#x27;t very dark. Have ordered a darker color.</li>
    <li> Love the color and not much of an oder</li>
    <li> not for fair to medium skin tones. too dark and way to blotchy after first shower.</li>
    <li> Nice color looks really great</li>
