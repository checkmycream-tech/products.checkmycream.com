    <li> The best product. I&#x27;ve using it for five years, 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> There is expiration date! Why?</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery! love Obagi!! I just turned 44 and get guessed 30!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it promises.</li>
    <li> LISTEN IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE REAL THING THEN YOU HAVE NEVER PAID FULL PRICE FROM THE DOCTOR! Furthermore you have no idea what you are putting on your face.  The real product is very thick and grainy.  This is like water and smells like self tanner!  There was no label attached to the cap as when purchased from MD. The bottle was overfilled and leaking out everywhere.  Not OBAGI quality!&lt;br /&gt; If you have fooled yourself into thinking you have gotten results from this, JUST IMAGINE what the real OBAGI would do! LOL</li>
    <li> This product was OK, did not see a change in my skin texture.</li>

    <li> not original packaging and no expiration date</li>
    <li> No results (positive or otherwise) noted. Felt like a waste of money and time applying it... Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this product! I am almost 50 years old and my skin appears 30&#x27;s! I use it daily and I once ran out and started something new! No! I saw a difference quick. Go for it if you are on the fence! It works and it is worth it!</li>
