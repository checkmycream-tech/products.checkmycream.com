      <li>Am very pleased -</li>
      <li>It washes well and seems to be holding up nicely.  </li>
      <li>I was going to replace that one, but bought the Escape instead because I liked all the details given on the Dream Essentials website.</li>
      <li>the design is very nice and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This mask does a good job of keeping light out, but is not for people who like to sleep on their side.</li>
      <li>I have tried many sleep masks over the years and have found this to be the best so far.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s comfortable and does a good job of keeping out the light.</li>
      <li>You could probably rig it to work if you&#x27;re inventive.    </li>
      <li>My wife likes it much better than any sleep mask</li>
      <li>I tightened it more</li>
      <li>and I have don&#x27;t want anything touching my lashes in my sleep.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable and does a good job of keeping out most of the light.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both agree this sleep mask really keeps out the light, especially important for him since he has to sleep during the day.</li>
      <li>Its very comfortable but light still comes through the edges.</li>
      <li>It feels very comfortable on my head, not too hot or bulky (unlike a fleece one I had!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and yet you can sleep on your side and not even feel it.</li>
      <li>This mask doesn&#x27;t let any light in.</li>
      <li>Still using my original mask.</li>
      <li>Put this on in the driveway when I first got it and couldn&#x27;t see any light!</li>
      <li>but it is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>The pictures do not show that this mask has eye pockets which makes it more comfortable than the flat kind.</li>
      <li>Sure saves my eyes from drying out and burning as much during the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 masks before this one, the last one a Ciccia Bella which I thought was pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It took about two nights to get used to wearing the mask and figure how snug to make the strap, but I find it very comfortable and worth the extra money for the 3-dimensional fit.</li>
      <li>I can tell you that it is well worth $25.</li>
      <li>definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good sleep mask.</li>
      <li>To overcome this, I had to close my eyes and then tighten it tigher than normal to block all the light.</li>
      <li>I bought him another mask at a local store but it let light through &amp; he would wake up when I turned the light on.  </li>
      <li>The Escape Travel Sleep Mask really does block the light and I&#x27;m able to sleep as long as I need.  </li>
      <li>I love that I can open my eyes inside the mask!  </li>
      <li>This one is pretty bulky because of the padding for the eyes.  </li>
      <li>it might seal completely  but not be as comfortable.</li>
      <li>the padded nose bridge not only helps lift the mask to give additional lift over the eyes it also enables you to get a complete block of light by adjusting the pad, eliminating that anoying sliver of light at the nose and cheeks of those cheaper masks.  </li>
      <li>There can be bright lights shining or sunshine coming directly through the window, but it will still be pitch black inside the mask.</li>
      <li>Its Ok if you are a back sleeper but side sleepers and stomach sleepers should stay away as it is impossible to keep it in a good spot in those positions...</li>
      <li>The main portion of the mask does not touch the eyes and the strap is adjustable enough for large heads.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not only sturdy and comfortable, but absolutely pitch black when it&#x27;s snug on your face.</li>
      <li>It takes a little while to get to wearing, but the mask is comfortable with no pressure on your eyes.</li>
      <li>The adjustable strap with Velcro works well, but the mask itself is pretty wide (one side fits all).  </li>
      <li>the shades and drapery in our new condo didn&#x27;t block enough of the morning sunshine.  </li>
      <li>the first morning after I wore it which I think  may be due  to the fabric sizing used; I recommend washing before use.  </li>
      <li>The strap will fit any size head big or small and it doesn&#x27;t bother you while you are sleeping.</li>
      <li>but if you give it a couple of nights you will barely notice it on your face.</li>
      <li>The mask is so thick that you can&#x27;t find a comfortable position.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the few nights of getting used to the feel.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s totally worth the few nights of getting used to the feel.</li>
<li> I used to always wake up with blurry vision due to my old mask pressing against my eyes all night, and it was also damaging my eyelashes.  </li>
<li> Comfortable and snug without irritating my long eye lashes.</li>
<li> If you have a larger than normal head, the adjustable strap on this may not fit you.  </li>
<li> Because the mask is made to not put pressure on your eyes, it does have pretty thick padding around the eye areas, so when you lie on your side, the pillow pushes the mask over.  </li>
<li> A tiny bit filters through across the bottom but with my eyes closed</li>
<li> I bought this sleep mask so that I could open my eyes with it on (couldn&#x27;t handle other sleep masks that don&#x27;t let you).  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any other mask to compare it to, which is why I only rated it 4 stars.</li>
<li> Agree with the other reviewer that what you can&#x27;t see in the photo is an indentation for your eyes, so that you never feel any pressure on your eyes from the mask.</li>
<li> After that, I had a hard time going back to sleep because its so tight.</li>
<li> Some that I have tried in the past had such heavy foam construction that they were not comfortable at all</li>
<li> I got this for my wife for Christmas after her previous sleep mask broke.</li>
<li> it took a little while to get used to the slight bulkiness of the mask</li>
<li> This mask is a little pricey</li>
<li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and tried it a few times.</li>
<li> When fitted properly, NO light gets through this mask, not even at the bridge of the nose.  </li>
<li> There was no light coming in what so ever in this mask.</li>
<li> I had never used a sleep mask before, but I was having trouble sleeping past 6:30 am --</li>
<li> It was hard to pay $25 for a sleep mask, and I considered it a bit of a risk, not having seen it before.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very comfortable; too hard on your face, and feels like it hits my eyelashes, which is weird when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
<li> If you sweat at night, it&#x27;s going to make it worse.  </li>
<li> and they were impossible to use when I tried to sleep on my side.</li>

    <li> The pictures do not show that this mask has eye pockets which makes it more comfortable than the flat kind.</li>
    <li> Its Ok if you are a back sleeper but side sleepers and stomach sleepers should stay away as it is impossible to keep it in a good spot in those positions...</li>
    <li> There was no light coming in what so ever in this mask. It&#x27;s comfortable and yet you can sleep on your side and not even feel it. The strap will fit any size head big or small and it doesn&#x27;t bother you while you are sleeping. You can still open your eyes with the mask on since it is not pressing up against your eyes. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 masks before this one, the last one a Ciccia Bella which I thought was pretty good.  I was going to replace that one, but bought the Escape instead because I liked all the details given on the Dream Essentials website. I sleep on my side tending to rub my face on the pillow to settle, and the mask doesn&#x27;t shift. It feels very comfortable on my head, not too hot or bulky (unlike a fleece one I had!! what was the mfr. thinking?)and my sleep is definitely deeper.  Agree with the other reviewer that what you can&#x27;t see in the photo is an indentation for your eyes, so that you never feel any pressure on your eyes from the mask. The only issue I had was a headache the first morning after I wore it which I think  may be due  to the fabric sizing used; I recommend washing before use.  Update: 7/19/15:  Still using my original mask. I machine wash it and air-dry it. It has held up beautifully.</li>
    <li> the design is very nice and comfortable.  If it can be made of softer materials, that will be perfect</li>
    <li> Comfortable and snug without irritating my long eye lashes. I&#x27;m a side and stomach sleeper and it stills stays on well.</li>
    <li> Put this on in the driveway when I first got it and couldn&#x27;t see any light! Am very pleased - it&#x27;s comfortable and does a good job of keeping out the light. You can even comfortably open your eyes with it on!</li>
    <li> this mask is the best i have used since i started using sleep masks.   the internal pockets line up with my eyes taking the pressure off of them which was one of my biggest gripes with sleep masks.  the padded nose bridge not only helps lift the mask to give additional lift over the eyes it also enables you to get a complete block of light by adjusting the pad, eliminating that anoying sliver of light at the nose and cheeks of those cheaper masks.  it took a little while to get used to the slight bulkiness of the mask but if you give it a couple of nights you will barely notice it on your face.</li>

    <li> I had never used a sleep mask before, but I was having trouble sleeping past 6:30 am -- the shades and drapery in our new condo didn&#x27;t block enough of the morning sunshine.  The Escape Travel Sleep Mask really does block the light and I&#x27;m able to sleep as long as I need.  It took about two nights to get used to wearing the mask and figure how snug to make the strap, but I find it very comfortable and worth the extra money for the 3-dimensional fit.</li>
    <li> I have tried many sleep masks over the years and have found this to be the best so far. It is comfortable and does a good job of keeping out most of the light. A tiny bit filters through across the bottom but with my eyes closed it is not a problem .If I tightened it more it might seal completely  but not be as comfortable. Some that I have tried in the past had such heavy foam construction that they were not comfortable at all and they were impossible to use when I tried to sleep on my side. This mask stays in place well even when I am on my side. It does not press on my eyes so it does not seem to interfere with eye movements during REM sleep. (I did not use the ear plugs as I just don&#x27;t like wearing any earplugs.)</li>
    <li> I chose this sleep mask after reading Amazon reviews. The main portion of the mask does not touch the eyes and the strap is adjustable enough for large heads. I dislike anything binding around my head and I have don&#x27;t want anything touching my lashes in my sleep. I am very satisfied with this product even though it is pricey.</li>
    <li> This mask does a good job of keeping light out, but is not for people who like to sleep on their side. The mask is so thick that you can&#x27;t find a comfortable position.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas after her previous sleep mask broke. It was hard to pay $25 for a sleep mask, and I considered it a bit of a risk, not having seen it before. I can tell you that it is well worth $25. My wife likes it much better than any sleep mask she&#x27;s had before. It&#x27;s not only sturdy and comfortable, but absolutely pitch black when it&#x27;s snug on your face. There can be bright lights shining or sunshine coming directly through the window, but it will still be pitch black inside the mask. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good sleep mask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very comfortable; too hard on your face, and feels like it hits my eyelashes, which is weird when I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  He loves this mask. This mask doesn&#x27;t let any light in. I bought him another mask at a local store but it let light through &amp; he would wake up when I turned the light on.  This mask is a little pricey but it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and tried it a few times. Its very comfortable but light still comes through the edges. To overcome this, I had to close my eyes and then tighten it tigher than normal to block all the light. After that, I had a hard time going back to sleep because its so tight.</li>
    <li> I loved this sleep mask and had it for about 8 years may dog chewed the corner of it and took some foam out but I still used it for another year until I bought another one.</li>
    <li> The only reason I couldn&#x27;t give this item five stars is that it does take some getting used to, especially if you like to sleep on your side.  Because the mask is made to not put pressure on your eyes, it does have pretty thick padding around the eye areas, so when you lie on your side, the pillow pushes the mask over.  It only took me a couple of nights to get used to it, though.    I love that I can open my eyes inside the mask!  I used to always wake up with blurry vision due to my old mask pressing against my eyes all night, and it was also damaging my eyelashes.  This mask does not make contact with the eyes or lashes at all!    If you have a larger than normal head, the adjustable strap on this may not fit you.  It&#x27;s not elastic, but it is adjustable with velcro.  However, it doesn&#x27;t get very big.  You could probably rig it to work if you&#x27;re inventive.    When fitted properly, NO light gets through this mask, not even at the bridge of the nose.  It&#x27;s totally worth the few nights of getting used to the feel.</li>
