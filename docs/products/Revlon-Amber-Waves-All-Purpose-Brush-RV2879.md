      <li>And, it&#x27;s cute.</li>
      <li>Great for medium to soft hair.</li>
      <li>so I decided to track it down and am very happy I did.  </li>
      <li>This brush is only good for a very fine texture hair.  </li>
      <li>I suppose if I wanted a smooth exterior and didn&#x27;t care if it was a rat&#x27;s nest on the inside</li>
      <li>Then you can smooth the surface of your hair with this brush if you want.</li>
      <li>I am delighted w my new brush &amp; cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>Super good Brush for natural or relaxed hair</li>

      <li>Soooo soft &amp; light weight!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best brush out there other than my personal fave</li>

      <li>Bristles started coming out first time I used it.</li>

      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>She set it half way on the counter top and it tipped off.</li>
      <li>Upon touching the bristles they felt limp.</li>
      <li>However, the bristles are too soft to go all the way through my hair, which is not thick.</li>

      <li>The bristles are so soft that they do not penetrate my hair.</li>
      <li>i bought this brush on a whim from rite aid and i loved it unfortunately it broke on me which is</li>
      <li>The Wet Brush (cannot live w/o wet brush if this one doesn&#x27;t sound like it fits ur needs</li>
      <li>but this is way too soft and the bristles are not the same as mine.</li>

    <li> i bought this brush on a whim from rite aid and i loved it unfortunately it broke on me which is why im buying another one on amazon but i could never remember the name of it untill now ... it smooths your hair to perfection</li>
    <li> Great for medium to soft hair. Very reasonable. Note measurements as brush is larger (for me) than I expected.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It feels like it is massaging your head. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and it isn&#x27;t cheaply constructed. However, the bristles are too soft to go all the way through my hair, which is not thick.</li>
    <li> Came apart at first washing.</li>
    <li> So soft it doesn&#x27;t go through my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  The bristles are too soft to go through the hair.  So first you have to comb your hair with a comb, or brush it with a different brush that will actally take out tangles.  Then you can smooth the surface of your hair with this brush if you want.</li>
    <li> I love this brush because it keeps my hair neat without being hard and harsh. The bristles are soft .</li>
    <li> I have really long and thick hair, so needed a brush that could  handle this. This brush does the job for me. And, it&#x27;s cute.</li>
    <li> This brush is only good for a very fine texture hair.  It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that often gets frizzy.  This brush won&#x27;t do anything to help my hair as the bristles are too soft to penetrate the surface.  I suppose if I wanted a smooth exterior and didn&#x27;t care if it was a rat&#x27;s nest on the inside it would be great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She set it half way on the counter top and it tipped off. As soon as it hit the floor, the handle broke right off (it was about a 3 foot fall).</li>
    <li> Really soft. Too soft for a purpose</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for several years to replace my old brush with no success. My brush is at least 20 years old and the bristles go all the way to the scalp. It looks like this brush but this is way too soft and the bristles are not the same as mine. Nice brush for a baby or the cat but not for me.</li>
    <li> Soooo soft &amp; light weight! This is good for doing 100 strokes at nite to distribute the natural scalp oils thru ur hair to the ends (to make it grow long &amp; strong! This is not a wives tale!!), &amp; although I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet, seems simple sounding just run it under the tap lukewarm H2O &amp; pat dry w towel then air dry. My hair is flat ironed thin &amp; dry &amp; this brush is •perfect• for that. It makes it shine like nobody&#x27;s biz &amp; I am still in awe of the light weight of this brush! I read some of reviews for it so will be careful not to drop it onto my wood floor in my room. I usually go for 100% boar bristle hair brushes. I lost mine &amp; this is a foray into the unknown w it being 50/50 nylon but it&#x27;s a lovely brush, I got mine on clearance at Kroger for less than USD$4 (+ tax). I am delighted w my new brush &amp; cannot say enough good things about it. If ur on the fence about this one, just get it!! It&#x27;s the best brush out there other than my personal fave The Wet Brush (cannot live w/o wet brush if this one doesn&#x27;t sound like it fits ur needs look for The Wet Brush on Amazon instead) YMMV now alls u need are a couple good combs! 😄</li>
    <li> I bought several of these because I like to have one wherever I go.  I keep one in my office at my desk, one in my car, one at home, and a couple of other places.  After using this brush, I won&#x27;t use any other brush.  It&#x27;s so comfortable, doesn&#x27;t scratch or hurt my scalp and makes my hair look really good!</li>
    <li> I saw a you tuber use this brush in one of her videos so I decided to track it down and am very happy I did.  It does the job and is gentle on my hair. Definitely a keeper. I tossed my other brushes, except for its sister brush for edges.</li>
    <li> UGH. This was my HG all time favorite brush and it broke after less than 6 months or so :-(  It split up the base and the bristles started shedding like crazy in big chunks. As the other commenters have mentioned, the brush is indeed super soft, but it&#x27;s really effective for me.  I absolutely love the blend of firmer synthetic bristles with super soft natural &amp;#34;baby brush&amp;#34; bristles. For many this brush wouldn&#x27;t much for their hair as far as styling. This isn&#x27;t a styling brush though, it&#x27;s like a conditioning brush. It&#x27;s great for my very, very fine, kinky, 4-type hair. It softens my hair and makes is shiny. I&#x27;m sooooo tempted to buy it again (I did not buy it from this vendor) here because I love it so much. Grrrrr!</li>
    <li> Upon touching the bristles they felt limp. The bristles are so soft that they do not penetrate my hair. I have shoulder-length medium/thin hair. I thought based on the description that it had more nylon bristles. The only good brushing I get is from a full nylon bristle brush.</li>
    <li> Super good Brush for natural or relaxed hair</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my daughters.  They did not like it.  They said the bristles are too weak.</li>
    <li> Bristles started coming out first time I used it. Different from revlon brush I usually buy at Cvs.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a brush in years. This brush has a good grip handle and when you think your hail looks flat, brush it with this brush and your hair is revived,&lt;br /&gt;Good all around brush. Wish it came in other colors.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a gift and it was well received. The size is right. The bristles are the best. I am so glad that Amazon always comes through with what is promised, and the products are always satisfactory. I recommend this brush.</li>
