      <li>My review. :)</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
      <li>It was one of most favorite gift of all.  </li>
      <li>Love the Kai products-- just probably wont order this body buffer again for the price.</li>
      <li>I love love love these Body Buffers</li>
      <li>I love how my skin feels after showering now and</li>
      <li>Smells fabulous and has a nice exfoliating buffer.</li>
      <li>So, in my opinion this is a phenomenal gift for a baby or bridal shower, birthday, etc.</li>
      <li>Kai is a great high end sponge is how I see it.</li>
      <li>The best thing about it is it is one of the only fragrances on the market safe for a pregnant woman to wear as it has no phthalates (hormone-mimicing ingredients)</li>
      <li>I received one as a gift and loved it so much wanted to buy some for myself.  </li>
      <li>it smells sooooo good and the scrubber/buffer/sponge really holds up wash after wash</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I like that it is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Depending which one you purchase and it smell amazing, the sponge is amazing quality and it actually has better ingredients and features than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Withe Rose is a white sponge like this one that lathers, cleans, exfolitate, massages and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>the scent is so light that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfumes you may wear.  </li>
      <li>These are fabulous.</li>
      <li>I liked this so much that I bought it for all my girlfriends for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my elbows smooth.</li>
      <li>Oh it is good for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, crisp, and floral, but I don&#x27;t notice it at all after I&#x27;m done using the body buffer and get out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>These sponges create a rich lather while buffing your skin without ripping it apart.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased two boxes of these to give as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Worth the splurge!</li>
      <li>Love the product first heard of it  on the Oprah show and wanted to try it ever since.</li>
      <li>The scent is clean, fresh and invigorating!</li>
      <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
      <li>This body buffer is fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I kept one for myself after catching a whiff of the very soft scent.  </li>
      <li>Makes your shower special and one to look forward to.  </li>
      <li>and I would guess this to be true.  </li>
      <li>sponge smells good like gardenias and the quality of the sponge is the same as my Spongeables.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>So, while it&#x27;s good and you may like the body scrub and the fragrance, once is enough.  </li>
      <li>not a bad price where i got it either.</li>
      <li>Its such an incredible smell- just like my childhood memories of stepping off the plane in Hawaii to be greeted with a lei, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Good as long as it holds the soap.  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite along with the Kai perfume.  </li>
      <li>Its definitely worth the investment</li>
      <li>Once I used it several times, I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>The cream felt luxurious and fresh.</li>
      <li>always reluctant to pay a lot for body wash because frankly, it washes off and gets used up pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very large sponge</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft and smelling clean and fresh</li>
      <li>I received one as a gift several years ago and fell in love with the Kai Body Buffer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. I believe I&#x27;m on my third one. A friend bought me my first one. Love it</li>
    <li> Although I do like this product, it&#x27;s not what I thought it&#x27;d be.  It&#x27;s a very large sponge so I do feel like you&#x27;re getting quite a bit for the money.  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> great in the shower - does it all - washes clean,  produces a great smell, and exfoliates and makes one&#x27;s skin feel just delightful.   not a bad price where i got it either.</li>
    <li> I thought these were going to be scrubbies like a body scrub sponge, but they&#x27;re hard, yet feel like wax, so I guess it&#x27;s kinda like the oil spray effect except its a solid that you can basically rub and smooth all over your body. No scrubbing is involed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Kai fragrance, as I have had the perfume for a while. The best thing about it is it is one of the only fragrances on the market safe for a pregnant woman to wear as it has no phthalates (hormone-mimicing ingredients) and it just smells like heaven.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always reluctant to pay a lot for body wash because frankly, it washes off and gets used up pretty quickly. But when I saw this it sounded different and it really is. It is a porous sponge, so when wet it exfoliates (gently but more so than a poof) and creates suds so it acts as a body wash and exfoliator. It says that each sponge can be used about 30 times and there are 2 in the package. So, in my opinion this is a phenomenal gift for a baby or bridal shower, birthday, etc. Its such an incredible smell- just like my childhood memories of stepping off the plane in Hawaii to be greeted with a lei, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Its definitely worth the investment and I will buy again. But this will also be a go-to gift for me to have on hand for when I just don&#x27;t know what to get a girlfriend but want to get something unique, memorable and that will be loved!</li>
    <li> I love it!  The fragrance is very refreshing and it exfoliates my skin.  I like that it is not too strong.  I look forward to taking a shower and using the the all in one buff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sponge, people. A sponge. The smell is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but what bothers me is knowing that Oprah uses this. I don&#x27;t want to smell like Oprah. Ever. So not worth the money. What was I thinking?</li>
    <li> Love the product first heard of it  on the Oprah show and wanted to try it ever since. It is just what I expected.</li>
    <li> It  has a light fragrance and lasts a really long time. (Months).  the scrub is light not too rough. It keeps my elbows smooth.</li>
    <li> a cousin recommended it and i&#x27;m so glad i splurged on myself.  it smells sooooo good and the scrubber/buffer/sponge really holds up wash after wash</li>
    <li> Love!  I have always loved Kai products. This body buffer is fun and easy to use. Will def. buy again</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for the past 7 years. I purchased so many from a shop in CA. I was so happy to find them. I purchased 3 sets and will be looking for more. This is one of the best bath products ever.</li>
    <li> I got this off of Oprah&#x27;s fav list. I have to remember that Oprah has expensive taste, because she can!  I do really like this product but not sure i will get it again for $40.</li>
    <li> then...i found them online...the fragrance is wonderful, and the sponge has soap in it...they last a long ti,me. Every shower or bath is a treat. Very nice as a gift, too. The body butter is also really nice!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite along with the Kai perfume.  Body buffer is a great way to layer the scent.  Expensive but is nice when I want to do that little extra for myself .  Didn&#x27;t give it the 5 stars because item is a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I liked this so much that I bought it for all my girlfriends for Christmas.  Then I bought it again and it became just too much.  So, while it&#x27;s good and you may like the body scrub and the fragrance, once is enough.  I&#x27;m now tired of the smell and am searching for something new.  Enjoy!  .... once</li>
    <li> I love these sponges! Not only do they truly exfoliate and moisturize, they smell fantastic! They last a long time too, when the soap dissolves, can still use with bath soap as an exfoliator</li>
    <li> Fragrant and wonderful.  Makes your shower special and one to look forward to.  A great gift item.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These are my very favorite shower sponges. I ,like other reviewers, wish that they were individually wrapped.  The scent is clean, fresh and invigorating! I received one as a gift several years ago and fell in love with the Kai Body Buffer. I highly recommend this brand. Would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already left one review.  when I first got it, it feels like a cake candle and agree that both buffers should be wrapped separately.  Once I used it several times, I really liked it.  It felt like it exfoliated very well, and lots of suds.  Initial fragrance out of the box not good and strong, but that scent is much milder during even first use.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times I feel like the exfoliating power has gone way down.  You have to keep getting it wet to get the suds.  I like the product, but I think it should be about half the price...and i&amp;#34;m pretty sure it will not last up to 30 washes.  Oh it is good for sensitive skin.  I have very sensitive skin and did not have any issues with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous and has a nice exfoliating buffer. Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> My son gave this to me for Christmas a few years back.  The Sales person told him it was one one of Opera&#x27;s favorites.  It was one of most favorite gift of all.  I love the way it smells and it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.  I can&#x27;t go without out it. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Good as long as it holds the soap.  Too expensive for what  you get</li>
    <li> Fantastic on the skin and has a beautiful light clean smell</li>
    <li> Oprah recommended these, and I just purchased my second buffer.  I love the smell and the lingering scent in the bathroom after my morning shower.  This buffer helps me wake up!  (along with coffee).  It lasted about 3 weeks for me, which was surprisingly long.  After each shower, I just placed the buffer back in the ventilted box, and when I was ready for my next shower, I took it out, got it soaking wet, and scrubbed away.  Oprah&#x27; the best</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and literally gets you &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean. Lasts for about a week or two before you have to use the other one. Makes your skin glow.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite things.  I love the Kai scent and all their products. If you want to pamper yourself with the best scent in the world, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before and loved it. This year I decided to purchase a few for friends and family</li>
    <li> i have never purchased for myself - but have received as a gift&lt;br /&gt;because of that, i&#x27;ve purchased as a gift many times over&lt;br /&gt;tons of wonderfully fragranced lather&lt;br /&gt;such a treat</li>
    <li> Too scruffy and seems to irritate my skin and I would never waste my money again to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> These buffers smell amazing.  And are delight to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint:  sometimes it feels like the sponge just won&#x27;t dry no matter where I place it.  Would be nice if it came with a cord/string to hang it from.</li>
    <li> Love it !!!! Smells great very light clean smell ...I always use the Kai body buffer... Makes your skin feel so good....fast shipper...</li>
    <li> This is the best sponge ever, it suds up with an amazing fragrance, the sponge is exfoliating and it has oils in it for moisture.  It last long too/</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and performed as advertised</li>
    <li> Spendy but wonderful!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased two boxes of these to give as stocking stuffers for Christmas.  I kept one for myself after catching a whiff of the very soft scent.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  These sponges create a rich lather while buffing your skin without ripping it apart.  It was even gentle enough to use on my neck.  I love how my skin feels after showering now and the scent is so light that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfumes you may wear.  I am sold on these.  One sponge is said to last 30 showers.  I&#x27;ve just used mine for a couple of weeks and I would guess this to be true.  While at first it appears to be an expensive product, I believe the fact that it will last you for 2 months makes it a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> I love love love these Body Buffers and they last longer than 30 washes..After ordering them last year I came right back to the site to order them again. In the description it says that the buffers are individually packed in 1 box which was the way they came last year when I ordered them.. today I got my new shipment and I was surprised and disappointed that the buffers were wrapped together in 1 piece of plastic, I put the other buffer in a sandwich bag and will hope it doesn&#x27;t lose anything from not being sealed until I need it. This is not to say anything was wrong with the product but I just wanted to let people know in case you thought you might give the other away as a gift ...</li>
    <li> Love the Kai products-- just probably wont order this body buffer again for the price.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous. Yes, expensive but each one is for 30 showers. You&#x27;ll love them. It leaves your skin soft and smelling clean and fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 1/2 of this buffer for two years now and soap is still in there! Great product.  I love using it as a body scrub and to foam up before shaving. If you like Kai fragrance you will love this addition to your line.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. You&#x27;ll step out of the shower smelling like a little bit of heaven.</li>
    <li> This was on Oprah&#x27;s favorites list years ago but it&#x27;s a fave any day, any occasion!! Gardenias are my favorite plant so this perfume will always be in my Top 3.</li>
    <li> One of my fav new scent so far. The cream felt luxurious and fresh. I first saw it at a gift shop in Sheraton san diego. It was very expensive but i searched online and found Amazon selling them way less cheaper.</li>
    <li> Worth the splurge! They work well and last a long time. The scrubbing really exfoliates your body. These are great.</li>
    <li> These smell marvelous, and the scent lasts and lasts.  I used it on my arms and legs and it gave me a rash- I have sensitive skin, so I blame it on myself, rather than the product.  Those with sensitive skin should be aware, thought. No strictly for my feet!</li>
    <li> These smell so good!  I just wish the scent lasted.  It&#x27;s very light, crisp, and floral, but I don&#x27;t notice it at all after I&#x27;m done using the body buffer and get out of the shower.  The buffer itself is gentle enough to use everyday, but it&#x27;s not for scrubbing any tough spots.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy these again because they&#x27;re awfully expensive, and although the scent is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I am so obsessed with soap infused sponges thanks to Spongeables.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try a different brand just to see my options.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge smells good like gardenias and the quality of the sponge is the same as my Spongeables.&lt;br /&gt;So for the price I paid, I am not impressed. Spongeables cost from $2.99-$9.99. Depending which one you purchase and it smell amazing, the sponge is amazing quality and it actually has better ingredients and features than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is just due to the branding and how rumor has it Oprah endorsed it as one of her favorite things.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you want a great soap infused sponge, try Spongeables. The Withe Rose is a white sponge like this one that lathers, cleans, exfolitate, massages and smells amazing. Kai is a great high end sponge is how I see it. But I rather pay $35 and get 8 Spongeables for the price of 2 Kai&#x27;s. My review. :)</li>
    <li> love it.  I received one as a gift and loved it so much wanted to buy some for myself.  Great product</li>
    <li> Great product line...I have several products including the perfume, the body lotion and here the exfoliating buffer.  I think it&#x27;s a bit large.  I considered cutting it in half to make it go a little longer.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the size or shape.  Still...love their line.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell. Sponge is a little rough but I guess that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be to exfoliate and make skin smoother</li>
