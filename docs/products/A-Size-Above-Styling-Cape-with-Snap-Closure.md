      <li>but very happy with it</li>
      <li>Great cape, roomy, covers everything</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>It is great.</li>
      <li>Works great for haircuts at home while keeping hair off necks.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>The cape itself provides great coverage over your clothes, protecting you from hair, color, and water.</li>
      <li>Good delivery; excellent product - nylon fabric has substance with nice salon drape and well made.</li>
      <li>It will also make a nice cape for a Batman or Dracula costume at Halloween!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a good cape.  </li>
      <li>Medium sized cape, great snap closures, would be better with a clip for custom fittings.</li>
      <li>Unlike you see in reviews of many of the barber/styling capes you can buy, this one is great.  </li>
      <li>but you have the option of not closing top button  Very good quality, not flimsy and easy to clean - best barbers cape for the price.  </li>
      <li>static electricity!  </li>
      <li>Much better!  </li>
      <li>This is a really nice quality cape.</li>
      <li>This is a nice quality cape - the adjustable snaps are nice.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this is a static electricity issue.</li>
      <li>What more do you need it do to?</li>
      <li>My stylist doesn&#x27;t mind me bringing my own cape, and it makes for a much more comfortable experience at the salon.</li>
      <li>It drapes to the ground when they&#x27;re sitting on a bar stool :)</li>
      <li>This is a nice cape, large at 60x60 with metal snaps for adjustable fit around the neck and a nice smooth comfortable nylon/poly blend material.  </li>
      <li>The second one is nice an roomy and seems to be of good quality.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice large cape.  </li>
      <li>and they couldn&#x27;t be used because there is no way you can adjust it to fit</li>
      <li>Honestly \\&quot;A size above\\&quot; and a must buy for those who want their whole body covered and protected from hairs.</li>
      <li>Also, the snaps are a great feature because I&#x27;m not a fan of velcro, especially when a ton of hair gets caught in it.</li>
      <li>Then I found this adjustable cape on Amazon, which features a row of snaps allowing me to adjust the fit to my liking.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s comfortable around the neck.  </li>
      <li>The snaps on the neck fit my neck in an acceptable fashion.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase price!</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased that this completely covers him.</li>
      <li>Works great, and pays for itself with what I save on dry cleaning and laundry products.</li>
      <li>So, although this prevents cut hair from getting on your clothes, it is a pain to clean up afterwards.  </li>
      <li>This material on this cape feels very high quality and is definitely better than the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; cape I got with my clippers.  </li>
      <li>It works very well for them, and a lot better than the bed sheet she had been using.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very large!</li>
      <li>Easy to clean, comfortable around the neck and extra large to cover most of the body.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Used it right away.</li>
      <li>This cape is nice and long so no hair will get on your shirt, pants or shoes.  </li>
      <li>I also wish it had more snap closures for thinner and larger necks.</li>
      <li>The first one of these was defective.  </li>
      <li>When I first modeled it at work, a colleague pointed out that my hair was standing out sideways.  </li>
      <li>I own a beauty shop and we have a barber also so some of the men have very large necks ;so we wanted some larger capes.one cape only had snaps on one side</li>
      <li>Large, durable &#x27;cloth&#x27; and snaps.  </li>
      <li>Truly a large cape.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to run it through a gentle wash cycle and see if that rids it of that problem.</li>
      <li>Clean-up is much easier than when I used a bath towel as the cover.  </li>
      <li>It is generously large enough to cover their clothes and even keeps them warm when it&#x27;s a little cool out.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to have around your body, not too hot, and when you&#x27;re done you can give it a few shakes and the hair comes right off.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the main thing.  </li>
      <li>so it would be a little more water resistant.</li>
      <li>first joking, then not so much, and finally a purchase.  </li>
      <li>only downside is right out of the box the cap is staticky and the cut hair has stuck to it.  </li>
      <li>It is full size and keeps hair off however for kids you have to use a clip to tighten it around the neck because its loose.</li>
      <li>This thing is huge, even on a average size adult man.</li>
      <li>I do like how the cape is large enough to cover their lap though.  </li>
      <li>a big cape that covers your whole body and didnt leave all the hairs clinging to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big enough to cover my whole body</li>
      <li>Perfect hair cutting cape - large, thin nylon with numerous adjustable snaps at the neck.  </li>
      <li>This cape is very large and the snap closure around the neck is a little big.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I&#x27;m old enough now to claim eccentricity and to weather goofiness, if not humiliation, and I simply cannot eat anything (even a dry protein bar) without getting something on me.  </li>

<li> This is a large cape, but when I&#x27;m cutting hair it gets soaked so easily when I wet hair.</li>
<li> /&gt;Thought I was getting a regular size cape - was a little surprised that it was as big as it is because it&#x27;s not in the item&#x27;s title.  </li>
<li> Should last for a long time for my family&#x27;s haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Should have purchased this a long time ago</li>
<li> I feel like this cape will last a long time, even after his time in the military is over.</li>
<li> There were only snaps on one side, and nothing on the other to attach them too.  </li>
<li> then the other two capes only had three snaps</li>
<li> It&#x27;s 60x60 inches, so covers over knees when seated and 27 inches down the back.  </li>
<li> There are snap buttons on back, so no hair down your shirt or neck  </li>
<li> Simple black and keeps the hair out</li>
<li> He&#x27;s a tall man, even when sitting down</li>
<li> Returning it also allowed me to get the black cheaper than the brown</li>
<li> My boyfriend is in the military and wasted a ton of money on haircuts for a few months after bootcamp.</li>
<li> A little tight fighting on neck</li>
<li> Makes for cutting hair much easier with less of a mess on clothes.</li>
<li> Heavy fabric like material.  </li>
<li> I find that I can&#x27;t snap it tight enough on my son and husband when cutting their hair so they still get some hairs down their neck/shirt.  </li>
<li> I was tired of telling the stylist to use a clip to keep the cape somewhat loose.</li>
<li> I use this cape when cutting household members&#x27; hair, which I do outside.  </li>
<li> I cut my husbands, my boys, and my girls hair because going to sams or supercuts is freaking expensive.</li>
<li> She had bought a home hair clipper set, and began cutting her husband and sons&#x27; hair at home.  </li>

    <li> I own a beauty shop and we have a barber also so some of the men have very large necks ;so we wanted some larger capes.one cape only had snaps on one side then the other two capes only had three snaps and they couldn&#x27;t be used because there is no way you can adjust it to fit .will never buy them again</li>
    <li> Great cape, roomy, covers everything and then some .. I bought it because I&#x27;m old enough now to claim eccentricity and to weather goofiness, if not humiliation, and I simply cannot eat anything (even a dry protein bar) without getting something on me.  I am the queen of spots. I bought it for a bib .. been threatening to do it for years, first joking, then not so much, and finally a purchase.  Works great, and pays for itself with what I save on dry cleaning and laundry products. I should add that I don&#x27;t wear it in a restaurant or public place, but at home and at work at my desk, out it comes.  One note, however, no matter what you purpose it for .. it causes (attracts?) static electricity!  When I first modeled it at work, a colleague pointed out that my hair was standing out sideways.  Everything I touch gives me a shock.  There must be a remedy for this .. I wonder what it is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing anything close to my neck (like scarves, necklaces, turtlenecks).  I find that the standard capes at the hair salon are too snug on my neck, especially when a towel is tucked in as well.  I was tired of telling the stylist to use a clip to keep the cape somewhat loose. Then I found this adjustable cape on Amazon, which features a row of snaps allowing me to adjust the fit to my liking.  Much better!  The cape itself provides great coverage over your clothes, protecting you from hair, color, and water. My stylist doesn&#x27;t mind me bringing my own cape, and it makes for a much more comfortable experience at the salon.</li>
    <li> I use this cape when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It works well, although it could be longer in the back.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair cutting cape - large, thin nylon with numerous adjustable snaps at the neck.  Should have purchased this a long time ago - my husband has been sweating under a plastic cape for several years when I cut his hair - no longer!!  This cape can also be washed if necessary.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> The first one of these was defective.  There were only snaps on one side, and nothing on the other to attach them too.  Returning it also allowed me to get the black cheaper than the brown (it was originally more expensive).  The second one is nice an roomy and seems to be of good quality.  It will also make a nice cape for a Batman or Dracula costume at Halloween!</li>
    <li> just what i needed. a big cape that covers your whole body and didnt leave all the hairs clinging to it. also, since i get my haircut outdoors, it didnt make me any hotter than i already was.</li>
    <li> This cape is nice and long so no hair will get on your shirt, pants or shoes.  There are snap buttons on back, so no hair down your shirt or neck  A little tight fighting on neck but you have the option of not closing top button  Very good quality, not flimsy and easy to clean - best barbers cape for the price.  5 Stars</li>
    <li> Medium sized cape, great snap closures, would be better with a clip for custom fittings. Simple black and keeps the hair out lol</li>
    <li> This is a large cape, but when I&#x27;m cutting hair it gets soaked so easily when I wet hair. I wish it were to be treated with something so it would be a little more water resistant. I also wish it had more snap closures for thinner and larger necks. I keep needing to close the cape with a hair clip to hold it in place.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is in the military and wasted a ton of money on haircuts for a few months after bootcamp. Finally, he came to the point where he bought clippers so I could cut his hair for him and save the time and money. The only problem we had was all the hair that stuck to him during the haircuts. This product solved the problem! He&#x27;s a tall man, even when sitting down so I&#x27;m very pleased that this completely covers him. Also, the snaps are a great feature because I&#x27;m not a fan of velcro, especially when a ton of hair gets caught in it. After haircuts, I simply snap off the cape, take it outside, shake of the hair then fold it up and store it. I feel like this cape will last a long time, even after his time in the military is over. So it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Good delivery; excellent product - nylon fabric has substance with nice salon drape and well made. It&#x27;s 60x60 inches, so covers over knees when seated and 27 inches down the back.  Even a loop at neck edge for hanging.  Think it will wear well.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, comfortable around the neck and extra large to cover most of the body. I purchased this to drape my bridal clients when I do their hair and makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and family.  She had bought a home hair clipper set, and began cutting her husband and sons&#x27; hair at home.  I bought this to compliment their barbering equipment.  It works very well for them, and a lot better than the bed sheet she had been using.</li>
    <li> Large, durable &#x27;cloth&#x27; and snaps.  Works great for haircuts at home while keeping hair off necks.</li>
    <li> This material on this cape feels very high quality and is definitely better than the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; cape I got with my clippers.  This cape is very large and the snap closure around the neck is a little big.  I find that I can&#x27;t snap it tight enough on my son and husband when cutting their hair so they still get some hairs down their neck/shirt.  I do like how the cape is large enough to cover their lap though.  Overall, recommend this cape--just keep in mind it&#x27;s very large!</li>
    <li> Truly a large cape.  Does the job. Three stars vs. five because the clipped hair tends to stick to the surface.  Even shaking does not release all of the hair.  So, although this prevents cut hair from getting on your clothes, it is a pain to clean up afterwards.  Maybe this is a static electricity issue.</li>
    <li> I use this cape when cutting household members&#x27; hair, which I do outside.  It is generously large enough to cover their clothes and even keeps them warm when it&#x27;s a little cool out.  Clean-up is much easier than when I used a bath towel as the cover.  Well worth the purchase price!</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands, my boys, and my girls hair because going to sams or supercuts is freaking expensive. It is full size and keeps hair off however for kids you have to use a clip to tighten it around the neck because its loose.</li>
    <li> The material is fairly heavy and has held up really well. This thing is huge, even on a average size adult man.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cape, large at 60x60 with metal snaps for adjustable fit around the neck and a nice smooth comfortable nylon/poly blend material.  However for what it is and what you get I feel this product is overpriced</li>
    <li> Unlike you see in reviews of many of the barber/styling capes you can buy, this one is great.  It&#x27;s plenty big enough to keep the clippings off of you, front and back.  That&#x27;s the main thing.  Also, it&#x27;s comfortable around the neck.  It&#x27;s comfortable to have around your body, not too hot, and when you&#x27;re done you can give it a few shakes and the hair comes right off.</li>
    <li> This is a nice quality cape - the adjustable snaps are nice.  They&#x27;re metal, not plastic.  Should last for a long time for my family&#x27;s haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought I was getting a regular size cape - was a little surprised that it was as big as it is because it&#x27;s not in the item&#x27;s title.  Going back into the item description, it does state that it is plus size.  The package says &amp;#34;Plus Sized Styling Cape&amp;#34;.  It is definitely made for a larger, taller person.  I can use it on my tall teenage boys, but it&#x27;s way to big for my younger girls.  It drapes to the ground when they&#x27;re sitting on a bar stool :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a good cape.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I needed a cape to protect against spillage when dying hair.  This works perfectly. Also protects against falling hair during haircuts.  What more do you need it do to?</li>
    <li> This is a really nice quality cape. It&#x27;s big enough to cover my whole body so I don&#x27;t get hair on me. Water also beads off of it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a big one!  but very happy with it</li>
    <li> Makes for cutting hair much easier with less of a mess on clothes. It is great. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Used it right away. Honestly \\&quot;A size above\\&quot; and a must buy for those who want their whole body covered and protected from hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a nice large cape.  Heavy fabric like material.  The snaps on the neck fit my neck in an acceptable fashion.  I have about a 16-16.5 inch neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is right out of the box the cap is staticky and the cut hair has stuck to it.  I&#x27;m going to run it through a gentle wash cycle and see if that rids it of that problem.</li>
