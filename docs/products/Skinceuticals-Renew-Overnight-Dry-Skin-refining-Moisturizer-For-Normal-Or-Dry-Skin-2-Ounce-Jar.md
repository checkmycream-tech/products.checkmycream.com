    <li> It keeps my face hydrated. It&#x27;s glows in the morning after a good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrific nighttime moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  My skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Very good product that was highly recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> This product is fine, I am not in love with it nor am I going to return it.  Sometimes I feel like it makes my skin more dry, sometimes I think it might be helping.  It may be because it is peeling the dry skin off?  I dont know.  I doubt I will purchase this moisturizer again.  However, I do love love love skinceuticals CE ferulic serum!</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I liked this product but after a few days I realized I wasn&#x27;t adding more cream to my face throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream only because the cream I normally use now costs over $100 for a small jar.  I decided to try something less expensive that still had the potential of being able to tackle my dry skin.  So far, this has done very well.  It isn&#x27;t at all heavy, yet keeps me appropriately hydrated.  I have very dry skin, so I use this in both the morning and at night.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product!  It goes on clean with no greasy feeling.  I will definitely be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> After one month of using this product I already see a difference. My sin looks cleaner and softer!</li>
    <li> Love Skinceuticals C &amp; E feurlic, so I thought I would try the face cream and was not impressed. Too expensive to warrant a 4-5 star rating</li>
    <li> Super quality. This is the best of this cream I have received!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for dry skin with leaving greasy feeling. Jar last a long time. Nice scent. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s in a jar vs. a pump or squeeze bottle (greater exposure to bacteria, etc.).</li>
    <li> This product is very moisturizing.  I put it on at night, it does not feel too heavy, and provides good moisture and softness to my skin.  Does not feel greasy.  In the morning, I can still feel the hydration in my skin.  This jar has lasted me about 3 months with daily night-time use.  Great for normal or dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best ever night cream, feels like butter on your skin.</li>
    <li> Transformed my skin! Lines under my eyes are almost gone and my skin is soft after only few days of use! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the price ... no scent, absorbs without being greasy, really diminishes age lines and makes my skin feel great! I&#x27;ve used this for years.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. My skin is very dry and I use this every night for smooth lovely skin.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used this product for years and I stopped several months ago, to try to cut costs by using other products...BIG mistake!  ALL the other brands I tried, did not compare to the Skinceutical line.  I ordered and just received Renew Overnight, and can&#x27;t wait to once again, see and feel the positive difference when I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> It has helped hid and slow down my wrinkles.  It sinks in to your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I had really dry skin and this has helped alot.  Like most things though it seems to lose it&#x27;s umph with continued use.  My skin is better, but I would have liked to see more continued improvement over time.  I will keep using it for now.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing to my face don&#x27;t need to use to much  Love it !</li>
    <li> I gave this a try because I needed something to use on the in-between nights when I&#x27;m skipping stronger products, and for when my skin feels dry and tight for whatever reason. This cream feels and smells like a thicker version of the Skinceuticals Epidermal Repair.  Just a basic, light moisturizer -- what used to be called cold cream.  Not much bang for the buck here.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream. Great price!</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick and creamy and lasts a long time because you only need a small dab. I do get a little burning when I first put it on, but that&#x27;s the acids, it&#x27;s not too bad. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday and truly love it.  I have dry skin so it works well.  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time and seems to work. Expensive but this is a good brand. We will see if it keeps my skin moisturizer in wintertime</li>
    <li> Pricey but great product. I&#x27;ve  used for about 3 years and have tried others but can not replace this one.  Lasts about 2-3 months with nightly use.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, mild cream for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;A good compliment to SC cleanser, as well as sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Spent a lot less on this product buying it on Amazon. If your not in a hurry watch the price for a while, sometimes it goes on sale for a much lower price. Thats the time to snag it.</li>
    <li> I do not like this night cream.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife- she loves the product.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my physician and it works really well.  I have tried others products, but, this works best.</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly and is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have dry, sensitive skin and it has helped.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. It is not too heavy/ oily. And my skin looks bright and renewed in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love this overnight cream! It has help keep my skin moisturized!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Been using this exclusively.</li>
    <li> This is a first time purchase for me, but I loved the day time moisturizer so I thought I&#x27;d try this one as well.  I don&#x27;t like spending this much for any skin care item but have decided that Olay just doesn&#x27;t do it for my skin anymore.  I rated this 4 stars for now because the scent, consistency, and texture is lovely.  Whether or not it makes me look more hydrated and younger is still the big question!</li>
    <li> I have beefing using this product over 4 years and it works. My complexion is flawless. Fine lines under my eyes are invibles and my tone is even</li>
    <li> Really good.  Excellent</li>
    <li> Very good night cream. I realized I was developing blemishes due to over drying skin using acne products. Very confusing. This cream has balanced my complexion, diminished lines with hydration and even looks clearer. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> great moisture, feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals is one of those &amp;#34;worth it&amp;#34; companies.  I love this moisturizer and have been using it for over a year. It is not too thick, greasy, or weird-smelling.  It works best with their serums (I use the texturizing and Vit. C ones).  Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> My wife, who is 52, has discovered the joy of Skinceuticals products. Frankly, she seems kind of obsessed with them.  She started with the CE Ferulic, talked about it with her dermatologist (who said that Skinceuticals makes great products), and moved on from there.  She loves this Renew Overnight Dry, and said that you cannot beat it for the price.  It does not break out her skin or clog her pores.  She is using it in conjunction with other Skinceuticals, including age interrupter, resveratrol, pigment corrector and the CE Ferulic.  She gets constant compliments on her skin. Per wife, great product, great price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> This noticeably improve my very dry skin&#x27;s texture. I use this at night (with petroleum jelly on top, I&#x27;ve always used it). For Day I use the B5 gel under a moisturizer. It&#x27;s expensive, but better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (drug store stuff and clinique). Will continue to buy in the future. Also doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
    <li> Perfect for my combo skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I use it every night...For day time use I use Skinceuticals  sun screen and find this works well too.  Priced so we can afford too.</li>
    <li> old or not the real product,</li>
    <li> This is the best overnight moisturizer, especially for sensitive skin.  It WORKS and it has great anti-aging properties, too,  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you purchase this product!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is awesome! I use it daily on my face, neck and any other dry spots. It really hydrates my skin and keeps it looking and feeling fabulous!</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Not cheap but very effective in keeping your skin clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> It made me break out all over my cheeks</li>
    <li> This is mystery in a jar.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Last time I accidently ordered for oily skin when my skin is dry, but this time got it right. Goes great with the retinol at night.</li>
    <li> a good product that is moisturizing without feeling greasy, and gently exfoliates</li>
    <li> This has really helped me with my dry skin. It is not oily and leave the skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> My physician recommends skinceuticals and I like this product a lot and find the price reasonable and the shopping easy.</li>
