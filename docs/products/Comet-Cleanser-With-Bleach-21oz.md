      <li>Comet will disinfect, bleach, polish and clean most bathroom and kitchen surfaces.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleaner, but it smells very strongly of bleach when you get it wet.  </li>
      <li>Then just light scrubbing does the job easily.</li>
      <li>My comet was fine.  </li>
      <li>The grates come clean very quickly.</li>
      <li>Comet is the best say no more.</li>
      <li>but I managed to clean the sink.</li>
      <li>Comet cleanser was what my mom gave us to clean the bathroom - not just the bathtub.  </li>
      <li>But it does an amazing job on old run-of-the-mill type of stains.</li>
      <li>Tried and true.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>Seems that abrasive action works better quicker to clean.</li>
      <li>Comet is like a dependable old dog; loyal and lovable.</li>
      <li>Great product I use it for my bathtub and it gets the job done with little effort.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Other scented sprays may be OK for a quick wipe-down, but when you really need clean, this stuff is it.</li>
      <li>Personally I think this powers works better than the Comet Liquid.</li>
      <li>Guess I will be going back to Wally World, because I sure as heck am not buying it for what the vendors on Amazon are asking for it.  </li>
      <li>Comet is not high-tech, but it works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the gentle odor coming from a powerful cleaner.</li>
      <li>I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\</li>
      <li>i cant find anything better to scrub a sink, toilet or tub with.</li>
      <li>My favorite places to use comet are the kitchen sink, the bathtub and the toilet.</li>
      <li>You can use this on counters, tubs, stoves, pretty much anything.</li>
      <li>There really isn&#x27;t much to say.</li>
      <li>thanks from squareprint.com</li>
      <li>Really does the job.</li>
      <li>It isms much cheaper on Amazon then in my grocery stores even if I had a coupon.</li>
      <li>This is our all time favorite product for cleaning sinks and toilets.</li>
      <li>Well, \\&quot;Soft Scrub\\&quot; didn&#x27;t clean anything - it was \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft.  </li>
      <li>The same is true if something burns on the bottom of my stainless steel kettles and frypans.</li>
      <li>I use it to clean my toilet, sink and shower</li>
      <li>Using a respirator, N95 or leaving the room for a few minutes to let the airborne particles safely settle will mitigate any danger.</li>
      <li>Just live in a &#x27;50s place</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t aware till yrs later there was all that cool/new stuff.  </li>
      <li>This will bring back the sparkle to anything and it disinfects very well.</li>
      <li>The way to remove carpet stains with Comet is simple: Sprinkle some Comet on the carpet stain, and then rub it with a very damp sponge.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t realize anyone else still bought Comet...assumed young&#x27;uns never...  </li>
      <li>Sprinkle some in your toilet bowl to sit for a little while about once a week in between formal cleaning and it keeps the bowl nice and white.</li>
      <li>The only drawback with Comet is that it’s a powdered cleanser, which means that it can be inhaled if you are not careful.</li>

    <li> Arrived broken open, spilled out into its bag, so annoying</li>
    <li> i use this to clean my bath tub with my bathroom brush and they work really nice i mean clear white nice, and they dont smell bad either.</li>
    <li> You can use this on counters, tubs, stoves, pretty much anything. This will bring back the sparkle to anything and it disinfects very well. The only downside is it smells something fierce (the bleach obviously). So if you&#x27;re in a small space, like cleaning a bathtub, it has a tendency to make you pretty dizzy and nauseous. Other scented sprays may be OK for a quick wipe-down, but when you really need clean, this stuff is it. It even got out the disgusting yellow stains on a counter from a previous inhabitant that wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
    <li> I like the gentle odor coming from a powerful cleaner. Sprinkle some in your toilet bowl to sit for a little while about once a week in between formal cleaning and it keeps the bowl nice and white. It wipes off easily enough with a sponge that I use it for my refrigerator inside and out.</li>
    <li> Great product I use it for my bathtub and it gets the job done with little effort.  Thank you Thank you Thank you</li>
    <li> We use this at home all the time so the last time we ran out checked on Amazon. And am I glad I did. It isms much cheaper on Amazon then in my grocery stores even if I had a coupon. Comet has been a staple in our household for years and now it&#x27;s even better given Amazons price point.</li>
    <li> Comet cleanser was what my mom gave us to clean the bathroom - not just the bathtub.  For the sink &amp; toilet it was messy, but if that&#x27;s what you have...  Wasn&#x27;t aware till yrs later there was all that cool/new stuff.  Well, \\&quot;Soft Scrub\\&quot; didn&#x27;t clean anything - it was \\&quot;too\\&quot; soft.  SO pleased there is still \\&quot;Comet\\&quot;.  Cleans the sink/tub/inside the toilet &amp; anything else you wanna scrub on.  BTW - fiberglass tubs cannot be cleaned - don&#x27;t even try.  Just live in a &#x27;50s place w/a porcelain tub.  The best are claw foots - big/deep/easy to clean.  Try sprinkling Comet in your toilet &amp; scrub it.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how easy it cleans up.  Use some disinfectant wipes to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t realize anyone else still bought Comet...assumed young&#x27;uns never...  Always buy the lemon scent in the plastic shaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comet - you&#x27;re cheap &amp; still the best.  You Rock...</li>
    <li> i cant find anything better to scrub a sink, toilet or tub with. plus i love the smell. Seems that abrasive action works better quicker to clean.</li>
    <li> Really does the job. One of the best. Quality of the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I felt so bad to have purchased this at $4.00 when I found it on shelf in a local store afterward for $0.99! Returning it would cost me 6.00, felt so stupid.</li>
    <li> Comet, as always, is simply the best when it comes to cleaning up your bathroom.  The price is right too, and the packaging was good and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Hmmmmm the better question is why did I buy comet online?  The answer is because I was depressed and drinking and did not feel like going out but I don&#x27;t like dirt.  My comet was fine.  It did nothing for my depression but I managed to clean the sink.</li>
    <li> Comet is like a dependable old dog; loyal and lovable. Comet will disinfect, bleach, polish and clean most bathroom and kitchen surfaces. My favorite places to use comet are the kitchen sink, the bathtub and the toilet. Comet is not high-tech, but it works exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how dirty your bathtub might seem, a sprinkling of comet and a little muscle will get the tub looking cleaner than a stainless steel scalpel. The only drawback with Comet is that it’s a powdered cleanser, which means that it can be inhaled if you are not careful. Using a respirator, N95 or leaving the room for a few minutes to let the airborne particles safely settle will mitigate any danger.</li>
    <li> I was amazed to see the price on this item...very competitive and for that reason I bought it. My only  vice is that i&#x27;m used to the newer containers with the flip cap that you close...this one just has the sticker that you pull off so the holes are left open. Just a pet peeve because it&#x27;s not that neat. Definitely prefer the newer one with lemon power.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly dependable and established source for cleaning tough stains from porcelain. This large size is difficult to find at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> thanks from squareprint.com</li>
    <li> This is a great cleaner, but it smells very strongly of bleach when you get it wet.  I don&#x27;t prefer lots of bleach.</li>
    <li> This is just regular comet cleaner, works as advertised.  I use it to clean my toilet, sink and shower and it&#x27;s always been great!</li>
    <li> After trying to remove hard-to-remove caked-in carpet stains unsuccessfully with Hoover carpet stain remover,I tried using Comet and it worked. The way to remove carpet stains with Comet is simple: Sprinkle some Comet on the carpet stain, and then rub it with a very damp sponge. And it leaves no residue nor any damage on the carpet. I don&#x27;t know, however, if it removes red wine spills and such. But it does an amazing job on old run-of-the-mill type of stains.</li>
    <li> Comet is the best say no more.</li>
    <li> This is our all time favorite product for cleaning sinks and toilets. Just the best. I just spread in the sink and wait until I need to&lt;br /&gt;use the sink again. Then just light scrubbing does the job easily.</li>
    <li> I love comet since it does such a real good job without any elbow grease.  It works real good especially the grout on the kitchen counter.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser ever made. It works much better than all the foams, liquids, and gels. Personally I think this powers works better than the Comet Liquid.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> There really isn&#x27;t much to say. It is Comet, it has spoken for itself for years. The product arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have had great success cleaning stove top grates where overflows have been baked on. I sprinkle some Comet on a copper pad and then scrub away. The grates come clean very quickly. The same is true if something burns on the bottom of my stainless steel kettles and frypans.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using comet many years and  have had no problems with it but this comet I got from Amazon smelled so bad I just threw it out. The was something wrong with it. I do not recommend this product and I will never purchase it again on line.</li>
    <li> I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\&quot; the savings on shipping, and on gas (from having to drive to town to shop).  The savings make up for any price difference.  Why shop any other way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Comet Cleanser for over 40 years, it is my staple product for elbow-grease type cleaning of any place in the home.  A can is always in the bathrooms for cleaning of those tough stains.  It along with pumice stone cleans and shines the toilet bowels perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three staples for cleaning includes:  Windex, Pledge, Comet Cleaner (powder), and Clorox Bleach.  I&#x27;ve learned to \\&quot;simplify\\&quot; my life and love the savings and the ease the products and Amazon afford!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt, COMET bleach cleaner is one of the time-tested cleansers on the market.  It gets tough stains out on just about every surface I&#x27;ve tried it on.  HOWEVER, I was at Wally World (big box store, you know who they are), and they had Comet for on REGULAR price for .93 cents for the same 21-ounce size.  I didn&#x27;t buy it, because I decided to buy online by the case, lest anyone at Wally World look at me funny for buying a case of this awesome stuff.  Guess I will be going back to Wally World, because I sure as heck am not buying it for what the vendors on Amazon are asking for it.  Too pricey on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Tried and true.  I&#x27;ve always used this product and nothing works better than Comet for scouring my porcelain sink.</li>
