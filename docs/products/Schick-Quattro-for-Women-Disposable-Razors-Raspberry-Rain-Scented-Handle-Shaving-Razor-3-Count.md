      <li>And it worked great, unreal smoothness of the glide.</li>
      <li>Great razors for the price for my wife.  </li>
      <li>Schick Quattro does a great job</li>
      <li>These razors are great....</li>
      <li>I did not find these razors to give a great shave.  </li>
      <li>Their razors at a good price that work</li>
      <li>I love these lady shavers!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have better luck using a butter knife!</li>
      <li>For disposables, these are pretty good!</li>
      <li>On my sensitive skin, the Schick Quattro works best.</li>
      <li>The handle is a nice size and easy to hold onto in the shower.</li>
      <li>For the price,  however, they are a much better deal than many others</li>
      <li>Just OK.  </li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>Lovely raspberry scented razors.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I love Schick razor blades.</li>
      <li>I love the handle on these razors.  </li>
      <li>No nicks, smooth shaving!</li>
      <li>Okay razors for thinner haired people</li>
      <li>I had to check the head twice to make sure it didn&#x27;t still have a plastic cap or some sort of seal.</li>
      <li>Great deal and shave very well.</li>
      <li>These are the best for travel because they are the only razors that have a cover that stays on securely and will not come off in your bag.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance is nice, though, and came very quickly with free shipping, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
      <li>The blades glide well over my skin and are certainly effective, however, they are certainly one use razors.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, doesn&#x27;t clean easily.</li>
      <li>They shave close and smooth.</li>
      <li>It was just so smooth</li>
      <li>These are good razors, they last for an OK amount of time.</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how good until I tried other brands.</li>
      <li>So I ordered these on amazon, free shipping, raspberry scented sounded cool, why not.</li>
      <li>They are disposable but I feel like I could only get one good use out of them.</li>
      <li>It is far more comfortable on the skin than the venus, which I just can&#x27;t stand...</li>
      <li>These are the best that my daughter and I have tried, and we&#x27;ve bought several different brands/types of razors.</li>
      <li>and it never seemed to be worth it.</li>
      <li>I normally by the super cheap razors, but I thought I&#x27;d try treating myself with these.</li>
      <li>Right afterward.</li>
      <li>The first time using one of these garbage razors, my legs were stubbly afterward.</li>
      <li>Personally, I think the moisture strip on top of the blades sticks out too far and prevents the blades from providing a clean close</li>
      <li>These razors work really well.</li>
      <li>I really like the venus razors</li>
      <li>Some other disposables I have been able to get another use out of, but these I trash after each use.  </li>
      <li>I tried this razor because it was a subscribe and save option with heavy discounts, and WOW am I glad I gave it a chance!</li>
      <li>These do a great job, last a long time, I rarely ever get a cut and have never received a raw or rash feeling from them</li>
      <li>I think they are a little more pricey than they need to be...</li>
      <li>The razor fits comfortably in my hand, and the no slip grip prevents wet, soapy hands from dropping your razor.  </li>
      <li>Most others had a foam or gel strip that easily shredded and made for uncomfortable shaves.</li>
      <li>The razors also seem to last longer than most other brands.</li>
      <li>These last longer than others I have tried too, and I will sometimes use them for much longer than I should but have never cut myself.</li>
      <li>I have tried 2, 3, and 4 blade razors, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s, scented and sensitive.</li>
      <li>Razors with soap around the blades wore away quickly and, again, not worth the money.</li>
      <li>I found these razors to dull quickly and they do not shave very well.</li>
      <li>I usually buy gilette razors but decided to give these a try because they were cheap but, as always, you get what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>total waste of money if you&#x27;re not Scandinavian with baby fine leg hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get a close shave with these razors, and while I don&#x27;t really need raspberry scented razors, if you&#x27;re buying them for that reason, the smell is pretty faint and wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>These razors went dull very quick, won&#x27;t get these again</li>
      <li>4 to a pack is nice, and they last a long time if you use them properly, not allowing them to sit wet for a long time.  </li>

    <li> These are the best for travel because they are the only razors that have a cover that stays on securely and will not come off in your bag.</li>
    <li> These are good razors, they last for an OK amount of time. I think they are a little more pricey than they need to be...but oh well.</li>
    <li> Wife likes them and cheaper than the big box store.</li>
    <li> they are a little dull but you get a nick free shave.</li>
    <li> These razors are great.... best razors I have ever used !!!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best disposable shavers I&#x27;ve ever used. Great for stubborn hairs. Or for awkward areas.</li>
    <li> These are the best that my daughter and I have tried, and we&#x27;ve bought several different brands/types of razors.</li>
    <li> By far the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever purchased. The blades are so dull and poorly designed. You literally need to go over the hair like 3 or 4 times to shave it off. I&#x27;d have better luck using a butter knife!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get a close shave with these razors, and while I don&#x27;t really need raspberry scented razors, if you&#x27;re buying them for that reason, the smell is pretty faint and wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> These razors went dull very quick, won&#x27;t get these again</li>
    <li> Great deal and shave very well. No redness using these.</li>
    <li> Okay razors for thinner haired people I have thick leg hair and these razors sorta tore me up</li>
    <li> Their razors at a good price that work</li>
    <li> Just OK.  I did not find these razors to give a great shave.  Average sharpness and they did not last longer than  month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of razors over the years and keep coming back to these. They&#x27;re gentle on the skin, but work on dense hair without missing any.</li>
    <li> I hate standing in the razor aisle at the store trying to pick out razors which are always new, different, discontinued next time I go. So I ordered these on amazon, free shipping, raspberry scented sounded cool, why not. Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, doesn&#x27;t clean easily. Will not purchase again. Light fragrance is nice, though, and came very quickly with free shipping, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> For disposables, these are pretty good! I honestly didn&#x27;t realize how good until I tried other brands. I think some of the others shave a bit closer but at the cost of some skin. Schick Quattro does a great job and I never feel the razors. These last longer than others I have tried too, and I will sometimes use them for much longer than I should but have never cut myself. The handle is a nice size and easy to hold onto in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and number of blades. On my sensitive skin, the Schick Quattro works best. The razors also seem to last longer than most other brands.</li>
    <li> Got a bonus razor pack!</li>
    <li> Great razors for the price for my wife.  She loves these and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> These razors are crap. I usually buy gilette razors but decided to give these a try because they were cheap but, as always, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get a close shave whatsoever. The first time using one of these garbage razors, my legs were stubbly afterward. Right afterward. I don&#x27;t know HOW this is possible with four blades. Personally, I think the moisture strip on top of the blades sticks out too far and prevents the blades from providing a clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total waste of money if you&#x27;re not Scandinavian with baby fine leg hair.</li>
    <li> I love Schick razor blades. These one&#x27;s a pink and smell fruity, which is kinda weird...definitely get what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor. What can I say?</li>
    <li> Best disposable razor i&#x27;ve found.  It is far more comfortable on the skin than the venus, which I just can&#x27;t stand... yuck!</li>
    <li> I found these razors to dull quickly and they do not shave very well. They are disposable but I feel like I could only get one good use out of them. I really like the venus razors and I think I will have to go back to using those.</li>
    <li> Lovely raspberry scented razors. They shave close and smooth. 4 to a pack is nice, and they last a long time if you use them properly, not allowing them to sit wet for a long time.  I love these lady shavers!</li>
    <li> I love the handle on these razors.  The enlarged and ribbed thumb grip is perfect!  The razor fits comfortably in my hand, and the no slip grip prevents wet, soapy hands from dropping your razor.  I don&#x27;t see the point in the scented handles, so I can take it or leave it.  The blades glide well over my skin and are certainly effective, however, they are certainly one use razors.  Some other disposables I have been able to get another use out of, but these I trash after each use.  For the price,  however, they are a much better deal than many others so I suppose it&#x27;s a wash.</li>
    <li> I have tried 2, 3, and 4 blade razors, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s, scented and sensitive. I gave up on 4 bladed ones a while ago because I always got nicked when trying to navigate my ankles and knees and it never seemed to be worth it. Razors with soap around the blades wore away quickly and, again, not worth the money. Most others had a foam or gel strip that easily shredded and made for uncomfortable shaves. I tried this razor because it was a subscribe and save option with heavy discounts, and WOW am I glad I gave it a chance! I had to check the head twice to make sure it didn&#x27;t still have a plastic cap or some sort of seal. It was just so smooth, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was actually doing anything. It was! And it worked great, unreal smoothness of the glide. Love love love.</li>
    <li> I normally by the super cheap razors, but I thought I&#x27;d try treating myself with these. I&#x27;m less likely to cut myself with these, but also less likely to remove all hair on the first (or even second) try.</li>

    <li> These razors work really well.</li>
    <li> These razors are the best! No nicks, smooth shaving! Love them.</li>
