### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful in every aspect!</li>
      <li>so this was perfect to me</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful.</li>
      <li>BUT surprisingly this palette is great!</li>
      <li>Also it is nice that the palette had sort of a magnetic device in it so that the flaps stay shut, great for travel!!!!  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>The blushes are nice because they include a highlighter, bronzer color, shimmer color and matte color!</li>
      <li>lots of good colors, the package works well</li>
      <li>CUTE!</li>
      <li>I will be getting more cosmetics from this brand again!</li>
      <li>The packaging of the makeup is insanely cute!</li>
      <li>it has everything and the pigments are amazing and the price its set is a steal</li>
      <li>The blushes are amazing though you can literally use them for highlight, blush and contour.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this kind of product.</li>
      <li>over all I liked this product.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I even bought one for my best friend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it love the blushes nice brown blush love it</li>
      <li>The packaging is great, and the colors are pretty.  </li>
      <li>I love BH Cosmetics.</li>
      <li>plus i really love bh cosmetics</li>
      <li>and I love the blush, highlighter, and bronzer that&#x27;s included with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this pallette</li>
      <li>i really love this palette</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this set because of the cute palette design.</li>
      <li>Love the colors and the package is so cute.</li>
      <li>Love this..</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>bh cosmetics products and the cute pakaging makes a lovely display but two pans of eyeshadow fell out</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also a cute palette that&#x27;s easy to take on the go</li>
      <li>Honestly one of the first things that come my attention was the four blushes!</li>
      <li>the colors are very pigmented and bright</li>
      <li>Just wish the palette came in full size!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a cool palette</li>
      <li>My brushes pick up the color easily and go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>But when I opened this bad boy up and saw the beautiful pigmented colors and the wonderful blushes, I fell in love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really liked the vibrant colors..pretty pigmented as well...</li>
      <li>I love how the colors are vibrant and go on easy.</li>
      <li>I love this pallet so much.</li>
      <li>but other then that I am very satisfied!</li>
      <li>Great palette, really like that there is shimmery and matte of the same colors.  </li>
      <li>I really have been enjoying this set, the colors are very pigmented and fun!</li>
      <li>Colors are actually pretty pigmented (when used with primer)!</li>
      <li>I had fun with the colors.</li>
      <li>Otherwise save a little more and get a better quality eyeshadow pallet.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try the Mailbu set out, as it has more of everyday type of colors, so the travel kit would be used more.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it, returned it back to sender</li>
      <li>Small but cute I love</li>
      <li>The shipping was incredibly fast, which I always appreciate.  </li>
      <li>It came fast and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>My favorites are the matte blush and bronzer which I use as a blush because it&#x27;s too light for my tan complexion, black,silver,red,fuchsia,gold and shimmer blue eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly pigmented and good-quality</li>
      <li>the packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better...</li>
      <li>bad eyeshadow pigmentation but the blushes/ bronzers are great :) but cant complain though since theyre only six bucks each</li>
      <li>Maybe they did it so they would break less, being a travel kit, but it does make it harder to get a good amount on the brush.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite palettes, I use it everyday!</li>
      <li>I am a sucker for a cute package.</li>
      <li>Nice make up palette bought this for my daughter, her only complaint is that she needs a primer to use with this as the eye shadow colors don&#x27;t pop without a primer.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling open unexpectedly.</li>
      <li>When I saw how much this product had included for the price i was a little weary.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great palette, really like that there is shimmery and matte of the same colors.  My brushes pick up the color easily and go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite palettes, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter to play with. Does not compare in any way to Coastal Scents, Shany or Sleek Cosmetics. Bypass.</li>
    <li> Really liked the vibrant colors..pretty pigmented as well...nothing was broken but the packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better...i received it in one of those bubble wrapped orangy envelopes. Received it a day ahead too ...over all I liked this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this pallette this is one of my favorites I&#x27;m so glad I got it love the blushes nice brown blush love it</li>
    <li> bad eyeshadow pigmentation but the blushes/ bronzers are great :) but cant complain though since theyre only six bucks each</li>
    <li> lots of good colors, the package works well and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for this kind of product.</li>
    <li> The palette it just.. it has everything and the pigments are amazing and the price its set is a steal and they&#x27;re made in the US which gives me a lot of relief. I will be getting more cosmetics from this brand again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love BH Cosmetics. The colors are beautiful. It came fast and was packaged well. Nothing was broken. The packaging of the makeup is insanely cute! Wonderful in every aspect!</li>
    <li> I expected this palette to be a bit bigger, so when it arrived as the size of my hand, I was a little disappointed. But when I opened this bad boy up and saw the beautiful pigmented colors and the wonderful blushes, I fell in love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Child, I only wish this thing came in a larger size..... but other then that I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> The palette itself is just a bit bigger than my hand when you open it up the shadows are about the size of a dime, the matte ones can be a bit hard to work with you really have to pack it on. The blushes are amazing though you can literally use them for highlight, blush and contour. The packaging for this palette is so pleasing. I am a sucker for a cute package. I would not buy this again just because of how hard it is to work with the matte shadows.</li>
    <li> I like the idea for this travel kit.  The packaging is great, and the colors are pretty.  The shadows are a little harder/chalkier than I hoped for.  I&#x27;ve had BH palettes before and didn&#x27;t find them this consistancy.  Maybe they did it so they would break less, being a travel kit, but it does make it harder to get a good amount on the brush.  The shipping was incredibly fast, which I always appreciate.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try the Mailbu set out, as it has more of everyday type of colors, so the travel kit would be used more.</li>
    <li> I love bh cosmetics products and the cute pakaging makes a lovely display but two pans of eyeshadow fell out so I had to crazy glue them but other than that its fine.</li>
    <li> I love how the colors are vibrant and go on easy. This is my go to palette every time I put on my make up.</li>
    <li> When I saw how much this product had included for the price i was a little weary. BUT surprisingly this palette is great! Colors are actually pretty pigmented (when used with primer)! I also use the pink blush daily now! Also it is nice that the palette had sort of a magnetic device in it so that the flaps stay shut, great for travel!!!!  Just wish the palette came in full size!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this set because of the cute palette design. I really have been enjoying this set, the colors are very pigmented and fun! The blushes are nice because they include a highlighter, bronzer color, shimmer color and matte color! I do recommend keeping the plastic cover over both the eyeshadows and blushes to protect your product! The set also doesn&#x27;t sit up like the picture would suggest, the mirror section falls over. BUT, the package is magnetic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling open unexpectedly. CUTE!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the package is so cute. I had fun with the colors. Small but cute I love</li>
    <li> Received this product broken so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it, returned it back to sender I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a cool palette will probably order again to try it out.</li>
    <li> Love this..the colors are very pigmented and bright i really love this palette plus i really love bh cosmetics so this was perfect to me</li>
    <li> I love this pallet so much. Honestly one of the first things that come my attention was the four blushes! I love it so much I even bought one for my best friend! It&#x27;s highly pigmented and good-quality it&#x27;s also a cute palette that&#x27;s easy to take on the go</li>
    <li> My imagination just went crazy with this palette. Plenty if colors to work with and I love the blush, highlighter, and bronzer that&#x27;s included with it.</li>
    <li> Nice make up palette bought this for my daughter, her only complaint is that she needs a primer to use with this as the eye shadow colors don&#x27;t pop without a primer.</li>
    <li> Few shadows are soft and pigmented. Need to work on building the color on the neo color eyeshadows.  The shimmer blush has chunky shimmer and a bit chalky. My favorites are the matte blush and bronzer which I use as a blush because it&#x27;s too light for my tan complexion, black,silver,red,fuchsia,gold and shimmer blue eyeshadows. Will recommend if it&#x27;s on sale only and you want to try out and work with it. Otherwise save a little more and get a better quality eyeshadow pallet.</li>
