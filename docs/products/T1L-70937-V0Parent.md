      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>This appears to be a good product.  </li>
      <li>It is very effective if you use as soon as you feel or discover any kind of gum lesion.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>This product is simply amazing.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice a difference with this, and it&#x27;s kind of a pain to use.</li>
      <li>It works best if you thoroughly floss, brush, use a mouthwash, and gently scrape any remaining plaque off of the teeth and gum line before applying.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and seems effective to recover your gums when they are woonded.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I love it, redued all the inflamation.....</li>
      <li>so it might take longer to be able to see some growth if it does occur.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even remember where I read about this product, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did</li>
      <li>Most of the pockets are shrinking through the repeated us of the product.  </li>
      <li>I just bought more....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried the gel</li>
      <li>By morning it&#x27;s feeling a lot better.</li>
      <li>Gengigel is an answer to many prayers with my lichen planus.  </li>
      <li>I found that mild debridement with a tea bag followed by Gengigel is quite effective for difficult-to-heal mouth lesions or ulcers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also experienced a TINY bit of gum regrowth on some of my gums.</li>
      <li>So far so good, as I think this does help sooth any irritation to the gum area.</li>
      <li>Within 24 hours of using as directed, the inflammation was significantly reduced.  </li>
      <li>Switched to original listerine, got a thotorugh cleaning from the dentist, and things are improving.  </li>
      <li>then I take a full spoon of coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I could not find Genginel locally and the GlyOxide available in the USA did not seem as effective as an alternative.</li>
      <li>It seems to work better if you use it frequently, and if you have a retainer to place over your teeth after application.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a kind of medication you will not find easily outside of Europe and a good complement to other treatments.</li>
      <li>I experienced a sudden problem on my gum next to one of my teeth.</li>
      <li>My advice is to get ready for a new regime to your daily routine to become and remain life with healthy strong gums.</li>
      <li>And, of course, make sure you&#x27;ve seen your dentist about the cause of the inflammation, if it wasn&#x27;t treatment related.</li>
      <li>It made them a nice pink color.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different things to help with the pain of cankers sores.</li>
      <li>Well this product was good enough to make it grow back.</li>
      <li>It works for more extensive gum ulcers, but it takes longer and one must be very diligent about using it.  </li>
      <li>good product but small container and takes awhile for it to show gingival improvement</li>
      <li>This gel type toothpaste seems to work exceptionally well for the deep cleaning that I have to do on a daily basis.  </li>
      <li>The main ingredient in this product does encourage your skin to hold water, so I did experience some tongue swelling at first, but that has dissipated now.</li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
      <li>Didnt really fill in the gum line but did relieve pain when applied</li>
      <li>If you have mild to moderate gum disease, I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
      <li>However, the cost seems way too high for what you get.  </li>
      <li>but its doing something because my gums are no longer sensitive and don&#x27;t bleed too much...</li>
      <li>I first used Gengigel after purchasing the product at a pharmacy in La Rochelle, France several years ago.</li>
      <li>Gengigel helps relieve the pain and has turned my gums from a bright red to a dark pink.</li>
      <li>I feel it important to have one&#x27;s teeth cleaned professionally at least four times per year because no matter how much attention you pay to your oral hygiene, problems will occur.</li>
      <li>I am 70 yrs old and have been bother by cankers sores for 50 yrs.  </li>
      <li>i wash my teeth with Colgate triple action toothpaste, then use Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda in the palm of my hand and massage it in with my tooth brush, then swish with it</li>
      <li>It is unfortunate because it is a good product.</li>
      <li>I used as directed and saw little if any change to my gums which have mild periodontal issues.  </li>
      <li>If you have severely receded gums (down to the root), this is probably not going to help them regrow, but it is definitely worth trying before having gum graft surgery.</li>
      <li>This was accomplished before my order of Genginel arrived, so now I have it for any future re-occurrence which might present itself.</li>
      <li>mouthwash after flossing and brushing soft on the gum area would do about the same</li>
      <li>it is a small tube that does not appear to be full.  </li>

<li> This was okay nothing to brag about because this to was expensive but not effective ...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks</li>
<li> First of all, this gel is rather expensive and imported to boot.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve told other friends about it.</li>
<li> However other areas of my gums have continued to recede.</li>
<li> I have a small area of sensitivity around my back molar.</li>
<li> Then after i dry my mouth and teeth a little i apply the Gengigel product with a cotton swab...</li>
<li> My sensitivity has gone down which is a plus on the receding gum teeth and the surrounding teeth where I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
<li> the company is overcharging and offering too little product.  </li>
<li> It relieved the pain and help the area heal over within a few hours.</li>
<li> Gengigel made it worse in only 5 days.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t even waste your time looking at the others because this does everything it says!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry I saw no difference in my gums, I believe a cleaning from your local dentist then  </li>
<li> The past 6 months I have been to the dentist for 4 Pockets in my gums that are rated 6.  </li>
<li> the main reason to purchase this was to put this with a q-tip on the corners of my mouth because I get painful mouth ulcers from my allery inhalers....</li>
<li> Product is hard to apply to your gums as the gel is slippery.</li>
<li> When one is almost 82 years old, annoying little things seem to pop up with increasing frequency.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if its the product alone that is working but my gums and receding gum problem is slowly healing..</li>
<li> I cannot believe that, and those suckers are so painful!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> gaps are slowly diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with inflamed, painful gums to provide relief and help speed healing.</li>
<li> I am very sorry that this product was not what I expected and that I cannot recommend it.</li>
<li> It was not cheap and I am a bit disappointed in it.</li>
<li> I like to use it 3 - 4 times a day, although that equates to about 1 tube a month, which can get expensive.</li>
<li> I was desperate because my gums continue to recede and the roots of my teeth are showing.  </li>
<li> Bad decision to try totreat gum problems with online purchase.  </li>
<li> Inflammation along the gum line on one side of my lower jaw was painful when trying to brush my teeth and eat.</li>
<li> In that my Dentist was in America, but I was in France, I sought relief from this annoying problem.</li>
<li> Based on the claims that were made for this product, I have to say I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Product is hard to apply to your gums as the gel is slippery. I have not noticed any change in my gums. I apply twice a day.</li>
    <li> good product but small container and takes awhile for it to show gingival improvement</li>
    <li> Got this to try to see if I could get any gum growth with it since I have 2 teeth that show receding gums. I can see a change in the sensitivity but haven&#x27;t seen a change in growth yet. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks so it might take longer to be able to see some growth if it does occur. My sensitivity has gone down which is a plus on the receding gum teeth and the surrounding teeth where I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference with this, and it&#x27;s kind of a pain to use.</li>
    <li> Based on the claims that were made for this product, I have to say I was very disappointed.  First of all, this gel is rather expensive and imported to boot.  I used as directed and saw little if any change to my gums which have mild periodontal issues.  I kept hoping there would be some residual effects but there weren&#x27;t.  I am very sorry that this product was not what I expected and that I cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I have a small area of sensitivity around my back molar. I dry the spot with a cotton ball and place a dab of this on at night. By morning it&#x27;s feeling a lot better. It does not have a numbing agent.</li>
    <li> Didnt really fill in the gum line but did relieve pain when applied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I saw no difference in my gums, I believe a cleaning from your local dentist then  mouthwash after flossing and brushing soft on the gum area would do about the same</li>

    <li> The past 6 months I have been to the dentist for 4 Pockets in my gums that are rated 6.  The dentist wanted me to have an antibiotic put in my gums which is Arestin.  I decided to get the gengigel, and I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for several weeks.  Today I went back to have my gums check, and I only had 1 pocket in my gum rated 6.</li>
    <li> Inflammation along the gum line on one side of my lower jaw was painful when trying to brush my teeth and eat. I already had a dental appointment scheduled for 2 weeks away, &amp; didn&#x27;t want to call in for an emergency appt. I don&#x27;t even remember where I read about this product, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. Within 24 hours of using as directed, the inflammation was significantly reduced.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with inflamed, painful gums to provide relief and help speed healing. And, of course, make sure you&#x27;ve seen your dentist about the cause of the inflammation, if it wasn&#x27;t treatment related.</li>
    <li> I like the product.... I am not sure how its working exactly as I have only been using it for about a month. but its doing something because my gums are no longer sensitive and don&#x27;t bleed too much... It&#x27;s hard to tell if its the product alone that is working but my gums and receding gum problem is slowly healing.. i wash my teeth with Colgate triple action toothpaste, then use Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda in the palm of my hand and massage it in with my tooth brush, then swish with it then I take a full spoon of coconut oil. Then after i dry my mouth and teeth a little i apply the Gengigel product with a cotton swab... So could be a combination of all these things working but its working... It&#x27;s all that matters :D</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing.  Cured the gum infection within a couple of days, and healing has begun.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and seems effective to recover your gums when they are woonded.&lt;br /&gt;It is a kind of medication you will not find easily outside of Europe and a good complement to other treatments.</li>
    <li> I had canker sores from switching from smoking to e-cigarettes. This product had a good rating so I tried it. It didn&#x27;t do anything to help my sore mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I found it ineffective.</li>
    <li> Product does not work.  Period.  Bad decision to try totreat gum problems with online purchase.  Switched to original listerine, got a thotorugh cleaning from the dentist, and things are improving.  Gengigel made it worse in only 5 days.</li>
    <li> Works great to relieve burning gums/ sensitivity. It made them a nice pink color. It did not grow the gums back but it did stop the receding in its tracks.</li>
    <li> Worked for my wife. A piece of her gum was lasered by a dentist who didn&#x27;t know what he was doing. Well this product was good enough to make it grow back. Thank goodness. If not I would of never heard the end of it!</li>
    <li> Currently in use, just started, awaiting results</li>
    <li> Best thing for gum disease or oral surgery!!!  Stop the pain and helps healing.</li>
    <li> It is the best cure for cankers sores that I have used.  I am 70 yrs old and have been bother by cankers sores for 50 yrs.  I have tried many different things to help with the pain of cankers sores. This is the best&lt;br /&gt;I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I grind my teeth at night, and even though I wear a retainer, my gums still recede. Gengigel helps relieve the pain and has turned my gums from a bright red to a dark pink. I&#x27;ve also experienced a TINY bit of gum regrowth on some of my gums. However other areas of my gums have continued to recede. The main ingredient in this product does encourage your skin to hold water, so I did experience some tongue swelling at first, but that has dissipated now. If you do have gingivitis or gum recession, I would recommend this product. It seems to work better if you use it frequently, and if you have a retainer to place over your teeth after application. Otherwise the gel is washed away by saliva after about 10 minutes. I like to use it 3 - 4 times a day, although that equates to about 1 tube a month, which can get expensive. It works best if you thoroughly floss, brush, use a mouthwash, and gently scrape any remaining plaque off of the teeth and gum line before applying. If you have severely receded gums (down to the root), this is probably not going to help them regrow, but it is definitely worth trying before having gum graft surgery.</li>
    <li> I first used Gengigel after purchasing the product at a pharmacy in La Rochelle, France several years ago. I experienced a sudden problem on my gum next to one of my teeth. In that my Dentist was in America, but I was in France, I sought relief from this annoying problem. The product worked for me then and the problem never reoccurred, until recently when I had a similar problem. I could not find Genginel locally and the GlyOxide available in the USA did not seem as effective as an alternative. My current problem was resolved with a one-week treatment with Amoxicillen. This was accomplished before my order of Genginel arrived, so now I have it for any future re-occurrence which might present itself. Sometimes, notwithstanding constant brushing, flossing, proxy-brushing and massaging, one&#x27;s gums react systemically and become irritated and infected. I feel it important to have one&#x27;s teeth cleaned professionally at least four times per year because no matter how much attention you pay to your oral hygiene, problems will occur. I also believe that C--enzyme Q-10 supplementation is helpful, especially if you are taking statin drugs. When one is almost 82 years old, annoying little things seem to pop up with increasing frequency. Don&#x27;t ignore them; pay attention and react to them!</li>
    <li> This was okay nothing to brag about because this to was expensive but not effective ... Its promised to help with receding gums if applied I did as it was instructed and there was no change to my gums...</li>
    <li> Yes the gum line is stronger...you must use it as recommended to notice immediate results.  My advice is to get ready for a new regime to your daily routine to become and remain life with healthy strong gums.</li>
    <li> I have used this about 6 times and find it does nothing at all for gum soreness or root sensitivity.  It was not cheap and I am a bit disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is very effective if you use as soon as you feel or discover any kind of gum lesion.  It works for more extensive gum ulcers, but it takes longer and one must be very diligent about using it.  I agree with one review that it works well if applied at night.  I found that mild debridement with a tea bag followed by Gengigel is quite effective for difficult-to-heal mouth lesions or ulcers.</li>
    <li> This gel type toothpaste seems to work exceptionally well for the deep cleaning that I have to do on a daily basis.  Most of the pockets are shrinking through the repeated us of the product.  If you have mild to moderate gum disease, I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This appears to be a good product.  However, the cost seems way too high for what you get.  it is a small tube that does not appear to be full.  the company is overcharging and offering too little product.  It is unfortunate because it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I took a risk and bought this and now  I just bought more.... Don&#x27;t even waste your time looking at the others because this does everything it says!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are always swollen because my bite is off so I tried this and I am so glad I did, I love it, redued all the inflamation.....BUTTTTT the main reason to purchase this was to put this with a q-tip on the corners of my mouth because I get painful mouth ulcers from my allery inhalers....I have not had an ulcer in 5 weeks of using this I cannot believe that, and those suckers are so painful!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gengigel is an answer to many prayers with my lichen planus.  It is the only thing that worked and it continues to work. I&#x27;ve told other friends about it. It works so wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the biggest skeptic about this product, but I went ahead and gave it a try anyway.  I was desperate because my gums continue to recede and the roots of my teeth are showing.  I&#x27;m glad I tried the gel because by the 3rd day (yes, the 3rd day!), I could see a big difference in my gum lines.</li>
    <li> So far so good, as I think this does help sooth any irritation to the gum area.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;It is working; gums starting to look healthier (pink); not bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;My gaps are slowly diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;You definitely have to stick to your oral hygiene regiment and you will start to see results from this product.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
</ol>
