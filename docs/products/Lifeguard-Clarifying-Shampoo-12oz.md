      <li>I can honestly say this did not work on their hair at all.</li>
      <li>It has a gentle and very pleasant smell.</li>

      <li>Got her safe I suppose.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the effect it had on my hair because the scent was too overwhelming.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest opinion about it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it-</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>After just one use, my daughter&#x27;s hair was clean from the pool chlorine!</li>
      <li>this cleans the icky stuff off and after adding Dove Conditioner - my hair feels great!</li>
      <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but hair is very clean when you are finished.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair fresh &amp; clean from chlorine &amp; salt water.</li>
      <li>We recently moved to a warm weather climate and the kids swim at the pool and beach a lot.</li>
      <li>I love that it is natural and does not dry out their hair like many of the clarifying chlorine removal shampoos.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but we ordered a different product from another manufacturer which we now prefer.</li>
      <li>Nice product, just not sure why all the packaging and huge box for one bottle of shampoo.</li>
      <li>At first, we were enchanted--castles, fairy tales, what&#x27;s not to like.  </li>
      <li>My hair really feels clean, SUPER SOFT and NOT chemical laden.</li>
      <li>I also use this on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s longer hair and it keeps her locks clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This takes out the chlorine, the ocean salt, and even works on hair that has too much product build up.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, I much prefer this shampoo.</li>
      <li>takes too much per shampoo to get a lather.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
      <li>Decent shampoo.</li>
      <li>This shampoo works well for removing the chlorine and salt from my hair after swimming and has a very light, clean, pleasant scent, unlike Ultra-Swim, which may work well, but just plain stinks to me.</li>
      <li>I love the rosemary conditioning spray this company makes and use it everyday.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a swimmer and was looking for new swim shampoo</li>
      <li>We live in Florida</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
      <li>super dry</li>
      <li>Gentle enough and the chlorine out of my hair.</li>
      <li>They swim frequently during the summer.  </li>
      <li>This is the only swimmers shampoo we have found that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of natural oils while removing the chlorine.</li>

<li> Washed several times also left it in in at least 10 min each time.</li>
<li> This product did not remove the green from my daughters blonde hair.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shampoos, but I can look past that.</li>
<li> This took their hair from dry, brittle, and dirty to shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
<li> Her hair isn&#x27;t green.</li>
<li> My daughter is swimming a lot this summer in a pool but is a flower girl this fall in two weddings I saw her hair turning green and ordered this.</li>

<li> Still smelled chlorine :/</li>
<li> so we use it at least three times per week and would recommend it to anyone who has children who swim.</li>
<li> Says no stings, but my daughter complained so I used it myself</li>
<li> I swim 3 times a week for an hour each time - and it was getting badly coated and weird feeling -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Kind of bummed. Washed several times with this (in the same washing) rinsed still smelled chlorine. Washed again. Still smelled chlorine :/ made daughters hair super dry</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really like it.  bought another product after.  takes too much per shampoo to get a lather.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this shampoo after I began swimming in the swimming pool. She said she could feel the chlorine deposits on my hair. The next time she saw me after I began using this shampoo on the days I swim, she said she no longer could feel the chlorine residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the cleansing properties of this shampoo it smells great. It has a gentle and very pleasant smell. The label says that this is \\&quot;hair care for Children\\&quot; but it works well for adults as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of this shampoo. It makes me feel pampered and like I am in paradise! My hair really feels clean, SUPER SOFT and NOT chemical laden. It takes some time to get used to it not foaming up though if you are used to SLS shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle in exchange for my honest opinion about it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well for removing the chlorine and salt from my hair after swimming and has a very light, clean, pleasant scent, unlike Ultra-Swim, which may work well, but just plain stinks to me. Therefore, I much prefer this shampoo. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lather up like other shampoos, but I can look past that.</li>
    <li> At first, we were enchanted--castles, fairy tales, what&#x27;s not to like.  Says no stings, but my daughter complained so I used it myself and it does hurt if you get it in your eyes.  Also, didn&#x27;t help with the post-swim &amp;#34;haystack hair&amp;#34; we were struggling with.  It&#x27;s ok, but we ordered a different product from another manufacturer which we now prefer.</li>
    <li> We like this shampoo!  Keeps my little swimmers from getting that dried out starchy feeling hair!</li>
    <li> This product did not remove the green from my daughters blonde hair. Washed several times also left it in in at least 10 min each time. Will not buy this product or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> We tried using this on two of my granddaughters&#x27; hair.  They swim frequently during the summer.  I can honestly say this did not work on their hair at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only swimmers shampoo we have found that doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of natural oils while removing the chlorine. My daughters swim year around so we use it at least three times per week and would recommend it to anyone who has children who swim.</li>
    <li> I lap swim 1-2 times per week. Regular shampoo made my hair tangled and it was starting to feel dry from all the chlorine. I wanted a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shampoo (in terms of ingredients) that would help treat my hair after swimming, and I came across this shampoo. I absolutely love it- it smells awesome, I appreciate the ingredients, and it definitely makes my hair feel nourished after swimming!</li>
    <li> My daughter is swimming a lot this summer in a pool but is a flower girl this fall in two weddings I saw her hair turning green and ordered this. Her hair isn&#x27;t green.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Works great to remove the chlorine residue from hair</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  Lice around school and tangled hair, Fairy Tales takes care of both.  It even helps manage my daughters unruly wisps.</li>
    <li> I love the rosemary conditioning spray this company makes and use it everyday. I&#x27;m a swimmer and was looking for new swim shampoo so I ordered this. I used this product once and I can&#x27;t use it again. The scent is too similar to the smell of porto-pottie fluid. I can&#x27;t speak to the effect it had on my hair because the scent was too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Great summer hair care product for kids that swim!  Leaves hair fresh &amp; clean from chlorine &amp; salt water. We use it along with the Lemon-Aid Conditioner and Coco Cabana Leave in Sun Spray. Nice set to have if spending time at pool or beach.</li>
    <li> Gentle enough and the chlorine out of my hair.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this shampoo several times and after each time her hair feels like straw.  Will not be using it again.</li>
    <li> We live in Florida so my kids swim all summer.  This takes out the chlorine, the ocean salt, and even works on hair that has too much product build up.  I use it every summer and keep it handy.  One bottle lasts all summer because we use it only twice a week. But, it is drying so put in a good conditioner when you are done.  Also it doesn&#x27;t lather up much, but hair is very clean when you are finished.  Smells great, too.</li>
    <li> Cleans the hair well.</li>
    <li> Best nice smelling gentle clarifying Shampoo,  we love it!  If you have not used do not miss out order and try you will be hooked!  Nice product extremely happy!</li>
    <li> I swim 3 times a week for an hour each time - and it was getting badly coated and weird feeling - this cleans the icky stuff off and after adding Dove Conditioner - my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> My son swims twice a week in the fall/winter/spring and is in the pool every day during the summer.  This keeps his hair looking healthy and moisturized.  It smells great and lathers nicely.  I also use this on my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s longer hair and it keeps her locks clean and moisturized.  I love that it is natural and does not dry out their hair like many of the clarifying chlorine removal shampoos.</li>
    <li> After just one use, my daughter&#x27;s hair was clean from the pool chlorine! This is the best clarifying shampoo that I&#x27;ve been able to find and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great product worked awesome with my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner. The smell alone has sold me but it also works great and leaves our hair feeling great. I use it on both my daughters and myself. I have tried for other brands to remove chlorine and nothing works as well as this! We love the lemon-aid conditioner too! A great combination and we never leave home without them for showering after swimming at the pool!</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo. Definitely pick up the conditioner to go along with it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, just not sure why all the packaging and huge box for one bottle of shampoo. Got her safe I suppose.</li>
    <li> We recently moved to a warm weather climate and the kids swim at the pool and beach a lot. This took their hair from dry, brittle, and dirty to shiny, soft and manageable. We use with Lemon-Aid Conditioner and are very happy with the results.</li>
