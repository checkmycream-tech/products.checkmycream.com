<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The wig is nice, looks like real hair but the head looks great with the wig.</li>
    <li> Excellent wig for my mannequin. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Always get complimented on my hair when wearing these. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat them. The wigs are thick and easy to maintain. They don&#x27;t look fake and super shiny. Love it.</li>
    <li> I got this a day early it&#x27;s beautiful I feel Inlove as soon as I put it on it did need a little styling because there was no volume but a little spray did wonders I will be re buying</li>
    <li> I expected the wig to look really fake when I first ordered it, but once I got it, I was surprised as how realistic it looks. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s a really nice wig for it&#x27;s price. The only downside is that it sheds a lot. It&#x27;s really long, but you can always trim it down a bit. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> Awesome wig! Came bastet than expected But is it heat resistant Towards the sun?</li>
    <li> nothing like photo there a bangs and photos shows no bangs will not buy again</li>
    <li> I love the wig. I gave it 4 stars. The top is too full. But other than that I like it. It gave me back my confidence, since I have boy short hair. I am trying to let my hair grow. So this is good for any back up. I am feeling sexy again. My hair was never this long so I was having fun with it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this for my fairy outfit. Seems to get knotty easily. But hey it was only like 15 $ when I got it. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the wig very much except when i rinse it then put a pickthrough it to get tangles out the ends look more and more dead</li>
    <li> Love this wig!!! Absolutely worth the buy. I have been growing my hair out after cutting it short. This wig looks and feels real. I have had so many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the light brown curly wig but it came very dark. I think I must have gotten the dark brown instead of the light brown by mistake even though the box is labeled light brown. The wig itself is very soft and beautiful, I just wish it was the light brown like I had ordered.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely gorgeous! everyone thought it was real and that I had extensions because well this is what my hair looks like naturally I just like to mess with it and ended up frying it and yeah....only complaint is the top of the wig come together at a point, not a natural looking split like the photos show, so it looks a little strange. and the back tangles really easy. I cut about 4 inches off, not because of the tangle but because it was a little too unrealistic to pull off daily since I have a little past shoulder length now. I&#x27;ll upload photos later. apparently johnson baby detangler works good, ill try that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made the mistake many times of thinking cheap wigs from Halloween stores would be worth the money and gotten burned every time. I was nervous when I saw how cheap this wig was, but after looking through the reviews decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! It came very neatly packaged, one quick touch up with the comb and the very few tangles came right out. It looks and feels like real hair, and I feel awesome wearing it! Will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> I can start off by saying that the length &amp; color is beautiful! But i dont want the wig because it tangles too much and sheds a lot! The top portion of the wig looks too fake &amp; shiny, but then again the wig is $17, so i cant complain! Its only good to wear 1 day, ofcourse on a weekend &amp; not on a weekday! So im thinkin of returning it! Very upset cuz i wanted to wear it on new years! I might cut off the front portion, but that wint change the fact that it tangles &amp; sheds:(</li>
    <li> Excellent wig!  Unbelievable quality for such a low price!  Shipped from America so didn&#x27;t take forever to receive.  The hair fiber is very soft and easy to comb through.  Cap is well constructed.  Density of hair is perfect too.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> great! very inexpensive and its a great product!!!</li>
    <li> This wig is very long and the quality is much better then that you buy for Halloween. It came with the wig cap and a wig comb that helped to shape the hair once taken from the package. Would be able to wear in public if you wanted and people would not know it was a wig.</li>
    <li> One of my best wigs. Better than a $100 wig I have. And you get a comb and cap! For $17!  Buy it! Just wish they sold more on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;ve been cosplaying for four years now. I&#x27;ve ordered countless wigs from amazon, and they&#x27;ve never seized to be as good, if not more, as I expect.&lt;br /&gt;  I ordered a dark brown wig a few months back over my mom&#x27;s account, and recently bought a light brown for my friend. We&#x27;re going to cosplay female versions of Castiel and Dean Winchester. These wigs are very soft, and beautifully styled. They&#x27;re very natural looking. The only complaint I have is that  the light brown wig was thinner than the dark brown. But totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;on the right of the photo, is my friend with the light brown wig. The left, is me with the dark brown wig</li>
    <li> Very cute but gets tangle very easy</li>
    <li> As a drag queen who constantly performs and flips their hair back and forth at the club every weekend, this wig overall pleased me. There are intructions on how to wash it in case it gets too knotted because that was a big problem I had. But aside from the knotting, it looks and feels like real hair which makes it an ideal wig!</li>
    <li> this wig looks nothing like the picture ot looks like a rats nest and its so big and puffy and fake looking a big waste of money it got one star only because i had to rate it to post it never came in a box just a clear plastic bag no cap no comb so not worth the money</li>
    <li> Perfect, awesome! Love it!</li>
    <li> To begin this review, let me just say, OH MY GOD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this today, and I put it on as soon as I got it inside. Not only is it super silky soft, but, it perfectly matches my natural hair color. It looks so real I honestly can&#x27;t believe I paid so little for it. There are a few cons I can list immediately, but, they&#x27;re nothing major, as this wig is primarily going to be for work since I intend to dye my hair blue. At the top center, there is a very small circle where you can see most of the fibers are coming out from. However it&#x27;s not really noticeable, and can easily be covered if you mess around with it gently. The bangs aren&#x27;t exactly like the picture on me, think more of The Little Mermaid Ariel bangs. It also appears to be slightly thinner, as the curls aren&#x27;t separated, which I do NOT recommend trying to do, as it looks to be easily tangled. It came exactly as described, and the little comb doesn&#x27;t pull out the curls. The shine looks completely natural, and as I said, it looks very real. Towards the end of the strands, it seems a bit like split ends, not noticeable, but to me, it makes it more believable. For storage, to avoid any tangling or ruining the wig, I advise hanging it in some way, where it won&#x27;t be disturbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wig, and will come back to edit my review after a month, should I find anything note-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since I first pictured the wig, and I did run it into the ground, mostly for lack of proper care. The one con I found is how easily this wig tangles, and that it tangles horribly. If you want this wig to last, proper care should be taken of it. After a while the ends started to look ratty, so I washed and flat ironed it - good as new. And yes, you read right, I flat ironed it! I strongly advise against using a curling iron, because holding the heat against this fiber for longer than 3 seconds would surely melt it. I set my flat iron at 380 degrees, and other than an odd smell, had no trouble with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get compliments when I wear it, and unless I&#x27;m being looked at by a woman who knows wigs, most think I just went back to my natural color and got extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I did receive the long black straight wig, and I am just as pleased with the last two. It looks a little frizzy, probably from sliding around in the netting its wrapped in. A quick comb and it&#x27;ll be just as good as the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, I am pleased with the fast shipping, and the quality I get for my dollar.than an odd smell, had no trouble with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get compliments when I wear it, and unless I&#x27;m being looked at by a woman who knows wigs, most think I just went back to my natural color and got extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I did receive the long black straight wig, and I am just as pleased with the last two.

    <li> Beatiful wig. Better than the picture, very soft and realistic. I had to cut it for a character and really didn&#x27;t want to because of how nice the wig is.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for many different wigs in this price range, I settled on this one. So glad that I did! It is amazingly long, and the ringlets are beautiful. It does not look thin, and the bangs look beautiful and natural. It does tangle if you are not gentle with it, and I don&#x27;t think there is much you can do to untangle it and preserve the ringlets. Aside from that, there is nothing more I could have asked for in a Halloween wig! Even had several new acquaintances convinced it was my real hair, and then couldn&#x27;t get them to believe the wig was not made of genuine hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> This wig was not as good as some of the others I have bought. It began to frizz fairly quickly even though I kept it dry. It also tends to get knots in it making brushing problematic. After a while, the hairs began falling out as well. Overall, it&#x27;s good for a few uses but toss is after that.</li>
    <li> I  am absolutely in love with this wig.I have really short hair now going from really long hair. I was happy to put it on and have long hair again. I definitely recommend this way to anyone yes it does tangle easily but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s easily fixed 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> Sent it back the same day. I just wanted to see how good these wigs actually are and their horrible. The wig was tangled too.</li>
    <li> if ur very self conscious about it looking 100% real PLUS a newbie in buying wigs... I wont recommend it although it has a real look to it except the top is a dead give away!</li>
    <li> great for costume wear and for price. not somthing you would wear out</li>
    <li> I wore this for a costume party being a pirate wench. I wore it under a bandana and people did not even recognize me! I partied for 4 hours with this on and did not have one problem with it! It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Wig tangles and is not too realistic looking.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and hoped that it would just be comfortable, but not only was it comfortable, the realness of it far surpassed my first thoughts, will purchase from this seller again, thank you!</li>
    <li> Bought to cosplay Greg from Steven universe. Wig arrived super fast and looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Best wig! People actually thought I had colored my own hair. It has a matte finish so it looks more realistic. It&#x27;s not fake looking or shiney</li>
    <li> I love this wig! it fits comfortably! Easy to take care of! I receive so many compliments on this wig!!</li>
    <li> I order the light brown version of this but received dark brown, even the box said dark brown.  However after trying it on, I have decided to keep it because I do like the color, style and length.  I will try to order the light brown again though.</li>
    <li> It just like imagine that it would be. Excelent material and the quality is really good. I just love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying this is my first wig and finally decided to just give it a try after debating purchasing and  researching other options for a few weeks!  I am experiencing some temporary *hopefully* hair loss due to a medication I was on and just couldn&#x27;t commit to spending $100&#x27;s of dollars.. With these great reviews and amazing price, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try!  I am very impressed with the look, fit and how natural this wig looks and feels.  I ordered the light brown but agree with another buyer (Nikki) that it is much darker then I expected.  The picture online does look like there are some red highlights on a light shade of brown but this is pretty dark and I see hints of black.. I double checked to make sure I ordered and received the light brown rather then medium/dark brown and it states light....  So, other then the color being a bit dark for me, this wig feels great and was a great wig to start with!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price but be careful it is really hard to get the tangles out of it without ruining the wig.</li>
    <li> Very realistic! Easy and comfortable to wear. Will order agin from this company!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. Looks a tad darker than the picture but it is light brown. it came with a wig cap and a comb which was very nice. the package was good. the hair feels and looks wonderful. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> My first time wearing wigs, it came it the cap and comb and everything. I&#x27;m in ROTC so it&#x27;s a very active lifestyle, yet I always get compliments on my hair. Looks just like the real thing, durable, and the price for such a wig is astonishing.</li>
    <li> The one that arrived was dark brown and not light brown. It is still very nice though. Looks like good quality</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ve started losing My hair and I&#x27;m considering wigs.. This is My 1st wig and I&#x27;m happy with it.. I can&#x27;t wait to order more wigs.. I was worried about the quality being so reasonable of a price but I&#x27;m happy.. It&#x27;s a Good buy..</li>
    <li> The color is really pretty.. it matches a dark brown. There are no red highlights as it appears in the picture.  I agree with the other reviewers..mess with the bangs, cut the bottom, and pull apart the curls. The very top part doesn&#x27;t have a part as it appears in the pictures, and I just got it so I&#x27;m still working on it. It would look natural if you had a hat or maybe a scarf around the top part. Overall, it&#x27;s a good wig.</li>
    <li> I got this just to have some fun. I ended up wearing it almost every day it looked completely real I got compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that it does tangle really easily.</li>
    <li> The color is more of a light brown and you don&#x27;t really see the streaky caramel  highlights (I prefer not to see streaks in my hair honestly.) The top part of the hair is nice but it&#x27;s the hair that creates the length that makes this go from a 4 star to a 2 star. it is so GROSS. Just normal wear will make this matte up. You get what you pay for. Totally worth a one or two time use... and that is it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s darker than the one pictured - more on the brownish tone ... It&#x27;s pretty though and match my natural hair color ...  I gave it a 5 cause at least the bangs are longer than the ones I got before ...  Hate short bangs... It&#x27;s inexpensive so I can&#x27;t complain :-)</li>
    <li> I like this wig. It looks realistic. However the bangs are thick and crazy so I had to seriously style this thing before actually wearing it..  it also appears darker in color than pictured.</li>
    <li> This wig is really nice and the hair is realistic for the price. The wig is very dark, I ordered the light brown and it looks brunette, it&#x27;s also very thick. I had a hard time styling it. The bangs are cute and not too long, but the thickness causes the top to look fake. Whenever I wear it, I put a hat on and others believe it&#x27;s my real hair. The cap is adjustable, but it itches quite a bit. I have purchased a real expensive wig and I didn&#x27;t have better luck with it. For the price and the quality, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Well,if it was actually \\&quot;light\\&quot; brown I would have given it 5 stars. I bought another of the same and ordered dark brown,this one is the exact same color. Didn&#x27;t bother returning it since it was so cheap. But it is comfortable,and realistic looking.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and I just love it  beautiful will be ordering more</li>
    <li> Looks just like the photo. Great quality. Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a costume party and people thought it was my real hair!  Very nice wig!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and full wig.. For the price I love it and going to buy more colors!!</li>
    <li> I have never bought a wig before, and so I was pretty skeptical... I used to have longer hair before I decided to get a pixie cut, but sometimes I really miss having my long hair so I went looking around on here, and after reading the reviews I thought, &amp;#34;why not. It&#x27;s cute, long and curly, great reviews and pictures, and it&#x27;s only 20$!&amp;#34; I got the wig yesterday and I tried it on and I swear it was so perfect. The color, the length, it looks so real I can&#x27;t believe it. I would seriously recommend this product to anyone looking for a wig!&lt;br /&gt;Lighting was weird in the picture but it&#x27;s so awesome!</li>
    <li> fitted me okay. thank you</li>
    <li> Not very thick.  Would not cover scalp.</li>
    <li> Received the package two days before the actual date I was supposed to get it, which was a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I have never owned a wig, but  I would say that this is great quality. You can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s a wig at first glance. If I were to just go shopping with this on or go out to dinner, most people wouldn&#x27;t have a clue. I just pop it on and fill in my eyebrows to look dark. I bought it because I had my hair cut really short and am in the process of growing it out. So a cheap, but quality wig like this is perfect. I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun with this!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig it was the same color as my hair so it looked super real and it was very soft like my hair</li>
    <li> Love this wig. But it tangles horribly. Once it reached that point of no return i just cut it into a short style. Now i can enjoy it longer</li>
    <li> The wig looked very fake and Halloween like . I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> The wig is very nice. Hair is very long. I just felt self concious wearing it because the hair is shiny but using some wig powder helped.  It seems like theres not too much hair in the wig and if you try styling in any way the black mesh underneath shows. There was some shedding from the wig but not excessive. But overall not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this to decorate a manikin with and it works perfectly. Very long, so if you need to you can style it or cut it to your desired style.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wig for the price. My only complaint is that I thought the wig would be two toned like the picture for Light Brown Curly, but it isn&#x27;t so all though it makes my eyes pop, it looks very fake. Otherwise this would have been a 5 star rating! But on the plus side, I have 2 wigs I need to choose from for cosplaying in and the choice is very hard. I think I may actually cut this afterwards and try it out in public. Oh, the wig is huge and I should know because I have a big head and my hair is in long braids and I can fit it all inside the wig. I did add some dry shampoo to dull down the shine, but it is really not needed. This wig is not thin and it&#x27;s not too thick. I may actually end up buying the dark brown or should I dare and buy the black... Ohhh lala!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice wig, appears well constructed, has good thickness front and back and the hair has a good weight - not as fly away as other cosplay like wigs I have purchase for vocaloid costumes for my kids.  The length is a little shorter than displayed, but it will do for the costume it was purchased for.  I am not happy with the color and expected something much lighter as depicted in the photo displayed for the item.  What was shipped looked like dark brown when I openned the package and appeared a tiny bit lighter when worn and in the sunlight as it has lighter reddish highlights.  But it is definitely dark brown not light brown as claimed.  As best as I can figure it must be the asian definition of light brown as it is made in China, but not the US definition.  I would have given it a higher rating of 4 stars if the color had been as expected.</li>
    <li> I have bought many wigs in my time and for the price, this wig is fabulous! When I am out and about, people compliment my hair, then are shocked when they find out it is a wig! I have bought 3 of these wigs because I love them so much! I gave one to a friend as a gift, and she likewise like this product. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;bangs&amp;#34; and the entire front part were awkward and weird... but with a hat on, it looked pretty real. It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;ll only wear it with a beanie or something.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig. It&#x27;s super soft and beautiful. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had ACTUALLY been light brown. It is a dark brown with some Carmel low lights.</li>
    <li> Much better quality than I expected, for the price it was perfect!</li>
    <li> This wig is very pretty I absolutely love the curls in it and how thick the hair is. The quality of this wig is surprising due to how affordable it is. I also like how the hair looks real some cheap wigs you get look shiny and fake but not this one.</li>
    <li> The color is super pretty, a lot more red tones than pictured. It is also way longer than it appears in the picture. I really like it though :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m vary new to the wig world but the quality is great vary well sewn and feels as soft as real hair the reason I&#x27;m only giving this protect one star is because the color is much much darker then then picture so if you want a new dark brown style then here it is but if your looking for something in a lighter shade then keep looking</li>
    <li> Best wig I&#x27;ve ordered online! I love everything about it and I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great and accurate color, but a little on the &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; side. Not really as thick as expected.</li>
    <li> It truly looked and felt fake.  We were content with the length but my wife couldn&#x27;t continue to wear it based on how it felt.  The up side was that it was not that expensive.  Would be great for a Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very bulky on top which makes it look fake and tangles way to easily had to chop over half off and still was a tangled mess I could only wear it in a braid with a hat on and it still looked fake</li>
    <li> La-la-la-loving it! For such a great price..I was amazed! #nomorebadhairday #forthischic #wearingthiserrryday</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; of this wig is so real looking...up close. and the feel of the material used is the same as hair stepping out of a salon. I am very happy. I now have better hair than I did before chemo..LOL! It&#x27;s awesome. I did order the light brown and received a very dark brown instead but I am liking the look of being a dark burnette.</li>
    <li> It came in great condition and the shape was the same as the picture, but I ordered the light brown and it&#x27;s definitely a dark brown with grayish-black streaks. It&#x27;s more of a dark ash brown instead of the warm light brown that I wanted. But it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying a wig and buying it without even physically seeing it made me VERY nervous. I was so amazed when I took it out of the box. It fits perfectly!! Looks and feels real!! Will be buying another one soon!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!! If you are having doubts, trust me I had mine, know that it&#x27;s really good quality and it looks amazing!!! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty decent wig for the price but it&#x27;s not the color that the description states. It ended up being a really dark brown.</li>
    <li> Its an OK wig for the money. I bought it to mess with because I&#x27;m going to be bald in a few years. Shake it out, wear a hat, it&#x27;ll look pretty real.</li>
    <li> This wig is the best synthetic wig I&#x27;ve ever owned. The hair fibers are very fine and feel great.  Due to the length and texture, it may tangle easier but I don&#x27;t see this as a con.  You just have to maintain it properly.  I would also warn that the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; is quite a bit darker than expected - also not necessarily a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one con as I see it is that the headband/cap shows through the front hair line unless you style it just right, which means it will need to hang low over your eyes.  It is good for a certain look, but again, it makes it less desirable for long-term wear.  Nevertheless, if you want to change your look for a night out, this is the perfect wig.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and has lots of hair on it, the color is great and the comb and wig cap it came with are nice as well. I also liked the packaging a lot.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I got it as an accessory for my costume, for an anime convention: I looked fabulous! I think this wig can make anyone look beautiful, such a nice color and shape! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! The seller also included a wig cap and a haircomb (for the wig) in the package, which I really appreciated, since this is the first wig I ever got.</li>
    <li> This one is my first and absolute favorite wig. It is alot pettier than I expected. The bangs are a little frizzy and it tangles if you don&#x27;t twist the curls into strands, but it is gorgeous and I think I will buy a backup because I love it so much! After cancer this is GREAT and makes me feel pretty again! Very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Please in the future please put which type of wig you bought and up load pic. Thanks. It would help. I have really short hair. And I want to grow it out. But that takes forever.  And I don&#x27;t want to buy a wig and it looking to fake. Thanks</li>
    <li> O MY GOD, O MY GOD, O MY GOD. I love this wig!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Looks better on the pictured Manikin and I got a dark brown when I actually ordered a the light brown, so I ended up giving it to my daughter who enjoys playing dress up - she gets a kick out of this wig so it&#x27;s not a complete bust on this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;~ SkyLee</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing! I wore it all day, and it felt so soft and real; but most importantly-it didn&#x27;t tangle or slip around.  Awesome! I have the MelodySusie in &#x27;long brown curly&#x27;; it&#x27;s a great wig.  If you are new to wigs, a wig cap makes all the difference in the world, and this wig includes one free.  I will say that if you get close and inspect it, you could see some of the netting through the hair, but you have to be CLOSE and really looking for it.  I have a previous wig from another amazon seller that has more hair, but sheds, tangles so easily and is too hot! The MelodySusie wig is very light and comfortable to wear and didn&#x27;t shed one hair in five hours of wear!!!  So good in fact, that I am buying another wig from them.</li>
    <li> Excellent! The wig was not hot to wear, and looked so real!</li>
    <li> I ordered light brown &amp; it looked almost blonde in the picture. No! it&#x27;s a dark warm shade of brown. It was a suprise, but I love this wig! Its soft &amp; super long. It looks SO real compared to others I&#x27;ve bought. The bangs are pretty as is, but I don&#x27;t like pushing them to the side every so often, so i cut them long, just at my eyebrows &amp; it looks great! Gives it more of a zooey deschanel look, but longer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s came really nicely packaged and the hair was so beautiful I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Looks real, feels real, my husband loved it too! I feel feminine again! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> its really pretty love the way it fasens to the scalp. best one yet</li>
    <li> Perfect! Nice and full and looks real! It gets a bit tangled but just spray a wee bit of detangler on it</li>
    <li> Amazing wigs, only problem I have is that once you brush it a few times the ends get a little funny!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a cosplay ensemble. For the price, I was genuinely surprised at the quality of the wig. I will say that the fullness isn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, considering the photo.. it only looks like that when you have ALL the hair coming over your shoulders to the front. But for a cheap costume wig that I am only going to wear with one outfit a few times a year, that is fine, I am just going to comb it out a bit and try to fluff it up some. Do note that the color was a good bit darker than it appeared to be in the photo- more of a medium brown.</li>
    <li> I get at least one compliment on it when I wear it out. It&#x27;s great quality and looks gorgeous on and off!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Was better than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I was extremely impressed with this wig! I have worn a number of wigs for shows and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ordered! It is not shiny, comes with a brush to help with tangles but does not tangle as much as most, and it has not shed at all! The color is beautiful and the top is thick. I highly recommend this wig!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig two days ago and it was supposed to come in like a week and a half but I just got the package two days later so that shipping was outstanding. The wig is thin but it is beautiful and long. I would recommend this wig definitely. Also the bangs are very long, but they can be styled fairly easily and quickly. The wig goes on in a snap and it breathes very well and is not as itchy as other wigs I&#x27;ve had. I recommend this wigs definitely.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig. Can barely tell it&#x27;s synthetic. I used some dry shampoo to get rid of shine (which compared to other wigs I&#x27;ve bought is not that bad) and trimmed a little off the bottom and cut the bangs into shape. Love the color and the way it fits. Going to order a second one today!! :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I am a wig specialist ,but I can say I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Feels almost like real hair. My sister who is going through chemo loves it!</li>
    <li> Let me start off, by saying that I&#x27;m 15 and I have a pixie cut, I don&#x27;t mind my short hair but sometimes I want to spice my look up so I wear wigs. I recently ordered this one, but my other purchase, was the dark brown color. So I&#x27;m trying something different, and by the other ones I received this wig is so life like, the curls are stunning, and it feels and looks so natural it&#x27;s unbelievable. The only big issue I have with this wig is that it does get a little tangled and matted, at the very ends, but you can always just brush that out, wash, or straighten it, and it looks brand new! It&#x27;s beautiful, and so long. I recommend this to everyone who is looking for a wig. 10/10.</li>
    <li> It looks real, a little curlier at the ends than in the picture but it is dark brown. I dont care because it was cheap, seems decent quality (really soft) and I am only going to wear it occasionally. Bummed though about the color!</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig, looks great.</li>
    <li> Great wig. Loved the color.  It is very long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and it comes to my hips.  But I like it when I need an up-do. It does knot easily and I was a little sad when I brushed out the curls, but if i took the time i could get them back.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price asked. Like it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this wig. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve lost the battle with bleach this summer and had to do the big chop! This wig has totally filled my long hair void!!</li>
