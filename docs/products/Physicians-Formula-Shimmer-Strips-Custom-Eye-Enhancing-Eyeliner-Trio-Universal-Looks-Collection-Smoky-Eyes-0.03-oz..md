      <li>So happy I found them.</li>
      <li>Great staying power, wonderful texture and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>so called &#x27;gel eye liners&#x27; , but they never work as good as my expectation--</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Not to mention the lovely price!</li>
      <li>Good eyeliner...stays on longer than most.  </li>
      <li>Some are nice.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply</li>
      <li>This is the BEST eye liner I&#x27;ve ever had so far.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner I have ever owned for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Always love these eye liners.</li>
      <li>Could stay on a bit better.</li>
      <li>Charcoal: smokey, shimmery, and fantastic!</li>
      <li>Taken to UPS with the appropriate label provided through Amazon returns.</li>
      <li>I wear this one for a whole day in office and get out for a happy hour after work, but it&#x27;s still in good condition and not messy at all!!!</li>
      <li>Defenitely worth it!!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Black: smooth and great!</li>
      <li>its really good actually.</li>
      <li>I love wearing a silver smokey eye look, so I have used silver eyeliners from many other brands.</li>
      <li>The light grey is not substantial at all, mostly just useful for shimmer effect.</li>
      <li>Dark shades go on better then the light.  </li>
      <li>Love this product just wish I could buy them individually.</li>
      <li>The price was pretty reasonable, too.</li>
      <li>black is the most useful and I ran out of this first.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would recommend this set because the two darker colors are so great that I&#x27;ve been using them almost everyday.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute smoothest eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The rest doesn&#x27;t really look well unless it&#x27;s on the bottom lid.</li>
      <li>Too much tugging to achieve color.  </li>
      <li>The lighter color is great for filling in thin spots in the brow.</li>
      <li>Very glam colors.  </li>
      <li>I love the black and the charcoal colored pencils so much!</li>
      <li>If you are very allergic to eye makeup, this is a decent inexpensive alternative.</li>
      <li>Also the only one I felt comfortable using on the top of my eyes is the black.</li>
      <li>Since I like dark and thin eyelines, I love the eyeliners which can easily get color on my eye lid without drawing over and over again.  </li>
      <li>As a frequent eye liner user, I&#x27;m applying these on my eyes on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>It is barely visible when applied.</li>

    <li> As described, works as it should.</li>
    <li> its really good actually. mines didn&#x27;t dry out and it makes my eyes sparkle when I use the black and silver. The only thing is that I thought the middle one was going to be like dark gray but it&#x27;s closer to the silver. Also the only one I felt comfortable using on the top of my eyes is the black. The rest doesn&#x27;t really look well unless it&#x27;s on the bottom lid.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute smoothest eyeliner I have ever used. My only complaint is it does have some artificial ingredients. But over all a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This is great eyeliner, both my daughters and myself use it, lasts a lot longer than any I have tried.</li>
    <li> Always love these eye liners. Easy to use. I never end up using all the colors bc it&#x27;s not daily color.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever owned for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are automatic and no need to sharpen&lt;br /&gt;2. ***Minimal smudging - this is what sets it apart from other eyeliners I&#x27;ve used***&lt;br /&gt;3. Very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;4. Truly waterproof&lt;br /&gt;5. Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;6. Stays on until you remove it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black is the most useful and I ran out of this first. It probably took me from a few months to half a year? This is probably the only part I wish could be improved, that they would sell the black alone. I bought the Definer Automatic Eye Pencil also by Physicians Formula which is only black, but it seems different and I don&#x27;t like it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention before - the black is quite dark, the dark grey is also pretty dark but slightly lighter than the black. The light grey is not substantial at all, mostly just useful for shimmer effect.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. The price was pretty reasonable, too. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Dried out. Did not line my eyelids. Returned. Findng eyeliner for hazel eyes is difficult and I thought I would give this a try but it was not satisfactory so I returned it. Taken to UPS with the appropriate label provided through Amazon returns.</li>
    <li> Very glam colors.  All colors show up on my olive skin.</li>
    <li> These are the best eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve ever used. They are better than all the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried and I will definitely reorder them as needed. So happy I found them. Great staying power, wonderful texture and easy to apply. They are perfection.</li>
    <li> I love the black and the charcoal colored pencils so much! However, I was disappointed with the silver one. It is barely visible when applied. I love wearing a silver smokey eye look, so I have used silver eyeliners from many other brands. I&#x27;ve never had that problem with other brands. Black: smooth and great! Charcoal: smokey, shimmery, and fantastic! Silver: too light, almost invisible, and very disappointing. Overall, I would recommend this set because the two darker colors are so great that I&#x27;ve been using them almost everyday.</li>
    <li> Good eyeliner...stays on longer than most.  The lighter color is great for filling in thin spots in the brow.</li>
    <li> If you are very allergic to eye makeup, this is a decent inexpensive alternative. Tends to go on a little heavy for my taste, but you can smudge with your finger to soften the look a bit. I like the built in sharpener.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eye liner I&#x27;ve ever had so far. As a frequent eye liner user, I&#x27;m applying these on my eyes on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve used Lancome, Shu Umera, Urban Decay, CDP, Bobbi Brown and numerous other so called &#x27;gel eye liners&#x27; , but they never work as good as my expectation-- they are either difficult to apply or easy to get blurred.

I wear this one for a whole day in office and get out for a happy hour after work, but it&#x27;s still in good condition and not messy at all!!! Not to mention the lovely price! Defenitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great Price.</li>
    <li> Love this product just wish I could buy them individually.</li>
    <li> Dark shades go on better then the light.  Too much tugging to achieve color.  Some are nice.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I always buy this brand because they do not test on animals!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Could stay on a bit better.</li>
