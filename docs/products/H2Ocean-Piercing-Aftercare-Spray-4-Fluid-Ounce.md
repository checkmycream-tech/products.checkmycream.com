      <li>- I hope YOU have as great a success with it as I have</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 100% sure that my piercings would be infected if not for spray.</li>

      <li>so I&#x27;m okay</li>
      <li>This solution did more for me than the dial soap solution recommended to me by the piercer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for all of my piercings for many, many years</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really works! Helps my piercings and makes them feel clean after a long day.</li>
    <li> Spray can leaks badly - wasting a lot of product</li>
    <li> As there are not that many products for after care available, this one is handy and useful, has no pitfalls and is quite acceptable in price.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by a friend. Loved it! Highly recommend it to anyone with new piercings</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with H2Ocean. It&#x27;s great for fresh piercings and also great for older piercings. I have my rook pierced and when I first got it done, my cartilage did not agree with the jewelry and just stayed red and swollen for a few months. Every day I would nurse it with H2Oean on a q-tip, making sure I carefully cleaned it. Eventually, my cartilage healed great and there is no more puss/crust/redness/irritation. The same thing happened with my daith piercing which is in my cartilage as well. Keloid bumps were also common in my cartilage piercings, and for those, I used tea tree oil + H2Ocean for cleaning for about a month and the bumps went away.</li>
    <li> Great for my piercing.  Portable which helped since I wasn&#x27;t able to soak it as often!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!! Perfect for piercing addicts who are a little lazy like myself! lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this to help heal all my piercings and had great results. It&#x27;s a really good product. Definitely recommended for all piercings.</li>
    <li> I have six piercings right now. My most recent was a week ago, my nose piercing, and H2Ocean is my main form of aftercare. It was recommended by my piercer, and cleans the piercings really well. I will be using it when I eventually get my rook done :)</li>
    <li> I used this after I got a double eye brow piercing and it healed nice and fast thanks to this stuff</li>
    <li> My daughter used it for her industrial piercing and it helped get rid of her keloid.  It&#x27;s fast and easy for her to use.  Much easier than the process we were using before in making our own salt water.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I used it for my nose piercing and it helped when other things didn&#x27;t it traditional sea salt soaks didn&#x27;t. I love the convience of it.</li>
    <li> I got my nose pierced in the beginning of October and a few weeks later, my nose developed something that looked like a pimple after I got it caught on my towel. I tried EVERYTHING to get rid of it and nothing worked. I was so scared I&#x27;d have to see my family that I hadn&#x27;t seen in months for Thanksgiving with an awful bump on my nose. After accidentally finding this product, I decided to try it. IT WORKED!!! Give it about 3 days and it will be completely healed. Even though there isn&#x27;t a bump anymore, I still use it to prevent anything else from happening. It definitely works better than you making a sea salt mix yourself.</li>
    <li> I order a 4oz can on July 14, 2013. I just got my belly and helix piercing on july 13. I figured the small can (1.5 oz) wasn&#x27;t going to last me and I was right. It ran out on July 15. Plus on that day, I accidentally hit my helix piercing....boy !!!! It hurt so bad. It started bleeding a little and the next morning I had crusties around my piercing. Today, July 17, the can came in. I was so happy cause I needed to soothe my ear from being all pissy 😥 when I clean it, it stop throbbing and clean all the crusty yuck stuff off. I recommend h2ocean ! Especially from this company. It only took 3 days just get to my house ! Real fast. The only problem I had with the can is that the nozzle was off...but it was easy to put back on so I&#x27;m okay ☺ get the 4oz can !!!</li>
    <li> Well my ear hasn&#x27;t gotten infected yet so I&#x27;m happy...  its a big bottle for one piercing so I guess you can have it for a while</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  If you&#x27;re stretching, especially with sensitive ears, this is a must.  I ordered this product after I had a bad reaction to what I think we&#x27;re actually nickel (not steel) plugs gauging up from a 2g to a 0g.  My ears were seriously wratched, I had to gauge back down, switched to glass plugs, was making my own salt solution a few times a day which has worked fine on my other piercings (nose, nipple) to no avail.  Eventually I used antibiotic ointment and they calmed down for a few weeks only to flare back up again.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if other people have experienced this problem but my ears were weeping constantly and crusting on the very tender skin behind my ears to a point where they were very painful and raw, and after a week showed no signs of healing.  I&#x27;m stubborn, didn&#x27;t want to give up because I&#x27;ve been gauging for over six months now.  H2Ocean was my last attempt before I gave up the ghost, and after a few days my ears are 80% better and well on their way to healing completely for the first time in months.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how thankful I am for this product- enough to write my first review!  Highly recommended- only caveat- the spray comes out a little strong, definitely want to work it around with some CLEAN fingers...and it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s a whole lot in this container.  That being said, I will absolutely be keeping this on hand as I continue to gauge.  Fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well.  I highly recommend this for any piercing.</li>
    <li> Bought this to heal an industrial piercing. I healed super fast and never got infected. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Second can in two weeks that has a messed up nozzle. When i push it down it sticks and sprays everywhere even ripping the cap off still has a lock on and it continues to spray everywhere. The solution works great not so fond of the spayer nozzle</li>
    <li> much more affordable than buying from the mall. essential for post piercing care</li>
    <li> Fast delivery ; it helps with the itching and slight pain for my dermal and cartilage piercings even after . aids in healing them faster too</li>
    <li> Really great for scars and hemmoroids!</li>
    <li> Always works well to clean any piercing I get!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my nose peircing</li>
    <li> I got this product for two cartlidge piercings after my piercer recommended it.  While I followed the instructions from my piercer diligently, this product dried out my ears and ultimately my piercings got infected to the point I had to take antibiotics and remove them.  I never touched the jewelry without clean hands and always had clean sleeping surfaces so I am not sure how it got infected unnless the drying effect this product had on my skin caused it.  If your skin dries easily, I would ask your piercer for an alternative product because this left my skin dry and flaky all around the piercing even though I made sure to wipe off excess and only apply right around the piercing.  Using it the 2-3 times a day as recommended by my piercer dried out my skin but I do use this to clean my jewelry by squirting it on a cotton swab and a couple times a week to clean my older ear piercings and it works well.  If your skin is not sensitive I would give this a try, otherwise use it sparingly or find another product.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper then buying it at the shop. exactly what I was looking for. Works right away to relive any inching sensation.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that healed my belly button piercing that I had problems with for 2 years. Also heals cuts in my mouth. Arrives fast and in great condition every time.</li>
    <li> got my nose pierced then both helix pierced following week and have used nothing but this product and have have not one problem with piercings.</li>
    <li> This product had a faulty spray nozzle and did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The last one that I ordered was the same...</li>
    <li> I had my ears pierced for a third time and the section of my lobe the piercing was made is thicker than the rest of my ear lobe. This caused the piercing to heal very slowly and while not infected (not swollen, red, oozing, hot, itchy, or painful) my piercing still had the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; look for weeks and had to be cleaned daily for the very slight crust that formed every day (again not infected but just acting like a brand new peircing). I used this spray twice daily and it worked. My piercing has healed fully after a few weeks of use and I would use this product in the future for sure. It was not a miracle so don&#x27;t give up after a day! It took a good week to start looking better and I continued use even after the piercing looked healed just to be sure. A tip on use: if you want a more direct stream of solution instead of a widespread mist, press and hold lightly on the button rather than just pressing it down all the way.</li>
    <li> Favorite thing to use!</li>
    <li> Helped my Piercing alot!</li>
    <li> Works as expected and does not dry out skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t hate the actual product itself as I&#x27;ve used it before and I know its a good quality product, but I am definitely upset at what I have received. The can itself was intact, the lid however was cracked, and it does not spray a fine mist like it should. Instead it produces a small stream of liquid. I&#x27;m very disappointed, the liquid is still usable since its for a belly piercing.</li>
    <li> All I can say is oh em gee!! I was skeptical and I had a bump that would not go away on my nose from a piercing. This product WORKS! It really cleaned my piercing and the bump went away. A friend recommended it to me and I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it did. I&#x27;m so grateful for this product.</li>
    <li> Came fast and works fantastic</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it runs out really fast, so you&#x27;ll need to buy them about every month</li>
    <li> I should order more because it goes so quickly with a fresh piercing! Its the best product out for quickly and easily cleaning your piercings! My septum is almost a month old, and healed quite well thanks to this product. Also this saved my nostril piercing a couple of years back. It kept getting infected until I invested in H2Ocean spray and it was finally able to heal!</li>
    <li> H2Ocean is perfect for new or old piercings- it is a good option to keep piercings clean- when salt water soaks are not practical.</li>
    <li> I recently had my nose pierced and struggled with infections and keloids, even though I did regular hot salt baths.  I was recommended this spray by a local piercer and it works great! Also it eliminates mixing your own salt baths and possibly getting them too strong or weak.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has new piercings.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t realize that when I used this every day, my skin wouldn&#x27;t actually heal after the piercing due to the salt drying my skin out. But once I stopped using it every day, my skin recovered well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my nose pierced for several years now and every so often I will get the irritated bump that is so common with nose piercings. This product clears it up within a few days. Much easier to use this spray bottle than heating up hot salt water to use as a compress.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it from rickys! The leakage on can was ridiculous at most 3 thorough sprays a day and lasted only a week! But i need it for this industrial so I have to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;This one lasted more than a week with the same amount of sprays!</li>
    <li> Its great, my son hit my tragus piercing and it got infected. Sprayed this for about 2 to 3 times a day and it healed pretty quick love it !!</li>
    <li> I got my bellybutton pierced recently &amp; I wanted to try this for it &amp; also for this little bump I keep getting on my nose piercing. it works great, the bump is pretty much gone &amp; my bellybutton is healing fine. BUUUUUUT. when I got this, the &amp;#34;360 spray top&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t work. it just sort of.. dripped out super slowly. I received this product less than a week ago &amp; now the spray top has stopped working completely. it won&#x27;t even &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; out anymore. &amp; apparently this product isn&#x27;t available for &amp;#34;returns or replacements&amp;#34; either. so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this from shops in the past and now do not live by a shop that sells it. Great stuff! Heals, feels great, leaves a salty residue.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. It&#x27;s perfect for people like me that don&#x27;t have time to do the daily sea salt soaks and all that good stuff. I mean who really has the time to soak a piercing everyday twice a day for 15 minutes for like 6 months .I used it for a rook, two belly button piercings, a micro-dermal and both nipple pierced I would absolutely recommend this. It&#x27;s gentle so along with washing your piercing daily you can use it multiple times a day. I also think it speeds up the healing time. The bottle also last a long time and is very cheap considering my piercer sells the same stuff for like 15 bucks in his shop. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend, a couple of weeks after getting a pair of nipple piercings.  Up to then, I had only been rinsing and cleaning in the shower, and stuff tended to build up and get painful even between showers.  I was quite pleased with how just a few drops of this, plus a little motion, would quickly dissolve built-up stuff, allowing it to be wiped clean... much better than plain water.  Once the build-up was off, another couple of drops would thoroughly lubricate the piercing and allow the bar to slide freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, and it&#x27;s kind of a big one, is that the propellant can run out long before the can is empty, if all you want is a tiny bit out of the can each time.  I usually want to put just a couple of drops onto each piercing and roll it around, not thoroughly soak each one.  Unfortunately, the compressed-air spray head doesn&#x27;t lend itself to doing that.  I was thinking this would be a pump spray canister, i.e. one squeeze &#x3D; one spritz.  But you can&#x27;t reliably spray just a couple of drops worth.  Trying to dribble a little bit out led to me inadvertently bleeding off most of the air.  Now I have a half-full canister with no propellant left... holding down and inverting does nothing.  Admittedly, I made my can last for about four months with light usage, so perhaps the thing to do is go ahead and get the piercing good and soaked with a quick, sharp press, since it&#x27;ll use the same amount of propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/10/14: I got my second bottle, and it looks like maybe my first one was from an early batch.  A clue is the artwork... the first bottle had tall lettering on it, this one has more rounded letters.  And the spray comes out much easier with a light tap, with no burbling.  So I&#x27;m thinking between then and now, they&#x27;ve fixed some issues with the spray nozzle.  Giving back the fifth star now.</li>
    <li> I have had many piercings and this last one was the first time I used this product. It has definitely helped speed up the healing process! Easy to use and it works!</li>
    <li> Kept my navel piercing clean and kept it from getting infected. Cheaper to buy here then it is at the piercing place.</li>
    <li> I had an infected tragus piercing before using this. It healed like a miracle. Used once in the morning and once at night. I kept it in my bag to use as an emergency in case anything got too close to my piercing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any magical healing properties that other people seem to achieve.  I like how convenient it is.  I&#x27;ve been using it on a nose piercing for about a month now with no adverse effects.  Tastes good too.. like salt.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! I was so surprised that my order literally came the next day . It was great. And I picked standard shipping. I have a dreaded bump on my nose and have been using the 1.5 bottle. But I would recommend getting the bigger one just because the healing process of a piercing is always lengthy . The 4 oz is great. I wish they had a bigger bottle than this. Highly recommend . My nose bump is almost gone</li>
    <li> Very necessary to have on hand with piercings.  Helps with possible infections and keeps trouble at bay when used regularly.</li>
    <li> I purchased four of these and only two cans worked. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. It&#x27;s better to purchase these at your piercer for the extra four dollars at least you&#x27;ll know the can actually sprays. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> Obviously for new piercings you should be doing salt soaks with warm water morning/evening but i&#x27;ve had my piercings for over a year and just want to keep them clean at this point and this is super handy for that. After I work out I use a bit of this and qtip off any lymph or nastiness. This has drastically reduced the general irritation I get after I work out.</li>
    <li> i only began using it for one day but i must say it feels awesome. it sprays on very well and it made me piercings feel a whole lot better. im glad i purchased this product. i would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I was a bit of a lazy caretaker of my new tragus piercing.  It was just so awkward to soak that part of my body several times a day.  I tried other items for care but wound up causing more harm than good.  Once I began daily spraying of this fluid on my ear everything progressed smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be cheap, buy the best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used h2ocean in the past for my tragus piercings with good results but recently got my nose pierced a few months ago and thought i&#x27;d try sea salt and water instead. Seemed like the cheaper, natural option. I&#x27;ve been struggling with &amp;#34;the bump&amp;#34; for months now and sea salt and water weren&#x27;t helping. So I bought some h2ocean and within a week my bump went down so much. In the future, I&#x27;ll just buy h2ocean the first time around. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Have used it on all of my piercings whenever they get fussy or after getting new ones and it helps them heal so nicely! Also soothes new piercings so they aren&#x27;t as annoying and constantly hurting. Best way to care for piercings and help them heal!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day; it is that safe. I have shared it with my sister who repierced her own ears!</li>
    <li> Helps with taking care of your new piercing if your short  on time!</li>
    <li> This product is great! Fantastic! Within the first spray I used I already saw the difference. I had trouble with my belly piercing discharging and crust forming around the jewelry, but with one spritz it cleared up quickly. This product lasts a long time as well. I&#x27;ve had it now for about 4 months and I just now finished it. So it lasts a while! I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a fresh piercing or to anyone that has had a piercing on for a while and just want to keep it fresh!</li>
    <li> Really works, great product!</li>
    <li> I got a nose piercing and was taking great care of it (I thought). I was making my own saline solution, but boiling the water, buying sterile pads, trying to travel and needing to make sterile solution got to be a pain, so I researched and found this. After just under 2 months, I was starting to get a little bump under my piercing that wasn&#x27;t going away no matter how long I left my solution on it (was soaking/cleaning it 3x a day). I got this yesterday afternoon, sprayed it on then, sprayed it on last night, again this morning - and the bump&#x27;s already gone. So much easier than making my own, and obviously works better!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, expensive though. Shoots way too much product.</li>
    <li> A WONDERFUL product.  It kept my little girls ears infection free after piercing.  I would also recommend it for any minor injury.  It cleans better and stings less than hydrogen peroxide.  If you have kids....get it!  If you have a piercing or plan to have one GET IT!</li>
    <li> I love H2Ocean! It works well to keep my piercings clean and help with the healing process. The website has a lot of information and it apparently works on most skin irritations like cuts, scrapes, acne, etc. My piercer recommended this and I just bought it here for a refill.</li>
    <li> this is the easiest, most effective way to care for a piercing... I got my helix pieced a week ago and have only used this on it.  It will take several months to heal....all cartilage piercings take time.... but so far, no redness, no crusties, no pus, no infection.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, and will help keep the piercing clean while it heals... get it!</li>
    <li> Get this...It&#x27;s the best thing you will do for any piercing. Saline never worked well for me but this is great!</li>
    <li> At first I was not sure if this was going to be a good product. ..I ordered it used it and in the 1st day I saw results I love this product! !</li>
    <li> Definitely helps calm my cartilage piercings.</li>
    <li> H20cean is a great product for piercings!  You can also use it to naturally cleanse cuts/scrapes as well.  This product has healed piercing infections for me and the bottle lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my navel piercing. I was using softsoap in the shower like my piercing guy said, until I got this a few weeks later. This is the best because it&#x27;s easy and you don&#x27;t really have to wash it off or anything. You can&#x27;t overuse it. It cleans and heals. I got some for my friend too, whose navel piercing was infected, and she loves it. Infection gone!</li>
    <li> I had my ears pierced nearly a decade ago and had hypertrophic scarring/keloids in my cartilages at the sight of the piercings and didn&#x27;t know if there was anything I could do to get rid of them. I bought this, sprayed it twice a day on both front and back, and about a week later, the scarring/keloids were much smaller. My ears also used to get inflamed when I put in new earrings, and after using this, they don&#x27;t anymore.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and arrived to my doorstep sooner than expected</li>
    <li> I use this mainly for my belly button piercing and I think this really helps clean it. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
    <li> This spray is so useful for multiple purposes. I first used it on my tragus piercing and it healed quickly and easily only using H 2Ocean. So easy to use, point &amp; spray. It is so healthy and sterile, I used it on my recent operation sites with great results. I need to buy a case of this spray!</li>
    <li> Great stuff for new and healing piercings!  Also like the price considering I bought a 1 oz can from my piercer for $10.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly,works great to clear piercing infections up!</li>
    <li> Bought these because i had peirced my doubles triples cartilage and double cartilage by myself and i got one infection i used it everyday on all my piercings 3 times a day and it worked amazing. Going to buy another can when i pierce my belly button!!</li>
    <li> The piercing was swollen and inflamed till initiation of product usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and the results started showing from the second day as it kept the site clean and sterile.&lt;br /&gt;Looks like the healing process accelerated a lot since its usage was started.</li>
    <li> Wish I had known about this product from when I first started getting pierced. I discovered this when I repierced my nipples, and it was a godsend. As soon as they started hurting or there was the slightest sign of being swollen, I sprayed this on and they felt better right away. Trust me when I say, don&#x27;t get pierced without having this in your stash.</li>
    <li> After 10+ body piercings, I decided to use the ocean spray with my industrial. It helps with the itching aspect of the healing process and also cooled my ear immediately after the piercing.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for my naval piercing that I go today and it soothed right away. The plus was that it only cost $10 at the tatto shop I got the piercing from! Try visiting a local tattoo shop before ordering this online. Great stuff to use though just spray it on and dab off anything that drips!!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I use it on my multiple piercings, and it love the easy of a spray over soaking in salt water when I am in a hurry!</li>
    <li> Works great on my piercings and I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> When i used these for my snakebites they were fine. I stopped using them for my cheeks my piercer said this is too salty thats why it burns.</li>
    <li> It definitely does the job at keeping my cartilage piercings moist. I prefer this over soaking my ear in water two times a day which was rather annoying.</li>
    <li> I got my belly button pierced back in February. I was doing the sea salt soaks as I was told, but it seemed to be drying out my piercing area. I know this piercing can take months to heal, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was making much progress. I also had a pus filled bump on the top of my piercing. I decided to by H2Ocean in the middle of July. The bump is just about gone and the piercing overall has made so much progress</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for piercings!  My daughters &amp; I used this for cartilage piercings &amp; 1 belly button piercing.  Helped keep everything clean &amp; sped up healing.  Will continue to use for daily cleaning.</li>
    <li> My bellybutton piercing had become very nasty and after even a tiny spray all the gunk came out and it cleared up.  Because I play rugby the constant pulling kept the area infected and now I just spray this every once in a while and it feels better right away.Thanks!</li>
    <li> Really sped up the healing process!!</li>
    <li> H2ocean is and will always be my go to product for piercings. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and it heals my piercings nicely. Also, if one of my piercings starts to act up, I use this and within 2-3 days, the infection is gone. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I recently got a double forward helix piercing and at first I only did sea salt soaks where I would prepare the mixture myself, but I found it quite tedious to have to do this twice a day and looked online for a more convenient alternative. And found it!! Every time my ear hurts or when I accidentally knock it or when I accidentally sleep on that ear I just spray the piercings and in a few minutes it feels a lot better. I&#x27;m going to keep doing this until my piercing cure. This is a must buy product!</li>
    <li> Works great on new piercings.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean my dermals. won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> The air ran out quicker then the contense of bottle, after air was gone still was only half empty, very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful and convenient product. I use it for new piercings since I hate having to do salt water soaks 2-4 times a day. My bottle did arrive much later than promised, so I had to buy a bottle locally while I waited, but Amazon refunded my money and let me keep the bottle (when it did arrive) as a backup.</li>
    <li> great product, it really does help with belly button piercing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonders on piercings!</li>
    <li> Best thing out there! Never failed me. A lot of people have told me to just use sea salt and water @ home but I prefer an actual product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about little over a month and it works great.  My earlobes feel already healed.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything!</li>
    <li> This stuff is necessary for healing piercings. Relieves that itchy healing feeling and helps piercings heal quickly without any problems.</li>
    <li> Great for piercing or skin care. Just apply as needed. Also it is essential to eat correctly so products can work more efficiently</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST cleaning stuff for any piercing. I use it daily for my new piercings and none have ever been infected. This stuff works like a dream.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other reviewers. This product is not good if you already have dry/ sensitive skin. The first few days, my piercings were fine- not swollen, itchy, or anything. I used the aftercare solution while waiting for this product to arrive. Within a couple minutes of using this spray, my earlobes became extremely itchy and swollen. They were like that the next few days. I stopped using this spray after the first two days. After returning to using the aftercare solution given for a couple days, my ears are fine again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously used sea salt soaks on a mildly infected cartilage (cleared up the problem), so I was hoping this would be an easier method of application. &#x3D;/ Sea salt soaks it is.</li>
    <li> This, and the tattoo lotion, work really well.</li>
    <li> The top of the can leaks when you spray it and leaks all over. Never had any pressure when you spray it.  Half a can left and it will not spray at all.</li>
    <li> I love this spray!  It has been very helpful with healing my agitated cartilage piercing when I need it.  It is good for average cuts and scrapes, too!  This is my second bottle.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> After just the first day using it my piercings feel much better. I have 9 ear piercings currently and they are all healed but have been crusting over a lot lately. This product has been working better than the regular cleaning solution. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its in a spray can. I really don&#x27;t see how that is helpful for application no matter where your peircings are. However, since it seems to be working I can deal with the mess.</li>
    <li> when i get the little bubble on my cartilage this stuff helps so much, relieves the pain and heals the bubble in 1-2 days:)</li>
    <li> Helps heal piercings. Makes it so much easier to clean them.</li>
    <li> I am subscribed on a monthly basis!  I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Worked well. A bit pricey thus 4-stars,but really liked it.</li>
    <li> I order this quite often for my tragus piercing. It works pretty good. However I recieved this can and the bottle was full but would not spray. Then when it started spraying it was just running out of the top, as opposed to the spout. After a few days, dit started spraying correctly. First time having this issue, hope its my last.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> I lost count of how many times I&#x27;ve bought this. It is just awesome!! I self-pierce a lot and it is perfect because stops the hurting like immediately and also makes the healing process easier and faster ♥</li>
    <li> Well I got my bellybutton pierced a while back and I noticed it started to get all purple around the top and it was starting to scab up. I thought my piercing was rejecting and I didn&#x27;t want to just take it out so I did some research and I found this product and read so many great reviews. Well, this is another one! I was SO amazed with the product. I saw a difference just after one day of use. If you&#x27;re having any troubles with a piercing, or you want to use a GREAT cleaner and help a piercing to heal faster, get this!!! It is so amazing. The 4oz lasted me about a week I think, so I would recommend getting a larger size if possible, or buying more than one. WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time, is a great product for several different uses, overall a great purchase. Would suggest to anyone!</li>
    <li> awes0me.... amd ammazikg.... recommend highly amazing.... recommend highly</li>
    <li> After going through my first can I bought when I had the piercing done, I quickly came on Amazon to buy another for the summer months. This stuff is amazing! Keeps it clean, cools it down and I highly recommend having it on hand the entire time you have a piercing... especially one in a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% sure that my piercings would be infected if not for spray. Buy it now!</li>
    <li> I used this on fresh nipple piercings, and they healed excellently. No nasty smells, no funky (abnormal) discharge. I am one of those people who have to proceed with caution with piercings because my body doesn&#x27;t like them. I am convinced this spray did what all the advice I had been given many years ago failed to do: help my body to accept and heal PROPERLY. I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this spray and will definitely be using it again if I ever pierce anything else!!!</li>
    <li> i use this for my nostril piercing. it&#x27;s awesome as long as you use it regularly. it makes cleaning and soaking SO easy, and the packaging makes it a portable cleaning method.</li>
    <li> Got it in a good amount of time and works great.</li>
    <li> Always the best product for healing piercings. No doubt. Helped immensely with my vertical labret so not a single issue using this for cleaning. Also, it is ALL I used for cleaning. Six weeks in and beautifully healed piercing. It is also soothing.</li>
    <li> I received the product and the can seems to be damaged. The spray function will not work. I had to poke a hole in the can and tranfer its contents to another container</li>
    <li> amazing for any open sores. Use it on my nose piercing. Works wonders</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago after I got my doubles re-pierced and while it did help healing the piercings, I think the warm water and sea salt care is the best for new piercings and would recommend spending the money on the sea salt and going that route instead.</li>
    <li> this is a great product helped my piercings heal quickly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, because I got my piercing back in June 2013, but the extra little discomfort that still seem to be there was taken care of by this product. I had a cartilage piercing and didn&#x27;t do a hollow point earring. Before using this I forced a 18 gauge hollow point through my cartilage and used H2Ocean. After about 3 months, I am good to go, and still have some left to do it all over again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughters new piercing works great highly recommend</li>
    <li> Have not had an infection or anything with this, ever. My piercer recommended to me years ago and I still use it for new ones</li>
    <li> This is a must have for any piercing. If you have a piercing or thinking about getting one you should buy a couple of bottles of this spray. You will not regret it !</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product through a local tattoo/piercing shop and loved it --- but much smaller bottles were very expensive. So happy to find this larger bottle at the SAME price as the small!!</li>
    <li> I have reviewed this same product 10 times and the site wont save it. It will take at least a month to get it in the mail. Other than that the product is the best.</li>
    <li> My spray bottle didn&#x27;t have any pressure in it and therefore did not spray. I can&#x27;t review the actual product itself.</li>
    <li> Excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Helps speed up the healing process and stops infections.</li>
    <li> I got my conch pierced 5 days ago. I had gotten an orbital piercing on a few years ago and don&#x27;t remember it being this sensitive this badly after 5 days. It was literally THROBBING at the slightest touch. It wasn&#x27;t infected but I got a small fever from the trauma of my ear. I didn&#x27;t want to be dramatic but I looked up something that might help with the healing and cleaning process that didn&#x27;t require me to touch it much at all and I found this. AWESOME. I have used it three times today and it&#x27;s already made a huge difference. No soreness, no redness, no throbbing within hours. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i am very happy about my product it was shipped really quick.i will be order more of this product i do recommened this product to anybody that has a new pirceins,</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I swear by this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for all of my piercings for many, many years and it&#x27;s a necessity.</li>
    <li> This spray is so simple, yet effective. It&#x27;s compact enough to bring with me on-the-go to help keep any new piercings I get clean.. but it also helped clear up an infection that was coming onto an older piercing. Trust me, it makes things a whole lot easier than having to mix up and carry around your own salt water mixture!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for 4 times. I just made two ear piercing last month, so I need it so much.</li>
    <li> I have many piercings and this product really helps keep everything clean and free of irritation. I have a dermal in my sternum and it gets irritated or clogged from soap, etc. A quick spray above it so that the solution runs behind the bead, gets everything out and seems to help clear any irritation that occurs from time to time. When a pierced area is a little red, I will spray it 2-3 times a day for a few days and it seems to take care of itself. I also use the spray daily for a few weeks on any new piercings.</li>
    <li> I had heard that this was one of the greatest Piercing AfterCare in the market. I really like it! It helped curing my piercing a lot! :D It arrived on time and great!</li>
    <li> It got rid of my dreaded nose bump!&lt;br /&gt;Its really easy to spray and has many other uses so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My daughters ears have been sore forever, but this helped almost immediately. Within two days her piercings were pain free.</li>
    <li> It worked alright to heal up parts of my piercing...Took a lot longer than what the other reviews claim tho.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use alcohol or peroxide for care of your nose piercing, they can cause scarring. This spray is gentle but effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on both my piercings, but since my ear is a lot more finicky I&#x27;ve had to go to saline for it, my lip however is healing rather quickly. I&#x27;m a smoker, and generally it takes longer for any piercing/wound to heal, but with this it&#x27;s doing amazingly well. I&#x27;m satisfied, they&#x27;ve seemed to fix their issues from previous bottles that the sprayer would pop off... (Which i don&#x27;t get why people made such a big fuss about that, it will literally go straight back on with no problem...) It&#x27;s all in all a great product, I can recommend this to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note- is if you have prior problems with piercings, don&#x27;t panic, and just keep with a cleaning regimen and switch every so often between this and another.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost the entire duration of my piercings healing process so far, and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The Lysosome, (an organelle in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells containing degradative enzymes enclosed in a membrane.) in combination with the Sea salt, which others have just dismissed this because it has sea salt, is an extra kick to help your body properly heal itself.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s working great for keeping my freshly pierced nostril clean. As an added benefit, it seems to be clearing up a few breakouts that I happened to have, as well. One of which is a &amp;#34;cyst&amp;#34; like zit on my chin (you know, one of those huge ones that lurk underneath the skin and never come to a head). It looks like it&#x27;ll be more than enough to keep my piercing site clean until it&#x27;s fully healed and for clearing up the occasional break out. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I hate this bottle. Every bottle I buy, it gets clogged. I can&#x27;t spray after having a whole bottle left.</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter.  helped to clear up infected ears.</li>
    <li> The specific bottle received, when you spray the product the cap leaks. Does the job of cleaning my dermal  sand piercings though.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my piercings and made them very sore. I am sure that the product is what made them irritated because once i cleaned with salt water the pain was gone. My piercer told me that this product is not for everyone and some people are fine with it and some people&#x27;s bodies don&#x27;t like it since it has extra ingredients in it that the body does not naturally produce.</li>
    <li> I recently got an Industrial bar in my ear and was recommended to try this product. After 3 days of having my bar, my ear started to hurt and get pink. I knew that it would end up being an infection though I do clean it with soap and after, put Vaseline on the sides. I started spraying this maybe twice a day to my ear as well and no infection has appeared yet. Even though I spray this solution to my ear, it still hurts a bit whenever I move my bar up and down. I&#x27;ll update my review if anything comes up.</li>
    <li> I have a few piercings, and whenever one of them gets inflamed or infected, H2Ocean clears it right up. A little expensive, but seriously worth it.</li>
    <li> This solution did more for me than the dial soap solution recommended to me by the piercer. My skin is very sensitive, so even using diluted antibacterial soap caused irritation on the skin surrounding my nose piercing. When I changed to the H2O, the skin irritation resolved itself, and you can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve gotten it pierced.  Even better is that when it is squirted inside your nostril, it helps to soften up some of the scuz if you have sinus issues :-)</li>
    <li> I was dumb to not buy this from my piercer when I first got my double helix piercing, it probably would&#x27;ve saved me from having a gross bump on it for 7 months.  It&#x27;s helped all of my other body piercings, when I first got them, but I thought I&#x27;d just buy sea salt and soak my piercing in it rather than buying this, which I hardly ever did.  I bought the Dr. Piercings Medicated Swabs before getting this, I thought after reading the reviews I would try that but it didn&#x27;t nothing to help clear up the bump.  I finally bought this and have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s definitely helped with the size of the bump.  Hopefully within a few weeks it will go away.  Before trying anything else I would recommend using this first to help with new piercings and infections.</li>
    <li> Obviously great product but the bottle is broke and leaked when I got it</li>
    <li> This is the answer to all healing. Won&#x27;t and don&#x27;t pierce without it. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! M</li>
    <li> I actually had to stop using H2Ocean for a while when I ran out and my piercing got red and inflamed with just homemade salt water soaks and heat compresses. As soon as I started using it again, along with my normal routine of salt soaks and heat compresses, my tragus piercing healed! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I got my tragus pierced and it got infected despite my best efforts keeping it clean. I used this spray and aspirin paste and it cleared it up within a couple of weeks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product it came earlier than expected works very well</li>
    <li> I L-O-V-E this product and would so highly recommend it to anyone with a new piercing, or anyone having difficulties with an existing one! I have had my BB pierced twice. The first time, 10 years ago, I had nothing but painful problems from day one. The piercer back then had recommended whatever was the after-care de jour, but it was harsh and made everything WORSE. I had to do the saltwater in the shot glass trick for days at a time due to infection and all, PLUS it took an entire YEAR to heal enough that I could change out my jewelry. (that first hole closed up when I had abdominal surgery a couple of years ago) OK, fast forward to now! Got my SECOND BB piercing 4-5 months ago, and my piercer of &amp;#34;today&#x27;s times&amp;#34; recommended I use H2Ocean&amp;#34;. I use the spray twice a day, making certain to spray all of the holes, and I have not had problem ONE this go-around. I feel as though I could even change out my jewelry NOW, though my piercer recommeds waiting another month or 2 to be sure!! I cannot give this product a higher commendation - I hope YOU have as great a success with it as I have ~ A</li>
    <li> H20 is my go-to for any type of piercing. It&#x27;s easy to use and works. My piercings don&#x27;t get infected and if they are irritated, this clears it up immediately. Love this brand!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters ear piercings.  She&#x27;s 17 and had her belly button pierced a couple of years ago and this stuff worked like a champ. She has never had any issues with swelling, infections, oozing, etc.  She just recently had her ears re-pierced and we were out of this stuff, so I came to Amazon, and to my delight found it, and ordered it.  Nothing else compares!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and I would rate 5 starts on the product because it works better than any spray. However one of the cans didn&#x27;t have pressure in it and it couldn&#x27;t spray anything at all.</li>
    <li> One ear always seems to be the troublemaker.  This stuff quickly showed who&#x27;s boss and cleared up the infection.</li>
    <li> Product came fast, and nothing could be easier.  I had a bottle I took on vacation a while ago when I got my second holes in my ears and unfortunately misplaced it.  My ears are sensitive and prone to giving me a a headache if I wear anything other than gold, but no matter how much regret I am feeling the next day this spray takes care of the worst in a few hours to a day or two.  There is no pain or stinging, and it is super easy to apply to the affected area.  At times when my ears have actually gotten infected, this is about the only product that will reliably clear it up.</li>
    <li> Great product for disinfecting most anything on the body. Always keep it around.</li>
    <li> Saves my piercings from getting infected EVERY TIME !</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and technically cannot really write a review because after using it twice, the button stopped working and I could no longer spray the product. I am pretty upset about spending approx $15 including shipping and got only two uses out of it before the can malfunctioned and It was no longer useable. I&#x27;m sure the product works great for aftercare of piercings etc but my order was a loss.. currently seeking a refund.</li>
