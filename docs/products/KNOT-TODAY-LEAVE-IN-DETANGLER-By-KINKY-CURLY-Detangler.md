<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used on my natural hair.  It detangles like magic.  I have less breakage and my hair doesn&#x27;t have as much shrinkage when I use this.  I use it along with the curling custard.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it works.</li>
    <li> I just wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so small. I go through it so quickly. This and the Kinky Curly Styling Custard are my secret weapons. They define my curls, but don&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Still the best natural hair daily moisturizer out there even though big companies and brands take up the shelves at Walmart and Target. It is also great for braid/twist removal and detangling.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. My hair feels light and smells great. Even made my hands soft. This is all I used on my hair for style and it holds in place perfect.</li>
    <li> is a very good product.  However, the product is too pricey.  If it were not as expensive, I&#x27;d order more.</li>
    <li> Maybe this product isn&#x27;t mad for my hair (4C) because this junk did not work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a very long time but I recently stopped because I&#x27;ve grown tired of how long it takes for my hair to dry with this stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other ways to moisturize my hair that doesn&#x27;t compromise my air drying time, so I&#x27;m going to go with those methods.</li>
    <li> Works out tangles so easily</li>
    <li> Detangled my hair well. Loses a star for smelling different.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! On my 4b to 4c hair this is great for everyday hydration</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my one year old daughter. She is mixed, but has kinky african american hair. I bought it because it is made with natural ingredients and it was recommended to me by another african american mom. I tried it as a wash out conditioner and thought it didn&#x27;t do a great job. Then I tried it as a leave in conditioner/detangler. It worked pretty well as a detangler, but once the hair was dry there was no moisture added. Her hair looked dull and dry. I think Sexy Hair Organics does a better job as a leave in conditioner. I will not be buying this product again. It was a lot of money to waste on a so-so product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give my review for this product because some people may be quite skeptical like I was. Well let me tell you, buy this! It does a great job of getting knots out of kinky, knotty hair. my 7 yr old has so much hair. And after washing, it is very hard to get out tangles because her hair is fine curly. I put this on it (used quite a bit) and it really helped a lot! I also use it on my 4yr old she has fine curly hair as well, and it always has tight curls on the ends when dry. I used this on her hair after it was dry  and knotty the other day, I was done in 10 minutes! It does make their hair seem wet though, so for us who are african american if you want to get the knots out and still want the hair to be straight, it is best to use after washing. And then straighten after. I am really glad I found out about this product. Thank you KINKY KURLY!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m white and have thick, course curly hair. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair and my hands don&#x27;t feel gross after putting it on. It even lasts for about two days!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to detangler. Great results</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL!!! I purchase it at least 3 bottles at a time. Right now the average cost for this very same product is $11 to $12 even from the manufacturer!  Amazon sellers: you&#x27;re charging way too much!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave-in/detangler ever!  It has a lot of \\&quot;slip\\&quot; meaning that your fingers or detangling tool will slide freely through your curls.  It even aids in clumping those curls, and IMO is essential when using the Curling Custard.  It&#x27;s not a gimmick.  I find that my styles turn out better when I use Knot Today underneath the custard.  It&#x27;s very light, and protein-free.  I love the ingredients; you can pronounce them all....  The consistency is very creamy, with little bubbles in it.  It is NOT GREASY at all.  The scent is also light, and very pleasant.   I suggest that you apply this on WET hair for maximum slip, when detangling, and even if you are using it to moisturize.  Seal with a light oil.  I will continue to purchase this lovely leave-in as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, it had great slip, and detangle was good as well, the only thing is that no matter how much I put in my hair it left the white film.  I decided to check the kinky curly site to see if I was using it wrong, and low and behold I was, it was recommended that for my hair type I should wash out, and when I did it was much better and when i use it along with the custard the curls just popped.  Great detangler, might re-order</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have 4A/B hair with some 3C areas. after Co-wash, I apply on wet hair evenly, detangling and smoothing it in with my fingers. I get amazing all over curls every time. After full day drying (it takes my hair forever to dry) there is a nice shine and a little crunchiness that dissolves if you just run your hand over the curls. Day two hair is even better. I cant stop touching my hair since I am newly natural so by day 3 I have a bit of frizz so I just rinse it out and reapply. Amazing product. One of my staples. FYI you can get it at any organic/health/natural food stores  for a discounted price.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I wash my hair with it and also use it as a leave-in. It&#x27;s super detangling and it is a must must must have for anyone with curly to kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but found that like another reviewer mentioned after repeated use my hair did not feel as soft.  I plan to try to use it sparingly and alternate with another product to maintain my original amazingly soft results.</li>
    <li> Best leave-in I have ever tried. It lasted a lot, liked the smell and the consistence. I totally recommend it for transitioners and naturals.</li>
    <li> Great detangler, but once hair is dry there is no moisture added. Very expensive for how much you need to use to get results.</li>
    <li> This product was great!!! It made the knots, literally melt out of my hair!  Problem? It&#x27;s way to expensive for the amount you have to use if you have super thick curly hair like me.  I only bought this one time before I decided it was cheaper just to make it myself, and it works exactly the same!</li>
    <li> If there were only one product I could use, it would be this. After I condition my hair and squeeze the water out with my hands, I run this through my hair and shake my head. My curls appear and separate beautifully!! I can&#x27;t believe it can be this easy. If I had to give up all other products, this is the one I would KEEP!! I have been using the same bottle for well over a month, so while its not cheap, I consider it a good investment. Experiment with it, you may not need anything else!</li>
    <li> Great for Natural hair but you need to make sure you have lots of moisture in your hair before using this or it will just feel horrible and you will not get the desired results. I suggest using a spray bottle of water with this and then you will love it. Of corse you may have some issues with this routine in the winter.....</li>
    <li> Works great even without styling products, it brings out my natural curls and hydrates my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner, which has become one of the staples for my haircare.     I didn&#x27;t believe the hype surrounding this Knot Today, and in fact tried everything but this product when I first went natural. Before using Knot Today, I once used Giovanni&#x27;s Leave In, per the recommendation of another natural. After a shampoo and condition, I&#x27;d use Giovanni as a Leave In conditioner for my hair to provide extra moisture. It worked okay, but it didn&#x27;t soften my hair much.      I finally gave in a few months ago, when Knot Today arrived at a local store, to try it. When I first put Knot Today on my hair, I noticed an immediate difference compared to earlier washings. Instant Magic. My hair softened, felt moisturized, had great slip and was easier to detangle. The fresh smell of the product was a bonus. Depending where you get it, the price is a little hefty, but it does last a while (depending on how you use it). I usually just put this one once a week -- to be economical. But, if you use it miore than once a week, I&#x27;m sure the benefits will be even greater. For me, a little bit lasts a while.    I highly recommend this.    INGREDIENTS: Organic Mango fruit extract, organic slippery elm, organic marshmallow root, organic lemongrass, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium methosulfate, citric acid, phenoxyethanol and natural fragrance</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff would be really good, and it was just not any better than any other detangler.  Just for me Hair milk works better for far less money and is less iky feeling.</li>
    <li> I mainly purchased the KC Knot Today for my daughter&#x27;s THICK 4a hair. She is very tender headed and her hair tangles as soon as you comb it. I applied the KNOT Today to her dry hair since I had already washed it, and it loosened those knots up so that I could comb them out.     I also like this product for my 3c/4a hair because it gives me great curl definition. I&#x27;m undecided about how well it moisturizes.    Overall rating: 5.0</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a product that yields results like this!!!! This product coupled with the kinky curly custard is AMAZING! My curls are left defined, soft and COMPLETELY frizz free! I wash my hair with sulfate free shampoo and use this as a leave in conditioner, use the kinky curly custard in sections, and then diffuse my hair and get GREAT results. The first time I used this product I received so many compliments at work about my hair. It leaves it so shiny, and with great curl definition. I also am able to achieve fourth day hair with this product...LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!! Works very well with Kinky Curly Gel.  Excellent product for natural black hair.  Love this product!!</li>
    <li> My hair is (or at least was) a frizzy mess. I have tried everything I thought might work. I have tried anti-frizz products from John Frieda, Redken, Eufora, Deva Curl, Nexxus, Matrix, Biolage, Blended Beauty, etc., as well as Morrocan, coconut, and olive oil products. And every time, all I have is less money and a lot of disappointment.  I have biracial \\&quot;kinky curly\\&quot; hair that was just out of control. I asked my hair stylist what to do, and she suggested an hours-long $300 Brazilian keratin treatment, which I&#x27;ve heard is filled with chemicals and of course lasts only for a few months. Not to mention way out of my budget.    But I was searching online yet again, trying to find something that would work for my \\&quot;Type 3c\\&quot; hair and give it that kinky, spiral curly look that I wanted, without the frizz that makes me look like a muppet. On the list of recommendations, I found the Kinky Curly Knot Today and the Curling Custard, read the positive reviews here, and decided to try it. Given my history with products, I was not optimistic.    I am SO glad I found this product!  No more pony tails each and every day!  I can finally wear my hair down.  I&#x27;m using it Knot Today with the Curling Custard, and my hair is now drying into the kinky spiral curls I wanted, even in the humid Midwestern summer. There&#x27;s just enough frizz to be funky--it doesn&#x27;t take over my whole head.      I don&#x27;t know if it will work for everybody&#x27;s hair type, but it certainly works for mine. I can&#x27;t wait to try the conditioner!    (BTW....as other posters have noted, this product is sold much cheaper at Target.)</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it gives a great slip to my daughter 4c hair. When i start to use this product on her hair i was so impress. Her hair got much curler and very managable. The way it smells is a plus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after hearing so much about it and just had to go out and buy it as i am a new natural as well as a product junkie...lol!  My TWA just didn&#x27;t like this product it made my curls really tight and left my hair feeling very dry. I will not be using this as long as i have a TWA will try it again once my hair has grown out more and see how it will do once my hair is longer...by the way I think my hair type is a 4a on top and a 3b in the back and sides.   I have also tried the COME CLEAN shampoo and will write a review for that product soon</li>
    <li> Previous Review: 4 stars:Really like this product for my pre-poo routine but it&#x27;s over priced so looking elsewhere. Current Review: 5 stars:finished my first bottle really fast pre-pooing my transitioning hair... BUT NOW that I&#x27;ve done the big chop and I&#x27;m hardly(more like never) combing out my natural 3c (I think it&#x27;s 3c) hair I use a lot less of this and it&#x27;s the best product out there for bringing out &amp; defining my beautiful natural curls. I&#x27;ve been using combination of aloe Vera, coconut oil, &amp; Kera Kare deep conditioner to define curls every morning but my hair was left quite greasy &amp; decreased curl definition by night time, but Knot today leave in defines my curls, no grease, no mess. Love it!!! Possibly my new morning routine with a bit of coconut or castor oil. The price isn&#x27;t that cheap but I can&#x27;t find this any where else and I think it will last awhile.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect leave in conditioner / regular conditioner. it smells great and doesn&#x27;t build up. it is light enough to use under other products. i really recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not thick enough for my hair, it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t put any on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product months ago and stopped using it. It was not doing much for my hair as far as detangling. I kept having to put more and more in my hair in order to see results. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t detangle all types of hair, but my hair is definitely kinky so I thought why not. Anyway its still in my bathroom barely used.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner after reading the rave reviews on Amazon.  However, I do not care for it, for my hair.  It had a great smell, but left my hair pretty flaky.  I tried using on a little, maybe a dime amount, and it still left my hair flaky. Cantu Shea butter is what I am using now.</li>
    <li> This gave me curls I didn&#x27;t know I had. If there is hair texture tighter than 4c, I have it. Detangling can take more hair than what&#x27;s in my ponytail sometimes, but not with this product. My comb and fingers can glide through once I apply. My twist outs are more shiny and stay moisturized longer. I use it with coconut oil and shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. It smells like the great outdoors or tree bark juice... It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good. It has a scent. Some would say it smells like expensive French cologne - but I&#x27;m a woman.</li>
    <li> This is my staple detangler since I discovered it in 2007. It has taken the trauma out of shampoo day for me.  I have  very dense, cotton-like, dry, tangly, type 4 hair and I was rather skeptical of all the rave reviews that I have been hearing about this all natural conditioner.   Using a wide tooth comb and my fingers, Knot Today allows me to easily remove annoying knots and tangles without breaking off my hair, and it is probably the main reason why I have been  able to keep my growing bra-strap length hair natural without relaxing it.   I use it both as a detangler and as a leave-in conditioner. Very importantly, it is non-greasy and also water based so it washes out with each shampoo and therefore does not leave any product build up on my hair.  It also does not irritate my sensitive scalp. I always have 3 or 4 extra bottles on hand to make sure I do not run out.   One of my beef with Knot Today is that it does not provide moisture to my hair when dry, however I get around that by lightly using a little coconut oil over it and also using my own home-made water based aloe vera spritz to re-hydrate my hair as needed.  Knot Today is also rather expensive since I can easily go through a 8-oz bottle in about a month, using it once per week.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. It leaves my hair soft and tangle free</li>
    <li> The Knot Today conditioner leaves my hair feeling very soft and moisturized.  It significantly controls frizzy hair and has a clean, fresh scent.  I also use it on second day curl to add moisture and manageability.  It is a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have very, very thick hair.  4AA hair, I like to joke around and say.  This product did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my mother whose hair is thinner than mine - it worked beautifully on her.  There&#x27;s a clear curl pattern, it&#x27;s softer and wavy, the product works as it should and I would say her hair is either 4b or 4c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then I will continue to search for the kind of products that will work on the kind of hair my father&#x27;s side of the family has blessed me with.</li>
    <li> I have really thick and kinky hair so this product worked well with detangiling my hair especially after I take out my braids. Only thing is that I have a lot of hair so I have to use two bottles every time I really need to detangle my hair</li>
    <li> I honestly have not used very many \\&quot;Detanglers\\&quot;, but can say that this stuff is excellent at what it does.  It is so soft and creamy and has a nice &#x27;slip&#x27; to it when applied. I use it on myself and my girls&#x27; hair. We all have different hair tectures, but it leaves all of our hair detangled, soft and defines our natural Afro-tectured curls so beautifully.  Seems to work best when hair is wet. I bought this at Target for $11.99(a little pricey, but worth it). You only need a little so it seems to last awhile.  Definitely one of my favorite products. I have not tried any of the other Kinky Curly products, but would like to.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me...passed it on to someone else to try. My hair is in between stages at this time.</li>
    <li> My hair is very kinky and it is hard to detangle after I shampoo and deep condition. I just tried Knot Today this morning and the the comb went through like butter! Thank you so much! This will be a permanent staple when doing my hair. [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Conditioner/Detangler - 8 oz]]</li>
    <li> I am not ashamed to say that I am a Carol&#x27;s Daughter junkie. However, not all of their products agree with my hair like their leave-in conditioners. I have tried a few other leave-ins and they would either leave my hair dry, crunchy or with buildup. Kinky-Curly&#x27;s Knot Today actually leaves my hair soft and makes my hair easy (yes with kinky curls) to comb through. You will hear or read a lot of naturalistas say that you should only comb your hair while it is wet with lots of conditioner in it. This is not true all of the time. Knot today even helps me when I use it on dry hair before a do a kinky twists, a twist out set or bantu knots. If you are looking for a leave-in conditioner I recommend giving this one a try. Every head off hair is different so while it works for me it may not work for you. You&#x27;ll never know until you try...</li>
    <li> This conditioner is AWESOME. I have 4b/4c hair, at first I was skeptical due to the price of course (which why I gave it a 4) but other than the price. This product works awesome. I have used every type of conditioner known to man to help with the detangling of my hair and none has worked. BUT THIS IS A KEEPER, it worked wonderfully and my hair is left feeling soft, defined curls and I can actually run my fingers thru my hair. GREAT CONDITIONER</li>
    <li> A must for the curly kinky girls.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is great for detangling and softening hands down.  I have to spritz my hair (dry, tightly curled, 4b) with water or use it after washing because it does not contain water and is not moisturizing for me otherwise.  FYI - this product can be purcased at Target for $11.99.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I read about it today and went out to purchase it an hour later.  Did my exercise, showered and con-washed my hair, left it wet just pulled the water out with my hands and put this on and forgot about it.  About an hour later my hair was dry enough and I walked in the bathroom, looked in the mirror and voile&#x27;; absolutely gorgeous, bouncy, swinging, shiny curls, just like that!  It&#x27;s almost magic and I almost feel guilty that I won&#x27;t ever have to \\&quot;work\\&quot; with my hair again...and think of all the money I will save...and how beautiful I will look in my mornings and how angelic my face looks with all these ringlets...and...and..and...(lol)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about using this product, but I&#x27;m happy I did. I love it. In order for this product to work properly you will have to shampoo your hair with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have a lot of wavy, thin, color-treated hair that is very difficult to comb through when wet and have been searching for a product without harsh chemicals. I used this today for the first time and was able to comb through my hair so easily. The ingredients are organic or mostly natural (3 rating on EWG safety scale) and it smells divine…the first ingredient it organic mango fruit extract. Perfect for adults and children.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to debunk two very illogical hair myth. There is NO such thing as a hair product that works for all types of hair and &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; does not describe your hair. So before I tell you why I give this product 4 stars, I will describe my hair texture. I have low porosity 3c/4a hair that when while hydrated, is very soft and easy to detangle.  I can use protein on my hair in moderation but too much causes my hair to dry out. Because my hair is low porosity, I must use heat/steam for conditioners to fully penetrate my strands otherwise it just sits on top of my hair and creates residue especially if my hair is not clarified. I like this conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t have 100 ingredients and drying alcohols that a lot of other conditioners have. Also, a little goes a long way. My hair is think but it does not take a lot of product to cover my hair. This conditioner also defines my curls nicely.</li>
    <li> works well on my 4a/b hair.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product...but it has been a disaster for my hair. Every time I&#x27;ve used it (maybe 4 times) its made my hair hard and crunchy the next day...it works well as a detangler etc. The problem is that when it dries it dries in a way that makes my hair crunchy and matted. And my next detangling job is 10x harder. I don&#x27;t use very much at all. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right... Just wanted to put this review out there because I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the only one this would happen to. My hair is predominantly 4b...little to no curl pattern...usually very soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Mediocre at best. Typical conditioner. Didn&#x27;t work any better than a regular leave in conditioner. I do like the natural ingredients. I&#x27;d heard so many awesome things and read great reviews about this product. The conditioner does detangle, but doesn&#x27;t come close to the As I Am Detangling Leave in Conditoner. It provided a little curl definition, but not enough to truly make your curls pop and hold. Its definitely not worth the money. Try the As I Am Detangling Leave In. You can virtually use your fingers to glide through hair to detangle. I have 4B hair and value a great detangling conditioner with lots of slip. This conditioner also left my hair dull looking. However, it did leave it soft.</li>
    <li> Perhaps the great reviews got my hopes up. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about spending this much but the reviews were so good and my friend swore by it. Anyway, didn&#x27;t wow me. I have a lot of very thick natural African American hair. Typically I just use a whole lot of conditioner, detangling brush, and wide tooth comb to detangle my hair in the shower, which has been working great for me. I guess if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it. I&#x27;ll go back to using the conditioners that I&#x27;d been using, which I can get for far less than $1.70/ounce. This was just not worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I never write reviews but, I had to write in on this product because I have been searching forever for a conditioner that would help with tangles  I have very long hair due to extensions, and washing my hair is torture.  I always end up with a mass of tangles and have used EVERY product with little results.  I read reviews on this and figured I would try again.  I was amazed.  First, understand that my hair is not left tangle free but, the tangles are easier to comb out.  I use this as a leave in after I use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Original \\&quot;Detangler\\&quot; Conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t use alot considering the length of my hair but, still more than most.  I put it on while still in the shower and my hair is very wet.  I comb through and then wrap my head in a towel.  I leave the towel on for 20 minutes and then dry.  Now I&#x27;m not sure which product (I used them for the first time together) made the difference but, I don&#x27;t care.  My hair was easy to dry.  No pulling and no tangles!!!!  It was so soft and silky wet and stayed the same after it was dry.  I haven&#x27;t had my hair feel so soft in a LONG time.  My own hair is dry, frizzy, thin, easily breaks and wavy, just a mess and it&#x27;s hard to make it look good, which is why I have extensions.  My friends and family have commented on how healthy and soft it looks, even the next day.  I finally found something that works!!!</li>
    <li> I appreciate the fragrance, consistency, and effectiveness of this product.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, but it still manages to keep my natural hair moisturized.  Prior to using this product, I used a regular rinse-able conditioner, and it left my hair feeling dry.  This Kinky Curly product, which I&#x27;ve heard so much about, truly softens and moisturizes my hair.  I&#x27;m even buying some for my sisters-in-law who recently decided to forsake the chemicals and go natural.  I also love that the owners of the company support the clean water initiative which builds wells in developing countries.</li>
    <li> I just got this today. I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair curly b/c its too humid to straighten. Love this stuff already. I see why a youtuber was professing her love for this. I don&#x27;t agree w/ a previous reviewer. I have fine, curly &amp; long hair.(about bra strap length). It&#x27;s not heavy or crunchy. I do spray my hair w/ water &amp; organic oil when styling.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner! It makes my hair very soft and my daughter hair.Its kind of high but i love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching a Youtuber rave about it. I find that this product helps me tremendously on shampoo day. You get an 8 oz bottle, and for my short hair (neck length bob), I only need about 1 or 2 quarter sized amounts. I work the product through my hair from the roots to the ends, being careful to avoid using too much (your hair will seem heavily coated if you use too much).  Then I comb it through with a wide tooth comb.  Amazing results can be seem even before I brow dry then flat iron my hair.  This product seems to cut down on the time it takes to completely style my hair. This product should last me at least 6 months; however, if your hair is long and/or thick you may use much more product, so it may not last as long for you. UPDATE on July 19, 2011 FYI: Hair serums give me the same results, and are cheaper. I&#x27;m using Motions, and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s hair serums.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this item as part of a leave-in conditioner reciper via Youtuber Kimmaytube.  It smells great and it&#x27;s wonderful for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man who wears his kinky curly hair about shoulder length.  And styling my hair for work probably takes about 20 mins, which everyday is a headache and becoming impossible because those 20 mins I could be spending sleeping.  Anywho, I wet my hair now and use Knot Today.  Of course, when wet it looks like I have a jheri curl but when dry (honestly, about lunchtime) it is curly and soft and natural looking.  I have the whole line of Kinky Curl products including the Custard.  Get this product and tell your friends.  Because I want them to stay in business so I can keep using this stuff.</li>
    <li> My twin daughters have two VERY different hair types (3c/4a and 4c) and for the first two years of their lives, I have been struggling with trying to find a product that was gentle and affordable. I am in the process of transitioning to natural hair and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try on their hair as well. This product is really great. Hair time has now become a joy instead of a dread. I also like to add alittle tea tree oil in the bottle for added moisture. They fight over who gets to sit in mommy&#x27;s lap first to get their hair done!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair as she is tender-headed and has very tightly extremely curly hair. I don&#x27;t have to use that much of the product, I simply place a decent amount in the palm of my hand, rub it through her hair, spray a little bit of water and I have been able to use a fine-toothed comb to comb her hair out. No more yelling and crying and causing me frustration to comb her hair.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but my hair doesn&#x27;t like it!!!  I worked better for my friend.</li>
    <li> Listen to all women of unruly kinky hair and I mean all women... This stuff is amazing. I finally used this to help with the kinky-ness of my natural hair and with my transition to natural. And I must say I made my own mix with about 2 tsp of castor and  tea-tree oil and it was amazing and I also made a batch with the kimmaytube recipe, with only half a tbsp of aloe vera gel instead of a whole 2 tbsp. It came out wonderful and I am appreciative. I don&#x27;t do well with the knowing my texture n all but I do know my hair needs moisture and a detangler that is not going to add to dryness and rip my hair out. And so far this is it.&lt;br /&gt;FYI: instead of putting more money into purchasing online on amazon. Ricky&#x27;s NY online and in store has this for $12.99. Slightly less but less still. Hope that helped for all users of [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky Curly Knot Today8 oz]]</li>
    <li> Does not work well for me.  Do not get a good curl pattern with this product.  Too lite.  Tried a couple of times.</li>
    <li> I so love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It detangles and Moisturize&lt;br /&gt;my Hair so Good! Target also sell&lt;br /&gt;this brand now too :-))</li>
    <li> I am a 4b/4c natural and this is a good product. It is expensive, but has become one of my staples due to the fact that it strengthens, softens, and leaves my hair with a noticable shine. I use it in a spray bottle as a leave-in combined with other oils and distilled water. After using I am left with defined curls that last for days.  I have not been able to use it as a stand-alone conditioner because it does not provide enough moister or the slip that I desire. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to add a boost to their hair.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect leave in conditioner. It has a massive amount of slip to help detangle and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls. My hair has been less frizzy (I use this then Pantene curl shaping gel)</li>
    <li> Just got it thank you.  I used  it immediately and  it made my extension  look  beautiful</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this product gets top ratings from curly girls, and that is IT REALLY WORKS! At least it does for many of them. I&#x27;m in that category, and I&#x27;m considered to have type 3a curls. If I ever have tangles, I apply a little Knot Today, work it through with a wide toothed comb, and they come right out. I often use it as a leave-in conditioner, too. Because of the price I use it sparingly, and it usually lasts a long time as a result. I would use it more often if it were a little cheaper, but overall I can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
    <li> Out of all KinkyCurly products i&#x27;ve tried, this has got to be my favourite, that said, its also one of my overall favourite products. I&#x27;m currently transitioning from relaxed to type 3c natural hair, and the hardest parts for me to manage are where the natural hair meets the relaxed hair, i was searchin for somethin that cud easily detangle my hair (esp bcause after cowashing my hair, it always seems more tangled) and after doing tons of research found this product. I literally use it in everythin and for every style, I used it in my deep condition, my regular condition, my leave in condition, i literally rub some in and can almost immediately run my fingers through my hair with ease, no snagging or tears, even at the delicate border line of natural and relaxed hair. needless to say, this has cut my conditioning time in half. Additionally, all the ingredients in this product seem to work fabulously with my hair and with almost every other product i use (i use a lot sheamoisture, giovvanni, abba, curls) i can go thru a lot of products, but right now, esp during this transitioning period, this is DEF my base! def recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a 3B fine hair curly with normal porosity and I adore KCKT! I use it as a leave in conditioner before I apply gel and it leave my hair moisturized and well defined. It smells fruity and sweet, but its not an overwhelming odor and it dissipates quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was right for my hair, but it&#x27;s really become a can&#x27;t-live-without product.</li>
    <li> This worked even better than I thought. I used this with the Kinky curly curling custard and the tangle teaser. It worked really great and I will be purchasing more in the future.[[ASIN:B00264NW7G Tangle Teezer Original Pink]]  [[ASIN:B00449Q6I8 CURLING CUSTARD STYLING GEL 8.0 oz By KINKY CURLY]]</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling leave in conditioner. It seems to work well, but I don&#x27;t notice it to be too much better than any other moisturizing conditioner that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again, but I&#x27;m not obsessed...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have crazy combination hair with sections from 4a to 4c. I&#x27;ve been natural for more than twenty years and this is the absolute best leave-in I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair&#x27;s pretty long (mid-back bra-strap) and this gives supreme curl definition, bounce, shine, and that smooth-as-silk texture we all want in our curls. I cannot recommend this highly enough!</li>
    <li> Great, the best product for my wavy, dry and kind of freeze hair, it define my soft curls, smells wonderfully....I tried another products here and there, and I come back to this one. I really recommended it.</li>
    <li> i dont care what kind of hair you have! this is necessary for life. i have fine hair but alot of it. shrinks coils and knots easily. it creates slip its creamy but not a butter and has water. it blends with any product you use aftef. my friend with curly 3 hair aarries this everywhere she goes. i ambstill on bottle one it lasts forever! i cant fathom why anyone would bad review it.</li>
    <li> This works very well on wet hair to detangle and keep it moisturized. This product is a staple for me along with kinky curly curling custard.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  Great detangler.</li>
    <li> ok but Taliah Wajiid&#x27;s detangler worked better for my hair overall not a bad product</li>
    <li> Moisturising without being heavy or residual.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only detangler I will ever use the rest of my life unless it&#x27;s no longer made.  It smells delicious, it is silky, and it doesn&#x27;t have those chemicals or other ingredients (like mineral oil and dimethicone) that really aren&#x27;t good for you.  It&#x27;s nutritious, it works and it smells great - like mango or summer fruit.  I recommend it to everyone I know with curly, dry or biracial hair.  They love it too.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it as the &#x27;C&#x27; in my L.O.C. Process! Liquid, oil, cream method will keep u super moisturizered.</li>
    <li> Love this product. A must have for detangling curly hair. It detangles hair quickly and leaves it feeling soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter who has slightly curly hair (not that is is mid back length) that gets a lot of knots after she sleeps or while playing at school.  I have tried a bunch of brand name detangling sprays the type you can get anywhere and they did nothing.  I originally but some in her hair and I found it hard to applying it evenly across the length of her hair, it was hard to move it from the point of contact.  I then figured out if I make it into a spray by adding some to a spray bottle with water it worked for applying all over.  Now I love it and I started using it on my shoulder length hair straight from the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have been using it for a couple of years and it always does what it needs to do; that is DETANGLE and moisturize. I have not had any issues with it whatsover. Now, I&#x27;m wondering why Amazon is selling it for such a high price when you can get it from Target for $11.99 the actual website of the company for $12.00. Is it because you&#x27;re avoiding the taxes and shipping charge? Because essentially you&#x27;re not with this price. Product works but the cost is too high on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have a very loose s-curl hair pattern that can get extremely frizzy. I used Knot Today after shampooing with the Come Clean shampoo and I did not wash out the Knot Today. It is a fabulous detangler. I read somewhere that the Knot Today may work as a curl definer so I decided to try it out on my hair. Unfortunately, as my hair dried I could see, to my horror, I had almost no curl definition. Not. A. Good. Hair. Day. My hair was super-fuzzy. I ended up pulling it back and using umpteen bobby pins to salvage a very unattractive, loose &#x27;fro. The next morning I rewet my hair in the shower, applied more Knot Today, easily combed out the minimal tangles, and then applied the Kinky Curly Curling Custard while in the shower. My hair was sopping wet as I applied a moderate amount of the Curling Custard, and I let it drip dry. GORGEOUS!!! I have NEVER experienced the curl definition like I had today. So, as a detangling moisturizer, Knot Today is superb. For that I gave it five stars.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about  this product it leaves your hair soft and retains .  I wish they sold it in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters and we all have kinky curly hair. We were having a hard time finding a product that wasn&#x27;t greasy and moisturized the natural curl. This product is excellent. One of my daughter&#x27;s hair is so thick and curly, it used to take me two hours to comb through it. Now it only takes 10 minutes and it is soooo easy to manage. I wash our hair and then put the conditioner on it. I comb through it with a wide tooth comb. I don&#x27;t wash it out. Then I put the curling custard in it. As soon as I apply the custard, the hair curls right up. I don&#x27;t comb it out, I just put them on a head band or put it in a ponytail. I can leave these styles in their hair for a few days. In the morning, I spray everyone with water, rub my hands over it and keep on going. I love combing our hair now, it&#x27;s no longer a chore. This product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love it. It really works the way it should and I feel like it just brings my curls to life too.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair, this product works great on her hair.  I have tried other leave in&#x27;s but Kinky curly is my #1 choice.  It leaves her curls shiny and bouncy.  Another great thing is that the next day hair looks great, i just have to spray some water in the morning and it looks great.  Highly Highly recommend this over any other leave in&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Used this product this morning, and man it literally just slipped the knots right out of my hair!! amazing! I WILL be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Immediately eliminates any kink or knot in your hair (and I mean--IMMEDIATELY);has a pleasant scent; don&#x27;t over-apply...if you have short hair (bob,or boy-cut),a little of this stuff goes a long way. I recently realized that I need to use much more as my hair grows-- I wonder why this doesn&#x27;t come in different sizes?</li>
    <li> Helps maintain both my girls hair to a tee! Ones hair is very course and ones is very thin. A great product.</li>
    <li> Was allergic to it and doesn&#x27;t contained water as first ingredients!</li>
    <li> Thank you awesomely packed..</li>
    <li> This works!  I have a little granddaughter with very curly hair.  When they use this product, it relaxes it so it is about 2 inches longer.  Soft, manageable and smells good.  What more can you ask.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner for detangling. The kinks just melt away. It&#x27;s amazing. I always keep an extra bottle. You have got to give it a try. You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair and I love this product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This product works the absolute best on clean, saturated hair. I recommend dividing your hair into 4 parts and working bit by bit from bottom to top (my hair is very tightly coiled). Your hair doesn&#x27;t even have to be remotely detangled for this to work it&#x27;s magic! After applying the knot today to each mini section of hair within the 4 parts, I ran some kinky curling custard through to seal everything in. The product does look a little white on darker hair (mine is dark brown) but it dries clear! The whole process took about 20 mins to apply and detangle, so I allowed my hair to dry over the course of the day. It also feels a little crunchy once fully dried but just scrunch your hair in your hands all over it&#x27;s completely soft! If I pull my hair up into a pineapple and sleep with a bonnet on, the curls will stay defined for a few days and I only have to take about 5 mins or so to re-define the hair at the base (from where it was pulled into a pineapple)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-p.s. Only a dime sized amount works per sub-section you apply. It has a lot of slip!</li>
    <li> It is not what i expected, it left residue in my hair. i am not heavy hand and I apply it alone after a fresh wash. I used it once and I wasn&#x27;t impressed, it didn&#x27;t provided much slip. I might mix it with aloes and oil to see if it helps. my hair is kinky 4a/4b if that helps</li>
    <li> This detangler/leave in conditioner is what I have been missing from my hair products.  I have 3C natural, curly hair that would get tangled upon air dry.  I put this product in my hair and didn&#x27;t even need a comb! I have yet to pick it up to detangle my hair because I can just run my finger through it and then good to go.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It leaves your hair really skinny to soften the look of my curls I rub a little Shea Moisture Hair Milk in my hair after the curly custard dries followed by the Shea Moisture Hair Milk</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00128WK4I Kinky Curly Knot Today8 oz]]This review is long overdue, but is being offered at the request of an international reader who wondered why I had never written about Kinky Curly products.  I have used the full line of Kinky Curly products, but had not written about them because the Kinky Curly line is not a product marketed primarily for African American hair.  This is the first fact to keep in mind; Kinky Curly is primarily a product for women with loosely- coiled, curly hair of any race or hue.  Its creator is a very light-skinned black woman whose hair would have been what was often called in the old days \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair by less enlightened black Americans.  However, having said that, Kinky Curly&#x27;s Knot Today does a good job of detangling all types of hair.  One weekend in my household three black women with very different hair types---ranging from softly curly to slightly kinky to my tough type 4 kinks tried it and we all had tangle free hair.  The secret is to put it in while the hair is still quite damp, give it about three minutes to lubricate the  hair shafts, and then comb.  Working in smaller sections versus trying to put it through the entire headful of hair at one time is best for those with coarser, kinky hair.  Mixed chicks will love Kinky Curly products; they are thus probably great for interracial children.  The only thing that prevents me from giving the product a 5 rating is that there is not enough oil or moisturizing properties in the product for type 4 hair.  Hence, don&#x27;t expect shine or softness after using; just your hair being detangled.  Proceed immediately to your final styling product.  You can&#x27;t style with this product; it only detangles.  Read my reviews about Kinky Curly custard---unfortunately that product is not as strong in its performance for type 4 hair.</li>
    <li> Originally this product was a fail for me because I attempted to detangle with it on semi dirty hair. But when I tried it again on clean and  detangled hair, it left my hair moisturized for days! I have since come to the conclusion, that for thick 3c hair it is best as a leave in and even better mixed with other leave ins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since using it my breakage has all but stopped!</li>
    <li> I have finally decided to transition from relaxed to natural after many months of deliberating. This product ended my worries!!! Dry hair resolved..check, healthy, shiny locks...check, no greasy residue...CHECK!! Longevity and continuous use without having the &#x27;hard hair&#x27; effect..CHECK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in LOVE with this product and the way it makes my hair feel, my next shipment will contain no less than 5 bottles!! LOL :o)</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for my son. It detangles hair wonderfully. Highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Really works through the knots and leaves your hair soft</li>
    <li> Great product!  It smells great and leaves my hair soft.  Love my curls!</li>
    <li> I have very curly short hair that I almost always wear straight. I use this conditioner in the shower to rinse out after letting it soak on my hair for several minutes, and then use about a dime-size amount to leave in after I get out (underneath heat protecting spray). Once my hair has dried and been straightened I definitely notice a lack of frizz/&amp;#34;fluffiness&amp;#34; compared to when I forget to add the extra bit of leave-in conditioner. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner/detangler I have ever found. I use it one my naturak hair and my daughters and it makes it easier to comb.</li>
    <li> Also left my hair feeling super-soft. This product plus a little bit of gel and my curls are defined, not too frizzy and not as crunchy as when I use gel by itself for a leave-in. I don&#x27;t recommend using it as your only conditioner-- shampoo and condition as usual, and then use this as a supplemental leave-in for best results. And this is a matter of personal preference, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell-- very coconut-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I left the bottle upside down on my shower rack about a week after buying it and every single ounce had leaked out the next time I went to take a shower, so I wasn&#x27;t able to experiment with it as much as I&#x27;d have liked. I might end up buying another bottle, but I&#x27;ll try some other products first.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works to define curls and the smell is so good I want to eat it!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. It was such a pain for me to detangle my curls in shower. But with this product, I can easily detangle. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product arrived to me on time. I had good service. I dont know if they are products that are usually sealed but this one wasn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if they usually come like this. I like to have my products sealed so that is why I gave this a 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of the product very fresh and fruity.</li>
    <li> My curls LOVE this conditioner. I just comb in when my hair is wet and my curls stay beautiful and defined all day.  I have very thick/frizzy curly hair (Type 3B) and I do not need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it makes my scalp very itchy! I normally use Aubrey organics scalp soothing shampoo because of my dry/sensitive scalp and I&#x27;m good for at least 2-3 days, but at work I find myself just wanting to scratch, scratch, scratch after using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to avoid using this near my scalp, but that isnt too easy. Also, you can buy this at Target for about $5 less a bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this product almost daily!! and it lives up to it name NO MORE KNOTS.  I when I use this product, i hardly have any knots .</li>
    <li> I really like it!  You have to use so much of which makes it go quickly😕 and it&#x27;s exspenive 😐</li>
    <li> Holy grail product for my leave in mixture.  Works great for curly natural hair. I replaced my old leave in with this one.</li>
    <li> first of all its was not packed very well half of it was wasted during shipping and the product itself is not working very well for my natural hair. its might just be the type of my hair.</li>
    <li> 4b/c natural hair, low porosity, medium density, fine strands&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product, without mixing with anything else or adding water and my hair loves it. I use it on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;5/5 for detangling&lt;br /&gt;3.5/5 softness (hard to get my hair soft)&lt;br /&gt;3/5 shine (hard to make my 4b/c hair shine)&lt;br /&gt;5/5 quantity needed to detangle (a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;4/5 smooths cuticle&lt;br /&gt;I find my hair was getting more and more tangled the longer it got.  My hair at its longest is 19\\&quot; so imagine single strand knots and other issues.&lt;br /&gt;Been on hair boards since 1999 so I have tried many, many, many products. :-)&lt;br /&gt;KCKT is great for styling.  Apply a small amount and you can manipulate your hair into any new style.&lt;br /&gt;I can do braidouts without the previous issue I had of my roots tangling and some breakage from strands wrapping around each other.&lt;br /&gt;It has helped me keep my ends and now I don&#x27;t have to detangle with my scissors near by. Best part is detangling time has been cut from 2 hours to 1 hour, yay. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Being a male with curly hair is annoying because finding products that work well doesn&#x27;t happen often. Upon finding this product recommendation on a few different websites I was pretty apprehensive about purchasing this because most of the suggestions were from women. Not that that mattered at all, but I just wanted to know if it would work considering my hair is a few different textures and my curl pattern varies too when most women I&#x27;ve asked about this product didn&#x27;t seem to have any knowledge about how this works with in hair with my &amp;#34;situation&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that i&#x27;ve purchased this product I can say I love it and will probably never buy a different brand of leave in conditioner. I get compliments on how nice my hair looks now that i&#x27;ve been using it. It smells nice, my hair is no longer tangled, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking like you&#x27;ve got all kinds of products in it. Buy it! You&#x27;ll be glad you finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> This product works in helping spread kinky curly custard in my hair. I have a small fro so I don&#x27;t need to detangle yet. It helps me use the minimum amount of this product, so I really like it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well at smoothing out tangles and snarls. Use it with a detangling comb, and it&#x27;s a dream. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly curly hair, and this is a godsend.  I use it for styling my hair, it keeps the frizz at bay, and shows off my natural curls.  As a plus, since I&#x27;ve been using this product, my hair isn&#x27;t as dry as it was beforehand.  It has a nice smell, and isn&#x27;t sticky or stiff like some curly hair products.  Leaves your curls bouncy and soft!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I think it&#x27;s just not right for my hair. My hair felt heavy and not clean after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty slick (as in slippery) product, but it definitely helped to eliminate the frizz in my hair.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that promise so much but do too little. This product, however really works.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a leave in conditioner, I apply it generously to define my curls then I apply the custard from the same company and my curls are shiny, perfectly defined and moisturized for a lot longer!</li>
    <li> Nice enough didn&#x27;t work too well on my 4c hair.</li>
    <li> Works amazing on my hair! I&#x27;ve been searching for something that is lightweight yet conditioning for a while and this hits both requirements.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite curly hair products. Excellent amount of slip- really helps get tangles out!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and so does my hair. I&#x27;m natural and it makes the de tangling process so much easier. I also add this into my moisture hair spritz.</li>
    <li> I use this product as per instructions of the infamous Kimmaytube Leave-In Conditioner. 3 years later, using KCKT is still one of the key ingredients that I use to create the leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for detangling, but most can&#x27;t afford to buy it. It is very expensive for the small amount and doesn&#x27;t last long for that expense. Wish the price would come down as other similar products are.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner so far. I bought this for my biracial daughter (black and white). Not sure her hair type # just yet, she is 1.5 yrs old, but so far beautiful ringlets, and this conditioner exentuates her ringlets! It is light enough to put on daily and lasts all day, has absolutely no drying chemicals and her hair has never looked healthier. We also use the Mixed Chicks kids line, and like that, but this leave-in doesnt leave her hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; when it dries. It also has a nice, light scent.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair moist and silky and definitely softens the kinks. The best I have found for natural, kinky hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this product in conjuction with the curling gel. Makes my natural curls look moist and healthy.</li>
    <li> A good detangler that left my hair easy to comb.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on my 2 year old&#x27;s mixed hair. It not only moisturizes and softens,  it also detangles very easily. It works best if applied when the hair is wet. It works just as well the following day when I spray it down and comb though it with a wide wide tooth comb or pic.</li>
    <li> Left my hair super dry. I think the formula has changed? It looked shiny, almost like a shampoo. Definitely not much of a conditioner, the drug store brand was better.</li>
    <li> I need a conditioner that moisterizes. This made my hair feel dryer than it did when I started my hair care regimen. I heard so many rave reviews about it not being heavy but it was like there was nothing there in top of it drying outmy hair. People may find this product great but I will surely pass on it.</li>
    <li> I think this product has been over-hyped. I had seen it on nearly every natural hair site I checked out. When I got a chance to splurge and try it, I was sooooo disappointed. I still have almost a full bottle in the bottom of my basket of products. It&#x27;s okay as a leave-in/detangler, but it&#x27;s just not worthy of the price or hype. It left a residue in my hair and did nothing positive as far as I could see. I get better detangling results with a really good rinse-out conditioner (like Aussie Moist).</li>
    <li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair so far and from the results her hair was easier to manage. It smelled good and made her hair soft. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my hair!</li>
    <li> We figured out what the name of this product is:  You Get Knots Today!  This product made a nasty tangle worse and left a sticky residue that was difficult to wash out.  We are so disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t even have curly hair and we love it. We all use this as a conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It only takes a little bit and does a great job. I&#x27;ve even stopped using styling products because when I blow dry because hair looks great with only this. There&#x27;s so much moisture that it protects my hair from the blow dryer. I don&#x27;t use a hot blow dryer though. I just turn in to warm and it&#x27;s fine. I use this on my daughters hair and I&#x27;ve been able to throw away all those spray on kid hair detanglers that never seemed to work anyway.</li>
    <li> EXELENT. FOR PROTEIN SENSITIVE HAIR</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is MAGIC for curls. It&#x27;s lightweight, smells great and detangles hair while making it soft as well as shiny. I have thick, curly hair and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Let me just say, this was the product that made me appreciate my hair. After I started using it, my hair just began growing like crazy, and it was at it&#x27;s longest. I have 3B/3A curls, and this definitely does the trick. I don&#x27;t normally hair tangles or any knot problems with my hair, but I needed moisture. This gave me wonderfully moisturized curls, and volume at the same time, which is what I want. The complements started coming in as soon as I started using this. I didn&#x27;t use it alone though, I put mousse on top of it for more volume, &amp; sometimes some oil on my ends. It works fabulously AND it&#x27;s natural. If I had to recommend one product for curly hair, it would definitely be this leave in conditioner. BUY IT !</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave-in. All natural without the extras. I have a short, tightly coiled, permanently-colored afro that loves a lot of moisture. I&#x27;m low maintenance, so I typically spray my hair with water every day, raking Knot Today through it only a few times a week (I wash every 5 days). My curls are soft, shiny and moist. I&#x27;ve read that it can elongate your curls, but I use it to define mine. I guess it depends on your individual hair texture. I&#x27;m due for another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent leave in conditioner.  I use about a half dollar size after washing my hair and it really leave my hair soft and is a great detangler,  I also use it on my sons hair, I just brush a little in and it really makes his hair wave up.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in condition I have come across. Works great for &amp;#34;second day&amp;#34; hair. Just spritz your hair with a little water and then apply about a quarter size amount to each side of your head. Doesn&#x27;t make your  air crunchy</li>
    <li> It works well when paired with the shampoo and gel..</li>
    <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that really detangles my dried out, messed up hair. Not cheap but much less than the more expensive stuff that did nothing.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my hair type (long, thick, coarse, color-treated and naturally spiral curls). It smells soooo good, goes on with a light weight feel but packs a lot of curl-taming punch! I am a huge fan of this line and so happy after spending years looking for a great product for my hair type to find this.</li>
    <li> Awesome slip and softness on my natural hair. Would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I have a combination 3c and 4a hair (3c on the edge, 4a on the crown) and this is the biggest lifesaver for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the entire line of Kinky Curly, and while it works wonders, it&#x27;s really costly. I recently started just using Pantene Pro-V shampoo (about twice a month) with Kinky Curly as the conditioner and detangler, and it&#x27;s just so smooth.....ah, wonderful! I&#x27;ve tried so many detanglers and this is the only one that I know 100% will work. When I use it as a leave-in, my hair is always soft since it also works as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not  curl-defining on its own, so I usually use Shea Moisture Shea Butter leave-in (I can only find it online....) to keep my hair smelling good and moisturized as well as get some definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO TIP: Don&#x27;t buy it online, buy it from Target! Only $11.99 there!</li>
    <li> And it&#x27;s awesome! It doesn&#x27;t make her hair crunchy or leave it dry but it does leave it nice and soft when it dries and her curls look fab :)&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot though and this seller is upping the price. It&#x27;s cheaper at target or the actual product web site. The product web site Also sells a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. It works wonders as a detangler. I use a quarter size all over my hair before I start to comb through my curls. It leaves my hair feeling really soft too. This product is one of my staples. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for months and I&#x27;ve still got 1/4th of the bottle left.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t. I applied the product after I had shamppod and conditioned my hair.  As I applied it, I noticed that my hair was soft like I had read in so many reviews. I proceeded to comb trough my hair with a detangle brush, and it was VERY difficult for me to comb through my hair. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. My Cantu shea butter leave in (which is only $6 and makes my hair feel like butter after its dry) is SO much superior to this product. I took that stuff back. I got my Cantu and I&#x27;m sticking with it. I did however like how it made my curls pop. So, I&#x27;d give it 2 stars. I have 3c hair btw.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim and advice of a friend.  I decided to go natural and needed something that would condition my hair but not leave it sticky.  I tried this as a leave in and it was wonderful.  The curling custard doesn&#x27;t do for my hair what I want it to do.  I then used the Knot Today to assist in my braid outs.  I put it on to detangle my hair, comb through with a wide tooth comb, put a little Knot Today on my fingers while I braid my hair.  I have the best braid outs with this stuff!!  I have 4b hair- it&#x27;s soft but it&#x27;s really cottony and hard to define the curls before it gets super fluffy and frizzy.  My curls don&#x27;t define well, but with Knot Today and a braid out,my hair has been extra cute lately!!! Try it, you  might like it and your hair may love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is good for getting moisture into the hair and making it easier to comb. The problem I have with it is that after my hair dries, I am left with dry, crunchy hair I guess because there&#x27;s no glycerin or other oils in this product. I like the fact that it is non-greasy but in order to get pass crispy dry hair, you will need to put something else in your hair. Oh, I&#x27;m also not too crazy about the price which is $12 bucks at the whole food market. If they can find a way for the hair to remain soft after applying it, I would continue to buy it but for now, I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this entire line of products more than 5 stars...........its rating is off the charts. I can&#x27;t say enough GREAT things about this line (so many people already have). I pray it NEVER EVER goes away. Its the only thing I use and I love it! Thank You Shelley Campbell for creating a hair product line that&#x27;s not only healthy for our hair but also does what is says it will do. To all the skeptics...........don&#x27;t think, just buy it. I promise you it will not disappoint. And p.s........its for anyone with curly, kinky, wavey, fine, coarse, or a mixture of everything hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works amazing.</li>
    <li> This product does the job.[...]</li>
    <li> Did not agree with my scalp.  Caused some itching.  Gave it to someone who can use it.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. This rating is for the product its okay. Doesn&#x27;t detangle as well.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Very moisturizing to the hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft. Does not curl my hair unless I use it with the Kinky Curls. Together they stop breakage.</li>
    <li> I have a curly haired dog that costs me a fortune every month at the groomers to have the knots removed from her hair.  Plus I have a nightly struggle with her an a comb trying to maintain her coat.  I bought this product out of desperation.  When the product arrived, I immediately washed her and while she was still damp, I put the product in her hair as a leave in.  I was able to comb right through her curls immediately.  Then I used a blow dryer on low setting and continued to comb.  She looks amazing.  Even better than when she returns from the groomer.  She has soft curly waves, no knots right down to her scalp.  I understand that this product was not intended for pets, and am not recommending anyone use human products on pets without speaking with a pet care professional.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my daughter hair texture..as a first time user I saw a difference in using this...more moisture in the hair and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> These pieces are very good for my hair like it very well as low-priced thank you amazon very much love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this like twice and it worked okay but my hair felt thick and i had to wash it out that same day</li>
    <li> Nothing special. This is the second time I decided to try to  use this product and quite frankly, it&#x27;s just &#x27;ok.&#x27; I probably will not continue to use it for my routine hair are.</li>
    <li> I used this product after washing my 3c 4a TWA. I am very tender headed and this really helped to comb through my hair. The problem came when I added my daily products. It curdled! At least that&#x27;s what it looked like! It left itty bitty white dots in my hair. I had to rinse it out. I thought maybe the K-CKT didn&#x27;t mix well with the other products so I gave it a second try with different products. Same yucky white mess! I continue to use this product as it does very well detangling my hair, but because I have to rinse it out prior to styling, I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great for natural hair and keratin treated hair. I don&#x27;t love the smell but it dissipate after a couple of minutes it&#x27;s gone so I guess it&#x27;s ok. Helps a lot with frizz and curl definition. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and use when your hair is really wet or you will get flaking. I use it with the Curling Custard and love the results. I&#x27;ve been trying out new products in my quest for cleaner, safer personal care items. This product works great and is pretty clean except for phenoxyethanol [...]. I&#x27;d give this 4 stars if it didin&#x27;t contain phenoxyethanol. So I&#x27;ll finish my bottle and try to find something a little more green to use with th Curling Custard.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair every 3 days....natural curly girl</li>
    <li> This is total price gouging! You can get this same product size and all at soap.com for 12.50! Don&#x27;t get ripped off!</li>
    <li> I have a daughter who is ten years old and is very tender headed and has thick, coil hair.  To comb her hair was like pulling teeth,to say the least it was a fight for at least an hour. I dreaded combing her hair and she dreaded me combing it.  Went to youtube and came across a video talking about Kinky Curly. Even though I wasn&#x27;t buying it I still wanted to try it.  I mean what would it hurt.  Baby am glad I did.   I know I might sound like a commercial when I say this but Knot Today Detangling conditioner saved our life.  I am truly thankful for this product and any one with a little girl who has thick, curl hair that tangles, this is the best product today that I came across that really detangles. It really allows you an opportunity to comb the hair through before it kink up.  As cliche as it sounds, All I can say is, Thanks Kinky Curly.</li>
    <li> This product is okay I use the kimmaytube method from you tube, Im natural  but if you use it by itself the hair seems a little dry but will I purchase it again probably not.</li>
    <li> This is the best for curly hair!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  It&#x27;s oil free, natural, and not heavy, but makes curly hair more manageable and styleable.  My hair looks incredible when I use this stuff. I&#x27;m addicted.  I have thick, frizzy 3c types of curls.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use it very often. I have 2C hair and use it after conditioning while my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> This review is as the product worked on a 3 year old African American Puerto Rican mixed girl with tight natural spiral curls. The product, once dry, made her scalp itch and it clumped her curls together making her hair matted and dry feeling. We&#x27;ll be sticking with mixed chicks products.</li>
    <li> Prefer this one over over the custard</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand any of the negative reviews. I suppose it&#x27;s possible some may have hair that is beyond help.  This leaves my hair so soft.  The tangles seem to melt away.  It smells fantastic and it is all natural!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product reading the other reviews is not how my hair felt like .  my hair felt dirty .....  Too expensive for me not to like it !</li>
    <li> If you have hair that looks like cotton with no curl pattern what so ever this is how you get this product to work on your head of hair.  I have seen so many sisters put this in their hair soaking wet and instantly poof....they get nice curl definition!  I have had this product for about year and I was using it as a leave, I never got any real curl definition but I like the way it smelled and it felt good on this out of control head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time ever, I got this product to work.  I washed my hair with the Come Clean Shampoo (KCK - Product) and I used a deep conditioning treatment LeKair Cholesterol that was mixed with a little Herbal Essence Conditioner, bagged my Afro, and sat  under a hood dryer for 15 minutes then a rinse.  I used the knot for today on wet hair, and finally curl definition!  My conclusion,&lt;br /&gt;for 4B and 4C hair this product needs a good layer of glycerin or something to sit on to work for coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a difficult product to use but if you can get it to work, you can have some nice curls.  I also noticed that if you spritz your hair with water you can get a little snap back curl reformation on second day hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the KC Gel, I don&#x27;t care for it, it is styling gel and I don&#x27;t like crunchy hair so...pass on that...plus the price is insane, I don&#x27;t care for it on twist outs either.  Try Oyin Whipped Butter, its the only thing that gives you shine, moisture, and no crunch.  The jane Carter Solution,nourish and shine is also a pass...if you put it on your hands, and your ashy an hour later...it is not going to do the job on your afro (stay moisturized!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillian</li>
    <li> I love the item it is a staple product of mine and I can&#x27;t live without it; which is why I am so infuriated with this seller beccause they still have not even shipped my product and I NEED IT! I would cancel it but no one else is selling it! I will not buy from this seller again but I will continue to use this product (and plan ahead!)</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected. Had little to no effect on hair tangles, did no make it much easier to get the comb through. Ok as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Came fast and works great !</li>
    <li> I admit I was a bit sceptical, but seeing all the positive reviews on this I decided to give it a try... and let me tell you.. WOW!.. Ever since October when I got a perm I have had knots in my hair and using a pick didnt seem to get all the knots out so I had to use a brush which ended up pulling my hair out all the time and was painful.. I could hear it ripping my hair and took forever to brush it out but now my hair is so soft and silky!! I was able to run my fingers right through my hair with ease and no pain before the pick even touched my hair! I use it as a leave in and its wonderful!! You dont need much.. I have long to my butt hair and its thick so I use two nickel sized amounts with maybe an extra dab of a dime size if that and thats all I need.. I can see this lasting me at least a month or a little more.. So all in all its really not that expensive when a little does go a long way!.. And the smell is awesome.. It doesnt overpower your shampoo and conditioner smell which if your like me and have a shampoo and conditioner you love the smell of and love your hair to smell like it, its a PLUS PLUS! I would recommend this to all curly haired men and women out there whos hair done like mine before I found this product..I just cant say enough about it!! Thank you \\&quot;Kinky-Curly KNOT TODAY\\&quot; for making a product that truely works!! :D  P.S. Its also Organic which makes this a PLUS PLUS PLUS for me and my hair doesnt feel greasy.. ;)</li>
    <li> loved this product, it really left my hair soft and really detangled it. I have really coarse curly hair.I highly recommend. you only need to use a nickle size amount on WET hair.</li>
    <li> I switched to Kinky Curly Knot Today Conditioner after Shea Moisture Reconstructive Conditioner stopped working for me. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found anything to compare to Shea Moisture Reconstructive Shea Butter Conditioner. I will try their African Black Soap Balancing one next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke my heart to pay $12 for a conditioner, but I had heard so many good things about this one that I figured that it would redeem itself with the way it made my hair look and feel. I&#x27;m still on the fence about this conditioner, let me explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not need to use a lot of this Leave-In, which is the first nice thing about it. I only need about a dime size per section of hair. If I use any more, I find that my hair gets rather limp and odd looking. The smell is also very nice-it smells like mango. I do like that this conditioner is all natural, and it is also one of the rare leave-ins that I am not afraid to also use as a styler. Just leaving a little bit of this product in my hair and letting it air dry will OCCASIONALLY result in beautifully defined curls. I say occasionally because that&#x27;s just the thing-this only happens every once in awhile. The other times I use this as a styler, it leaves my hair frizzy and undefined. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with this-probably it&#x27;s something in the amount I&#x27;m using. I am NOT a girl to mess around with product distribution (aka if I pour it in my hand, whatever size it ends up is the size that goes in my hair) so that is a BIG thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Kinky Curly Knot Today as a styler would not be enough to redeem this product, but there&#x27;s also the fact that it plays well with my everyday styler, my beloved Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls. When I use KCKT my hair turns out so soft and touchable. There&#x27;s also almost no frizz. It also works really well underneath my Lush Revive and Balance. I find I can get the most moisture when I use those two products combined. Really, it&#x27;s a win-win when used underneath a styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have with this leave-in is that for some reason, it ALWAYS feels greasy. When I put this in my hand and emulsify it(rub my hands together to distribute product evenly), my hands always feel greasy afterwards. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s this weird film in the product that leaves behind that nasty feeling. Even after I apply the product to my hair, I have to rub my hands on a towel to rid them of that feeling. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has this problem. Luckily, the product does NOT leave that same greasy film on my hair, otherwise I would not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good product, but I probably will not re-purchase after I run out.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Came quickly and works well!</li>
    <li> I have naturally Curly hair that is very thick and I have a lot of different curl types in my Hair. This and Mixed chicks leave in conditioner are the TWO BEST Products for my hair!!!!!!! :) I have ordered this 2 times already :)</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It was like putting water on my hair and walking out the door.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great product for my 4c hair. My hair is soft, manageable, and so easy to comb through after shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer especially for twists/ twistouts, and black natural hair. Detangles well.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long kinky hair, part African-American, part Jewish of caucasian descent.  After buying about 20 different hair goops, this one is looking like the winner.  I&#x27;ve asked her to keep using each one I bought independently and tell me which one works best, by itself.</li>
    <li> I think anyone with kinky or curly hair knows detangling is one of the most tedious parts. I bought this product in the hopes it would cut down my detangling time, which can take up to 45 minutes (I have 2C/3A hair for reference). I first applied this product in my damp hair and that didn&#x27;t seem to work, my hair just became hard and sticky, and it seemed to make it more tangled. A few days later I tried it in my dry hair same result: hard, dry, sticky, tangled hair. I really wanted to love this product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It smells good though.</li>
    <li> This product has been a key part of how I got my natural curl back. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with Type 4 hair and use this product as instructed on Soaking wet hair and it seems to work very well in terms of keeping my hair moisturized. If I just lightly spritz my hair with water the next day and it still seems to work.</li>
    <li> This product really seems to help set my curls after washing and helps to keep them from getting so tangled at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Great for combing and finger detangling wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a detangler, leave in conditioner and setting product all in one! Natural curly girls, give this one a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Kinky Curly Knot Today for two weeks now and I just love the way it detangles my hair and makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have naturally curly hair and I love how my curls look once they dry 😀</li>
    <li> This product works very well for my natural curly hair. It&#x27;s expensive but it easily combs through my hair and leave it feeling nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I found so far for my daughters hair. Her hair is very curly but also thin. I found Kinky Curly to be very light and it did not weigh down her hair but made pulling a comb through very easy. Her curls stay nice all day which is a miracle for a five year old, all other products were nice right after styling but the end of the day we just had a frizzy mess. Although amazon charges WAY TOO MUCH! Buy it somewhere else you&#x27;ll love it! I get mine at Target was hoping Amazon had it at a better price.</li>
    <li> I liked this product on my 4b hair. It enhanced the curl/wave pattern without a lot of shrinkage and had a nice smell. So, you may wonder why only 3 stars? Well, I have A LOT of hair and had to use A LOT of product. Unfortunately, my finances cannot sustain me using half a bottle of product, that costs approximately $18, in one sitting. The same goes for the Kinky Curly Curling Custard. If I wanted to spend this much money on hair care products, I would have continued RELAXING my hair!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product for very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is that it&#x27;s not sticky, helps tame frizz, and keeps my locks separate.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite economical by comparison to the MANY MANY products I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
    <li> As a recovering product junkie, I have used Mane &amp; Tail, Redken, Carol&#x27;s Daughter, and regretfully Miss Jessie&#x27;s. This is HANDS down the only thing that has successfully moisturized my hair. It has a light smell and texture. I purchased one bottle in February of 2012 and did not have to replace it until August of 2012. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knot Today is best used after a deep shampoo and conditioner. I wash with Alba Acai Shampoo and Conditioner. Then I finger de-tangle with the mixed Kinky Curly with the jojoba, castor oil aloe elixir (Kimmay Tube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful results. My hair, which was once short, brittle and fragile, is now longer, thick, soft and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God more black women are discovering scientific solutions to managing our beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Ever since I went natural I have been trying to get my mother to at least consider using natural hair products for her and my sister hair. Every time she ignored me. Finally she decided to go shopping for some natural products and picked this up when I returned from school and found this I immediately wanted to try it after hearing all its reviews when I say it made my hair so easy to detangle I seriously could not believe it I have not found a product that offers as much slip as this one! What makes me want to boast its excellence even more is the fact that it works wonderfully on my younger sister&#x27;s hair who has wavy/loose curly hair. We can&#x27;t usually use the same products because my hair is a kinky texture. But it worked perfect on both of our hair I just had to use a little less on hers. Both of our hair although very different textures tends to tangle and knot up easily but not with this it cut our detangling time down a great deal. I do not see how this product could get bad reviews! This product is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. It leaves my sons hair soft</li>
    <li> This product works well for my daughter&#x27;s combo 3B/3C hair. We have gone through a lot of products...  A LOT. I&#x27;ve tried them all - and yet we keep going back to this because it works. I use this leave-in after I&#x27;m done washing, conditioning, detangling and rinsing my daughter&#x27;s hair. I comb it through her hair section by section while the hair is SOAKING wet. I think that makes a difference. This product provides great slip (without silicones - yay!). You have to experiment and find out the amount that works for you.    In the morning, I spray my daughter&#x27;s hair with a little water, add a little more of this leave in and then detangle and she&#x27;s set for the day. Her curls are nice and bouncy once they are completely dry. You have to give it a minute. The curls and/or the curl pattern may look funny, fuzzy or off while wet. But when the hair dries, the curls should be in tact.    I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because I notice at times -at the end of the day- my daughter&#x27;s hair is a little dry. If your hair is a little dry naturally, you&#x27;ll need something else to add a teeny bit more moisture (like a pomade or an oil).</li>
    <li> I detangle my hair while washing out my conditioner and then this works well to do a comb through before I style.  I often only apply raw shea butter over it and do twists in my afro-kinky natural hair and my hair feels moisturised for up to 3 days.  Not sure if I would repurchase because of the price but it definitely works.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing! I have never put on a detangler or conditioner that works as well as this product. To test it out, I tousled my hair around in the shower and I had plenty of knots. Knot Today, took them out so fast and the best thing is I had no pain while using my wide tooth comb. I used this as a leave in and it made my hair feel really moisturized, and my curls are well defined, soft and bouncy. It smells so nice and it&#x27;s somewhat pricey, but in my opinion, I think this product is worth the money. I will be using Knot Today daily.</li>
    <li> There is no way the reviews on this website can have any ounce of truth...perhaps folks are experiencing buyer&#x27;s remorse for spending so much money on a small bottle of conditioner.    I just finished using this...well basically the conditioner is still sitting in my head because by now I have combed out half a head full of knots.  No EASY detangling.  No EASY combing.  None of that...ALL LIES!!!!    It&#x27;s as if there is no effect at all using this conditioner...all it is is slimy gunk on your hair...no managibility, no softness.  I&#x27;m STILL combing out knots.  It was NEVER this difficult EVER.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I WILL BE WRITING THE MAKERS OF THIS AND LETTING THEM KNOW; I WILL ALSO POST A NEGATIVE REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT ANY AND EVERYWHERE I CAN!!!!    People need not be duped like I was!!!!    Seriously.  I can&#x27;t believe how sorry this conditioner is.  Truly pathetic.    Unhappy (no longer a) customer of KC products!</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair and was looking for a leave-in conditioner to moisturize my dry ends...This product was able to deliver great results. I would definately purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never paid so much for a hair care product but I am glad that I did. Living in Hawai&#x27;i, the water is unprocessed and torture for my hair, this made it possible to comb through my hair in minutes which previously took over 10 and ended with a ton of hair loss. Love the product and worth every penny for the complete set!!</li>
    <li> I have super thick 4a/b hair. I love using this product as a leave-in after washing out the conditioner. I massage it into my hair as soon as I step out of the shower, and then I section it off. 10-30 minutes later I can comb through my hair (I wear it in twistouts)  with ease. This is the best and only leave in I use. This product works on damp hair, but it works even better on wet hair- it also smells good (not very strong). Be careful not to use too much or else your hair will look white before it dries.</li>
    <li> This product has great reviews but it did not work for me. This is not simply a Knot today, this is never again.&lt;br /&gt;I am a mix of Japanese and Black and my hair is very curly.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this product does no better than using a shampoo/conditioner combination like Pantene and comb/detangle while washing your hair. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I left the product in my hair like the instructions said and it made my hair limp.&lt;br /&gt;I always use Paul Mitchell&#x27;s super sculpt lotion to define my curls and leaving both products in my hair was too much.&lt;br /&gt;The search continues...I would not re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This is probably my all time favortie leave in conditioner. The smell is not so strong and once I apply it, I get instant results.</li>
    <li> It would be a regular purchase if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  However, it does what it says.  I found that with a small size of product distributed through hair that it allowed for easier detangling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner, so it does keep my hair soft. I leave it in overnight. I would certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> My conditioner finished, so I had to get another one.  I love this product it thick and creamy.  A bottle last me approximately 6 months. A really good buy.</li>
    <li> The only thin I don&#x27;t like about this product is that when your hair is not completely dry it will leave white product on my hair. Other then that the product is OK.</li>
    <li> I have curly (3a) hair (curls are s shape). I LOVE this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> I have 4C very coarse, thick as wool hair. My hair is a light brown so it is very dry. I have tried so many different conditioners but they all seem to just sit on my hair with no slip and my hair would dry like an old wool rug before I could comb it out. I saw this on some site and thought okay I will try, however I do not have bouncy curls, I suffer major shrinkage. This product is the only thing that has made my post wash comb out easy. It makes my very very very coarse hair detangled and  has an excellent slip. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other products in this line, again I use this solely for a detangle agent .If you have hair like mine, I suggest this product, apply to wet hair, part your hair in sections with clips and use a denman brush that has been modified for 4c hair. As you brush your hair add more conditioner to knots or dry spots, hair needs to be wet when brushed/combed. This product will have the brush gliding thru your hair, I promise .</li>
    <li> Got this to remove the knots in my dogs hair as suggested by someone. Works. Never used it on myself. Good for matted pet hair!</li>
    <li> I use this with my curly girl hair care routine as my leave in conditioner. I leaves my curls soft, fluffy and fragrant.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is no leave in. This has no water. Put this on your hair and it leaves it sticky and not moisturised at all. Worse, after it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; in, my hair feels dry and strange, even when I mix it with water. It also leaves unsightly residue on the hair. This is my second time around using it. I did this time because it has no protein and I only recently realised that my hair is suffering because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie, with tons of leave-in conditioners in my hair care arsenal. However, I keep coming back to Knot Today. It&#x27;s light, moisturizing and dries clear. I have a twa and rarely use a comb, so I don&#x27;t use it to detangle.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars, because it smelled good and feels good in my hair, but my hair is a little too thin for this conditioner! I think it only works better if you have thick hair!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I ever used and I&#x27;ve used quit a bit.</li>
    <li> i have 4B,4C combination hair and i like the knot today product because it smells great and defines my curls. I have used it together with the kinky curly custard and organics hair pudding for my twist out and i love the results. overall the product is worth it.</li>
    <li> I went back \\&quot;natural\\&quot; after 30+ years of chemicals and I was concerned about combing and becoming \\&quot;tender-headed\\&quot;. I used the shampoo and my hair was squeaky clean: then I used the detangler and my comb glided through without any pain!! OMG I love this stuff!! If I want straight hair, I&#x27;ll use my flat comb...no more chemicals...EVER!!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products! Never need to comb or brush my curls after a shower if I apply this to my towel dried hair.</li>
    <li> Its Expensive but really do the job....Its a natural product and smell good&lt;br /&gt;Im natural hair and its the first time that a natural product work for my hair....i have to wait if this will continous like now...</li>
    <li> I have kinky-coily hair and I live in Central Texas....that means my hair must fight extreme heat and moderate humidity most times of the year. Since going natural, my hair would break a lot in the summer until I discovered Kinky Curly Knot Today. This product has literally saved my hair and restored its texture. I highly recommend this product to anyone living in extreme weather environment--especially if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair. Although it did make detangling a lil easier but it didnt make my hair shine or anything. once it dried and my hair still look dull and not moisturized. People claimed it is a water based moisturizer but there is no water in the ingredients. I guess yu have to spritz yur hair before applying to get some affect for some people</li>
    <li> My go  to for all natural leave in. I use it almost daily!</li>
    <li> the only detangler I use!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing leave-in!  The first time I used it, I was impressed by the slip.  It&#x27;s so easy to comb/brush my hair when I use this.  But that&#x27;s not the reason for the 5 stars.  It gets 5 stars because it curls my curls like nothing that I&#x27;ve tried before or after.  When I rake this through my natural hair, the curls pop!  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other leave-ins (Giovanni, Cantu, Eden Bodyworks, etc.), and nothing works like Knot Today.  As soon as I rake a little of this through my hair, my hair curls and coils (and the frizz disappears).  Styling products, no matter what brand, look much better as long as I use this first.  I wish that I could buy it by the bucket.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to like this product! I do like the way my hair felt, but alas I am allergic to it. I immediately began itching and burning on my scalp and hairline after using it. I began to break out and my eczema flared as well. I did some research, and if you have sensitive skin you may be allergic to the slippery elm in the product. I am also allergic to aloe vera, so this does not surprise me. Just be aware that some may experience bad reactions to the product. I am in the process of learning to make my own organic conditioners so I can control what goes into it. I only use natural products on my hair, and I was excited about this one. It does leave my hair super soft, but I can&#x27;t use it. :(</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used this a recommendation from some of the natural hair youtubers and it works well. I use it in a mixture with a few essential oils and it works well on my twist outs. I am currently rocking my TWA so it was do great to finally find a product that worked!</li>
    <li> I have used many many conditioners and leave-ins and I like KinkyCurly Knot Today the best for incredibly soft, lightweight, frizz-free, curls/waves.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The conditioner is exceptional for type 4 hair. The seller &amp;#34;Good Hair Day&amp;#34; shipped on time and asks a competitive price. I am satisfied and will definitely use them again!</li>
    <li> So I had to choose between &amp;#34;Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;As I Am Coconut leave-in&amp;#34;.. Both work great... EXCEPT... I found that I needed to use more product with the &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; in order to achieve the &amp;#34;ideal&amp;#34; curl definition. (Keep in mind that they&#x27;re both 8 oz.) Within 2 weeks.. my &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; was more than half-empty. :/ Spending the extra $4 on KC was actually the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made.  With the Kinky Curly, a little goes a long way. My curls had a lot of definition/ was easy to de-tangle in minutes. This is coming from a 3c/4a natural who has extremely thick hair. Ladies, please stop being cheap with your hair.. an extra $4 won&#x27;t hurt and is definitely worth it &amp;#60;3 This is a MUST-HAVE product and I WILL be purchasing again. :) I hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> This is a fairly thick, creamy conditioner that detangles hair and works well as a leave-in. It has a pleasant smell.    For the best curl definition, I&#x27;ve learned to apply an amount that seems like too much, about four to six handfuls.  I comb the conditioner through my hair,  wet it one last time before getting out of the shower, wrap it in an old T shirt or pillowcase and wait for 15 minutes. I remove the wrap and let my hair air dry, or sit under a dryer if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was very skeptical. Yes it is expensive . I saturated my hair and put a quarter size in my hair comb it through and let it air dry. Awesome curls. Love it. My only complaint is when my hair dries its a little crunchy. I guess the curling custard may prevent that I don&#x27;t know haven&#x27;t tried that. I&#x27;ve just been enjoying the curls for the last two days. I have 4b/c hair.</li>
    <li> It really lengthens the curls and my hair looks thicker than it is.  My braids even have a lot of body.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair really greasy, don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
    <li> I use this prose after I deep condition my hair and it leaves it moisturizers. I also use this as a pick me up if my hair gets dry. This product is perfect for detangling</li>
    <li> I adore this product it makes detangling my 4 year olds hair a breeze which is saying something with her insanely thick kinky curls!</li>
    <li> This really did not help my kinky curly hair...I was sadly disappointed on it&#x27;s lack of detangling ability.</li>
    <li> For the past 10 years I have struggled with my daughters 4c hair , until I found this product, now after shampooing and conditioning her hair I apply the knot today leave in detangler and its much easier to comb the hair and she comes home from school with the same beautiful curls as in the morning , no frizz! , it smells nice too.</li>
    <li> The Kinky Curly product line is awesome!  It does exactly what it says. The Come Clean shampoo lathers up well and smells great.  My hair was clean and not stripped.  The Knot Today conditioner is a great leave in conditioner!  My hair is very thick.  It detangled my hair with no problems.  The Curling Custard is worth every penny!  It goes a long way too.  My hair is curly, soft, and has a nice sheen.  I usually have to two-strand twist my hair for the wave pattern to keep, but with the custard I just section of my hair a pull the custard down to my ends.  It waves and curls up instantly!  If the weather is too cool to air dry, I use a soft bonnet dryer to dry my hair.  The hair spritz has a nice hold; my hair is still soft afterward.  I would recommend this product line to anyone who has natural kinky curly hair!</li>
    <li> This product works on all curl types and hair textures.  My hair is very fine, and the Knot Today detangles and moisturizes my curls like a dream, with no buildup or greasy residue.  A little goes a long way, and it works beautifully under the Curling Custard.  I only wish it came in a bigger bottle, because I go through it a lot faster than the custard.</li>
    <li> I like this because it detangles great, but I didn&#x27;t like it as a leave in for my hair. My hair is already curly so to me it made the curl pattern tighter and curlier. I like my curls loose.</li>
    <li> Have used products that were better, for the price not soooo great.  More words required... Crazy requirements for leaving feedback</li>
    <li> Good leave in and de tangled for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this products. I read reviews on it before, but it was not until I used it for my self that I was convinced. Using it in conjunction with the kinky curling custard leaves my curls super defined.</li>
    <li> absolutely brilliant! couldn&#x27;t ask for a better for my 2 year olds hair. leaves it soft and defined every time :-)</li>
    <li> Must buy!!  Love this product.  I have purchased this item for approx. 2-3 years now and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago along with Kinky Curly Come Clean shampoo. I used the 2 together and hated the result! I didn&#x27;t continue using the stuff until recently when I found it again and thought to give it another try. This time I loved it! I used it on dry hair and did a twist out. I loved the definition and the softness of my hair! I believe I will continue using this for twists outs</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local Target store and so far so good.  I have fine, wavy/curly type 2b/2c hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do is, wash my hair and I then section my hair into four parts. I part my hair from front to back and then from hear to ear.  I then apply tiny amounts of this to every section and it works great at keeping my hair conditioned and I can comb through it with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down at all.  If you have fine hair, like I do, I think the key is not to drench your hair in it.  And a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is OK, I don&#x27;t love it but I don&#x27;t hate it.  Its smells citric to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I wish it came in a pump dispenser bottle.  It can be difficult to get the product out of this narrow bottle easily with it being a thick consistency.  And also because I wish it smelled better.  Again its not a bad scent, but I don&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good leave-in conditioner, give this one a try and use it in small amounts until you figure out the correct amount you need for your hair needs.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff for moisturizing and detangling my natural, kinky, curly hair.  It took me forever to try this product because I was skeptical, but I wish I had tried it sooner!  It makes my hair soft and silky, and cuts my detangling time in half.  Usually my arms are tired after a detangling session, but not with this product!  My wide tooth comb goes through with ease.  I recommend this to anyone with kinky curly hair!  BUT the price on Amazon stinks.  It costs $11.99 at target; buy it there instead.</li>
    <li> Great products!!! I love this product. It&#x27;s smells wonderful &amp; works really well. The price was really good also will buy again.</li>
    <li> Once this is on your curly hair, fingers or brush just glides through, amazing!  Curly girls, you gotta have it ;)</li>
    <li> Finally something that detangles my daughter&#x27;s tight curls and knots. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I went out and purchased this expensive product - paired with the KCCC and it does absolutely nothing for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t detangle it. It doesn&#x27;t add moisture. It doesn&#x27;t add shine. I have 3c hair, I believe... Nevertheless, this is supposed to be the holy grail of products so I feel like it should work on ALL hair types. My hair isn&#x27;t that much of a force to be reckoned with therefore, I don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t working. It says apply generously on the label. I did and still nothing and it doesn&#x27;t smell all that good to me either. I will never purchase this again. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It easily cut combing time in half for our 5 yr old daughter who has a very very tight curl.  And I have tried everything I could get my hands on.  I used it for the first time at the beach and thought maybe it was the water.  But it worked just as well at home !</li>
    <li> YES IT SMELLS GOOD I USED IT PART AS THE KIMMAYTUBE LEAVE IN CONDITIONER.. AGAIN LIKE I SAID IM NOT TO CRAZY ABOUT IT, IT SMELLS GOOD BUT FOR 12.99 I EXPECTED IT TO LIVE UP TO ITS NAME YES IT DEFINED HER CURLS MORE BUT TO ME IT DIDNT MOISTURIZE HER HAIR BY ITSELF IT NEED A BOOST WITH CASTOR OIL SO I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT NOR WOULD I TRY IT AGAIN A WAISTE OF 12.99</li>
    <li> did not like this product not enough of moisturizing more fluff not enough stuff great for other types of hair.</li>
    <li> amazing product, saved me hell of a headache brushing my little girl&#x27;s course hair.</li>
    <li> Like the product. Brand comes recommended. Did not dislike anything about it and would recommend to others for use. thanks</li>
    <li> Having 4c hair, I tried this product after doing a big chop. It was the 1st product I tried when going natural,that I purchased from from target.&lt;br /&gt; I purchased just two products from this line, they were: not today leave-in &amp; the custard. I first only found the custard. Tried it and did not find the results I was expecting. So I proceeded to look for the other products. Finding only the custard as the other products were sold out I tried out the products anyway.&lt;br /&gt; I used the not today leave-in after shampooing my hair, and found how easy is was to run my fingers through my hair with this product on my wet hair. As it offers you can leave it in or wash it out. I chose to rinse some of the product out, just as a way to make water my main moisturizer and then applied the custard.&lt;br /&gt;I did not blow dry my hair afterwards and my hair remained wet for quite sometime(i never blow-dried my hair so take that into consideration when using this product if you prefer to blowdry). After a days time, you will realize where you distributed the custard or where you did not. Where you did not put the custard where you may have thought, will be dry first and frizzy. So you have to make sure you have time to go over ever strand to get your results.&lt;br /&gt; I later purchased the shampoo and it really cleans your hair of build up. I have not tried the pomade nor the night foam but maybe some day when I get a bonus or extra money I can review them. The products are amazing but the cost is crazy. But I think I am going to go back because it was the best mosturizer, detangler, cleaner that I spent money on that is all natural. No 5 stars because of the price for the size.</li>
    <li> OK, my title pretty much says it all! Kinky-Curly Knot Today is about the same price as all the other vegan/all-natural/cruelty-free/insert-something-else-here curly-girl products at your local shops. However, the coconut-y tropical smell is what pulled me in. That, and I told myself that I could get more use out of this instead of the Jane Carter Curl Defining Cream because I would be able to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is HORRIBLE for detangling extremely curly and kinky hair! The product is so gloopy that it&#x27;s great for locking in moisture or setting my styles, but it&#x27;s absolutely awful for detangling hair! Instead of separating the strands with slippery goodness, it makes them clump together. I had a lot a KNOTS at the ends of my hair after washing with a relatively good detangling cowash (As I Am Coconut Cowash). I have had to pull out and snip out a lot of knots with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have been using this product as a styler for after my hair is detangled. It really helps my hair twists and curls stay together and avoid frizz after I&#x27;ve put everything in place. I further amp it up by patting my twists with the Curling Gel Souffle from SheaMoisture. Surprisingly, those two products together are not sticky for me (granted, it&#x27;s snowing outside, so humidity is low). I also can get away with using just half an ounce or so of product per week. The product doesn&#x27;t flake up my hair and I&#x27;m in my second week w/o washing it out. I simply spritz and re-style (in my case, twists) every other night or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not sure I will repurchase. If I am not careful to gently glide this product on small sections of detangled hair, I get single strand knots ALL OVER the place. It keeps the moisture on my extremely thin/fine strands, but because of its clumping nature, it is KNOT CITY if I am not careful. I would definitely test a friend&#x27;s if you have pen spring sized curls before getting this product.</li>
    <li> This works for my hair. It gives me lots of beautiful spirally curls. I use it with another product though, Deva B Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer. Works every time! This product has EARNED it&#x27;s 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> I purchased the as I always do, but I notice my hair feels waxed residue like.  I have used this product for years and now my curl get even more tangled. So I purchased Herbal essence conditioner Hello Hydration and it leaves my hair detangled, soft and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In my own opinion I think KK CURLY have changed its formular.</li>
    <li> I love Knot Today! I have natural hair that tangles (it actually starts to loc!) if I don&#x27;t comb through it everyday. I use it when I&#x27;m in the shower with my conditioner and it makes combing through my hair soooo much easier. I also use it on days I don&#x27;t wash it and I get great results. If you&#x27;re looking for a detangler, try this one, you won&#x27;t regret it :-)</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 3 months ago. I have added it to my wash regimen since I was lacking a basic detangler. It is thick enough to coat natural 4b/4c hair without feeling gunky and greasy. It has a lovely smell. One of the better uses I have for it is I have used it to mix in with my other products like a moisture mist I make with aloe vera juice, water, veggie glycerin, jojoba oil and essential oils like peppermint and lavendar. I also add this product into my shea butter leave-in which has coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils, and a little veggie glycerin. I have found that adding this product makes the consistency of my mixes much more palatable for my hair. And, my hair stays detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test its awesomeness, I used it on my mom&#x27;s thick, relaxed hair. She said her hair has never been so silky. I don&#x27;t use heat or blow dryers on my hair so I wanted to see if that would alter the potency of this product. We did a light blow dry on my mom&#x27;s hair and used curling irons two times during the week. Her hair is still extremely silky and she is excited to buy it for herself. All you need is this and a little oil to round out your wash routine. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back and had to give it 4 stars because I found that, after several uses, my hair wasn&#x27;t drying as soft as it should. So, I cannot use this product alone on my coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note here is that the price is EXTREMELY high. I bought this at Target for almost $10 cheaper. I think a lot of these types of products (for curly/kinky hair) are now becoming more and more available at neighborhod retailers. I would definitely look there before buying. If you can&#x27;t find it there, break down and buy it here. It is truly a great product to add to any regimen.</li>
    <li> this is one (of only 2) conditioners that i ever use in my natural hair.  i am black american, no mix of anything...just regular nappy hair!  i put this stuff in and voila!---i can get a comb thru it without breaking a sweat (or my comb).  amazing.  i use it everyday.  works best if your hair is damp, but i put it on my dry, right-outta-the-bed hair in the AM and it still does it&#x27;s magic.  i&#x27;m a knot today believer.</li>
    <li> Amazing detangler and conditioner but this is not a leave in. Other than that the product is amazing with defining your curl again!!</li>
    <li> This is the best detangler ever!  Love this product and has a fantastic scent!</li>
    <li> I lived in Taipei for a while and the guy who cut my hair finally showed me which products to use for curly hair and how to use the diffuser attachment on my hair dryer properly.  He was using a leave-in conditioner which was made in Taiwan.  I stocked up before I left Taipei and was down to my last bottle.  I started searching for a replacement.  Kinky-Curly Knot Today was showing repeatedly as a good product for curly hair and the various web site I was looking at.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 10 days.  I wash my hair every 3rd day.  I use this every day as I spritz my hair with water, use a nickle sized portion of this product and dry my hair with a diffuser.  The curl comes back right away and I&#x27;m finished drying my hair in about 5 minutes.  I used the Kuene Hair Fibres to keep the curls in place.  Both products are water soluble so there is no problem with the curls getting flat.  Kinky-Curly Knot Today is a wonderful product for curly hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in conditioner. I have kinky curly hair and it makes it soft and smooth. Great product.</li>
    <li> This was a great product and it worked perfectly.  I did find it cheaper on the makers website so I will purchase from there.</li>
    <li> I like this item untangles hair very easily.</li>
    <li> this has saved me... i use this on my daughter, she can not live without this product... she is bi racial and has long hair that is curly, she always plays sports and swims, and hated combing her hair out, so i have tired every product out there, and stumbled on this... well she uses this every day, she wants this for birthday presents ect... i do always keep a bottle on hand for when she runs out, then order another to have... this has saved us, and honestly works well, no hard odors, does not hurt her hair, and gets tangles and knots out and she is 10 and now loves her hair and taking care of it.. thank you for this product...</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 2 daughters and I loved it so much that I use it myself! We all have really curly hair, 2 of us have really thick and bouncy strands and the other with fine hair and this product works well with both types. It perfectly detangles instantly. And makes our hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I was expecting so much more from the review I read. I brought this for my daughters and it really did nothing to make their hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> Target would be your best bet. Love this for my daughters kinky hair. Knots dissipate like magic. Wish I had found this product 4 years ago!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner did nothing but sit on my hair and create a white mess. I tried using 2 handfuls of this conditioner and ended up with a white mess. I used a quarter size of this conditioner for my entire head thinking that less would not cause a white mess and I was wrong. This conditioner is not for me.</li>
    <li> Knot Today is like magic! My hair is super thick, and this product made combing a bearable chore. A staple in my hair care products.</li>
    <li> There is nothing exceptional about this product, from my experience. i used it on a small amount of hair, and I was able to comb the knots out of my hair. I have read reviews that state that this product left hair &amp;#34;so soft.&amp;#34; That was not my experience. I still needed to use a moisturizer after using this product on my hair. That&#x27;s all fine and dandy, except I could have had the same results using a spray bottle with water. I&#x27;m not sure what sets this product apart from water, except that using this doesn&#x27;t leave my shoulders wet. That&#x27;s it. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, it wasn&#x27;t great. It also wasn&#x27;t any different than using water.</li>
    <li> It does detangle hair but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference comparing to other products.</li>
    <li> highly praised product but did nothing to my hair nor did it damage it. basically it was useless but luckily i discovered what works for my hair.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product a couple days ago and I have used it twice for my flexi rod sets. My curls come out very well defined, soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other staple product over the past year has been Cantu Shea Butter Leave-In Conditioning Repair Cream. But the Kinky Curly Knot Today might be my preference from now on. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. And the price of the 8 oz. bottle is on the high side ($12 at Target compared to 16 oz. of the Cantu for less than $6.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I like how my hair comes out when I use KCKT, so I think I&#x27;m a fan from now on.</li>
    <li> We call her Curly Sue, and the curls are very fine and prone to snarly-snarls.  Needless to say, it was a challenge to get them tamed before she would cry, &amp;#34;Stop!&amp;#34;  She&#x27;s not yet two, so is not prepared to endure all for the sake of beauty...yet.  This makes her look &amp;#34;all pre&#x27;ey&amp;#34; without the pain!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t weigh down those fine locks, and is &amp;#34;good smelly.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Product makes detangling easier. Not conditioning enough to replace a leave-in conditioner, though. Also, you don&#x27;t get much considering the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this to detangle my hair plus it smells good...I use it every other day and you dont need a lot....well worth it...for your girls</li>
    <li> its really a good detangler,but i dont use it for deep conditionner</li>
    <li> This product is good for moisturizing my hair it leaves my hair soft, managable and smooth.  I use it 2-3 times a week on wet or dry hair and get the same results everytime.  I will continue to use this product because my hair loves it. I think the price is a little to high for such a small container.</li>
    <li> Love this detangler, slippage is excellent.  Smells great, not a lot is needed, and very fast detangling process for my hair routine.</li>
    <li> This product is great but it has one problem that the bottle finish fastly..i think it is better if they make different size&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> Wonderful light conditioner!  I rinse mine out.  Completely detangles, leaving hair soft but not &amp;#34;too soft.&amp;#34;  Great scent too.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I have fluffy, but very thin, very curly hair. This is made for much thicker/coarser hair and even says so on the label. So I cannot use it as a leave-in. As recommended on the label, I am trying it as a wash-out conditioner in the shower. It still seems a bit heavy and leaves me still needing a leave-in for my towel-dried hair. So I will not buy again. But I think it would be good for the right texture hair.</li>
    <li> I have a child with 1C very thick, very straight, very dry, very long hair, and a very tender head. She lets it get matted to the point of big fat dreadlocks that take FOREVER to work out. I turned to the Internet for advice, and Knot Today was it. I bought it at Target for $11.99, VERY skeptical that I&#x27;d get more than one use out of such a small bottle even if it did work (and I had my doubts about that as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We washed and conditioned her hair, and then I rubbed a few half-teaspoon dollops directly into the mats. I approached it first with a Wet Brush, and then with a wide-tooth comb, and the mats came apart with surprising ease. I never thought I&#x27;d be celebrating it taking 40 minutes to completely detangle her hair, but compared to FIVE HOURS (I wish I were kidding), it&#x27;s like a miracle. I was also skeptical about leaving it in; I thought it would leave her hair feeling sticky or greasy, but I was wrong about that, too. Her hair dried smooth and soft, and without the flyaway dry quality that makes it tangle so easily in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ordinarily gush, but I was so pleasantly surprised with Knot Today. A little bit goes a very long way, and works fantastically well on hair that is NOT &amp;#34;Kinky Curly.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Not really what I was looking for.  Tried this product, but I really need a product which helps with tangles and moisturizes..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kinky Curly Leave In and Custard for 4 years now. I like to experiment with new products, by I&#x27;m always led back to these two products because they work. People stop me and compliment my curls, which is then typically followed by a question regarding what I use. I feel super confident recommending this product and will continue to do so. It also works miracles in my son&#x27;s hair which is much kinkier than mine. I would love to see a loyalty program added for folks who buy constantly.</li>
    <li> Staple product for me</li>
    <li> I love this product for detangling.  It works well with eco styling gel as well.  Highly recommended.  It is a bit pricey but well worth the investment as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Not enough slip for my 4a hair...more tangled than usual..will not buy again...</li>
    <li> We absolutely LOVE THE KC Custard.  This detangler from KC is still very good but not awesome.  It&#x27;s a little too thick and heavy for a detangler.  JUST FYI:  If you are allergic to Mango, you need to know that this product&#x27;s first ingredient is Mango fruit. Otherwise, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  And, even though it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s really slippery.  So you can use a quarter for a whole head of long curly hair.</li>
    <li> this works so extremely well on my infant son&#x27;s hair.  i have been using it for almost 2 months now and it works wonders.  it really gives life back to that baby hair they all have in the beginning that slowly fades around 6 months! it is light weight and his hair is so silky when i work it into his hair.  great detangler too!  he has a bad patch of dry hair in the back of his head that has just been destroyed from laying on his back and, although it hasn&#x27;t completely grown back in yet, it is a lot softer now and has even restored some of the curl to it. i use this product to moisture and define his curls then use the curling pudding to set it. i only wish i has started using this earlier instead of baby lotion, smh.  the only con is that the 8 oz doesn&#x27;t last very long.  about 2-3 months for me. but i used it with his regular hair routine.  if u only use it when u shampoo your hair it will probably last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. it smells heavenly. if u are a fan of a fruity coconut smell, u will fall in love with this.  my baby always smells too delicious!!</li>
    <li> freakin love this leave in !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;d been looking all over for a leave in conditioner for my LOC routine. I tried Shea Moisture, Motions Naturally You, and a couple of other products, but they would always clump up and leave white flakes in my hair. I tried the Kinky Curly Cleansing Shampoo and Leave in conditioner with the Shea Moisture Deep Masque treatment and Gel Curling Souflee and my two strand twists turned out the best ever, soft and bouncy with no flakes in sight!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with Knot Today. I use this in combination with the Kinky Curly Curling Custard. My hair is super curly but dry. This leaves a very thin layer of moisture to my wet hair (I apply after using my normal Wen Shampoo/Conditioner) and prepares it for the Curling Custard. I have not tried either product alone as I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say to use them together. When finished off with a diffuser, my curls are perfect for 2 days. If I used more of the Knot Today Conditioner, I&#x27;d probably be able to go a third day. The directions say how much to use depending on the type of style that you want, but given my dry hair, I applied in small sections like you would when using gel. Immediately after, I scrunch it with the custard and then diffuse. I can feel it when I rinse it out of my hair but it has done as it says and left my previously dry and damaged hair more soft and conditioned. Other products tend to dry out and disappear requiring me to use coconut oil at night so my curls will last another day. This one is no fuss after its initial application. I just shake out my curls the next day and am ready to go!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this helped me with detangling before washing. I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair fighting the tangles.</li>
    <li> Great detangler.  Once you have reached half bottle, try filling up the remainder of the space with water.  By the next day, you will have the same exact gellish product that works the same!!!  One bottle will last a very long time.... even works when diluted!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product and how it makes my hair feel after I wash and condition it in the shower, very easy to comb through.  Great detangler!  I have type 2b curly hair that frizzes easily and when I use Kinky Curly Knot Today, I don&#x27;t have the static electricity or frizz I would have otherwise.  I recommend this for any type of curly hair that frizzes.  I also enjoy the convenience and ease of shopping through Amazon online as well as savings offered through Prime Membership and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Makes it so much easier to do my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to the natural style hair and this product keeps me from the pain of comb-out! It leaves my kinky hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;m EXTREMELY &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; but I feel no pain with this product. My 7 year old granddaughter loves it too!</li>
    <li> GREAT detangler. Not much of a leave-in though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 8 years and I have yet to find something that comes close. I have 3b/3c, low porosity hair and use this product as a leave in and Detangler. It leaves my hair super soft, defined, and tangle free. I often put a moisturizer on top and either coconut oil or aloe Vera to seal. It is important to remember that this is NOT a moisturizer. It will not moisturize your hair, so you&#x27;ll need to put a moisturizer on top of it and a sealant. It works great with my other products. I&#x27;ll continue buying until it doesn&#x27;t exist anymore (though I can&#x27;t imagine it won&#x27;t!)</li>
    <li> Bought this with the kcc because that&#x27;s what I felt like I was supposed to do. This product does do what it says but I had some pretty high expectations from all the reviews I&#x27;ve seen. To be honest I have used a regular conditioner and had a easier time de-tangling. I&#x27;m not big on products that make my hair sticky while wet, I prefer more of a slick or greasy feel to it so I know my hair wont tangle. I will finish the bottle but dont think I need to order another one. Again this product is not horrible but I have achieved great results from my tresseme naturals conditioner and kcc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update my review in saying that after trying multiple leave ins with KCC this one just goes with it the best. It definitely isnt great at detangling but if you get the really rough knots out in the shower you should be fine. Out of all the other leave ins I use this dries the fastest with KCC since its light and bubbly. I have definitely bought more than  a handful of these so I use it all the time. One of my staples!</li>
    <li> seems to dry my natural hair out</li>
    <li> I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN,IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOFT AND SILKY TO THE TOUCH.AND THE PRICE IS OK AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for kinky curly girls BUT it must be used with some kind of oil in order to avoid crunch hard hair. It&#x27;s like a cross between a gel and conditioner so it holds your curls and gives them amazing definition. I mix 2 TBS of this it with 2 TBS of aloe vera gel, 2 tsps. of vitamin E, black castor and jojoba oils each (KimmayTube Recipe) and use it as a leave in to give my 3c/4a hair a beautiful finish after a wash and condition. I always seem to come back to this whenever I&#x27;ve tried other curl creams that don&#x27;t work as well. It smells good, defines my curls and leaves them nice &amp; shiny. I have used it without adding oil and though the definition is even better, it&#x27;s just too crunch for me. Give it a try and see how you like it.</li>
    <li> This product is really what the reviews said. I love the smell, it&#x27;s a delicious mango aroma. It leaves my curls soft and moisturized. I really recommend buying this product, specially for tight-curly girls.</li>
    <li> still looking for the perfect product to detangle my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair---this works okay, but does not get out the difficult knots at the nape of the neck</li>
    <li> Detangles my kids&#x27; hair without pain. Comb or brush glide through. (My children are African Anerican). Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  I like it better without the kinky curly custard. Knot today has the best texture.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Great product and does not leave hair feeling greasy or too heavy.  Great for everyday use.</li>
</ol>
