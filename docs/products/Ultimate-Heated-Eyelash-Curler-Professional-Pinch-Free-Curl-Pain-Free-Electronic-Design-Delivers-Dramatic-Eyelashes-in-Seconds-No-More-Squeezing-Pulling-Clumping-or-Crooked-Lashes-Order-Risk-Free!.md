      <li>Great!</li>

      <li>Works very good on my lashes.</li>
      <li>Good buy!</li>
      <li>Loved this product!</li>
      <li>I put on my mascara, then just use the curler in 3 sections and in about 15-20 seconds have beautiful curled lashes  Edit:.</li>
      <li>This worked great.  </li>
      <li>i really loved this eyelash curler&lt;br /&gt;Being a makeup artist i used it on my clients and they were please because there was not any fear of a pinched eyelids</li>
      <li>This is a good eyelash curler for those with longer lashes and for beginners.</li>
      <li>Not a quality product or good value.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t believe the good reviews for this curler.</li>
      <li>This product is very creative.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Warning:  Make sure your make-up is waterproof!</li>
      <li>It has a great feature of the removable lash comb that slides off for easy cleaning.  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes look amazing.</li>
      <li>but it worked amazing.</li>
      <li>but with out mascara it worked amazingly.  </li>
      <li>The comb is nice and I like that it had a heated tip to get the corner lashes.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any way of brushing or holding lashes in place to even begin to try to warm them.</li>
      <li>Barley gets warm.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too warm.</li>
      <li>but I warned you, try at your own risk.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s nice about this is you can sort of brush your eyelashes into place.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and effective!</li>
      <li>I have very light eyelashes  </li>
      <li>but it turned out to be okay.</li>
      <li>how many times I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even thinking about holding it on my lashes for more than 5 seconds because it just won&#x27;t curl in 3 no matter</li>
      <li>This product is neat, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the effect I was looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Con: It doesn&#x27;t come with the battery, so make sure you have a AAA battery.</li>
      <li>Then I repeated it once more, just to be sure.</li>
      <li>The potential is there for a great product!</li>
      <li>so any tool that will help them look fuller and longer is worthwhile to me.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea and it works well.  </li>
      <li>I love this curler.</li>
      <li>But the Panasonic just seems to work better for me.</li>
      <li>It does, however, look much better when used with an underlying mascara.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>It worked OK for me.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s most interesting to me is that you use this curler AFTER you&#x27;ve applied mascara, but doesn&#x27;t cause it to melt off.  </li>
      <li>I don’t know, but I would say that&#x27;s probably better for lash fullness over time.</li>
      <li>Really look it!!!!</li>
      <li>I read reviews and was very excited to get it</li>
      <li>Worth EVERY penny!!</li>
      <li>Very light weight; instructions super easy to follow!  </li>
      <li>The Swiss Ultimate Heated Eyelash Curler is a very good product for eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Apart from its practicality, I just think its cool, so futuristic and so inventive.</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I also liked the size , very convenient for travel too.</li>
      <li>literally does nothing but light up.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is important to me, I have lost manny lashes over the years from cheep eyeliners and trauma to the years area.</li>
      <li>Over all it looks really cheap.</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me!!!</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and the curl was noticeable quickly.</li>
      <li>This is super easy to use.</li>
      <li>and it was quick and easy</li>
      <li>This was super easy to use, heats up quickly and cleans really easily as well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably a good idea to actually wash the tip once a week or so to get rid of any residue, but the enclosed brush does a good job of prepping it for the next day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard, from YouTube beauty gurus, that it&#x27;s better if you use waterproof mascara for straight lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still couldn&#x27;t get a good curl, but it does open my lashes and the heat and comb de-clumps</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s a quick review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The heat generated isn&#x27;t very hot.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and the color changing temperature indicator makes it easy to know when it’s ready.</li>
      <li>think with more practice, I can get some epic lashes with the curler without having to resort to Latisse!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes stay curled all day and it gives a more even curl then the old manual ones.</li>
      <li>but so worth it.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, I brushed off the mascara from the plastic tip, wiped off the metal plates, and it was good as new!  </li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>The directions are in English and very easy to follow.</li>
      <li>This product is very reasonably priced and is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>so you know, you do have to clean it like once a week because the mascara builds up over time, but the includes a nice little brush for that</li>
      <li>Fast heat up time and does EXACTLY as promised!  </li>
      <li>The wand never gets &#x27;too hot&#x27;</li>
      <li>I have tried this many different ways with and without mascara.  </li>
      <li>I think that it needs to be designed better for us people that have short eyelashes.</li>
      <li>At first I was scared that the curler would burn my eyelashes off</li>
      <li>I think my regular eyelash curler worked better.</li>
      <li>I did one eye only to begin and saw a significant difference ...and that was before I put on mascara!  </li>
      <li>I wish that I had set fire to my money instead, it would have at least been more entertaining.</li>
      <li>It takes a moment or so for both eyes, but you don’t pull out any of your lashes, the same way you do with the old fashioned kind.</li>
      <li>after reading the positive reviews i thought id give it a try.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited I&#x27;ve found an effective method for giving my lashes a natural curl, without the harsh &#x27;bend&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an easy no pinch eyelash curler</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t ever seen my eyelashes curl that much</li>
      <li>It took off more of my mascara than I expected.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even think it heated up that much.</li>
      <li>However, it is very convenient because it is portable.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>so you know when it&#x27;s ready for use.  </li>
      <li>moMEXXH15U564]]This really does curl your lashes.</li>
      <li>Thanks for getting my hopes up.</li>
      <li>got some uplift on my lashes using this product, but getting a real curl wasn&#x27;t something I could manage.</li>
      <li>and didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
      <li>The only thing i dont like is that the LED light is so close to your eye.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Curling after you put on mascara seems like a good idea, since the mascara will then hold the curl in place (at least in theory).&lt;br</li>
      <li>- there&#x27;s just the right amount of heat to be effective, yet gentle on those delicate lashes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really look it!!!! Better than I expected!</li>
    <li> This stopped heating after only 2 1/2 months, as I only wear makeup a couple times a month this means I got less than 6 uses&lt;br /&gt;before it stopped heating. Not a quality product or good value.</li>
    <li> I was never able to get it to work actually.</li>
    <li> I think that it needs to be designed better for us people that have short eyelashes. If your lashes are long I don&#x27;t think you would have a problem, I was not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I found this product difficult to use. Heated was not an issue, the actual curling process I just couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected, but works.</li>
    <li> Might work well for some people, but, I have long lashes and I could not get the curl to stay.  I have tried this many different ways with and without mascara.  Back to the torture device.  My daughter has convinced me to try with a different mascara or maybe an eyelash primer. I will update if it works.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I did not have any issues with this product and my eyelashes remained curled for the day.  This product is very reasonably priced and is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> How suspicious is it that out of the 12 reviews, 2 were written on the 30th, 2 on the 27th, and FOUR reviews on the 26th. All of them but one in June. (I haven&#x27;t use the product yet but want to see if the actual users will stand for this product?).  Update: I did forget to update this when I got it, it was terrible, it didn&#x27;t really heat too much and the comb was hard to use. It didn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes at all. Ended up returning it and loosing money because I had to pay for the shipping (and I bought the battery too, it wasn&#x27;t included back then), should of just toss it away.  Oh and I did follow the instructions, do not believe that people who give this a negative review just didn&#x27;t read the instructions. Maybe it will work for somebody with soft lashes but I warned you, try at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to the tee. It did nothing. I went back to my old manual eyelash curler in 2 days because it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using an old school eyelash curler and hated the way it felt.  This worked great.  I have very light eyelashes  so anything I can do to make them look fuller I will.  You curl after you put the mascara on, which make sense- curlers I&#x27;ve used in the past you use before mascara so basically they never worked.</li>
    <li> Great! I have long eyelashes which makes them hard to curl. This curler did the trick and they stayed curled all day!</li>
    <li> This product is neat, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the effect I was looking for. Positives are that it heats up well, and the plastic casing makes it near impossible to actually burn yourself with it (unlike traditional hair curling devices).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curling after you put on mascara seems like a good idea, since the mascara will then hold the curl in place (at least in theory).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some uplift on my lashes using this product, but getting a real curl wasn&#x27;t something I could manage. I do have heavy lashes to begin with, so this product may work better on thinner lashes.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and easy to clean. This is an affordable product that delivers the results for the eyelashes that do need curling and volume. I also liked the size , very convenient for travel too.</li>
    <li> i really loved this eyelash curler&lt;br /&gt;Being a makeup artist i used it on my clients and they were please because there was not any fear of a pinched eyelids&lt;br /&gt;Also it is a breeze to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an easy no pinch eyelash curler</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the good reviews for this curler. First, the product I received was not made by the stated manufacturer, but instead was produced by a company called &amp;#34;zlime.&amp;#34; I figured, well, okay, that doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t work, right? I turned it on, heated it up, curled the lashes of one eye, and ... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I did it again. Then I repeated it once more, just to be sure. I finally called my husband into the room. He stared at my one (allegedly) curled eye and said, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t get it.&amp;#34; So there you have it - different product/manufacturer, zero effect, confused husband. I wish that I had set fire to my money instead, it would have at least been more entertaining.</li>
    <li> It came on time. However the one I received had Chinese or Japanese writing all over it which was fine since the instructions where in  English too. Over all it looks really cheap. I had to use setting #2 just to feel anything and didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Its like a small curling iron for your lashes (How has this not been thought of before!?). What&#x27;s nice about this is you can sort of brush your eyelashes into place. You can create different the angles and directions you want the lashes to go. The device has two “brushes” on the heating element that either let you clump some lashes together, or spread each lash out for a fluffier look. In general, you have a lot more control then with a conventional eyelash curler. It takes a moment or so for both eyes, but you don’t pull out any of your lashes, the same way you do with the old fashioned kind. I don’t know, but I would say that&#x27;s probably better for lash fullness over time. That is important to me, I have lost manny lashes over the years from cheep eyeliners and trauma to the years area. Apart from its practicality, I just think its cool, so futuristic and so inventive. I am going to a bachelorette weekend  and I can&#x27;t wait to show it to all the other girls, I know they will all want one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, you do have to clean it like once a week because the mascara builds up over time, but the includes a nice little brush for that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving one star because i have to in order to write something. This product came to me in Chinese.  The directions after translating and by looking at the image stated to remove cap. Looking at my product i notice there wasn&#x27;t a cap. what the heck.  it said the pink indicator will turn clear. Never did.  This product does not work. Do not listen to the other &amp;#34;great reviews&amp;#34; like i did. Big mistake.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I love it.  My eyelashes stay curled all day and it gives a more even curl then the old manual ones.</li>
    <li> The Swiss Ultimate Heated Eyelash Curler is a very good product for eyelashes. It heats up quickly and the color changing temperature indicator makes it easy to know when it’s ready. It has a great feature of the removable lash comb that slides off for easy cleaning.  I would recommend this product to anyone and I will buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the design of this curler and it doesn&#x27;t heat up that well.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as traditional eyelash curlers also you don&#x27;t get pinched,, which is always a problem for me. I need to hold it in place for about 30sec to get curl and it didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! My eyelashes look amazing. Easy to use and effective!</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, though it was a little confusing at first. Worked out alright.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does what it said it would!! Natural curled lashes! Worked very well for me!!!</li>
    <li> This product is very creative.  It&#x27;s like a mini curling iron for your eyelashes.  I love the idea and it works well.  The only thing i dont like is that the LED light is so close to your eye.  It is a bit annoying, but otherwise the product is great!</li>
    <li> Product was not sent as advertised.  No lid was included with unit and it does not heat up enough to curl lashes.  I read reviews and was very excited to get it but it did not heat up at all on number 1 and very little on number 2.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing to my lashes. I was disappointed, was hoping for some kind of result. I didn&#x27;t even think it heated up that much. Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> This little gadget fits in my purse and keeps my extremely long eyelashes out of my eyes, however, the heat feature combined with mascara may give an undesirable,  melting like, outcome.</li>
    <li> I have super short Asian eyelashes that point downwards. Then I found my miracle product; the Dior eyelash primer! It&#x27;s around $30 but so worth it. It extends your lashes and makes them point up. You let it dry for a minute a two and then apply your mascara. I&#x27;m currently using Chanel&#x27;s Le Volume, not sure if it&#x27;s going to be my go to yet. Benefits Bad Gal has a great brush for my type of lashes. It&#x27;s still annoying though because my lashes clump together, which really bugs me. This eyelash curler is the answer! The heat is helpful, but it&#x27;s a lot of work. You have to curl the base, then the middle of your lashes and then finally the tip. I still couldn&#x27;t get a good curl, but it does open my lashes and the heat and comb de-clumps my lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with more practice, I can get some epic lashes with the curler without having to resort to Latisse! But with the money I&#x27;m spending on products, I should probably just go for Latisse. If your lashes clump because of mascara, this definitely helps. It doesn&#x27;t get too warm. I&#x27;m not positive how long the curl will last. I&#x27;ll write an updated review once I get it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: It doesn&#x27;t come with the battery, so make sure you have a AAA battery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyelash curler on three separate occasions after purchasing it from Swiss Ultimate Labs. Here&#x27;s a quick review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not that it makes a difference but I got one with a pink cap and pink comb.&lt;br /&gt;2. This little device is a little smaller than what I imagined it to be. However, it is very convenient because it is portable.&lt;br /&gt;3. This mini device runs on a AAA battery that is not included.&lt;br /&gt;4. At first I was scared that the curler would burn my eyelashes off but it turned out to be okay. The heat generated isn&#x27;t very hot. It might feel weird at first, if you&#x27;re a first time user like me, and you can feel the heat on your lashes, but it&#x27;s totally safe. I&#x27;m even thinking about holding it on my lashes for more than 5 seconds because it just won&#x27;t curl in 3 no matter how many times I comb.&lt;br /&gt;5. Because I have short, straight, Asian lashes, this eyelash curler doesn&#x27;t really have much of an effect. You can see a slight curl but not much of a difference with and without mascara. I&#x27;ve heard, from YouTube beauty gurus, that it&#x27;s better if you use waterproof mascara for straight lashes.&lt;br /&gt;6.  This is a good eyelash curler for those with longer lashes and for beginners. I do recommend it but don&#x27;t expect dramatic curls in your lashes. My mom used it and it worked for her. She has longer and curvier lashes. So everyone&#x27;s results may differ.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Barley gets warm. Doesn&#x27;t have any way of brushing or holding lashes in place to even begin to try to warm them.</li>
    <li> does not work period. Tried with/without mascara. Barely heats up and no way the brush would help curl your lashes when it doesn&#x27;t even work well as an eyelash separator. Thanks for getting my hopes up. Definitely the right idea, just bad engineering/poorly made.</li>
    <li> Works very good on my lashes.</li>
    <li> after reading the positive reviews i thought id give it a try. after several frustrating attempts i gave up. it didnt do anything for my lashes, not even a tad bit. i even held it longer on my lashes, nothing. tried it before and after mascara, no luck.</li>
    <li> the temperature is ok, but somehow not very effective,</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and this one doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl your eyelashes like I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Despite the negative reviews I decided to give this a try as I don&#x27;t like using an eyelash curler. I am thrilled with this product. I have long lashes, and wear glasses-they touch the lens and leave smears, even after using the an eyelash curler. This is super easy to use. The directions are in English and very easy to follow. I put on my mascara, then just use the curler in 3 sections and in about 15-20 seconds have beautiful curled lashes  Edit:. I bought this in September, 2014 and it has quit working. Although I&#x27;m not happy with this, I am buying another, as I really love how it works and how my lashes look.</li>
    <li> I was in a pinch and the usual Panasonic curler that I buy went up to nearly $40 on Amazon a while ago.  I had burned out my third one by accidentally leaving it on.  This one was closer in price to the Panasonic so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be much different.  It doesn&#x27;t curl as well.  The comb is nice and I like that it had a heated tip to get the corner lashes.  But the Panasonic just seems to work better for me.</li>
    <li> Did not curl my lashes.</li>
    <li> I hate using the traditional eyelash curler it never works.  I haven&#x27;t tried this with makeup yet but with out mascara it worked amazingly.  I haven&#x27;t ever seen my eyelashes curl that much and it was quick and easy</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moMEXXH15U564]]This really does curl your lashes. I tried it before I put my mascara on and I could see a difference . I will try it with mascara after reading the other reviews. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate vacation tool when it comes to the pool or the beach.  I tested it out before the gym due to similar conditions e.g. no make up, sweat/water proof.  When it passed my work-out test, I knew I had to bring it to the beach house.  It survived waves and the house jacuzzi without any volume loss.  It does, however, look much better when used with an underlying mascara.  Warning:  Make sure your make-up is waterproof!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this but it worked amazing. It was easy to use and the curl was noticeable quickly.</li>
    <li> It worked OK for me. It took off more of my mascara than I expected. It seemed to slightly make a difference on my lashes but no one was able to notice the difference. I&#x27;m still a little sketchy about the heat near my eye. It also didn&#x27;t come with a battery, so it is not ready to use out of the box. I think my regular eyelash curler worked better.</li>
    <li> Works really well, gets at the really small lashes and makes your lashes look like a million bucks.  I have small lashes, but with the right product and this curler I look like I have the best extensions ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited I&#x27;ve found an effective method for giving my lashes a natural curl, without the harsh &#x27;bend&#x27;.  While this mini wand must be used with mascara, I no longer have to risk pinching or pulling my lashes and eyelids!  It heats up quickly and has a visual indicator so you know when it&#x27;s ready for use.  The wand never gets &#x27;too hot&#x27; so you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning - there&#x27;s just the right amount of heat to be effective, yet gentle on those delicate lashes. Works wonderfully and fits perfectly in my makeup bag!!</li>
    <li> I have to say... I was pretty skeptical when I tried this curler.  I&#x27;d purchased a heated curler a million years ago, and it actually burned the inside of my eyelid.  This one is definitely different! Once you put a AAA battery in, it only takes about 30 seconds to heat up, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  When you turn the curler on, it lights up, and there are flat heating plates surrounded by a little plastic tip that helps to separate your lashes - even at the end for using vertically on those little short inner lashes!  What&#x27;s most interesting to me is that you use this curler AFTER you&#x27;ve applied mascara, but doesn&#x27;t cause it to melt off.  I spent less than a minute at the end of my makeup routine using the curler, and ended up with beautiful, opened up lashes that stayed curled all day, and aren&#x27;t crimped in some weird way. Afterwards, I brushed off the mascara from the plastic tip, wiped off the metal plates, and it was good as new!  It&#x27;s probably a good idea to actually wash the tip once a week or so to get rid of any residue, but the enclosed brush does a good job of prepping it for the next day.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone like me with short, straight lashes that you don&#x27;t want looking bent or getting pulled out with a traditional curler. Worth EVERY penny!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the brushes are long enough and you couldn&#x27;t really tell, in my opinion, that it was even on. Try again Swiss Labs!  The potential is there for a great product!</li>
    <li> literally does nothing but light up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it over and over, without mascara, with mascara, with different batteries, after letting it heat up for various amounts of time. dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped but it does work a little.  I have small eyes and can&#x27;t use a regular eyelash curler without pinching myself!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t feel this does what I anticipated it would do, also I have had to change battery every other use. I will be looking for a rechargeable eyelash curler?</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how inexpensive this was, and was pleasently surprised at how well it works too.  I don&#x27;t have thick eyelashes so any tool that will help them look fuller and longer is worthwhile to me.  This was super easy to use, heats up quickly and cleans really easily as well.  Would definitely recommend this to interested customers.</li>
    <li> I love this curler. I have very long lashes and it helps with separating and curling so when I put my mascara on it goes on like a breeze. Also, my friend with very small eyelashes loves it because it curls them for her. So no more straight and short.</li>
    <li> Very light weight; instructions super easy to follow!  Fast heat up time and does EXACTLY as promised!  I did one eye only to begin and saw a significant difference ...and that was before I put on mascara!  You can use this tool either before or after you put on mascara as well.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Maybe I missed something in the directions, but this does not curl my eyelashes. I&#x27;ve got back to the old fashioned way of using a curing wand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews from other users.  However, after several attempted tries, I just could not get this curler to curl my eyelashes.  I ended up sending it back for a refund.  Maybe this was an isolated incident and there was a problem with this particular curler.  I will have to either try a different heated curler, or just use a blow dryer to heat the old fashioned type of curler..</li>
