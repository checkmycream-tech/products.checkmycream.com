### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>: Price, and it works best in conjunction with TheraBreath mouth rinse (also pricey).</li>
      <li>The instructions recommend using TheraFresh PLUS Oral Rinse afterwards for best results.</li>
      <li>Both of these are very good, and they both share a number of ingredients with TheraBreath PLUS.  </li>
      <li>A word of caution, it contains Xylitol which is incredibly toxic to dogs.</li>
      <li>(helps keep gums happy), zinc and Aloe.  </li>
      <li>I think they offer great products.  </li>
      <li>I had this product before and it works great.</li>
      <li>this is a great product.</li>
      <li>My experience may differ from someone&#x27;s who has a physiological issue with their breath, but for me, this didn&#x27;t have any great effect.</li>
      <li>I think a great combo is this TheraBreath Plus formula with a couple drops of peppermint (or spearmint, depending on your taste) oil.  </li>
      <li>This is a very handy way to brush your teeth on the go as no water is required.</li>
      <li>To me, that is quite remarkable.</li>
      <li>The taste is okay, but not the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It comes out of the tube as a subtly-colored gel, not the bright blue/green/red we&#x27;re used to.  </li>
      <li>Cleaning quality was good, and alleviation of dryness was good.</li>
      <li>Kissable husband is a good thing :&amp;</li>
      <li>I even used it with my electric toothbrush with good results.</li>
      <li>That said, it is still a good product by itself.</li>
      <li>They both provide excellent cavity, plaque and tartar control protection and leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>I love that it is vegan, cruelty free, and that it includes awesome ingredients like Xylitol, while also packing fluoride to prevent tooth</li>
      <li>Although somewhat on the higher priced end of the oral healthcare spectrum, this is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste is an effective accompaniment to the therabreath mouthwashes.  </li>
      <li>I will, also, say that this product works best with the mouthwash which I got a couple of weeks or so into the whole experiment.</li>
      <li>While some folks may miss the minty freshness that Crest leaves in their mouth, I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that lingering toothpaste flavor when I ran by Starbucks to get my morning latte.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste that great, and while your teeth feel clean, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel that way.</li>
      <li>So, if I was so impressed by this toothpaste, why only three stars?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the rest of our mouths, though we&#x27;ll keep using it to see if there are more benefits over time.  </li>
      <li>I could feel the effects (freshness mostly) of the Therabreath throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to being able to walk away from the sink for a moment while brushing my teeth, but not with this stuff.</li>
      <li>However, I stuck with the product, and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste was really interesting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many  TheraBreath products before.</li>
      <li>While this toothpaste is great, I have accomplished comparable improvements in breath by using Theraneem tooth powder (cinnamon flavor is awesome), which doesn&#x27;t have fluoride and does have a well-regarded oral probiotic, and by using Coral White Toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>She did not have &amp;#34;24 hour confidence&amp;#34; as is &amp;#34;guaranteed.&amp;#34; Maybe it takes more than a week before you see a difference, but she doesn&#x27;t like having fluoride in her toothpaste</li>
      <li>I was offered this product through the Vine program and took it as it sounded interesting.</li>
      <li>but it does seem to keep the teeth clean!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam like most brands, I found the texture smooth and tasty.</li>
      <li>Now, when combined with the TheraBreath mouth rinse, the user gets that strong minty flavor that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>It is quite strong and takes a while to get used to it.  </li>
      <li>Beyond that, it&#x27;s toothpaste, and it works fine to clean teeth (though the flavor isn&#x27;t strong, and I prefer strongly-flavored paste).</li>
      <li>That said, if you want fluoride, and you want fresh breath and healthy gums, then this toothpaste is quite good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It probably takes a while to really determine how effective this paste is.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I don&#x27;t care much about the type of toothpaste I use, I am happy to switch to one that is more natural.  </li>
      <li>My mouth feels very fresh</li>
      <li>This is pretty good stuff, and it certainly freshens breath.  </li>
      <li>A lot of toothpastes are too strong in the flavor department - but this one is mild.</li>
      <li>, the fact that is is vegetarian/vegan and kosher friendly</li>
      <li>That will allow TheraBreath PLUS to thoroughly clean.</li>
      <li>if my mouth doesn&#x27;t make me one of the stinkers out there, I still like how clean this product leaves my mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not at the same kind of minty flavor that most Americans are used to from their toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Overall, seems good, but frankly the jury is out.</li>
      <li>As mentioned in the title, this toothpaste works great for breath, but I took away a star as it is kind of a one trick pony; do not expect specific anti plaque/tartar results, not any extra whitening.</li>
      <li>Happily I find I disagree with some of the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product - really worked for our son, when nothing else did!</li>
      <li>It works fine on my breath, and does a decent job on my son (when he remembers to brush!).  </li>
      <li>the mixture wanting to run out of my mouth much more easily than a traditional toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>This is a very fresh-tasting toothpaste - it&#x27;s minty and smooth but not &#x27;too&#x27; minty.</li>
      <li>No minty fresh feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I cannot seeing this replacing my regular brushing routine but it is handy as a part of an oral hygeine routine.</li>
      <li>Use it at night before bedtime to make your mouth fresh in the morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m known for always having some kind of fluid on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, when I was offered the opportunity to try this toothpaste with its 24-hour fresh breath guarantee, I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a most curious product, mostly because of our built-in expectations about toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>fresh.  </li>
      <li>If you prefer to use a natural product, try Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth instead.</li>
      <li>I have even had fresh breath in the morning after using this product at night.</li>
      <li>those needing an extreme fix, I&#x27;d recommend brushing first with a good anti-cavity paste and finishing with this.</li>
      <li>the fragrance bit just sort of baffles me and makes me wonder EXACTLY what it is.</li>
      <li>That being said, it does take more effort than regular toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste and will be using it from now on!</li>
      <li>I ended up drooling all over myself the first couple times I used</li>
      <li>I was immediately aware of fresher breath after brushing with it.</li>
      <li>I started noticing results after he had finished the first tube so evidentally a combination of time/repeated usage and the mouthwash did the trick.  </li>
      <li>A pretty good paste with a decent mouthfeel, unlike some of these other toothpaste alternatives, namely Earthpaste, which is literally like scrubbing your gums with mud.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I want a toothpaste that leaves my teeth feeling clean and has some polishing action.  </li>
      <li>Since this product focuses on cleaning the bacterial layer (dental plaque) from your teeth, gums and palate, I recommend using mouthwash first if you have a lot of large food particles from a meal.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you use this in addition to regular brushings with normal toothpaste you&#x27;ll have better results?</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m in the midst of an ongoing weight-training program in which I take certain supplements that affect my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more about simply feeling like even with a brush full of this toothpaste, there isn&#x27;t enough of it to &amp;#34;go</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the way this toothpaste tastes, but it really does what it says it&#x27;ll do.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe it does much of anything for your teeth.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t testify that it lasts 24 hours--and who really brushes just once</li>
      <li>After just a couple applications, I found my breath was that much fresher and stayed fresher,</li>
      <li>TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula Fresh Breath Toothpaste has a lot going for it on paper.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like much flavor in toothpaste</li>
      <li>I have a whole morning and nighttime routine</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It gets really watery, and I couldn&#x27;t see that my mouth smelled particularly sweeter, or my teeth were much cleaner.</li>
      <li>My breath doesn&#x27;t appear to be substantially better than with any other toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>disappointing.antially better than with any other toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>day?--but that clean taste does last you awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Anyway, as far as toothpaste goes I don&#x27;t have the time to evaluate long-term results and my teeth are pretty messed up in any case.  </li>
      <li>; She felt the toothpaste was fairly abrasive (more than she was used to) and, after a week, she doesn&#x27;t feel like her bad breath has improved.</li>
      <li>; people need to understand that the US Department of Health recently halved the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water, and many scientists, including some from institutions as eminent as Harvard have called for further reductions.  </li>
      <li>A mild minty taste with no gritty feeling.  </li>
      <li>My husband smokes cigars occasionally, and his regular toothpaste doesn&#x27;t eliminate the cigar smell from his breath (no matter how many times he brushes).</li>
      <li>After sticking with this toothpaste and adding the TheraBreath Plus Mouthwash to his dental regime, my husband&#x27;s breath is actually tolerable for the first time in our marriage!  </li>
      <li>I missed the foaming action of regular toothpaste, but at the same time, I appreciated the clean feeling and didn&#x27;t miss the overly crisp mint flavors that I&#x27;d grown used to.</li>
      <li>I really like this TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Use it in the morning on a dry toothbrush and scrub your teeth and tongue it will clean your breath.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No more bad breath love it</li>
    <li> Pro: It does work right away to kill bad breath and it seems to last for a long period of time throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: There is next to no foaming action or pleasing taste. No minty fresh feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those needing an extreme fix, I&#x27;d recommend brushing first with a good anti-cavity paste and finishing with this.</li>
    <li> This item was given me for my review.&lt;br /&gt;TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula toothpaste is a bit odd on the first few tries. It does not emulsify like regular toothpastes, so you wonder if the product is getting everywhere it needs to go. Additionally, one of the instructions is to not rinse your mouth if you want maximum benefits. The first few times I tried it, I didn&#x27;t really like it. It gets really watery, and I couldn&#x27;t see that my mouth smelled particularly sweeter, or my teeth were much cleaner. However, I stuck with the product, and I am glad I did. I have seriously dry mouth, and I am always looking for something that deals with the coating I tend to have on my tongue, teeth and in general. I am, also, trying to find something that puts back a little moisture without coming in pill form. After about a week and a half of using the toothpaste, the difference in the sweater feeling and appearance of my tongue was the best it has been in several long, dry years. This was visual proof, and, mind you, I have tried a lot of different products to achieve the same results. Cleaning quality was good, and alleviation of dryness was good. I brush my teeth with the toothpaste a minimum of two times a day, using a sensitive toothpaste in between. I wish this toothpaste addressed sensitivity, as well, but I guess you cannot pack everything into one product. I will, also, say that this product works best with the mouthwash which I got a couple of weeks or so into the whole experiment. That said, it is still a good product by itself.</li>
    <li> A pretty good paste with a decent mouthfeel, unlike some of these other toothpaste alternatives, namely Earthpaste, which is literally like scrubbing your gums with mud.  My only quibble would be mintiness, you don&#x27;t get the refreshing kick off TheraBreath that you get with other comparable pastes, such as Kiss My Face or Jason.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life. I tested this product by eating garlic rolls and then brushing my teeth... Wow, works 100%</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is an effective accompaniment to the therabreath mouthwashes.  You can feel the difference after brushing, my mouth feels cleaner and less dry.  As mentioned in the title, this toothpaste works great for breath, but I took away a star as it is kind of a one trick pony; do not expect specific anti plaque/tartar results, not any extra whitening.</li>
    <li> Every once in a while my husband has bad breath. I thought Therabreath would help and it does.  This is no ordinary toothpaste.  It has a thinner consistency than other toothpastes and it has a different taste.  It&#x27;s not at the same kind of minty flavor that most Americans are used to from their toothpaste.  It has a much milder mint flavor, one that&#x27;s barely there.  It does not foam like other toothpastes too.  It does refresh breath.  A word of caution, it contains Xylitol which is incredibly toxic to dogs. Overall it freshens breath but you have to get used to a toothpaste which looks and feels very different than the Crest and Colgate you have grown up using.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff, and it certainly freshens breath.  It has a number of things that help your mouth, including xylitol that strengthens teeth, COQ10 for circulation (helps keep gums happy), zinc and Aloe.  It definitely keeps bad breath under control, but users need to understand that it reacts differently than most toothpaste - it doesn&#x27;t foam up, and it doesn&#x27;t have that strong, &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavor you might expect from a typical commercial toothpaste.  It certainly fights bad breath, though, and over time I suspect it is at least as good for your teeth as a traditional toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One the possible downside, it is expensive, and it contains fluoride.  Before everyone clucks and says &amp;#34;of course it does,&amp;#34; people need to understand that the US Department of Health recently halved the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water, and many scientists, including some from institutions as eminent as Harvard have called for further reductions.  While this toothpaste is great, I have accomplished comparable improvements in breath by using Theraneem tooth powder (cinnamon flavor is awesome), which doesn&#x27;t have fluoride and does have a well-regarded oral probiotic, and by using Coral White Toothpaste.  Both of these are very good, and they both share a number of ingredients with TheraBreath PLUS.  That said, if you want fluoride, and you want fresh breath and healthy gums, then this toothpaste is quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can compare Theraneem here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQ7QHWU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is Amazon&#x27;s link to Coral White:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KI2SY76/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, regardless of which product you chose, an oral probiotic can really help with bad breath - trust me there!  It also improves overall oral health.  I recommend Dr. Williams&#x27; Oral Sinus probiotics.  These work very well in conjunction with TheraBreath PLUS toothpaste and even further help prevent bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWLLE38/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many  TheraBreath products before. Dr. Katz is a well-known dental professional, who has designed products for bad breath and better oral care. I have used the regular strength Fresh Breath and PeriBreath products. They are expensive and supposed to fight bad breath and gum issues. I had used the PerioTherapy line for months when my dentist had to change my oral care regime to better fight bad bacteria and plaque. This new toothpaste is supposed to be a stronger version to fight bad breath, when used along with the oral rinse and Probiotics. This formula contains Zinc, Co-Q10 and Xylitol to supposedly fight bad breath. It doesn&#x27;t taste that great, and while your teeth feel clean, my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel that way. I wound up having morning breath while using this system. I normally never have that problem with the regular products I use. I use Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxicare and Sensitive toothpastes. They both provide excellent cavity, plaque and tartar control protection and leave my mouth feeling clean. Not so with the new formula. Different toothpaste will give different results for differing problems. I prefer multi use formulas that tackle everything. TheraBreath purports to be an all in one solution, with a primary focus on bad breath. For me, it failed miserably. I wound up with morning breath because I wasn&#x27;t using my normal brands that did the job for a fraction of the price. You only have 4 ounces in a tube for TheraBreath, while my Peroxicare has 7 ounces for $3.50. If you prefer to use a natural product, try Jason&#x27;s Healthy Mouth instead. Save your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Bad breath. Garlic, onions, tobacco and all other nasties this stuff works!  Use it in the morning on a dry toothbrush and scrub your teeth and tongue it will clean your breath. A mild minty taste with no gritty feeling.  When used with TheraBreath Mouthwash it works to freshen your breath for hours.  Use it at night before bedtime to make your mouth fresh in the morning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the experience but the product does the job. It&#x27;s not a normal toothpaste. Don&#x27;t put water on the brissels before hand or the paste will disappear. Even if you do put it on dry it does get very liquidy before you&#x27;re done. The taste is okay, but not the best. However, when all is said and done I do feel like I have a cleaner mouth and fresher breath with this product versus any name brand toothpastes.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was really interesting. It had a slight flavor, but not the minty zing that I was used to. It also isn&#x27;t as frothy as my normal toothpaste. While some folks may miss the minty freshness that Crest leaves in their mouth, I liked that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that lingering toothpaste flavor when I ran by Starbucks to get my morning latte. So, if I was so impressed by this toothpaste, why only three stars? Well, after a week or so of use, my gums have started to bother me. I can&#x27;t be sure that this is an issue with the toothpaste or just an unfortunate coincidence. For now, I&#x27;m going to have to stop using it and see if the problem subsides. I may try it again later as I really do like the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used TheraBreath mouthwash for a while and swear by it.  I wondered if I would like the toothpaste as much.&lt;br /&gt;It works.  I do.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have the soap in it that other toothpastes do, and the foam in your mouth factor isn&#x27;t there, but it doesn&#x27;t mean this stuff doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans, polishes and sets your mouth up to smell and feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with both the paste and the mouthwash.  Combo that works!</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste (and the rinse) for years. it totally takes care of your bad breath.</li>
    <li> Having now used the standard TheraBreath toothpaste, and now the Plus formula, I&#x27;m only a little satisfied with this product. For bad breath, it works quite well. No complaints there. However, as a TOOTHpaste, this products falls short. I don&#x27;t believe it does much of anything for your teeth. It doesn&#x27;t feel or look like it, anyways. Maybe if you use this in addition to regular brushings with normal toothpaste you&#x27;ll have better results?</li>
    <li> I really like this TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula toothpaste.  I have never tried the regular version, so I cannot compare it to that.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t foam like commercial toothpaste.  This eliminates the need to spit during the brushing process as much as when I use regular toothpaste.  When I have had really bad breath in the past, I have used OraMD or a homemade version (almond, peppermint, and spearmint oils).  It is quite strong and takes a while to get used to it.  I sometimes even put a couple drops of my homemade version on regular toothpaste.  I think a great combo is this TheraBreath Plus formula with a couple drops of peppermint (or spearmint, depending on your taste) oil.  Thus, I think the TheraBreath formula could be mintier.  I like it better than commercial versions and do wish it didn&#x27;t have fluoride, but it is a good option for bad breath issues.</li>
    <li> I am giving TheraBreath PLUS Professional Formula five stars because it really works. That being said, it does take more effort than regular toothpaste. Since this product focuses on cleaning the bacterial layer (dental plaque) from your teeth, gums and palate, I recommend using mouthwash first if you have a lot of large food particles from a meal. That will allow TheraBreath PLUS to thoroughly clean. The instructions recommend using TheraFresh PLUS Oral Rinse afterwards for best results. I cannot speak to that as I didn&#x27;t have access to the Oral Rinse but I will say that TheraFresh PLUS Professional Formula does work when used as directed. I have even had fresh breath in the morning after using this product at night. To me, that is quite remarkable.</li>
    <li> Although somewhat on the higher priced end of the oral healthcare spectrum, this is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s ingredients list contains a blend of compounds that work against the bacteria that flourish in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if my mouth doesn&#x27;t make me one of the stinkers out there, I still like how clean this product leaves my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that is is vegetarian/vegan and kosher friendly is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a very fresh-tasting toothpaste - it&#x27;s minty and smooth but not &#x27;too&#x27; minty. A lot of toothpastes are too strong in the flavor department - but this one is mild. My mouth feels very fresh like I&#x27;d just gotten it professionally cleaned when I brush with this toothpaste. I really like it. I was immediately aware of fresher breath after brushing with it. I really like this toothpaste and will be using it from now on!</li>
    <li> Since another reviewer claims this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have fluoride, I want to point out that it does. Under &amp;#34;Active Ingredient: Sodium Fluoride 0.24%.&amp;#34; I have a sample Crest toothpaste that uses the same type and amount of that active ingredient, so this toothpaste isn&#x27;t special in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another household member feels like she has bad breath and was interested in trying this toothpaste, so I mainly got it for her to try out. She followed the directions: &amp;#34;Cover bristles of dry toothbrush and brush teeth, tongue, and palate for 2 minutes. Spit out excess.&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Use twice daily.&amp;#34; She felt the toothpaste was fairly abrasive (more than she was used to) and, after a week, she doesn&#x27;t feel like her bad breath has improved. She did not have &amp;#34;24 hour confidence&amp;#34; as is &amp;#34;guaranteed.&amp;#34; Maybe it takes more than a week before you see a difference, but she doesn&#x27;t like having fluoride in her toothpaste so she isn&#x27;t inclined to use it twice a day if there is no noticeable improvement. Update 6/24/15: Even after weeks of use, it never did improve her bad breath. Instead, it allowed tarter to start building up on her teeth in a very noticeable way, something that isn&#x27;t a problem with her usual toothpaste. I hate to waste things, but we&#x27;re throwing this toothpaste away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this toothpaste as well for a few days. I don&#x27;t have bad breath as a chronic problem. If anything, I felt like my mouth tasted a bit nastier (or &amp;#34;less clean&amp;#34;) hours after using this toothpaste as compared to my usual toothpaste. Probably there is no actual difference and it&#x27;s simply that I don&#x27;t normally think about it. I thought that the ingredient list was a little odd--xylitol is a sugar even if it&#x27;s not as bad for your teeth, so why use so much? And aloe to brush your teeth? It&#x27;d be interesting to know the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; behind some of those ingredients. Anyway, it&#x27;s unlikely either of us will buy this toothpaste again in the future.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like other tooth past but it does seem to keep the teeth clean!</li>
    <li> I had this product before and it works great.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  I use this product with TheraBreath PLUS Professional Formula Fresh Breath Oral Rinse - Extra Strength and TheraBreath PLUS Nasal-Sinus Drops. they work well together.  I think they offer great products.  I just wish the toothpaste had some flouride.</li>
    <li> I have always had a bit of a dry mouth. I&#x27;m known for always having some kind of fluid on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam like most brands, I found the texture smooth and tasty. And unlike other brands, this paste isn&#x27;t opaque. It isn&#x27;t runny and holds well to the brush. The flavor (and residue) reminds me of a dental office visit. It&#x27;s not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days was a learning period for me. I missed the foaming action of regular toothpaste, but at the same time, I appreciated the clean feeling and didn&#x27;t miss the overly crisp mint flavors that I&#x27;d grown used to. I&#x27;m not sure if it has the abrasive ingredients that make regular toothpaste work as it should. It doesn&#x27;t feel chalk-like or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works well. I could feel the effects (freshness mostly) of the Therabreath throughout the day. Even after having lunch, I could tell that the paste was still at work. It lasts well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with chronic bad breath. However, I&#x27;m in the midst of an ongoing weight-training program in which I take certain supplements that affect my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference since using the TheraBreath toothpaste about ten days ago. My experience may differ from someone&#x27;s who has a physiological issue with their breath, but for me, this didn&#x27;t have any great effect. Beyond that, it&#x27;s toothpaste, and it works fine to clean teeth (though the flavor isn&#x27;t strong, and I prefer strongly-flavored paste). It doesn&#x27;t have the same whitening effects as the Rembrandt toothpaste I normally use, though.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste really works in stopping bad breath</li>
    <li> TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula Fresh Breath Toothpaste has a lot going for it on paper.  I love that it is vegan, cruelty free, and that it includes awesome ingredients like Xylitol, while also packing fluoride to prevent tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste delivered its breath freshening promise.  After just a couple applications, I found my breath was that much fresher and stayed fresher, longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside?  I did not enjoy the product as a regular toothpaste replacement.  The product is very viscous, with very little obvious polishing effect.  I felt as though I was brushing with water, the mixture wanting to run out of my mouth much more easily than a traditional toothpaste.  It felt messy and difficult to use.  Furthermore, my teeth were left feeling as though they weren&#x27;t brushed very well.  I felt nearly like I had used a world class mouthwash, but still needed to brush my teeth.  I did not like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after a couple uses, I have not wanted to use the product again.  It has some terrific ingredients and does seem to keep your breath fresh, longer.  Nevertheless, I want a toothpaste that leaves my teeth feeling clean and has some polishing action.  Perhaps, over time, I could implement it a few times a week, before a traditional toothpaste brushing.  However, it all seems like a bit too much work if, like me, you don&#x27;t find the product can replace your regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  After sticking with this toothpaste and adding the TheraBreath Plus Mouthwash to his dental regime, my husband&#x27;s breath is actually tolerable for the first time in our marriage!  HOORAY!!!!!  I started noticing results after he had finished the first tube so evidentally a combination of time/repeated usage and the mouthwash did the trick.  This stuff is crazy expensive and worth it to me!  Kissable husband is a good thing :&amp;#62;).&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I got this with low expectations as much of bad breath comes from dietary choices, health concerns, medications, etc.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has hideous breath.  We try any and all products that purport to eradicate bad breath.  His is so bad that he can brush with the MINTIEST toothpastes on the market for a full two minutes, gargle with mint mouthwash, walk straight to bed, kiss me and make me want to hurl.  That is a sad state of affairs.  In the time it takes to get from bathroom to bedroom in a normal sized home you can&#x27;t even smell the mint in his mouth anymore...just something prehistorically putrid.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal morning breath but nothing exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;We both dislike the texture (not enough to not use product though), brushing dry, and the feeling that you really aren&#x27;t getting much action out of the toothpaste (it isn&#x27;t so much about missing foaming, because I&#x27;ve been on long jags with baking soda in the past)...it&#x27;s more about simply feeling like even with a brush full of this toothpaste, there isn&#x27;t enough of it to &amp;#34;go around.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like much flavor in toothpaste and I find it has plenty of mint for my tastes.  I see that others find it &amp;#34;tasteless.&amp;#34;  Husband finds it to be bland.&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of using this I can say that it hasn&#x27;t razzle dazzled me for either of us.  I now use it only in the mornings since that is my breath challenged time frame.  My mouth feels clean, but not exceptionally so.  My breath doesn&#x27;t appear to be substantially better than with any other toothpaste.  I do appreciate the xylitol since I have extremely dry mouth and this helps a wee bit.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t helped my husbands bad breath at all, definitely no better than any other toothpaste...disappointing.antially better than with any other toothpaste.  I do appreciate the xylitol since I have extremely dry mouth and this helps a wee bit.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t helped my husbands bad breath at all, definitely no better than any other toothpaste...disappointing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice not to hear from my hubby how bad my breath is when I&#x27;m by him. We are definitely making up for lost kissing time!!</li>
    <li> Even if it seems to work, using it is unpleasant. It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth with teeth whitening gel. If they made a formulation that at least frothed a bit to get rid of the current consistency, then I would be all for it.</li>
    <li> Ok, I didn&#x27;t realize that i was possible suffering from bad breath until i noticed little signs people would do when talking to me. I was extremely embarrassed and wanted to figure out how to solve this problem quickly. I started researching and came across this. It has changed my life. I use this in conjunction with the mouth wash, water flosser, and a tongue cleaner. I&#x27;m telling you, even you will notice results immediately. I have a whole morning and nighttime routine and I will never go back.</li>
    <li> The TheraBreath Plus Professional Formula extra strength Fresh Breath toothpaste claims to help alleviate bad breath.  My son takes medication that makes it smell like something horrible crawled in his mouth and died.  The medication also causes dry mouth, so he has been using Biotene rinse for the dry mouth, and brushing, after every meal and snack.  Or that is what he is supposed to be doing, but I do not think he is.  So, when I was offered the opportunity to try this toothpaste with its 24-hour fresh breath guarantee, I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tooth gel, not a paste.  It is clear and meant to be applied to a dry tooth brush, and then brush the teeth, tongue, and palate for two minutes. The package recommends to follow tooth brushing with the TheraBreath mouth rinse.  The gel has a slight minty flavor, nothing like the strong mint flavor of my usual toothpaste (whatever is on sale), but better than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Enamel Strength toothpaste I tried.  I feel that it leaves a film on my tongue that is unpleasant but not too off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it work on bad breath?  It works fine on my breath, and does a decent job on my son (when he remembers to brush!).  I would not say it gives 24-hour fresh breath confidence, but it is better at keeping bad breath at bay than most of the other tooth pastes I have used (all the big brands, plus some natural and foreign varieties).  Now, when combined with the TheraBreath mouth rinse, the user gets that strong minty flavor that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Works well on moderate bad breath, and decently on horrible breath caused by medication*.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price, and it works best in conjunction with TheraBreath mouth rinse (also pricey).</li>
    <li> Once I started using this toothpaste, I simply will never go back to commercial off the shelve toothpaste. This toothpaste doesn&#x27;t mask bad breath: it takes it away.</li>
    <li> This is a most curious product, mostly because of our built-in expectations about toothpaste.  Indeed, only by tradition would you even call it a &amp;#34;paste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the tube as a subtly-colored gel, not the bright blue/green/red we&#x27;re used to.  It also has a more subtle flavor than we&#x27;d expect--pleasant enough, but not overwhelming.  And as you brush it seemingly liquifies--problematic for someone like me, who brushes with open mouth.  I ended up drooling all over myself the first couple times I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then you finish and you notice something peculiar--your mouth may not have the sharp taste we associate with other toothpastes, but it tastes clean and, dare we say, fresh.  I won&#x27;t testify that it lasts 24 hours--and who really brushes just once a day?--but that clean taste does last you awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the product for review--to try and get the 18 year old to use it on his swamp breath--no verdict on him yet, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I was trying to figure out the flavor of this toothpaste, because it is different than most other toothpastes.  It is a very subtle mint flavor that I can only guess comes from the natural mint oils used in the toothpaste.  I think I am use to the artificial flavors of most toohpastes that this will take some time to get use to. There is not much foam to the paste, once again probably due to the natural ingredients, but it seems to spread fine and my teeth feel clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I don&#x27;t care much about the type of toothpaste I use, I am happy to switch to one that is more natural.  I have been using this in combination with their oral rinse, and I do feel my mouth is substantially fresher.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for a few nights.  The kids didn&#x27;t mind the taste and they haven&#x27;t complained about brushing with it like they have with a few other toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried with less JUNK in them.  While I haven&#x27;t seen a physical difference yet, I have noticed that my son&#x27;s killer morning breath is much less lethal these days.  His brushing habits haven&#x27;t changed - he still fights brushing after breakfast and tries to lie or dodge or just do a quick job with the night brushing, but there is definitely a difference.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the rest of our mouths, though we&#x27;ll keep using it to see if there are more benefits over time.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars for me is the &amp;#34;natural fragrance.&amp;#34;  Why does toothpaste need that??  I get the flavor - and that&#x27;s only listed in the ingredients as &amp;#34;natural flavor&amp;#34; but fragrance?  Given that it&#x27;s got natural flavor, spearmint leaf oil and another mint oil, the fragrance bit just sort of baffles me and makes me wonder EXACTLY what it is.</li>
    <li> I was offered this product through the Vine program and took it as it sounded interesting. After reading some of the reviews I did not expect to like it. Happily I find I disagree with some of the other reviewers. This is a very handy way to brush your teeth on the go as no water is required. Strange? Yes. I even used it with my electric toothbrush with good results. I cannot seeing this replacing my regular brushing routine but it is handy as a part of an oral hygeine routine. I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> It seems to help bad breath somewhat, it does not taste particularly bad, but the lack of foaming results in this totally liquid drool that runs right out of my mouth while I&#x27;m in the middle of brushing. I&#x27;m used to being able to walk away from the sink for a moment while brushing my teeth, but not with this stuff. The drool goes onto your shirt like clear water, but dries to look like white paint.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the way this toothpaste tastes, but it really does what it says it&#x27;ll do. My husband smokes cigars occasionally, and his regular toothpaste doesn&#x27;t eliminate the cigar smell from his breath (no matter how many times he brushes). His &amp;#34;cigar-breath&amp;#34; often carries over to the next day, too. This toothpaste kills it after one brushing. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> After years of my wife complaining about my &amp;#34;evening breath&amp;#34;, this product has saved the day.  Coupled with the mouth rinse, you cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> I expected to only get one tube, so I was surprised when the package came with 2 tubes.  Anyway, as far as toothpaste goes I don&#x27;t have the time to evaluate long-term results and my teeth are pretty messed up in any case.  But it does help with the bad breath, so that&#x27;s something.  The taste is about like any baking soda toothpaste.  There&#x27;s a little grittiness after brushing with it.  Overall for the price it&#x27;s probably not much better than the normal toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m not sure bad breath is a major problem. Even so, the product seems to work with a low- key taste, and my mouth did feel better and fresher than with more common toothpastes. I&#x27;m not sure if it will help with gums etc., since my teeth do get a bit sore every now and then. So I&#x27;ll continue trying it out. Overall, seems good, but frankly the jury is out. It probably takes a while to really determine how effective this paste is.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product - really worked for our son, when nothing else did!</li>
    <li> Only paste I use, really works....</li>
    <li> you cant compare the feeling with regular paste- but sure works well with the mouth wash and regular past combined</li>
</ol>
