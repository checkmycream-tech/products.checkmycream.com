<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works good. Can leave a line indentation in your hair towards the top, but it may be how I used it. Found that if I don&#x27;t hold it on my hair for very long towards the top, then the indentation isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
    <li> Too bulky &amp; hard to figure out for me.</li>
    <li> It was great. Beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> I had to hold it way toward the front in order to get my hand around it because it opened so wide.  I&#x27;m an average size woman so it&#x27;s not like my hands are tiny either, but this is just so heavy to use.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re better off with a curling iron if u want wavy curly hair! The wave this iron gives sucks! Looks messy. You can scrunch your hair with your hands and get the same results.</li>
    <li> this is my 4th one of these, and i love them! I have two for salon and two for home incase one breaks or something! They&#x27;re my favorite irons!</li>
    <li> I try revlon 3 jumbo waver for first time and when i turn on smoke come out and electric spark sound coming.I think that this is new but when it i try again.Smoke and electric sound doesn&#x27;t stop.I scare but i just want to try and when i use it on my hair.This product burn my hair and my hair fall alot of burn. :((</li>
    <li> This item well give you more of a late 1920&#x27;s -1930&#x27;s wave look. The others like this give a deeper, less soft V wave. I suggest watching the YouTube video on this. It show what you will get, no mater what kind of products you are using in your hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STYLING TOOL. Takes me 10-15 minutes to wave my hair</li>
    <li> I like the product. The seller is pretty good on delivering too.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these wavers. Easy to use: take sections of hair, starting about ten cms from the roots. I have used my GHs to create this look before but these do it all for you! Due to the squeezing action of the wavers, you must be careful not to squeeze too hard, gentle pressure is required. The look is cool and they work a dream.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my niece, and she is quite happy with this gift.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon product is a good deal to buy.</li>
    <li> I had been using this waver since May and I liked it. Just a couple of days ago I was using it on my hair and the handle just broke off making the product unusable. I am very unhappy with this and the time has passed for me to return it or get a replacement. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crimping irons most of my life. And as you can see I am a \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot; of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as expected. Heats up well, etc. And doesn&#x27;t seem anymore heavier or clunker than most other Crimping Irons. And all at a decent price. (29.95) -Someone mentioned that it was $70 in an earlier review? I think they are confused and possibly rating the wrong Iron.</li>
    <li> Works great. Always get compliments after using it. Only take me about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Unless you turn the heat WAY up and have pretty thin hair, its hard to get perfect waves. I have fairly thick long hair that I try not to use too much heat on and overall this is a nice product, but if you have really thick hair this product might not be suited to your needs. Product came super fast</li>
    <li> I bought the product from the site last month on 5\8\2011. Then I refused the order . After that the money cut from my account and until now I did not get the my money and did not get the order.</li>
    <li> It does not really do anything kinda makes the hair look bad even.</li>
    <li> Went to use this for the 3rd time today and the handle completely snapped off.  And not in a way that can be fixed.  The plastic just snapped.  So disappointed. Was 2/3rds of the way done with my hair... so it went into a braid.  If the quality had been better I would have given it 5 stars.  Too much money for only 2 1/2 uses.  Would be nice if they replaced it for me.  Otherwise I will not be replacing it with this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old daughter. She is always trying to get her long hair to have &amp;#34;beachy waves.&amp;#34; I saw this work on a friend&#x27;s short hair and thought it might do the trick. She looked at it sideways when I first gave it to her, but after she tried it she was amazed. It made her hair have big curls. Her hair does have natural wave, but this iron defines the curl. It&#x27;s also very easy to use. It&#x27;s a crimper style iron. You open it and press it down on the hair, and then release. So you are not wrapping the hair like a curling iron. Her hair goes past her shoulders, but my friends hair was just past her ears. It worked on both the short hair and the longer hair.</li>
    <li> This was terrible for my African American hari, could barely hold a wave or a curl</li>
    <li> I have always had this romantic fantasy of having long \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; hair, so I ordered the Jumbo Waver and ended up with a frizzy fro. I am no hair expert, I&#x27;m clumsy and more than a little bit impatient, so take this with a grain of salt, but for me, after using this awkard thing (and burning myself twice), I ended up with a \\&quot;non style\\&quot;, so I brushed it out to make it look more \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; and that is how the fro happened. If you&#x27;re skilled with these kind of tools perhaps this will work great for you, but for me it was a flop.</li>
    <li> the handle is too big for normal hands. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and this is not user friendly</li>
    <li> This curling iron did a good job. The waves were nice and big just how I wanted them. I was afraid that they would be just crimped looking but this iron does create beautiful waves. However, I saw the same exact iron at walmart a few days later for $9.99 and I paid 19 something for it online. You can imagine my disappointment especially when you add shipping and all I had to do was go right down the street for the same item. It&#x27;s a good product just look for it in walmart or another type of retailer before you buy it online.</li>
    <li> the 3-barrel waver is a quick, easy way to get loose, bouncy waves.  it takes me 5-10 minutes to do my whole head and it&#x27;s fairly goof-proof.  my only complaint is that the iron is large and bulky, making it more difficult to manipulate than it needs to be.  i highly recommend it regardless and the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I love it! I get hair that&#x27;s like Marissa Miller&#x27;s/ Helen of Troy. It came in within three days and works wonderfully. Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair</li>
    <li> Why is this selling for so much when other sites have it for about 25 dollars. It is the exact same product. Am I missing something? I love the look this iron gives your hair and I want to buy one but can someone explain the pricing to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron after seeing the waves in a friend&#x27;s hair. \\&quot;Is that your natural wave?\\&quot; I said. She told me how she did it, and two weeks later I bought the waver. It&#x27;s easy to use (that is, uncomplicated to make the waves you want and it doesn&#x27;t take forever) and it works very well.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice idea in theory. It does give your hair a nice wave with practice I might add. I only gave it 3 stars because it is WAY too heavy! As someone with VERY thick long hair it is a workout just to use this. I bought it in July used it 3 times and by October it was in my yard sale. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this at Walmart a few years ago. Still works great. No wear and tear. I use it maybe every other week. Easy to style to hair and it&#x27;s quick. I just set it down on my counter top....not the carpet bc it would burn it. I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Gets the large waves I need.  If your hair looses curls easily you should put gel on each strip before you press with the wave.  Otherwise it will lose the waves before you finish the rest of your hair.  It heats up fast and is easy to use.      Be careful not to accidentally move the temp control while using.  It&#x27;s easy to bump it.</li>
    <li> I Love this Iron! This is the best wave iron out there! For me it works best if you use some hair product (I use hairspray) first on each strand then from the root turn the iron upside down to get the biggest waves from the roots down! The waves last all day long unlike a regular curling iron.  I also have the 3 barrel curling/wave iron, but this wave iron works much faster then the 3 barrel iron for sure!  Saving me much more time getting ready :) Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this iron! I use it all the time! Even though it does take quite a lot of time to complete my hairstyle, I make time bacause my hair look awesome when I do! If you are considering buying this product- take iit from someone who has had it for about a year now! loving it!</li>
    <li> Huge and heavy. I&#x27;ve used it once.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product in great time and when I had it in my hands I had to try it. The 3 barrel makes larger waves and I love it. I have thick hair and the end result made me feel beautiful. I love this product and have absolutly nothing negative to say. This product is amazingly priced and overall exactly what I wanted for my hair.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter wanted the Revlon Jumbo Waver to have another way to wear her hair. It&#x27;s been easy for her to use and the waves are really&lt;br /&gt;cute. The only complaint is that it&#x27;s bulky but I don&#x27;t know what they could do to alter the iron and still achieve the same hair style. FYI: I didn&#x27;t pay this much for mine. Shop around. You can get it much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my two daughters&#x27; hair because they like to have waves sometimes. I did not expect this to work like a $70 iron but it is totally useless.  I have used other things like this on their hair before and they worked great, this barely made any waves and then after about an hour it just looks like frizz.&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to heat up but when it finally did get hot, it still did a horrible job.  I would have assumed for the price it would work better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this.  Try a different one.&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI, they both have thick, soft, straight hair and I used small, thin sections each time I put the irn on their hair.</li>
    <li> PROS:  Heats up really fast.  Mermaid waves turn out beautiful.  Adjustable temperature.     CONS:  It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side.  Bulky.  Has a funny smell to it at first, but hopefully will go away. (I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me and my 11 year old daughter for Christmas.  It gets hot fast and there is a knob that you can turn to adjust the heat.  It was simple to use and my daughter mastered it better than I could!  We have had a blast using it and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> hi   its very good item and make great medum wave as natural wave,  but   the Head conductor of electricity is small   so you should buy another big head to can you use the iron.</li>
    <li> I really love this waver.  It heats up quickly and the waves are the perfect size.  The end result is very cute beach-type waves.  You do have to hold it on for about 10 seconds for it to keep the curl.  I have naturally curly, frizzy hair.  I always blow my hair out and flat iron it.  This waver gives me a different style and a little volume to my normally straight style.  For the price, it is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all hair.  This gives you beautiful beach waves. The only thing I&#x27;d that there is no indicator that it is done heating.</li>
    <li> Truly my all time favorite hair tool!!! I am in love</li>
    <li> Hi there, i tried this product from Amazon, it is really so nice and easy to use  It gives u a very nice wavy look..</li>
    <li> my hairs not that long but i use it and it looks really good. like they all said, it doesnt look like a crimper, the results look like a \\&quot;natural wave\\&quot;-er</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this waver.  It creates the large soft waves I was hoping for and it is very easy to use.  Excellent product for the cost.</li>
    <li> My Hair is about 8 inches from my shoulders and straight with a little wave also it is relatively fine. But whenever I go out I straighten it which takes about 10 minutes. I saw this product online with basically all positive reviews from people who sound like they have the same hair i do so I decided to give it a try. The day i got it tried it and it made the back of my hair straighter than it normally is. I got disappointed because I thought that it wouldnt work. The third time trying it I finally got the hang of it. It looks like i expected: natural, wavy and beachy looking. Other people who wrote reviews said its heavy but its not at all! It took me 20 minutes to do it. Before each section (I did four sections) i lightly sprayed my hair with hairspray. This product is awesome, don&#x27;t hesitate, go buy it!</li>
    <li> I love this waver, its a good price, and the waver is nice and big so it makes it a little faster to wave your hair than the smaller ones. I havent had a problem with the product yet. I just didnt like that it doesnt have a stand to put down on the counter. Besides that, it styles my hair very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this, easy to use, beautiful hair!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy and big. I have small hands so holding it for a long time stresses my hand. As another reviewer mentioned, once you open it up, you can&#x27;t put it down unless you clip the handle close. I have to constantly clip the handle closed before putting it down and release the handle after picking up another part of my hair to crimp. After a few times of practice, I can do it without a lot of clumsiness on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark coarse hair so I use the highest settings. I don&#x27;t make the curls perfect and it looks great, like beachy waves. Also saves me a lot of time too. I spray a liberal amount of hairspray on afterward and it holds for the whole day. Also gives it more volume too since my hair is so flat. The waves also reflect the light so my hair looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 10-15 minutes to do my entire head (I have really long hair). I use this for days when I want more volume in my hair, but can&#x27;t afford to spend a lot of time on it. Creating perfect curls with a curling iron takes 25 minutes. Yikes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this waver, but unfortunately I only got to use it a few time (3) before it no longer would get hot.  I was so sad.  It worked so well on my long, Straight, straight, sleek, thin hair. I plugged it in and the light came on and it got hot.  I was able to do about three sections of hair before I realized it was no longer hot enough and then it went cold.  I tried other sockets, but it didn&#x27;t help. I read other reviews about this happening,but figured I would give it a try.  I do like it enough to purchase it one more time and hopefully it will last longer  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Well, it&#x27;s been a year since I&#x27;ve purchased my 2nd deep waver and it is still working.  The only problem I have with it is that it makes my hair have a burning smell after using it.  I even use it on a very low setting.  It may just be my hair, but curling irons don&#x27;t leave my hair with that smell.</li>
    <li> I am a product of a Norwegian mother and a Hungarian father. My people are not known for thick wavy hair. I have super thin, anemic hair. As a child if you put a barrette in it, by the middle of the day the barrette was hanging by a lone hair or it slid to the bottom, or it vanished. I got perms galore, but they never stayed for long. I learned to love my straight hair, which I can wash and run with. I can braid it and bun it and twirl it and with enough product it will stay for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned curler after curler, in fact I just got this one [[ASIN:B0050QJ0YQ Remington CI52FO Wrap to Waves Ceramic Hair Styler]] and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I wanted curly waves, but without having to wear gloves and fear of seriously burning myself and having to work too hard to weave my hair around an appliance that was hard to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon Jumbo Waver, is a hair styling tool, for those of us who are lazy...and are prone to accidents. Its so stinking easy! I section my hair with clips, take a chunk and proceed to clamp the hair, moving downward as I go and BAM...waves. It takes me less than 10 minutes to get huge wavy results. EVEN on my thin hair,,this gives me TONS of volume and it stays! even without products!!</li>
    <li> Love its! Finally found one with bigger barrels! The ones at Wal-Mart are too small. They&#x27;re good if you have thin, frail hair I guess. But this. I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I have only used this item a few times even though I bought it a while ago. The last time I used it the handle broke. I think the front of the barrel is too big and the handle is too wimpy! I am looking at getting a new one but will not choose this one! Disappointed.</li>
    <li> For what I paid this was a pretty good product. I have fairly thin hair so it held the waves for a pretty long time.  The only thing is that its awkward to hold, I burned myself a few times, but overall its a pretty great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading some reviews saying this was a fast and easy way to change up your hair style. I opened this as soon as it came. I have long, straight hair so I needed a change! Sadly, this did not work at all. It also came with no instructions. I could see some wave in my hair when I first started but by the time I got to the other side of my head the wave was gone from the side I started with. By the time I got done with all of my hair it looked frizzy and like I just woke up. I&#x27;m Very disappointed. I was thinking about returning it but I&#x27;ve decided to look online for a video on how to use it. Hopefully it will work out better! At this point i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for a few months now. Every time I take the time (about 20 minutes) to wave my hair, Revlon gets a new customer. So far, three of my friends have purchased this item after borrowing mine. The iron takes a while to heat up so if you start using before the iron is at the right temperature, you will get mediocre waves. I wave small sections at a time and use a heat protectant/ style setting spray. My hair does not usually hold curl but the waver actually holds for the whole day. One thing to note is that if you you should hold the iron in place for about 7-10 seconds before moving to the next piece. Also, if you are unsure that the iron is hot enough, start on the under layer of hair in the back which will be covered up anyway. The end result is that my hair looks surprisingly voluminous and looks very shiny. My hair is normally coarse and slightly frizzy.</li>
    <li> good product and good price   every body lkie it and ask for it, my family my friends and my nigobours</li>
    <li> This product is the latest in the block when it comes to hair care and style...Tired of straight flat hair? Use the 3 barrell curling iron for HOLLYWOOD looking waves...</li>
    <li> I read about a lot of different wavers and all of their reviews for quite some time before settling on this one. I have medium-length, layered, fine hair (blonde), and it doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily. With this waver, used properly (test it out one or two times before you use it on the day you&#x27;re going out), my hair looks AWESOME! I get beautiful \\&quot;beach waves\\&quot;, and lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Worked great, but a little bulky to do by yourself.</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter.  Arrived in 3 days!  She loves it...and it&#x27;s hard to please a teenager!</li>
    <li> the waves didn&#x27;t really hold. waste of money</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time tonight and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. I have curly/wavy medium thick hair and I only needed to heat the barrel up to 15. After I got the hang of it, I didn&#x27;t even have to use my hand, but just glide the waver down my hair. The waves stay without hairspray and I feel like a beach babe. :) No more curling irons or overnight braids. You&#x27;ve got one happy girl over here.</li>
    <li> I got this waver just a couple minths ago and it seemed ok, the waves take for ever to form and they eventually fall out or get tangled ugly.  This iron is soooo  heavy you get tired of counting to 30 for each wave!  So I researched and went and sprung for the Infiniti conair crimper!  Pay the extra money and get what is better for sure!!! AWESOME Infiniti CONAIR  it is light, waves are perfect and created in a 5 second time frame and it is super light, so dont waist your money on this crimper, its a pain in the ACE!!!</li>
    <li> The arrival was extremely rapid. The product is quite large, but after using it I realized it has to be exactly true. I love how my hair I have left these waves. I&#x27;m fascinated. I recommend it because it is easy to use and the result is quite fast.</li>
    <li> First off, this may or may not show as an Amazon verified purchase.  I ordered, and it was out of stock, so eventually canceled after I found it at my local Target last week.  But I do own this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy waves!  I&#x27;ve looked at several wavers over the last few months, and you need to Google pictures of &#x27;triple barrel waver hairstyles&#x27; and &#x27;deep waver hairstyles&#x27; to really see the difference -- know what look you&#x27;re after and save the hassle of buying the wrong type.  Also, I watched a video on YouTube (there are many, but I only watched one that had a lot of views) to get a sense of what I would be dealing with.  Lastly, there is a difference between the results you get from a regular triple barrel waver and a &#x27;JUMBO&#x27; waver.  Decide how wavy you want your hair.  If you want a tight enough wave to resemble curls, a standard size is probably the way to go.  If you want looser waves, the kind you typically see on todays television personalities -- go with the jumbo size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I was educated going into my purchase.  Real life was a little different.&lt;br /&gt;-- Waver is heavy.  It&#x27;s not so heavy you can&#x27;t do it, but your front shoulder muscle is probably going to ache a bit after using this.&lt;br /&gt;-- Didn&#x27;t come with anything to set the hot iron on, so I used a silicone pad from the kitchen.  It&#x27;s quite big, so the silicone kept it from slipping off the side of a relatively narrow (2\\&quot;) sink.  It gets very hot, so protect your surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And other than that I have nothing negative to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I both used the waver (I used a little gel on my wet hair) with a teeny tiny bit of spray on the waves right after the iron was removed.  Her waves lasted 48 hours, with some loosening.  Mine probably would have lasted much longer had I not showered.  Maybe I used the temperature too hot (I used the heat resistance spray) and thin layers so the heat was only applied for a few seconds at a time, but the waves stayed.  Having watched that YouTube video, it made it so easy to do a good job right out of the gate.  My trial run was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waves look almost natural to me.  So happy for a tool to give me a change-up when needed!ched that YouTube video, it made it so easy to do a good job right out of the gate.  My trial run was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waves look almost natural to me.  So happy for a tool to give me a change-up when needed!</li>
    <li> I really looked forward to putting waves in my hair with this. The size of the waves would have been so perfect. The problem is that it never got hot enough. It would get warm and I would have VERY mild waves that would completely disappear no more than 90 minutes later. I would even use lots of extra time on each wave--if I used just the standard amount of time I use with any other styling device, it wouldn&#x27;t hold at all. I also put hairspray on before I used it which would normally be somewhat dangerous with products that heated up to a normal temp and still it barely worked&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t just the [[ASIN:B000FRWNL2 Revlon RV084C 3-Barrel Jumbo Waver with Ceramic]] I had originally purchased that was defective. I so loved the design that I exchanged it at the store I purchased it for another one. The replacement didn&#x27;t warm up either.&lt;br /&gt;The ones that gave this 5 stars must have seriously thin hair.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine in Peru requested that I order and bring down one of these to her.  She did much homework on it .. online....and her friend has one....so she is thrilled to have one of her own.  So....I know I can rate this a good rating.&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
    <li> I loved this waver. I would wave my hair once a week. the waves lastest for a few days and I always recieved compliments. Unfortunely, my revlon waver stopped working, it just won&#x27;t turn on anymore which is really depressing, and why I couldn&#x27;t give the full 5 stars for the review:( . Great product though!</li>
    <li> super HOT. People are just amazed at how well this product performs. Bought for 10yr old, should have adult supervision.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this 3 Barrel Jumbo Waver because the picture didn&#x27;t show the girl with ringlet type curls it gives you hope.  This just does big waves.  I does look pretty and kind of reminds me of a 1940&#x27;s hairdo which was pretty.  It is easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this waver at first because I was afraid it would just crimp my hair. I used it right when I recieved it and I absolutely loved it! It makes my hair look naturally curly, kind of like if I had slept with braids in. And it stays in with no problem! I recomend this product to anyone looking for something different!!!</li>
    <li> It does not work on my hair at all! I would return it but my husband threw out the packaging!</li>
    <li> I really liked this crimper but i havent even had it for a year yet and it broke out of nowhere, The light still comes on but it wont heat up. I expected more from a revlon product.</li>
    <li> All was going great until halfway though my first use the waver short circuited and threw sparks at me!!  Not only did it throw sparks, one barrel became VERY hot and fried off a section of my hair!!  This was not user error as I had the iron on medium heat and it was perfectly fine until it exploded.  This is probably a rare occurrence but it happened and needless to say I&#x27;m not giving it a good review.  I&#x27;ll be calling the company and I hope the customer service is good.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair so I was a bit nervous.. but thanks to the heat settings I can get it warm enough to work on my hair! It gave me the exact results that I was hoping for... I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap made, waited 21 days for this item to arrive and opened up the oversized packaging box and found no coushining in the box to protect the product, of course the product was broke. I was very unhappy and mad this was supposed to be a christmas gift but as seen above arrived 4 days after christmas. Don&#x27;t buy this cheap piece crap and don&#x27;t rely on the tracking either they say its somewhere but its really somewhere else. Never again i will purchase a product like this.</li>
    <li> It looked great the first time I used it. The second time I used it the spring came shooting out and it fell apart! Horribly made!!</li>
    <li> Makes really cute waves... It is easy to use... I would recomment this product to anyone... No Complaints... We love it...</li>
    <li> Was very skeptical when I bought this waver since I&#x27;m not a big fan of other Revlon&#x27;s hair product, but this 3 barrel Jumbo Waver is GREAT!  It&#x27;s very easy to use, heat up very fast and creates that \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; hair waves very quickly. I have coarse hair (and use setting 20) and it takes me less than 15 mins to do all my hair, and the waves last the whole day :) The only thing with the waver is that there is no safety stand for it, so just have to be careful where you put it or u might burn the counter since some part of the metal will be in contact with the counter.</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase. It works quickly and easily, it only took me a couple of uses to get it down very well. The only thing reason I didnt give it all 5 stars is because periodically when you squeeze the handle, you will hit the on/off switch and unknowingly turn off the iron, which you probably wont notice until your hair stops curling. Once you realize you do it though, its easy enough to reposition your pressure so you dont turn it off, so the problem is easily solved.</li>
    <li> Iron is very heavy and a little hard to handle with one hand when trying to hold hair with the other... I like the waves it creates, but not the line it leaves if you don&#x27;t start at your temple.</li>
    <li> When I bought this product, it worked AMAZING. I have really long, thick hair and it still gave me great waves. I loved this waver the first month I had it. However..after that first month it stopped heating up and it no longer works. I tried messing around with the heat dial, letting it heat up for an hour, nothing worked. I was very angered by this because it was such a great waver. I have another waver, but the crimps just aren&#x27;t as large and flowing. I am hesitant to purchase another one of these because I am afraid that one will stop working as well, seeing that a friend of mine also had the same problem with hers, and after reading another review on here about the same problem.</li>
    <li> I had done a lot of research for a waver and kept coming back to this one.  What made me order it was that it was a \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; waver that promised to give larger waves and the fact that it was ceramic not metal like many of the others out there.  The price was surprisingly low so I was skeptical but figured I&#x27;d try it out.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!  It really does make very large waves and they come out beautiful.  They even last until the next day if you spray it.  It heats up fast and gets very hot.  I will say that it is very cumbersome and heavy and if you have long or thick hair, it may be hard to do your own hair. Takes some practice.  My hair is thinner and past my shoulders and it takes me about 10 minutes if I&#x27;m doing it for a quick change up from my normal straight style.  I could spend more time and it would only look even better. I have gotten so many compliments from complete strangers about how nice my hair looks the day I wave it.  I have tried it on my mom&#x27;s hair and my sister&#x27;s and unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work as well. So I do think results will vary depending on your hair type.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that beach hair look, then buy this. It does not curl your hair but rather makes it wavy. I got a lot of compliments. It&#x27;s easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I chose this one as the barrels were a tad larger &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Such a pretty wave.</li>
    <li> It gives lovely waves, and the day after its styled I found my hair still had a lot of body in it :) the only thing is that it smokes a lot as its heating up which was quite alarming when I first used it but apart from that its great and very fast :D (works best on day old hair, the newly washed hair doesn&#x27;t hold the waves as well so you&#x27;ll be ages styling it)</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Take me 15 minutes to do the whole hair. &lt;br /&gt;Looks like I have natural curl. &lt;br /&gt;At the beginning I have to learn how to use it, but once I figure out, it is easy. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love this waver. I bought an iron before this from someone else but it acts more as a crimping iron. This iron is much better and every time I use it, people give me many compliments because the curls/waves look beautiful and very exotic. Highly recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, long hair.  I use this often and get so many compliments on it.  It is a very large wand but it has been very easy to use. Takes me about ten minutes to curl my hair now that I have practiced. The curls lasts until I wash my hair.  So glad I made this purchase!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. A little heavy but that&#x27;s be of the three barrels.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I&#x27;ve been looking for so long to find a waver that will wave my hair without making it look crimped and this is perfect!! The waves come out exactly how it looks on the box.. I love it !!  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently. I&#x27;ve to say, it doesnt get hot enough so waves wont stay on. But, ironically, the outside face of the bottom plate (not the two barrels but the opposite part) gets extremely hot and since is a wide area, it&#x27;s easy to get burn.</li>
    <li> I bought a smaller waver but didn&#x27;t really like the effect. This is perfect for my long hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> The Revlon waver isn&#x27;t too bad of a product considering that it&#x27;s only $20.  The waver produces nice waves, but only when used with hair wax or a wet-effect spray so that the waves don&#x27;t look too frizzy. The iron is extremely heavy, is awkward to hold, doesn&#x27;t heat up very quickly and isn&#x27;t very hot so it&#x27;s a pain to hold the HEAVY iron in place for at least twenty seconds for each section to have the waves set.  I have very fine hair and not too much hair, so if this iron takes a long time to do my hair, I imagine it will take much longer for people with coarser hair.  The iron doesn&#x27;t have tourmaline plates so your hair doesn&#x27;t look shiny and is easily damaged. Pros: the waves stay tight and looks the same as when you first \\&quot;waved\\&quot; your hair even after a day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this waving curling iron! I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair as when I stole it with this.</li>
    <li> I received this on time, however, the waver does not work. The light turns on, but it puts out zero heat. Sadly, i threw away the packaging, so i will be eating this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good . good shipment . in a short time. thanks it,s easy dealing with you.no dammage as same as what i saw in web</li>
    <li> I just got this today and am pretty disappointed. When I used it even on small sections of my hair it just looks like a big crimper - definitely does NOT look natural, so I feel silly wearing the style. Going to return it in favor of one of the wand curling irons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted~</li>
    <li> it holds a wave which is saying something cause my hair doesnt, and my only issuse is that it gets really hot and i burn myself, but im not blaming that entirely on the product itself i&#x27;ve used it like 5 times and im starting to like it more and more</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it but after only a few uses it fell apart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very heavy.  The closing handle is so big that I had to hold it close to the center.... touched the heated element several times.  Ouch!  I have straight straight hair and this tool did wave my hair but it didn&#x27;t last more than 3 hours.</li>
    <li> Its huge and heavy and I&#x27;ve already burned myself a few times, but I love the results I get from using this tool!</li>
    <li> This is a really great little waver for the money. I just got it yesterday and tried it out today. I loved it! It is pretty big but not heavy and it has multiple heat settings. I have straight, fine hair past my shoulders that does not usually hold a curl and I was able to make very pretty s-shaped curls within minutes. It took me about 10 minutes to do my entire head. It is 14 hours later and the curls have stayed in all this time. In fact it looks the same as when I first curled my hair. One review says you cannot set it down but I put it on my bathroom counter multiple times without incident. I have wished for curly hair all my life and suddenly here it is! I just wish they would have invented these back in the 80s so I wouldn&#x27;t have had to get all those awful, stinky perms! :)</li>
    <li> It is a great product and beneficial Thank you and will I deal with you next time I have won the satisfaction</li>
    <li> My favorite hair tool (and I have a lot of them)!! Makes pretty waves that get me lots of compliments. My hair is long and layered.  I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on short hair.  It does take practice to get the look you want!!! I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 years and use it all summer. The waves last, even after a sweaty workout with it in a ponytail. I just shake it out and go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy to burn your self with this barrel, since it&#x27;s so large! It gives nice loose waves but not tight waves.   Overall it&#x27;s a good hair tool, and heats up VERY quickly. :)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic tool. I have straight hair that has no body and refuses to hold a curl. I used one product and my hair was wavy all day. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with straight hair.</li>
    <li> First I will start off with that I didn&#x27;t realize this was JUMBO barrels. It threw me off when I opened the box because my friend has a waver but just a regular size one. But it does give you adorable waves. You have to take small, small strands of your hair if you want it to have a definite wave in it..I at first tried to take as much of my hair as I would with a curling iron and it wasn&#x27;t working. But after about half way through waving my hair I got the hang of it and it turned out great. I recommend using hair spray to keep the hold on the waves.</li>
    <li> I have really short hair and this works great to give it a nice wave.</li>
    <li> While this does get very hot and will provide a nice wave on long hair it will not last long. I am a hair stylist and I used it about 4 times and it stopped heating up. Won&#x27;t waste my money again. Looks like others on here have complained about it breaking as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this particular product because I happen to notice how great my friends hair looked one day. I asked her how she did it and she told me that she used this crimper. I was actually very surprised that her hair turned out the way it did with a crimper. So I found the product on here and when I received it I was like holy crap this thing is huge!!! I really wanted my hair to look like hers so i decided to try it out right away. Unfortunately i had just washed my hair that morning. I have the type of hair that does not hold curl unless i use tons of product. I was pressed for time so i didnt use any product and so my hair didnt turn out very nice. Not going to lie I was kinda sad. I was even thinking of returning it. My husband was like it doesnt seem to do anything for your hair. I decided that i would try again the next day when my hair had time to get a little greasy. This time i used lots of moose and hairspray and my hair turned out FANTASTIC! It looked amazing! After i got done with it my husband saw it and said, \\&quot;Wow babe your hair looks great! Like really good, you look hot!\\&quot; I have a smaller crimper but i really love how this one makes my hair look more wavy. I would definitely recommend this. I wish i could post a picture on here so you all can see!</li>
    <li> Kinda makes your hair frizzy and dry&lt;br /&gt;Use once a month for a lazy look. Use a good leave in conditioner before using or heat protection spray.</li>
    <li> I like the look this iron gives my hair but it takes a while and it is awkward and bulky to use. Be preared to burn yourself quite a few times in the begining while learning how to manipulate the iron in order to achieve the best results. The wave look only lasted a few hours in my hair as well. Also, I only had it for about 2 months, using it maybe every other week and it just stopped working. It turns on but doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore. I would not recommend this product after using it. I just ordered another brand after reading its reviews so I hope it workes better than this one did.  It will give your hair a wave look if you go slow and use small sections but as for quality and easy to use I have to say that it fails...</li>
    <li> gives really nice beachy waves.  its fast and easy to do your hair and looks really pretty. i recommend it for people with hair longer than chin length.</li>
    <li> This three barrel curler makes the best waves! Between my two teenage girls, this iron is used everyday.  It is so popular that other teens come to my house to borrow it.  This is a definite must have! :o)  ~Happy Mom~</li>
    <li> Makes cute waves, just not sure if it works well with my hair lol</li>
    <li> I have yet to use my Jumbo waver, but I was really happy with the speed of my delivery. The package was brand new and in great shape as described and I am really excited to use my waver! Thank you and I would purchase again from this company!</li>
    <li> doesnt really work so well</li>
    <li> it was good while it lasted but u would think the size and how bulky it looks it woulnt break dat easy rite? wrong........i dropped it by accident on a carpeted floor ...a good 2-3 ft off da ground..next time i turned it on...did not heat up at all...it was good while it lasted but..jus dont drop it</li>
    <li> this wave iron is great because the barrels are so big.  it creates really nice loose waves in just a little bit of time because the iron heats up pretty quickly and you dont need to hold the iron in place for very long to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> Not easy to maneuver and frizzed out my wife&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product for large crimps. Works great on my thick hair. Quick heat up and covers a lot of area with one clamp.</li>
    <li> Got this &amp; absolutely LOVED it!!! That is until it stopped working after a few months of use. Hardly worth it. I am now ordering a new one, but am seeing that others have had the same problem as I am with it suddenly not heating up - just barely getting warm. Think I may be trying a new brand. I have fine hair, and love the look that this gives me. I found that my curls work better when my hair is a little &#x27;dirty&#x27;. When I&#x27;ve done it just after shampooing, my hair is just fluffy &amp; fly-awayie. If I do it after a day or 2 of not shampooing, and then just separate curls with my fingers - it looks great. Tons of compliments. Had alot of fun with it &amp; am SO sad it isn&#x27;t working now! Shouldn&#x27;t be having to buy a new one (or should I say a different brand) so soon. Revlon, I am so disappointed!</li>
    <li> Greatest styling took ever ok I&#x27;ve had this since 8th grade now I&#x27;m in college I use it almost every day it&#x27;s amazing I get tuns of compliments on my hair all the time it makes the perfect beachy wave love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter for Christmas and I think I like it more than she does! I am not much of a \\&quot;hair\\&quot; person and pretty much do the same thing day after day. This is very easy to use and you&#x27;re done quickly. It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. I have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair since I started using this. I have a lot of hair but the strands are fine so I definitely have to work in layers, but I have to do that with all styling tools, so again it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this hair styler. It did great things for my hair, and produced the results that were promised on the packaging. However, after only 4 uses the handle completely snapped off rendering the iron unusable. I have put in a call to Revlon&#x27;s customer service, as I am quite displeased with the quality of this product, and after having spent $25 on it at Target, I am feeling a little jipped. Spend the extra money on a better quality item. You&#x27;ll be happier in the long run.</li>
    <li> Grand daughter wanted this for Christmas, and she was pleased to get it, but in all her pics on Face Book, she has straight hair.  I guess she uses it</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! She uses it almost every day. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Product as described. Quick delivery. I wasn&#x27;t able to achieve the large wave look I was going for with this waver. Very hard to manipulate and hold for a long period of time due to the heaviness and size of the waver. Creates a very daunting task for someone with thick hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this, used it once or twice and gave it to charity.  It is clunky and large, the barrels are not traditional nonstick or chrome but made of a porous-looking material that doesn&#x27;t allow your hair to slide like the nonstick, ceramic or chrome ones do.  I have fine hair that isn&#x27;t real thick and three teen &amp; adult daughters who live at home.  We all tried this and didn&#x27;t like it or the resulting hairstyle at all and we all have varying degrees of thickness to our hair (all long though).  The results were strange looking like you used the old fashioned hot curlers with the metal clips and they left lines in your hair.  It says with ceramic on the title but this isn&#x27;t like the ceramic curling iron I recently purchased.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty big product compared to the rest of my iron straighteners. It took a while to curl my entire hair. The shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> after having it for a week the handle broke and there was no way to fix it! it is a great product just made cheap. how do i get a refund or replacement?</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 16 year old daughter and she loves it! Her hair looks so beautiful after using this. It is the perfect amount of wave without being curly.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and makes amazing large waves, but it&#x27;s way too heavy u need help to do all ur hair, I was doing my hair then the handle crashed!!!! Bad bad quility</li>
    <li> this barrel waver didn&#x27;t work and after using it, my hair stay the same.Moreover,the iron doesn&#x27;t get hot until 3 minute or longer.</li>
    <li> Turned it on and within 20 seconds it started smoking and set on fire leaving the plastic to burn and almost my carpet!! Very dangerous! Would not recommend 😡😡😡😡😡</li>
    <li> got this for my 16 year old daughter.  seems to be easy to use since it doesnt take much time for her to get ready in the morning, thus freeing up the bathroom for others!</li>
    <li> this product is very big&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t thing it was like this&lt;br /&gt;when i use it its good and do fine&lt;br /&gt;but i think because it big and heavy i cant handle it easy&lt;br /&gt;in last its good to make wavy hair</li>
    <li> Love it. Make hair look cute, nice big waves not small crimps</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this, because my hair is flat and no body. It does wave your hair if you can hold it up long enough to get all your hair done....Its very heavy and hard to handle.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for about 3 weeks and have only used it 3 or 4 times.  As I was mid-way through waving my hair today, it stopped working.  The handle didn&#x27;t break, as other reviewers have stated (although it DOES seem cheap for such a heavy-duty appliance).  Rather, it simply stopped heating.  It has 30 heat settings and I have been able to set it at level 5 and it was plenty hot to do the job.  Yet I turned it up to 30 and it wouldn&#x27;t even get warm.  Luckily I can still return it for an exchange as it&#x27;s been under 30 days since purchased.  Beyond that, they&#x27;ll replace it but you pay shipping plus $6.00.  Love the product and the results on my hair...  If only the product would last more than 3 weeks!</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair, and this product is great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not. Fail.</li>
    <li> My roommate had one of these, and it worked marvelously, so after about a year I finally went out and bought one for myself. Worked just fine until about three months later when the handle and spring broke off. Called Helen of Troy (handles Revlon appliances), and they said that since it had already passed the 30 day warranty, I would have to mail it in to get a replacement. That&#x27;s a lot of effort for a college student particularly when the item cost about $18. So, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought the waver and it works well when i do it on someone elses hair but when i try to do it myself it is very hard. it is very big so it is super hard to do your own hair with.</li>
    <li> Feels Very BIG in your hand. And its a little hard to handle but the beatiful Waves you get more then makes up for that.</li>
    <li> The handle broke after the second use. This item was not mistreated nor was it misused. Not durable at all!</li>
    <li> i should have ordered a smaller 3 barrel waver. it does a good job but my hair is too short. I recently cut my hair however, when it grows longer it will be better.</li>
    <li> Very cool&lt;br /&gt;But I have a problem&lt;br /&gt;Written on the device 120v&lt;br /&gt;And tried it on 110v&lt;br /&gt;But I want to use on 220 v and I am afraid that is burning!</li>
    <li> item doesn&#x27;t curl hair very fast. therefore you are forced to hold the hot curler on your hair too long damaging and drying out hair. I would not recommend. I can get same results simply by braiding my hair when wet and allowing to dry for same waves result!</li>
    <li> I love the look this gives to your hair!! Only problem is it&#x27;s super heavy,which makes it hard to hold!!</li>
    <li> I love this one so much, I will recommend my friend to purchase it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this waver at Walmart a month ago and loved it. Yesterday I went to use it and the handle just snapped completely off!!! I called Revlon to complain that their \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; product was cheap and she informed me that I could pay for shipping to mail it to them and they would send me a replacement. Luckily I still have my receipt and will be returning it to Walmart. I will be buying a better one, not some \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; piece if JUNK!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair appliance! It doesn&#x27;t curl your hair, so if you&#x27;re looking for a curler, this isn&#x27;t it. This will give you beautiful beach waves. I have straight, long, fairly thin and dry hair. It takes me about 40 minutes to do my whole head. I don&#x27;t use any product when I use this. My hair will loosen as the day goes, but it just looks better by the end of the day. My hair comes out silky and shiny and I am totally satisfied with the results. It is large and heavy, but that&#x27;s the price we pay for beauty - you do get used to it. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I burned my head and ears when I first started using it. After using it a few times and getting used to it, no more burns. Also, the reviewer who said she couldn&#x27;t put it down on the counter, I put mine down all the time and have never once burnt the counter. I&#x27;ve had this for almost two years and am tempted to buy another only because if mine ever breaks, I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to get another. It&#x27;s Murphy&#x27;s Law. If I like something, they&#x27;ll stop making it!</li>
    <li> I really liked the jumbo waver when I first got it...took me a couple times to figure out how to use it the way I liked. Just as I got the hang of it, the handle broke that opens and closes the waver! I never dropped it or mis-used it, so I don&#x27;t know what happened but I&#x27;m sending it back and hopefully they will replace the darn thing.</li>
    <li> Heat very quickly,easy to handle and use.Beatiful waves,makes my hair sleek and shiny.Downside:becomes heavy after a while as you can&#x27;t put lit down once it&#x27;s hot.</li>
    <li> Hello Wonderful machine and works great waves and gives the natural beauty of the hair does not need to go to the saloon</li>
    <li> This gives you big beautiful wavy hair, but it takes a long time to do your whole head of hair. Also, it is rather heavy and clumsy, but once you get the hang of it its ok. I love the way it makes my hair look, but i rarely use it because it takes so long and it fries my hair.</li>
    <li> So great! So fast!&lt;br /&gt;I totally LOVE this item! I got so quickly my hairstyle and even if my hair are short, that worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;The price and the shipping were great!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> This product is fine but not the best.   It&#x27;s good if you are wearing a headscarf or thick headband.    Pros: It heats up VERY quickly and creates nice waves (not crimps) without making hair look dead.    Cons: It leaves a very noticeable crease in your hair because of the outside barrel&#x27;s \\&quot;interesting\\&quot; design. Also, you have to be sure that you don&#x27;t hit the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button while using it.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and in original packaging! Still have a tuff time trying to learn how to use it but my sister does it beautifully!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like this hair appliance.  It gives me a new hairstyle that I looks different.  It&#x27;s not just the same style that&#x27;s curled at the ends, nor is it the straightened look.  I have thick long hair, and it works fine... make sure you crimp little sections though.   If you want to make sure your hair will stay and show the curls, you have to add hairspray and gel.  If you don&#x27;t have either, your hair will still be wavy, but it won&#x27;t be as prominent.  It takes a while, so make sure you have a lot of time to get ready!  Good luck, and have fun with it :o) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is probably the best hair tool I have! And the price is amazing!!!!! It heats up quick and because it&#x27;s so big you can get a good amount of hair in each time. Waves last all day and even to the next day. This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased and my friends like using it - even got one of them to purchase one for herself. A must have!!!!</li>
    <li> Stopped working 2 months after purchase date.  Just didnt turn on anymore.  Other people seem to have had this problem too.  My verdict...don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to change your style in under 10 min. it takes no time to heat up, and leaves waves in your hair, the kind of waves that look like you just unbraided your hair. Its a nice change of pace every now and then.  I have pin straight fine hair, so this tool comes in handy when im bored with my hair!&lt;br /&gt;My only commplaint is that it&#x27;s big and heavy. Its hard to handle because of its weight and Im always afraid im going to burn my ears! Also because of its size It&#x27;s hard to store anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, it works. Its quick. It&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> The waver definitely gets hot enough to wave my coarse and straight hair (hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl) and the wave will stay in for most, if not all, of the day.  I read complaints about not being able to set it down, but if you leave the waver open you can set it down on it&#x27;s ceramic ends, like a tent.  It&#x27;s actually a pretty ingenius design.      I used to have a vidal sassoon waver but the Revlon Jumbo waver definitely gives you bigger waves.  Personally I think that the bigger waves looks better.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s made out of ceramic, rather than the metal wavers.    100% satisfied with mine.</li>
    <li> I would recomment this product to anyone...No Complaints...We love it...I have bought two of them...One for me and one for my daughter!!!</li>
    <li> so excited to buy this and try it...however, took it out of the packaging, plugged it in, turned it on and it wouldnt even heat up. un plugged it several times and turned it to 30 (highest setting) and it didnt even slightly get warm. i will look at another brand...thought revlon made better products</li>
    <li> I bought this barrel waver with high hopes, and really pleased with the price. The reviews gave me the extra boost I needed to buy, but upon receiving this product I was enormously disappointed. Even at the highest heat setting, and allowing it to reach that temperature, this tool did not wave my (very fine) hair, regardless of my testing it on one inch and one and a half inch sections. It did create frizzy, weird kinks that reminded me of wrinkles in fabric. Not at all attractive. I gave it a fair trial, using it to style my whole head before giving up and blow drying my hair straight again. No way I could go out looking like that.  The product is also rather heavy, it did not cause me any discomfort but the weight made it twice as unwieldy as it would have been normally. I found myself contorting into odd positions to clamp my hair properly.   I&#x27;m sending mine back tomorrow.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! A friend of mine had this exact crimper she bought at Walmart. I searched for it on Amazon and it was much cheaper online. It literally gives you the perfect beach wave curls. It actually looks very natural if you try not to crimp your hair for an extended period of time. It is slightly heavy, but totally worth the outcome.</li>
    <li> I love this waver! It creates the perfect size waves for my hair.  For girls with shorter hair it might be a little harder to wave it all because it is so big, but it is great! It can be slightly hard to hold because it is so big.  The handle can get a little rough on your hand because it isn&#x27;t totally rounded, but it doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it all the time.  Overall, it is just what I was looking for and I&#x27;m so glad I got it!</li>
    <li> You have to make sure to use the plate side down and be very careful not to burn your hand.</li>
    <li> It works and looks good for me!!! People compliment me on hair all the time. It&#x27;s really good I think.</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron. It worked very well on my hair (which is pretty thin and fine) and the price was great. However, only after about four uses of it it broke.. Basically it won&#x27;t heat up anymore and I have no idea why. It&#x27;s actually very upsetting because I was just starting to get good at using it. I&#x27;ve tried plugging it into different outlets and what not but still with no luck :/ I&#x27;d still recommend buying this, I just hope it was a fluke problem with mine and not the product overall...</li>
    <li> On special occasions, I used to take my single curling iron and painstakingly curl up, then down, and repeat until I had a nice marcel wave, but this does the job five times faster! It heats up fast, and in like 10 minutes creates the desired 1920s \\&quot;finger wave\\&quot; that I used to spend an hour doing. Very cool, and if you don&#x27;t want the 20s look, you can wear it a little messier for a \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; style.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It&#x27;s very heavy, clunky, and a bit hard to use if you have long and/or thick hair. This is so cumbersome to use that I&#x27;ve only tried it a few times, and it&#x27;s now sitting in a drawer. For this reason, I can&#x27;t comment on the other reviews that claim the product broke after a few uses. I can say that I&#x27;ve used other triple-barrel irons in the past that were lighter and much easier to handle, so I can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Took a little getting used to, but this is great...I can \\&quot;wave\\&quot; my long hair in minutes and it lasts, something a curling iron could never do for my very straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair but the curls are uncontrollable and unpredictable. I was looking for a curling iron that would be quick with long-lasting results that look natural. Well this is perfect. It enhances my natural waves and truly does look natural. I get tons of compliments and the curls are long lasting. I truly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this waver. Only prob is you have to do small strands of hair so sometimes it takes too long! Otherwise it works really good!! I love it. Pretty inexpensive too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I was disappointed.  Even on its highest setting it doesn&#x27;t work very fast.  I have to hold it in my, or my girls&#x27;, hair so long that my arm gets tired and I find I rarely want to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this at target and within the first 2 minutes of me using it the thicker side completly snapped off. It exposed the wires and everything. Its made out of really cheap plastic. The people who wrote good reviews on this product were lucky it didnt break within 2 minutes of using it, but I am 100% certain it will break on them soon.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it gives my hair the most beautiful waves, and i love it for such a good price it cant be beat. i recommend this product to everyone who likes to do things with their hair. i have medium length hair and my sister has long hair and it came out so perfect on both of us:) lalaloveeee this,</li>
    <li> My neighbor has this waver and I tried it and had to get one for myself! The first one didn&#x27;t even turn on - but it was replaced easily and quickly and the second works perfectly! I get lots of compliments when I do it, and it doesn&#x27;t take long!</li>
    <li> Love this waver. I like that I received it on time I just wish it was I little more hotter. But other then that I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because a friend had one and it made her hair look fantastic. It&#x27;s easy to use with long hair however it gets interesting on short hair because the barrels are so big. Overall though it&#x27;s a great product if you want some vintage looking waves in your hair.</li>
    <li> this is for my wife.  it&#x27;s easy to use. she can do a lot of new styles for her hair with this.</li>
    <li> Very practical in use and also easy and clear for all its properties and lightweight I loved my wife very</li>
    <li> I love this wave iron so much! It creates really nice natural looking waves quickly. I have had mine for about a year now &amp; everyone always wants to borrow it. I have naturally straight long hair &amp; when I use this the waves lasts all day &amp; look great the next morning even &amp; I don&#x27;t use any gel or hairspray on my hair. I use it on about the medium setting, its huge &amp; a little awkward to hold sometimes but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to use on your hair so its worth it. Like some of the other reviews said, you have to find something safe to set it down on since it doesn&#x27;t have a stand of its own, I actually set mine on a cookie sheet so it doesn&#x27;t burn anything. I don&#x27;t know how I ever managed without it, it creates such an awesome look.</li>
    <li> This hair tool is awesome! I can fix my hair, from start to finish, in under thirty minutes. (My hair is a few inches past shoulder length)&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this hair waver. It does the job fast, right, and with minimal damage. Love IT!</li>
    <li> A very nice product, reasonable prices and I&#x27;m a big fan of you do the marketing of the product zones, and as you can see I bought the product in large quantities&lt;br /&gt;I thank you for your cooperation</li>
    <li> Easy to use, fast heat up time.  Makes beautiful loose waves.</li>
    <li> Product is exact. Received on time.. The only things I didn&#x27;t anticipate is the Product itself is tough to use do to big size, Kinda awkward , and no stand so you can set it down on the counter between crimps, which is really needed</li>
    <li> ive never used one of these before i bought this one, but it was a great experience. It makes big waves that are beautiful and perfect for a day on the beach or any other event really :) i definitly reccommend this, it works very well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like this waver but it does take a while to get the look you want.  You have to play with the heat and how much hairspray/gel you&#x27;ll need to hold the look.  My only gripe is that you can&#x27;t set it down once it is on.  I personally have used a silicon pot holder (the ones that are extremely heat resistant) and that has solved that issue.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice new \\&quot;beach sexy\\&quot; look.    PS- I&#x27;ve seen some people write that it doesn&#x27;t curl their hair like they want, which would make sense because this contraption is meant to create a wave.  If you want a curl you&#x27;ll need a curling iron or curlers.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed. The first time I used this was ok but it was difficult to handle. The barrels are heavy which gets tiring after a while.. It didn&#x27;t produce the waves I was expecting but I also have hair that is somewhat difficult to style. I only used this product one time and when I attempted to use it a second time, I did about three strands before it completely fell apart in my hand.</li>
    <li> Even though I had a deep waver from Vidal Sassoon I ordered this one because I liked the \\&quot;curling iron barrel style\\&quot; opposed to my other one which made my hair a little kinky. This one works a tiny bit better but not much. My hair still looks kind of kinky and I wish the waves looked a little looser and more natural, but the price was outstanding if you just wanted something to switch up your straight hair every once in awhile. It is quite time consuming and awkward to use also.</li>
    <li> I love this waver... my sisters had one &amp; I had searched everywhere to find one. Finally on AMAZON.com. It gives your hair a great look without much effort!</li>
    <li> So to start...I was only able to use this product once. I thought I was in love as I was waving my hair. The waves were turning out fabulous and the waver itself was fairly easy to use. But...As I got down to my last two pieces of hair the handle and spring underneath it popped out. I was not able to complete my new look that I was so excited about. I am now waiting on my new Hot Tools deap waver to arrive, and I can&#x27;t be more excited to try it out! Sorry Revlon Perfect Heat Jumbo 3 Barrel Waver I am going to have to give you two thumbs down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...after buying another Revlon Perfect Heat Jumbo 3 Barrel Waver from Ulta I realized the first one I bought must have been a dud, because the second works great and has for over a year. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I love this waver!  Ive tried other ones and they always make my hair look crimped or kinky. This creates nice medium/large sized waves, like a beach sexy look.  You will need hairspray afterwards though.  After I use the waver, I like to spray my hair with hairspray and then use my hands and scrunch it up a little to make it kind of messy.  Anyway, this iron is awesome, I would definitely recommend it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, you cannot put it down once its on.  I have to stand it up on the black part of the barrels themselves, because thats the only part that doesnt get hot.  But I love it!  Makes your hair look cute!  Get one! :-)</li>
    <li> Love it! I have human hair extensions in my hair and it is perfect for changing up my hairstyles. While it is clunky and It&#x27;s inexpensive, it gets super hot, it creates beautiful waves ( not crimps.)   Be careful not hit the off button while you wave.  You will not get lines in your hair if you hold it properly     I havent had any problems so far. I hope we get a better model in the nearer future. But for now this&#x27;ll do</li>
    <li> After receiving item, it quit heating up after two weeks.  This is the second one I have bought for my daughter.  At least the first one worked for about 3 months.  Will never buy another!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and although I have never used it, EVERY TIME I tell her that her hair looks amazing, this is what she has used. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I do my hair with this. It is super easy, heats up fast, and has a great impact. DO IT!</li>
    <li> Had this about couple years and it works. Love it because it heats up fast and give really nice big waves:) Use this about couple times a month when I go out.</li>
    <li> So many good things to say! At first I was concerned that it would just give my hair a &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; look, and i&#x27;ve crimped my hair with much smaller crimpers and it looked horrible. So I was a skeptic, but I love the way this makes my hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of a combination of a super giant crimp and a wave, and it lasts pretty much until you shower it out. The other thing I love about it is how fast I can wave my hair. With a regular curling iron, or even a straightner, it takes me much longer because I can only do small chunks of hair at a time. With the waver it easily does much larger sections of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people saying that you can&#x27;t put it down because it doesn&#x27;t have the little piece of plastic to prop it up on the counter, but there is a way around this. I set it on my bathroom counter vertically up and down so that the tips at the end are resting on the counter while it&#x27;s open. You have to be careful with it because it is a little wobbly, but it allows you to set it down between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about how to hold it, so before I turned it on I practiced for a second to get used to it while it still cool. It was easier than I expected to use, but I&#x27;ve had to learn how to use some very complicated curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I absolutely love this waver!!</li>
    <li> So let&#x27;s just talk about how AWESOME this tool is!! I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s like getting a new hair-do but not paying tons of money for it. Before I bought this, I was reading the reviews and people were commenting on how long it was taking them, I was unsure of how long &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; was and decided to buy the tool anyway. It didn&#x27;t seem like it would take THAT long. I am writing this review to help the next person who wishes to buy this item &amp; would like to know the waver time frame. My hair reaches right above my boob and is fairly thin. I woke up at 7:09 and turned on my waver (because it does take a while to heat up), at 7:27 I started &amp;#34;waving(?)&amp;#34; my hair, at 8:37 I had completed my whole head of hair. So if you have thick hair, I would imagine it will take much longer. It is definitely worth the buy but it will not be something you use in the morning if you want to do something quick to your hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is not the right type of hair or maybe I am not using it correctly.  It is so cumbersome to use b/c its so big.  I will try again.  But first use was fustrating and lacked results.</li>
    <li> I love this iron and the wave effect it gives my hair! The big barrels give my hair a more natural wave look and because it&#x27;s so big, it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to do all my hair...and I have A LOT of hair.</li>
    <li> When I say it broke while I was using it I don&#x27;t mean it just quit working. THE WIDEST PART OF THE WAVER BROKE OFF OF IT&#x27;S BASE, EXPOSING THE WIRES! this happened DURING it&#x27;s SECOND use. I&#x27;m actually a former hair dresser so u better believe I take good care of my hairstyling tools and use them properly, I&#x27;m beyond upset at the poor quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This jumbo barrel waver has the a good set up. If you have long hair without many layers, this is a great way to add texture and volume. I haven&#x27;t had it for long, so I am unsure about any power shortages or faults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair slightly longer than my shoulders with long layers. I would not recommend this hair tool for cuts or styles much shorter than my own. The barrels are long enough that you would only get one or two clamps in and you may want a smaller barrel waver.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. The waver gives the effect of a french braid after you unbraid it, and even better.  It takes me more time to do it because I have thick hair, but its worht it. I have been using it for more than 3 years (not too often) and the waver hasn&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
    <li> Price is really good - reason why I bought this product. Had too watch a YouTube tutorial on how to use this the correct way because the first time I tried this, I did not do it right. But Once I figured it out, it went great. Got a lot of compliments on the waves it made. Awesome beach like mermaid waves. There however was constant smoke that would come out of the thing. Like turn up the heat and the smoke would not stop coming, even if it was just chilling on your table, on, untouched. Kinda freaked me out as if it was burning all my hair. Fiancé would walk in the room I was in and apparently the room was filled with smoke! The thing was only on for 10 minutes! This waver is also super chunky! Like real big it&#x27;s hard to get a hold of it! Especially if you have small hands , which I do. Tried to use it with both hands but I nearly burnt off my entire hand once I touched the top of the damn thing. It&#x27;s a trip too, because you&#x27;d think you would be able to touch the top of the waver because it looks heat proof ! - but it&#x27;s not so don&#x27;t do it. Anywho I don&#x27;t regret buying this product ! Definetly a bargain! Just make sure you use it right (there is a trick to it), &amp; open up a window if your in a closed room.</li>
    <li> When i curl my hair with a curling iron or straighten it, it never stays and always looses its touch. with this i can do my hair and the waves will still be there the next day. incredible for the price. i would defiantly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, big waves that last a good amount of time (about 2 days) on my fine but thick, curly hair. By the end of styling, however, my wrist was tired from the weight.</li>
    <li> Damaged mine and my sisters hair completely that her hair started to fall off even on low heat . And yes we used hair protectant</li>
    <li> If you have silky hair, this product it not for you! It will work great but you would not see good result on silky hair</li>
    <li> Broke after first use.</li>
    <li> i love my wavy hair .. it last for two days&lt;br /&gt;easy to use .. and quickly too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the price is very good&lt;br /&gt;i bought it once&lt;br /&gt;and i bought again ..&lt;br /&gt;and i will keep buying it as much as i need it</li>
    <li> Great product. Present for my daughter and she loves it. It works and that&#x27;s important. But, no adaptor plug given with it! Had to go buy one.</li>
    <li> It works really well but the handle will get extremely hot if you leave it on for over 10 mins. so you can&#x27;t continue to use it because it will burn your hand. I just turn it off for a couple mins and then go from there</li>
    <li> The product I was sent was defective and a fire hazard. Within 5 minutes of using it on medium heat it started to smoke and smelled strongly of melting plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the product i received was just broken or some kind of dangerous knock off. 1 star is generous considering how awful this product is but the seller did ship it quickly and it was correctly packaged.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought this item (first time from this seller), and I am mixed about it. It breaks..extremely easy. Like. for no reason. Just one day you plug it in and it doesn&#x27;t work. And not after heavy duty use, after a couple of months of not even using it more than 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this waver gives the best results of any I&#x27;ve tried. (when it works) When my first one broke, I spent more on two bed head ones, in 2 different sizes. While those are excellent waving irons, and totally worth the money, they did not give the same over all beachy waves that this one did, and this one does it with a lot less effort and in less time. I really love this waver more than any other I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried several, of varying cost and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally find it worth replacing every few months for the way it makes my hair look. Some people may not. I guess it depends on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - The one I have bought from this seller hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, so I am not commenting on this sellers item, only the waver in general.</li>
    <li> This is a little awkward to hold at first but it does make for some beautiful waves and it&#x27;s something different to do with your hair</li>
    <li> This item breaks!! It does your hair beautifully bu it is poorly made! You have to compress it to hold the hair &amp;#34;IN IT&amp;#34; which puts pressure on the clamp mechanism and causes it to break because it can withstand the constant pressure! I loved my hair when it was done with this curler but it is just made poorly! I wish they would reverse the way it opens and closes that way the only time you have to clamp it is when you are putting your hair into it and taking it out instead of having to hold it closed while your hair is being curled/waved! Only ones star because I didn&#x27;t have it that long after receiving it before it broke!</li>
    <li> The product heats up fast and creates beautiful waves but you get what you pay for. I had this item for a week and after using it several times, the stand and handle broke. It snapped right off. The ceramic is really cheap and I don&#x27;t think it can handle a lot of heat. The iron is also pretty heavy. I would recommend paying a bit more for another product.</li>
    <li> love it, kind of awkward to hold but that was expected. overall, glad i got i and great for its price.</li>
    <li> Completely met my expectations. Packaged wonderfully and worked just as expected. It is hard to find this size and quality at a store, so I was pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this! The waves are so beautiful and it takes no time. They last for days too! I have extremely blonde hair and I can&#x27;t wash it every day without it turning brassy, and when I use this waver my curls look fresh. I only have to make small touch ups on the send, third day wears. Or I throw it up into a pony and looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take some getting used to, but on the second try I had perfect waves.</li>
    <li> I love my new waver it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I just got this is and I tried it out and fail it just does my hair puffy not even wavey like the picture says</li>
    <li> Works faster than my old smaller three barrel iron, and I love how my hair looks when I use this tool, modern waves.</li>
    <li> By far the best wave iron. I look ridiculous with the smaller barrel and the smaller barrels take much longer to do all of my hair. This gives me the ultimate all natural look and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. And the price is ridiculously cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron to replace my Vidal Sassoon 3 barrel waver with high hopes of producing the mermaid-like waves i envisioned.&lt;br /&gt;This wave iron is HUGE. it is like a giant robot claw, except with heat.&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands and arthritis, so i found this tool almost impossible to use. Because of the weird clamp plate, it is difficult to get the tool close to the head to make a nice wave all the length of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be better for picking up dead mice; or smashing spiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT purchase again.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Bought this curl my daughters hair-  took for ever to heat up.  Tried it on her hair barely made a wave- and the wave it did create was frizzy.....  Took it back and didn&#x27;t bother trying another.</li>
    <li> A great deal! I had been looking for a 3 barrel waver that would give my hair bigger curls and this works amazingly well! I have medium to thick hair and this waver curls its so fast and it holds the curl really well. Yes, its kind of chunky and slightly heavy... but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister along with http://prntscr.com/3yvu09, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I live these crimps I just don&#x27;t like that you can be burned so severely</li>
    <li> Makes quite big waves in the hair, looks great. Heats up within a couple of minutes. It is big like it says in other reviews but I like that it makes three curls in one go. You can put it down right away afterwords if you either let it stand on the plastic pieces on top or if you flip the switch to close it and lay it down. It was not to heavy for me to hold.</li>
    <li> enjoy this product. I would recommend this product, it&#x27;s great deal and the price was competitive. take it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality</li>
    <li> Awesome Waver.  Lots of fun waves!  Nice change from straight locks.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone wanting to be able to change up their look.</li>
    <li> I love it. It Works wonderfully just takes me a while cause I have very thick hair. Get Tia pr</li>
    <li> I love this Waver! I do wish the handle was more rounded, as the square shape can dig in to my hand the way I hold it. But otherwise it is great, heats up fast and makes my hair less frizzy than my last one. My hair holds the wave well. This is a very large waver and I get nice waves, not little kinky one.</li>
    <li> This revlon jumbo waver makes nice hair waves. Like if you just undid a braid. The only down side I see is that it is a little to heavy. Otherwise it is nice because the 3 barrels is a time saver for you can do your hair in less time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little bigger than I want and it is little heavy side but I do love the look it gives me!&lt;br /&gt;I still need to work with it to see different hair styles but I am so excited!</li>
    <li> Since he arrived, it was not yet possible to determine whether the object works because he burned the transformer from 220V to 110V 300W power! I&#x27;m waiting for the new transformer and then ... let&#x27;s see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s OK!!!</li>
    <li> I love this item! My friend told me about it and I anted something new to do to my hair other than scrunch it or curl it and this is perfect :)</li>
    <li> this waver is amazing its the best one ive used and its stood up to time ive had it for over a year and its my fav hair styling tool</li>
    <li> I bought this product even though I was worried my hair wouldn&#x27;t be long enough for it to look right with waves in it.  The product heated up nicely and didn&#x27;t seem to get to hot to wear I might burn myself or my hair.  I wish it had something on the ends so that I could hold it with both hands while waiting for it to wave my hair.  Worked nicely, gave my hair lots of bounce and volume, hopefully will look even better when my hair grows out more.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong... this is a nice waver, but it&#x27;s a monster! It was a bit awkward at first to handle.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good waver if you like loose waves (which luckily.. I do!). I was a bit worried about it&lt;br /&gt;burning the counter when I set it down because it seems to almost sit flat on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon needs to add something to the bottom so that it doesn&#x27;t sit flat.</li>
    <li> Love it but very very heavy!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is hard to hold. You would need a heat resistant glove to hold onto it, otherwise it hurts your wrist. It makes decent curls. For the money it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was SO EXCITED to receive this item, until it broke after the second time I used it. Since I don&#x27;t style my hair very often, by the time I tried to use it again and realized it wasn&#x27;t working, I could no longer return it. Very, very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as I expected... Maybe because my hair is not long enough... I rather use the curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love this item. You can control the temperature and it waves hair perfectly. I love it and you will to.</li>
    <li> Works great when I put some curl defining product in my hair first. Easy to use. Takes up quite a bit of space.</li>
    <li> This 3 barrel roller is very big and not easy to handle, wish I paid attention to the wording on description !</li>
    <li> Tried it, it was TRASH. It did not create waves or crimps. Created a dead, limpy looking mess on my head!</li>
    <li> I have the smaller one of these, but found this one to make bigger waves. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but if it is anything like the one I have I&#x27;ll be sure to get even more compliments on my hair!</li>
    <li> i use this everyday, i love the way my hair turns out. Its also easy to use but very heavy!</li>
    <li> Looks nice. Does a good job but my wife says it&#x27;s clunky and heavy. She gave it to her sister who lives it.</li>
    <li> This product is great and was represented as it is. I would recommend it to anyone.I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work great for frizzy hair. Not enough heat on the both sides.</li>
    <li> I use it almost everyday. I have long, wavy hair already, but this makes every strand behave perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would make cute waves in my hair.  I didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too big and clunky and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the kind of waves it made.  I will just let my hair air dry and keep my natural curls/waves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked to have wavy hair.  My hair is very straight with almost no volume at all.  I used to braid it wet and sleep on it for waves.  When I got older I would use a curling iron to try to duplicate the effect.  It took hours and a LOT of hairspray.  I&#x27;ve also gotten perms before - wave perms - to create the look I wanted.  Absolutely none of those methods even comes close to comparing with the 3 Barrel Jumbo Waver.    I stumbled on a smaller waver at Walgreens and bought it.  It was neat, but gave more of a crimped effect.  Then I read online that there is a jumbo version.  So of course, I bought it on Amazon.com.  Best purchase ever!  I&#x27;ll probably never use a curling iron again.    The jumbo waver takes about 20 minutes to do my whole head (my hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders).  After, I lightly mist it with hairspray, which to be honest I only do for assurance.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem to need the help.    The waver heats up fast and takes only about 5 seconds to imprint on my hair.  Thus it only takes about 30 seconds to do each strand (5 seconds x three sections plus time to move it down each section).    Long story short - if you like that beachy wavy hair look - this is the tool for you.  Ditch anything else and buy one!</li>
    <li> Beautiful beachy large waves. this iron is bigger than I expected  but it&#x27;s easy to use after you get use to it.</li>
    <li> thnk you for you the order is very good as what I whant and it nice to use thank agen to you</li>
    <li> This hair appliance is really awesome. I did find that I had to set the heat up rather high for my hair to actually curl.  It may be because my hair is Soooooo straight.  Anyway I was able to get the look I was after.  The triangle crimpers make my hair look frizzy.  This did not.  I got big beautiful solid deep waves. I have 26inch length and the waves &amp;#34;took&amp;#34; from the root to the ends.  My husband couldn&#x27;t keep his eyes off me. I got so many compliments after using.  It is rather large and takes some practice to use...it&#x27;s much larger than my old crimper, but that&#x27;s why it works for my long thick hair. If you want the deep wave look this is it!</li>
    <li> This is great.  It allows you to wave your hair easily and makes fantastic curl thingys. haha, whatever, fantastic waves. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This iron tamed my unruly curly hair. I have &amp;#34;frilly&amp;#34; (Frizzy and Curly) hair. I blew dry my hair and then used this iron on sections of my hair to smooth the curl out. It worked great!</li>
    <li> I love this! It took me about 35 mins to do all my hair since it was my first time using it and it&#x27;s pretty heavy- but the waves have stayed in all day.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very cute. Fast delivery too. Its little heavy, but great turn out.</li>
    <li> This waver was broken straight out of the box. The cord was poorly attached to the device and the contact kept coming on and off. I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I LOVE  This iron...  MY ONLY concern, it is my second one. the handle is a bit weak for such a heavy head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what i was lookin for</li>
    <li> This iron works great! it arrived quickly and my sister in law was so excited to get it for Christmas</li>
    <li> The second time I used the Revlon Jumbo Barrel Waver the backside that connects to the handle cracked and completely broke off, now it is hanging by the electrical wiring that runs through the barrel. Save your money! Buy something that works more than once!</li>
    <li> THIS IS EASY TO USE AND IT CAME TO US FAST AND IS EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED AND MORE! SO WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS ONE</li>
    <li> Girl I got it for moved away a month after getting this.  I&#x27;m guessing that it worked well, or she would have had me exchange it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived ahead of schedule and packaged properly in a box to avoid damage during shipping. This waver works great and is a good bang for your dollar. I had read some complaints about the handle breaking. I can see it is poorly designed if someone was to clamp down hard it would break. However, knowing that I will be careful and for under $20 I&#x27;ll take the chance and replace it when/if it were to break.</li>
    <li> I found this huge and awkward to use. After a few attempts I gave up and returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have stick strait hair and this has been the only waver I have found that holds them in my hair not only thru the day, but until I wash it! The only complaint about this is that it is heavy and you cannot hold the tip to balance b/c they get hot.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND this product. I am really sorry I bought it, it was a huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried using it -- on the first strand of hair -- it broke in my hand like a cheap toy. I glued it (that only worked for a while) and even then I hated the effect: it made my hair frizzy. Has a really cheap feel. Just hated it.</li>
    <li> I had a great expectations because this was recommended by a friend, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t do that well for me. My hair holds curl fairly well, but it doesn&#x27;t hold these waves for very long. When the curl starts to go, it just looks like I have frizzy hair. Also, for whatever reason, it singes the ends of my hair no matter what heat setting its on. I have healthy hair, but I&#x27;ve ended up getting my hair cut every time I&#x27;ve used it because it kinks and burns the last 1/2 inch of my hair (even on the lower heat settings). Its also huge and hard to work with and store. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> This is the second waver I have ordered from Revlon in 3 weeks.  My daughter uses it once, twice, maybe three times and the handle just breaks right off.  This morning she had her hair half waved, and had to get a pot holder to hold the clamp shut so she could finish her hair before school.  She loves what the waver does, but this design is so poor!  The plastic is too weak for the weight of the appliance.  I thought the first one breaking was a fluke; so I re-ordered the same one......with the same results. Not again, we will try a different brand!</li>
    <li> I was actually surprised at how easy this was to use. I have long, fine hair &amp; I have a lot of it. My whole head was done in less than 15 minutes. I did my hair faster with this than with my regular curling iron. I did a lower section &amp; then a top section. It covers a lot of area at once. It heated up in under a minute. I set it at 10 out of 30. I started closest to my scalp &amp; worked down towards the ends. On the top of my head, for volume, I used it upside down.     *I saw one video online of a girl actually wrapping each strand of hair around each barrel. Do Not Attempt. That is not safe &amp; not what this is intended for. Simply move the iron down your section of hair. Hold for 10 seconds. Move down &amp; hold for 10 seconds, etc...*    This produces 1 inch S curvy waves. Not crimps. Not Z zig zaggy waves. I&#x27;ve also looked at the Hot Tools waver &amp; the Bed Head waver &amp; they look like great products, but they looked like they produced more of the Z kind of waves, which I didn&#x27;t want, so I chose this &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier. I also noticed, after only the first section, that it made my hair super shiny. Get it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> If you are considering buying this iron, please realize how HEAVY it is and that a strong adult will have to assist any teenage girl attempting to use this.  My poor daughter burnt her shoulder pretty bad as the iron does get nice and hot but weighs a ton!  You literally need two hands to hold it and after about 5 minutes, your arms will start to shake from holding it up.  It does make nice waves, but the process is a bit tedious as you can only curl one short section at a time.  I just want people to be aware that they will need assistance when using this product.</li>
    <li> I have medium long, very coarse hair. I got this tool to change up my style options. It heats quickly. I found the ergonomics cumbersome which makes the waves a bit flat in places.</li>
    <li> On days where I have 20 minutes to get ready, I use this. It is pretty huge, and my friends make fun of me when I use it, but they compliment my hair all the same. It gives the look of post-braided hair; without the frizz and un-even lines. I recommend doing your hair in layers so that you can get more waves and fuller hair; also use heat-protection because this gets HOT.   It&#x27; easy and convenient. NO problems so far at all.</li>
    <li> Junk!!! Don&#x27;t waste ur money on this thing !! Too big and extremely difficult to use!! Plus took forever to do my hair !! If u want waves, just braid hair the night before. Disappointed !! Gave 1 star for fast shipping !</li>
    <li> not very perfect curve…</li>
    <li> So the first time I used this product the result was terrible! If you already have thin naturally voluminous hair this will NOT WORK. I started out dividing my hair and did the bottom back of my head and when I got to the top I did the first section. When I released there was a wave but it was so frizzy and puffy I looked like I had a Afro. I pushed it down put some hair spray and continued. I couldn&#x27;t even finish my hair was so big I had to put a tone of hair spray and use a straightener to fix it. NOT good on my type of hair be warned!</li>
    <li> This machine gives you the nicest run-way waves. It gives me waves that I couldn&#x27;t get with my curler because my curler simply gave me ringlets. You have to be patient with it though because it works best when you pick out small strands one by one and not big chunks. The waves last ages too.</li>
    <li> I used it only once, and it broke down.  I never dropped it.  Its handle is broken!  I just use it once but I cannot use it twice!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone is talking about with these good reviews! This stupid thing is useless! It barely put any waves in my hair. In fact, it just made it look like my hair was a mess, and not in that deliberate, sexy way. I got slightly better results when I tried it on really thin sections of hair, but the results were still pretty ugly. Save your money for the salon! This tool is a waste.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my hair look!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister 2 years ago and she still like it</li>
    <li> Great product! Curls my hair quickly. It takes a little time to get used to because it is large</li>
    <li> Product is a bit big and heavy</li>
    <li> I bought this for Christmas present when my daughter opened it it is broke REALLY THIS MAKES ME SICK</li>
    <li> Was looking for a wave curler that was easy to use, this was the highest rated. It&#x27;s huge and clunky but easy to use and I like the wave it produces.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and long straight with layers my hair this waver creates beautiful waves and stays all day long.  Heatsm up fast and easy to use .  I bought the mini too for tighter waves</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just bought this product, it arrived today, what I didn&#x27;t realise is that it wouldn&#x27;t work in australian electrical plugs, and that I&#x27;ll need to buy an adapter just to use it. But I&#x27;ve been told even when I do the product might burn out or blow up in my hand. A little confused if it&#x27;s worth it or not to buy an adapter so I can use this.</li>
    <li> Hard to handle. The waves are ok. I burn my skin a few times because it&#x27;s quite big and clunky. Just not really well design.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it does make pretty waves.</li>
    <li> I love it. Heats up fast an very easy to use . Amazing!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Never buy this. LOST OF MONEY!!!! Don&#x27;t have a time to return it.</li>
    <li> it gets to hot and burnt my hair.</li>
    <li> well is obviously very big and I love the idea of ​​styling my hair with it, but not very comfortable to use, it is quite heavy and the clip is so big that my fingers do not reach very well.</li>
    <li> REALLY good for the first week, then stopped working. VERY disappointed😔</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and is easy to use. Makes beautiful waves! I bought it to replace my old one. I had my last one for almost 2 years and one day it just didn&#x27;t get as hot as it used to, this one works great!</li>
    <li> First&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your dealings good&lt;br /&gt;Secondly&lt;br /&gt;I want you to provide me with a tracking number&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;atheer suleman</li>
    <li> Love it and it has been working for yearsssssssssss</li>
    <li> I wanted a waver to control my curls not straighten my hair. I was going for a wavy tousled look. The waver made my hair straighter and it worked a little bit with gobs of curling mousse. It just wouldn&#x27;t hold the wave. I&#x27;ll try a few other curling products with then, if it doesn&#x27;t work out it is being donated.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t too many jumbo wavers out on the market - especially at this price!  This waver is perfect to make nice tousled and beachy waves.  It does NOT make your hair look crimped.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This waver worked well to make your hair look like you took it out of a braid or srunched up. It does not look natural at all. I bought it as a waver to get a vintage look and it doesnt work for that. If you try to brush and tame the waves they just get frizzy.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would give me soft waves and all if did was frizz my hair.</li>
    <li> i loved this product i bought a different brand with smaller barrels and i hated it it made my hair really frizzy and i bought it for $30.00 so i decided to try a different brand and thats when i came across this one for $15.00 i was not sure if i should buy it cuz im not a big fan of revlon but i decided to give it a try and im happy i did i love this item the 1st time i used it was for my baby shower and i got complement all day i am very happy with this purchase so i guess the saying you get what you pay for is not always true</li>
    <li> Used it once. On the last strand of hair it let out an electrical noise and smoke. Burn my hair off.  It got so hot could not use it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work I didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read enough about it before my purchase. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for years, and love it! It works great.</li>
    <li> I love love LOOOOOOVE this Jumbo Waver! I loved it so much that I bought it for my cousin to convince her to NOT perm her hair. She was extremely satisfied with the product and thanked me for talking out of perming it. We call our hair style the Shakira look lol. You gotta have this.</li>
    <li> This iron worked ONCE and that&#x27;s it. Now it won&#x27;t heat up at all, even at the highest setting. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a youtube video and the girl&#x27;s hair came out so beautiful, however i just can&#x27;t seem to get it, idk if  it&#x27;s cuz my hair is curly or what but the waves come out frizzy and burned even without leaving it the waver on hair for long. I don&#x27;t know what i am doing wrong, but maybe for others depending on your hair will be better. It&#x27;s a good product, warms fast and durable.</li>
    <li> Keeps shutting off. When I squeeze the handle to close the barrels together, the on/off switch is directly underneath it and shuts it off. Works GREAT when I can keep it on</li>
    <li> I have medium/thick long hair and this waver would only keep it&#x27;s hold for an hour before falling out (and that&#x27;s with plenty of product to help it). And since I had to use the highest setting it was difficult to keep the ends from making a bad line/crease in them. Plus it dried out my hair and made it frizzier than before using the waver. I ended up having to straighten it first and that really dried up my hair. Plus it took a long time with my thicker hair so by the time I finished the beginning pieces were already falling out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product works but just make sure you have thin/unruly hair first. I will just stick to my large barrel curling iron for waves.</li>
    <li> This is an easy curler to use - I love how it makes your hair look.  A smooth, soft curl that looks like a body wave.</li>
    <li> Hi ^^&lt;br /&gt;I try it yesterday ..&lt;br /&gt;Good to short hair like me .. Fast heat..&lt;br /&gt;I think if I&#x27;ll go to party .. I&#x27;ll have a great style $.$&lt;br /&gt;And thanks for speed delivery ^^</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it makes the hair is beautiful, and much liked my hair,And a lot of my friends asked me to ask them this product  thank Revlon</li>
    <li> soory I didn&#x27;t like it beacause the item is toooo heavy :(..it will hurt your arms when you use it.</li>
    <li> I love it. It heats up fast and when I&#x27;m on the go. Or late or work I use it. In like under 10 mins</li>
    <li> Good device for my wife. It works as her hair style.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. Use it all the time! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Very surprised with product.. Works better than my 60 dollar wave barrels!! Heats up in less than one minute and gets really hot!!  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer..</li>
    <li> Very low quality... the product is broken after 2 days and it was impossible to  fix it. I&#x27;m sure that was not bad luck because when I saw the product I realized that was very poor quality.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the product did wonders for my hair I have curly thin medium hair and the waves framed my face well</li>
    <li> The first day I received the waver I used it right away. It is heavy and took a while to do my hair... but I have SUPER thick hair! End result I loved! I did not use it again for 3 days. I had purchased it to take on a cruise thinking this would be easier than curling my hair. Well three days later, the morning I was leaving for my cruise I got up to do my hair. As soon as I clamped it down on my first section on hair the handle broke where it goes in at and the spring flew out! I am in the process of returning this item. Not worrying with purchasing another. I give it three stars because it did do a great job the first time but apparently is made of crappy material and not a reliable product.</li>
    <li> i wish i could give this more than 5 stars. it is easy, simple and makes my hair super cute! my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well but this is perfect. i dont know how i lived without it. i would recommend it to everyone. its amazing</li>
    <li> Gives you beautiful perfect waves. If you want your hair to look like you just rode a white horse across a beach to meet up with your prince, this gives you that hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these but they&#x27;re so expensive in stores! I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what I was buying since I was buying this online and had no clue how these work! I got the hang of it quickly and I love the way it makes my hair look! I have log hair so it takes about hair an hour to do all of my hair but it stays all day and even until the next day! I think they look even better as the day goes on as well! I totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> WORKED 2 TIMES THAN JUST STOPPED WORKING</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had about four of these waivers and I love the way it makes my hair look, BUT it does not last very long. I am on my fourth one and I just received it yesterday and I turned it on this morning to get ready for work and it only waved half of my hair before it cooled down and turned off on its own. When I pushed on the handle to clamp the curling iron, it makes a clicking sound which I know is not good since I&#x27;ve had so many and none of them made that sound until they were about to break completely off. It is really unfortunate that this product is so cheaply made because I really do love it, I have bought so many. I wish they could just make one that would work for awhile but apparently that&#x27;s not the case so I have to find another brand. :(</li>
    <li> Works just like I thought it would. Gives nice beach waves without damaging hair, and doesn&#x27;t take a long time to style</li>
    <li> Natural waves, just what I wanted it for</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this! It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair!</li>
    <li> This curler is way to heavy and awkward to use very much. I bought one for my daughter and wished I had used mine first. This would be ok if you were a football player or someone with big muscles.Haha. Also takes forever for it to actually curl the hair. Don&#x27;t like this and overpriced.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all, makes creases in your hair and doesn&#x27;t achieve the beach wave look. I&#x27;ve retried using it multiple times, I always end up hating it.</li>
    <li> It was very much larger than the pic. It looks standard size on the pic, but when we received it. It was too big!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about the waves and this is just perfect. It&#x27;s huge. Really huge. But it makes beautiful waves that don&#x27;t fall out. It&#x27;s far better than I expected for the price. I have very long and thick hair and have no issues after almost a year of using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite a nice hairstyle to try once and awhile. But for me, I would love to use this 5 out of 7 days of the week. I love the waves it gives the hair. It is quite a large object, and sometimes difficult to hold, but it does give you a benefit of the doubt allowing you to &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; large sections at a time. It also needs some practicing finding where to continue &amp;#34;waving&amp;#34; down the hair. (I mean that the section of hair you have, the first spot you &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34;, you then move down to the last &amp;#34;indent&amp;#34;. Confusing, but just watch some YouTube videos and you&#x27;ll understand!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I have always used a straightener to put spiral curls in my hair, but I wanted something that would enhance the natural waves in my hair. Because my hair is weird, there are some sections that are stick straight and some wavy. This waver helps to make my waves more uniform and best of all, give volume to my hair! The top section of my hair is straight, so it lies flat. The jumbo waves give it a little boost. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this waver is that it&#x27;s humungous! Sometimes it feels like I&#x27;m using a waffle maker on my hair, but that&#x27;s just one con among many pros. If you have small hands like I do, be sure to use this product with both hands! The end-result is worth the 10-minute work out you&#x27;ll get from holding this lugger up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can blame this tool 100% or if it&#x27;s partially my hair but it just takes to darn long to get the look you&#x27;d expect from this waver. I&#x27;m just generally unimpressed by how it crimps the hair and how long it takes. I have very naturally straight, medium length hair and this tool takes about 20-30 minutes to do my whole head. I&#x27;ve tried both hair moussed/unmoussed and washed/unwashed and I&#x27;m not impressed with the results especially when the 90% of the body/wave is lost within the first hour of my hair being crimped. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair, maybe its the tool. Maybe I&#x27;ll just not use it and let it collect dust in my closet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this hair ceramic its so easy to use it save time for me even with my new (boy) hair style cut.. So many ppl ordered it too</li>
    <li> Works perfectly but is huge a bulky. Hard to use. If you have hair shorter than shoulder length don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but very intimidating in size. The waves don&#x27;t hold very long unless you cake on hair spray, but it looks fantastic and beautiful. A great alternative hairstyle compared to waving/curling with a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
    <li> This Is A Very Good Hair Product ! It Works So Good And It Gets So Hot ! I&#x27;m Glad I Bought It .. Best I&#x27;ve Bought In A While !</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this thing, it was big enough so I could do big sections of my hair quickly. I&#x27;ve got really thick and long hair so it was perfect...until after a few uses the back literally melted and snapped off, hanging by the wires inside... The heat setting wasn&#x27;t set halfway either.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair appliance. I love the mermaid waves it makes.</li>
    <li> this thing gives you beautiful waves in less than 10 minutes on long hair. very handy</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as portrayed in advertising. I don&#x27;t think it gets hot enough to be effective.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!! I have a smaller version of this and hated how &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; it looked.  I wanted something a little more adult and professional and this was just the ticket!  Creates looser waves that look like I braided my head up over night.</li>
    <li> i will buy another  . and this product is very good .  thanks for  all  . i will buy again</li>
    <li> I love it! I think anyone giving this any less stars dont know how it works. You dont need a gloove. Makes your hair look very nice and sexy. I sure needed a change. For the price, its more then expected.</li>
    <li> used this first when my sister had one and had to purchase one myself. I couldnt live without this, great product makes beautiful large waves!!!</li>
    <li> I ask does it work on European power and it was cleared that it does. But there is not way to work in Europe. Otherwise I am sure that is ok .</li>
    <li> Love this waver! Heavier than I was expecting, definitely heavy duty, but every time I use it I get perfect waves. In love with this tool! Ladies, you won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
    <li> I always get tons of compliments on my hair when I use this to style it.  You should know 3 things before making this purchase. 1) This device is heavy and you have to press down pretty hard to really get a result.. Your arms get tired after a while. 2) You have to use thin layers of hair one at a time and spray them with hairspray first or it will not work. I am glad one of the reviews I read said that so I knew what to do when I bought it. It&#x27;s true. 3) If you have long hair, thick hair, or a combination of both like me...this takes a long time. I have to start at one end and &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; my hair about 3-4 times total to make it down the length of my hair. Multiply that by all the sections of hair, and it is time consuming. It takes some getting used to with which direction to use the iron so that the roots and tips of your hair lay the way you want them too. Needless to say I only use this on special occasions when I am getting dolled up to go out or something.</li>
    <li> This thing is gigantic and kind of looks like some kind of torture device. Once you get the hang of it you can create some pretty natural looking &#x27;beach waves&#x27; though. It gets the job done. I have very very thick hair and it is usually pretty hard to get a curl to hold in it without some extreme heat. This waver works because it can get very hot. Usually about halfway through it starts to cool down and get a little less effective, but I just close it back up and let it reheat for a few minutes and keep on going.</li>
    <li> This tool may be a bit awkward to work with because it&#x27;s so big. But once you get used to it it&#x27;s amazing! I have very big curly hair and this gives me the perfect beachy wave that I&#x27;ve been looking for. GET IT!</li>
    <li> my name is Kate..disappointed. i waste my money.. it is not hot and it is not fixing my hair.. nobody buy this one.. only you waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters and have different types of hair.  One has very thick hair and the other has very thin and fine hair.  It works great on both of theirs and it holds through a long school day.  I would highly recommend it.  It is a good quality for the $.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to use on my nieces hair. I literally used it three times and went to heat it up to do her hair one morning , and it just stopped working. It would not heat up, power on.... nothing!</li>
    <li> This app glitched me off all the time. I dont care for it so I deleted it and now I have to leave so many of a word review.. lame</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and big so you can wave plenty of hair at a time. It&#x27;s a quick way to change up your hair. I love mine. :)</li>
    <li> perfect i highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;its really heavy , its better if there is someone helping you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the curls are amazing</li>
    <li> Works fabulously and makes my already wavy hair looky beachy cool and super pretty:) Lots of compliments and waves that last the entire day and on into any evening shenanigans!! Highly recommended:)</li>
    <li> Oh, words cannot describe how much I love this purchase! I get compliments all the time and it does not resemble the 90&#x27;s &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; like, like I feared. Very easy to use, eliminates frizz and you even look great when you wake up.</li>
    <li> I love this!! It came in like 3 days! It heats up so fast and gives me the perfect beach/mermaid waves I&#x27;ve been dying to always have!! The only negative is that it cools down slowly(not a real big deal) so I always have to watch were I lay it once I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair toy! Works awesome and doesn&#x27;t damage hair!</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love it. Works great, heats up quickly, perfect size</li>
    <li> Broken since the firast use</li>
    <li> I love my crimper and my boyfriend loves my hair after I use it to do my hair. :) I&#x27;ve burnt myself with it a couple times but I think once I get more used to using it will work great and not burn</li>
    <li> update: I just tried giving this a 2nd try and the handle snapped off right in my hand... and the time frame to return has passed. I wish I could attached a photo..&lt;br /&gt;thanks for taking my money, Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;original review:&lt;br /&gt;If you want your hair to look like you just took it out of braids, you&#x27;ll love this. I was looking for S curls.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! Cheaply manufactured and doesn&#x27;t curl whatsoever! I am so frustrated that I opened it and can&#x27;t return it. It will sit in my bathroom collecting dust.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Didn&#x27;t take long to get the hang of it at all. My hair is difficult.. it doesn&#x27;t like to hold curl but when I woke up the next day I still had the fabulous wave going on.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful! I love it. :-)</li>
    <li> Not meet my expectation&lt;br /&gt;Not static wave&lt;br /&gt;And weak wavness&lt;br /&gt;Not so clear on hair&lt;br /&gt;More very large and heavy</li>
    <li> Too hwavey.would not suggest.</li>
    <li> This item works fine.</li>
    <li> This waver works really well; just make sure to use strong hairspray or gel on your hair before using to get the maximum waves. The only drawback to this iron is that it doesn&#x27;t set down correctly when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
    <li> I love this 3 barrel curling iron! I read all the reviews before purchasing on off of amazon and this is the one that seemed to be the best shot... and it was. I love it because it was pretty cheap, and actually works great, isn&#x27;t a cheapo appliance that only works on thin hair. I have long, somewhat thick hair that is naturally sort of wavy but not pretty enough to leave natural. This waver is great to use to get that look for those of us who aren&#x27;t blessed enough to have great hair &#x3D;) definitley get this one!</li>
    <li> I love it! Great service too!</li>
    <li> good wave maker. This does take a little while to heat up it is not as fast as a paul mitchell straitner but its also not the price of a paul mitchell straitner. basically you get what you pay for. works great in bigger sections of hair i find. plus gets done faster. I hold in place on the barrel for about 15-20 seconds depending on hair type at high heat and then spray hair spray when done and most days holds up very well. makes very pretty waves love the product overall.</li>
    <li> Well i havent tried this but i have two revlon curlers &amp; they are auper great ! I would recomend this(:</li>
    <li> My crimper BROKE!!  Doesn&#x27;t get a great wave and gets really hot and almost burned myself.  Yes there are controls to set the heat but it broke just as I had started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. YES IT MAKE TAKE A FEW EXTRA COUPLE MINUTES IN THE MORNING TO DO BUT THE RESULTS ARE WELL WORTH IT. THIS MACHINE GIVES YOU THE BEACH WAVE CURL YOUVE BEEN TRYING TO ACHIEVE SINCE WATCHING THE VICTORIAS SECRET MODELS PRANCE DOWN THE RUNWAY. THIS MACHINE WILL MAKE YOU AMZINGLY HAPPY. MARK MY WORDS!</li>
    <li> I rather pin curl my hair/extensions the old fashion way to get waves , takes extremely long to heat up, leaves hair smelling funny and very time consuming in order to achieve wave u need to use small portions of hair. When they say jumbo they meant it is extremely largeeee  and a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Burned my hair and stopped working after 1 day very disappointed.  I really wanted it to work. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> This iron is great for beautiful, wavy curls. It&#x27;s so handy. It&#x27;s light in weight and powerful in heat. Love!</li>
    <li> it is ok, only wish it did my hair faster, it takes a a lot of time, i guess it is not hot enough or something, i suggest if you are going out, at least put a side two hours or an hour and half to get those perfect waves.</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> My girls&#x27; hair looks amazing!  We love how easy it is to use this product.  It does take some time to do a full head of hair, but the result is wonderful!</li>
    <li> always get great compliments on my hair when using this waver.  it&#x27;s so simple and quick to use and heats up within seconds</li>
    <li> the barrel waver is heavy and hard to use; the effect does not stay on and is not really what I exected it to be in terms of size of the waves.</li>
    <li> This waver is much bigger then I thought it would be. It is heavy and hard to do my hair with.</li>
    <li> I just tried this &amp; it does exactly what I wanted it to do! the trick is to use smaller sections like half an inch at a time.</li>
    <li> As a licensed cosmetologist, I must say this is my favorite tool! It is sturdy! I have gone through three over the past seven years, by my own fault. I put mine through quite a beating and each one has lasted me at least two years. It creates beautiful movement in the hair and is my life-saving go-to tool. I can&#x27;t live without it. I just broke my third one the other day and I&#x27;m lost without it! I ordered this again yesterday so hopefully it comes soon! My hair misses it!</li>
    <li> I was shocked and i feel disappointed! because the Waver arrived damaged and my first time when i used  It&#x27;s the wire was a move then it&#x27;s Turns off Waver when i move it again right and left Turns On ??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then it&#x27;s Smoke comes out of it i think it&#x27;s because the Heat and it&#x27;s normal thing then i heard Electric spark and smell of smoke then i think it&#x27;s normal Because it&#x27;s new !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;are this original Waver  .i read about it and many people like it ? I&#x27;m Surprised May cause harm for me ? also very sad what i do :(</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got this product that I decided to immediately use it on my hair. My excitement soon turned to frustration. The barrels never got hot enough.. I was able to touch the barrel with my hand without burning myself. Needless to say no \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; looking waves were left impressioned in my hair. (And I have fine stright hair.. the easiest to manipulate)The design of the product is quite horrible. It is heavy and the square-shaped handle make it very uncomfortable to use. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> BEST WAVER EVERRRR !! EVEN BETTER THAN A FREAKING CURLING IRON!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Despite the package description there is no stand on this appliance, nor is one included as a separate piece.  It is large and bulky, but for the most part -- it works.</li>
    <li> This waver works well, but it is very large. It is a little awkward handling it. I do not suggest this waver if your hair is short/medium length because of its size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this waver over a year ago from Ulta.  I had never used a waver before and didn&#x27;t know if I would like the style, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, and the price was very attractive.  It died this morning, and I&#x27;m not sorry. It was just OK. For a year of infrequent use, I feel like I got my money out of it, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really loved the style and I got tons of compliments on my pretty S-waves. My hair is thick and medium coarse and can be hard to curl.  I think this was really why I had a problem with the waver.  It did heat quickly as advertised, but it did a poor job of retaining that heat.  As I worked through sections of hair, it would keep getting cooler and cooler until it wouldn&#x27;t wave anymore.  I figured out the best thing to do was to do a couple sections, then put it down and walk away and let it heat back up.  This drastically extended the time it took to do my hair, usually 45 min to an hour.  Also you can&#x27;t just put it down since the hot plates will sit directly on your table, so I used a heat-resistant travel case to set it on.  I also found that the pressure you use to clamp it down was a big factor.  If you just held it normally, it didn&#x27;t wave as well.  If I really pushed down hard on the handles, and thus put more pressure on the hair, it worked better.  This is what led to the waver&#x27;s demise this morning.  I was halfway through my hair and really pushing hard on the handle when it broke apart.  This is my own fault, but if it had done a better job of holding heat, I wouldn&#x27;t have needed so much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also extremely heavy.  Your arms will get tired.  Just holding it in the store it may not seem heavy, but holding it over your head for minutes at a time really takes a toll.  It&#x27;s also unbalanced, which I think is the bigger issue.  All the weight is on the plates and there&#x27;s very little at the handle, so it wants to fall down, hot side first, onto your head if you don&#x27;t maintain a really good grip at all times.  It is wide and clunky and hard to maneuver around your head.  I&#x27;ve given myself some pretty good whacks with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, my hair did look great!  But I will be spending a little more money and getting a better quality waver to replace this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;- Works adequately&lt;br /&gt;- I got lots of compliments on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;- The temperature dial and indicator light are great&lt;br /&gt;- Stayed clean after a year of use, no buildup or gunk on the plates&lt;br /&gt;- The locking clip is nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Very heavy and unbalanced&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t retain heat well&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t put it down without a protective pad&lt;br /&gt;- Takes forever to wave all my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  it&#x27;s an OK waver and may be a good buy if you&#x27;re unsure if you&#x27;ll like the style or you won&#x27;t use it often.  It would work better on thin, fine hair.  If you have thick or coarse hair, keep shopping.</li>
    <li> روعه شويه عليه&lt;br /&gt;مررره نايس انصح فيه يستاهل وبعدي موب غالي&lt;br /&gt;والبياع مررره شاطر 3 ايام وواصله لرياض ماشاء الله عليه يستاه 10 نجمات هو والجهاز</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY SECOND REVLON PRODUCT AND I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND IT FOR MAKING YOUR HAIR RETRO STYLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET YOUR ONE</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t heat up hot enough. Barely makes wave, then they go away as soon as you step outside. It&#x27;s definitely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> it does not heat enough .. so waves do not stay for an hour , it only leaves the hair with fuzzy volume as if not styled .. my hair is originally thin and fuzzy</li>
    <li> Heats up extremely quickly, very quick to use and easy as all you have to do is clamp down on the hair, there is no fafing</li>
    <li> in 21 years of marriage, I&#x27;ve never seen my wife as happy with her hair as this product has made her.  This baby turns dull, straight  hair into a wavy mane in just minutes.  With a price of just over $15, I wish I had bought one 20 years ago!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Not really suitable for short hair, it is too heavy to handle, extremely easy to burn yourself; but pretty decent for price, and for long hair.</li>
    <li> I got it within the time they said daughter asked for it that is why I ordered it for her b-day she is  17 so she is deff old enough for it she said it takes longer to do then when she uses her straightner,and you can&#x27;t use alot of hair at one time if so it will not look very wavie at all she said she will still keep trying to use it when she can will keep everyone up dated on it.</li>
    <li> this makes really nice ice cubes and the price was right, not sure why you need more than that !~!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and was hoping for waves. I got an 80&#x27;s crimp look. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift and the girl i bought it for loves it she uses it all the time and it makes her hair wave bueatifully</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was so big. Too heavy to use.</li>
    <li> I owned this for several years. It works GREAT, especially when you have thick hair. It gives you defined waves. However, when you have long, thick hair, it does take a very long time to get all your hair waved. The worst thing about this was the fact that, since it is jumbo, it is very heavy! My hand and arm would get so tired, and my hand would actually feel weak by the time I finished. I never used it too often because it took so long, but when I used it, I always got a lot of compliments! :) One day when I was using it earlier this year, the handle that you push up and down to clamp with just completely snapped off, so I only had one half of my hair finished lol. Just keep in mind when you order this that is is very big and heavy, but you will get beautiful results!</li>
    <li> excellent product recommend</li>
    <li> So I had this set to high knowing my thick hair is relentless on low heat. Remind you this is my first use of the product. Got about half way through my hair and the handle busted off hitting my exposed arm and burning it severely. Very dangerous and poorly manufactured especially something that gets up to 300+ degrees.</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times on my daughters hair and it is big, bulky and heavy, I read that in the reviews but decided to get it anyway. Also, if you don&#x27;t hold it just right it curls weird. I can&#x27;t explain what it does but in the back of my daughter&#x27;s hair it&#x27;s get kind of kinked. I couldn&#x27;t imagine trying to do my own hair!</li>
    <li> It seemed to be heavy at first, but after I got used to it...loved it. It heats fast and hair looks awesome in 30 min.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use! I have thin hair so it only takes me about 5 minutes but I get lots of compliments everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> Love how this iron has the back to it. Makes the most beautiful waves in any length of hair. Always get compliments on mine and my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this waver. I am always look for ways to get that beachy, wavy hair, however this waver didn&#x27;t really do that. It did wave my hair, however it left my hair kinda frizzy and really poofy. I have asian hair that is about medium thickness. I like more subtle and uneven waves, which is why this product wasn&#x27;t good for me. I have watched other reviews about this product, and it seems to work for a lot of people. I just did not like how the waves looked too perfect and even. If you are looking for really big wavy hair this product is for you, but if you want that unruly beachy wave.. this may not be the right product.</li>
    <li> My New to teens daughter and I fight over this. It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, and makes my bad hair days amazing in just a few minutes. I really like how smooth my hair looks and how playful the waves are. It&#x27;s great for stubborn to curl hair like mine. And its great for my daughters super thick hair too. The waves last for days!</li>
    <li> First off, I will say that my hair looks GREAT after I use this. I get compliments every time I style my hair with this. Secondly, the appliance itself is also HUGE. This serves the purpose of making bigger waves that don&#x27;t look like crimps. If you have tiny hands or weak arms or both (or tiny arms or weak hands or both), this is going to be very difficult for you to use on your own hair. Seriously, the reviews here are correct: works great and is also huge. It gets an even heat and gets hot enough to help my hair keep its shape. Usually when I use this I shower at night and style my hair with this and then sleep on it so it looks more natural in the morning. I really like this appliance.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CRIMPER! Finally found the kind I&#x27;ve been looking for, waves last until washed and its so affordable! Perfect beach waves!</li>
    <li> I love this device!  I get many compliments every time I style my hair with this!  THE ONLY flaw is the screw/clasp/mechanism that allows the handle to squeeze and release has broken on TWO of my devices now.</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Speed ​​the arrival of of the product did not expect to get it in record time after the payment and good results</li>
    <li> Got to me super fast.! packaging was awesome.! Product AMAZING! &lt;3 &lt;3 IT WAS NEW . AND ALSO PACKAGING CAME IN BOX. ! SO NO DAMAGE.! (:</li>
    <li> Great product and creates the loose 1920&#x27;s curl I want. I would recommend turning the curlers on for a while before use....Just be careful not to burn your ears :(</li>
    <li> Loving  Doing My  Own  Hair</li>
    <li> Luscious curls everywhere! Heats up quickly and evenly and is super easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d probably give this a five if it was so freaking big and fairly complicated to use.  But the look is great if you have the time and patients to use it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for long hair</li>
    <li> Thank you it was very excellent ممتاز جدا</li>
    <li> I bought This nd it does not work good do not buy it it takes a very long time to heat up</li>
    <li> i but it for me sister it is good and she is love it :) i find it here but is expensive of this . . .</li>
    <li> Revlon knows hair, I don&#x27;t but got this for my wife as (big) stocking stuffer. Works great and her hair holds the waves quite well. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Its much bigger than the pic. Great for long hair and you can adjust heat.  It was worth it.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be about average in terms of its ability. it does have alot of heat settings but i found the dial moved when i didnt even touch it, just a flimsy nob. I found the product to be too big in size so it was pretty hard to style the hair by yourself. It gives you a basic crimped look which is good if thats what you like, I was just expecting bigger waves. On a positive note it is super quick my whole head of hair took me about 15 minutes. It gives good volume.</li>
    <li> كتجربه اولى لم يحصل شي لشعري مجرد لفه بسيطه ، قد يكون استخدامي غير صحيح او نوع شعري يحتاج اقوى حراره</li>
    <li> I love it . Its perfect</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve purchased this product &amp; it still works great! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do &amp; it works very quickly. I hold it on to my hair for at least 5-7 seconds &amp; is able to heat through a lot of hair</li>
    <li> It broke after 3 uses. Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> absolutely love what this does to my hair! I highly recommend if you have volume less hair like mine. gives it lots of volume and beautiful waves in my hair. easy to use also</li>
    <li> I got 3, 1 of them was broken after a month, 2 after a year or more.. but diffidently would like to order it again&lt;br /&gt;one of the best wavers and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
    <li> This is great for waving hair and I do love it. My hair is pin straight and long so it&#x27;s a great way to change up my hair in under 25 mins. But the tool is very hard to use. It&#x27;s huge and heavy. Also the whole entire silver part gets extremly hot so you can easily burn yourself. It&#x27;s hard to wave your roots because it&#x27;s to hot to put close enough to your head. Also my handle has not broken yet but does not feel durable and I can tell with enough usages it will break at some point. Overall since the product is only $16 I do recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my long straight hair that I never know what to do with. My go-to is usually the 1-inch curling iron, but this tool has been great - once I got the hang of it. Others are saying it&#x27;s bulky, and yes, it&#x27;s bulky. But as far as it being heavy? My arms didn&#x27;t tire at all, especially since it takes like 10 minutes to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast. I put it on the 5-10 setting and have found that using larger sections (like 4 on each side) makes for looser, bigger waves that look more natural. I agree with other reviewers that it can make hair look a little too \\&quot;crimped\\&quot; if you do small sections and hold for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this with or without styling products. Style still holds. Be careful you don&#x27;t burn your neck, however, as I did the first time. One tip: work from the bottom of the hair up, leaving a few inches of hair at the ends \\&quot;un-waved\\&quot; if you want to avoid the ends looking too crimpy and create a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waves turn out nice, but I do wish the barrels were just a tad bigger for slightly more loose and natural waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great tool I&#x27;ve been finding myself picking up on those days I just want to go with a messy look - working with it instead of against a bad hair day.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality , when I plugged it on my first use I heard voices of electricity and smoke came out of it !!</li>
    <li> I love it and what it does to my hair, the only downsides is that when it&#x27;s on it smells like burning plastic, but other than that it makes my hair look pretty and wavy.</li>
    <li> Upon opening i noticed that the item was broken the right barrel was moving around alot</li>
    <li> No matter what temp I used, this device did nothing to my hair.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this jumbo waver.  I&#x27;m very happy with the waves I get with this tool.  Before purchasing, I watched several YouTube videos on how to use it, and they had a lot of great tips.  Working in small sections seems to work best for me and I like to divide the hair into several layers to get more volume, as well.  The trickiest part is definitely the top of the head because, if you don&#x27;t get close enough to the scalp and angle it just right, you can end up with the awful crease so many have mentioned.  I find that starting the waves at the top with the back plate facing outward and then continuing the waves with the tool facing the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; way (barrels facing outward) helps avoid the crease.  Just some of my tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Creates nice waves that last all day (and then some, in my case).&lt;br /&gt;- Latch keeps the barrels closed when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable temperature dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Very large and heavy (and thus, a bit awkward and tiring to use).&lt;br /&gt;- No stand to keep the tool from resting directly on the countertop or other surface.&lt;br /&gt;- The lever used to clamp down on the hair feels quite fragile (cheap plastic), so avoid clamping down too hard.</li>
    <li> It is the best it&#x27;s hard to use at the beginning cuz u have to get use to how big it is but I love it</li>
    <li> After I used it once it stopped working I&#x27;m very disappointed because the first time I used it I loved it!</li>
    <li> Daughter had used one at a friends house and bought this because she loved how it worked.</li>
    <li> Love love love this waver! Seriously the cheapest hair iron I own and the one I use the most. The waves last me three days. I would recommend this to everyone who wants waves!</li>
    <li> Its takes forever to get the perfect aves and the waves don&#x27;t come out as good and also, its heavy to hold because it takes five minutes to do the waves on your hair just only a section of your hair, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair looks after using this waving iron</li>
    <li> This 3 barrel jumbo ceramic waver broke after only 20 uses. The plastic parts fell apart. I was hoping to get it replaced or get my money back to invest in a better one, but apparently you don&#x27;t have a policy regarding product failure.</li>
    <li> I bought the Jumbo Waver yesterday.  It never heated up even once.  Exchanged it today and the new one doesn&#x27;t heat up.  Right out of the packaging.  Now, I&#x27;ll have to go back to the store and return it.  I thought Revlon was a good company.  What has happened to their quality control?</li>
    <li> I saw a video on Youtube recently and decided to give this product a try but I bought it at a local drug store. Well, it heats up faily quickly, and gives u very curly waves. if u want soft waves, leave it on for 3 seconds or so, if you leave it on for too long, it gets too wavy and looks unnatural. personally, i really like the waves, but my BF is not really feeling it. oh well, as long as it makes me happy :)</li>
    <li> I love this iron it noes even fine or super straight hair wavey the price Is so worth it every girl should have one</li>
    <li> nice waver revlon. new and make really good wave &#x3D;) its not expensif for the qualities of the stuff .</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, straight hair that gets oily annoyingly fast.  I have been using the waver on the highest setting and it gives me textured beachy, mild waves. It sort of gives me the look of having had my hair in small braids but without the wait and more control on how it looks.  My hair is heavy and healthy/silky so it doesn&#x27;t really curl well, but this gives it nice texture.  I hope it is durable.  I really just use it on the top layer of my hair and it blends nicely.  I&#x27;m far too lazy to do all of my hair.  Is really easy to use!</li>
    <li> Works really well and really doesn&#x27;t take that long and I have long thick hair.  The hardest part is my hand getting tired when gripping it shut, I feel like I really have to hold tight in order for the wave to take.  Looks really nice and the waves hold, even after I slept on it!</li>
    <li> This is actually the third one im buying...the last two broke. Both times i was in the middle of curling my hair and i must have been pressing down too hard bc it just snapped literally broke into pieces. Springs and bits everywhere! I do like the way my hair comes out, and its so super easy to use! Way better then an actual curlying iron. I wanted this for a more of a crimp look and i would say it gives you between a crimp and a curl. if you really want to invest get a curling wand. Those are a godsend!</li>
    <li> This waver is to heavy, and the style won&#x27;t stay for very long. I have to use so much hairspray and even then it goes flat in just a few hours. It also takes a while. It is an ok product, but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Overall a cool product, the only drawback is its too imposing size.</li>
    <li> Just recieved it ,eork good ,hope to enjoy it for a long time 👍</li>
