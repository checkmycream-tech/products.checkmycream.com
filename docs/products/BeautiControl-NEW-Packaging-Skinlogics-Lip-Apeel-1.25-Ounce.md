      <li>Just because something is an older product on the market, doesn&#x27;t mean it still couldn&#x27;t be great or even the best.</li>

      <li>so I based on such great reviews I decided to buy this</li>
      <li>Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...works very well.</li>
      <li>3 stars because it works decently but was expecting it to work better for the price.</li>
      <li>Great for dark lips.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my new favorite lip balm</li>
      <li>and I am really glad it is now available over the net</li>
      <li>I am Hispanic and my lips are naturally darker than most.  </li>
      <li>but I find putting a thick layer on is more effective.</li>
      <li>has really helped me very much.it keeps my lips nice and moist and free of dry skin.</li>
      <li>It works fabulously and obviously nothing is aggravating my allergy which is great because my lips would swell ( not in a good way) and sting like crazy.</li>
      <li>but it is exactly as pictured and what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>so I am willing to pay the higher price for it.</li>
      <li>This product really does it&#x27;s job!</li>
      <li>lips still get very flaky but when I use this often it solves the issue right away.</li>
      <li>and they all seemed pretty positive</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider my lips to be incredibly dry, but a beauty guru on youtube said something about exfoliating lips for better lipstick application</li>
      <li>I works really well on my dry lips, I love the smell also</li>
      <li>This product really completed my expectations.</li>
      <li>My husband absolutely loves this lip treatment I ordered this just for him. ...</li>
      <li>The chap stick works very well for me</li>
      <li>and I really like it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating, smoothing and shiny</li>
      <li>and it really clears the chapped lips.  </li>
      <li>When I combine the lip balm with a coat of eos lip balm it makes my lips much</li>
      <li>Upon using this for the first time I had lighter lips and left them soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised on how fast I got it!</li>
      <li>only gave Lip Apeel 4 stars because the packaging makes it look like there is much more in the container than there actually is~</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I usually never write reviews.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few days I used the peel once a day - it&#x27;s very easy, only takes a couple of minutes - and then used the balm afterwards.</li>
      <li>I do not use dark lipstick colors on a regular basis, mostly tinted lip glosses.  </li>
      <li>It cleans up my lips and makes them soft.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t completely satisfy me..</li>
      <li>I use vanilla buttercream Soft Candy lip scrub by Treat before I use the Lip Apeel~</li>
      <li>Its worth the price even though I wild like it to be half of what it costs.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe I spent 20 dollars on something that has done absolutely nothing for me!</li>
      <li>My lips got really dry and flaky after giving birth to my son no matter how much chapstick I put on or how often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I even put Neosporin on my lips, but they still peeled constantly and I was very self-conscious about it in public.</li>
      <li>Can barely notice my lines.</li>
      <li>Yes it gets rid of some dead sking and your lips feel softer BUT even right after I remove it from my lips</li>
      <li>I think the key to success is everyday use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Last year I developed an allergy to lip balm and after trying multiple ones I decided to go back and try lip apeel again.</li>
      <li>It does make my lips so soft and gets rid of the dry skin on the surface.  </li>

<li> It does make my lips so soft and gets rid of the dry skin on the surface.  </li>
<li> Let me begin by saying I have seriously dry lips that are constantly peeling</li>
<li> I have had dry, peeling lips for several months and no lip balm or gloss would cure it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other lip scrubs, and come back to this one.</li>
<li> After one use I can now conclude that my lips must have been incredibly dry.  </li>
<li> This has been my go to product for dry lips.  </li>
<li> after a month of using it 4 times a week still no results whatsoever, my lips are still dry, peeling off.</li>
<li> When your upper lip is darker than bottom, this will gradually peel the dead skin making your upper lip</li>
<li> I used it religiously some years ago but had moved away to other products in the last few years.</li>
<li> I have very dry lips that peel and using the product</li>
<li> Have only used this for a few weeks.</li>
<li> I would like my money back folks! :/</li>
<li> Now I use the peel every few days and using the balm afterwards and whenever my lips feel dry.</li>
<li> it was before it went dark.</li>
<li> - doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll run out for a few months.</li>
<li> you can see a lot of dead skin still hanging on my lips..</li>
<li> Works for peeling dead skin off your lips.</li>
<li> It was a little late in arriving</li>
<li> Another scam product from this line , expensive and leave your lips like dry sand after the scrub.</li>
<li> Sometimes I feel like it makes it worse though.  </li>
<li> instructions say to apply a thin layer of the line peel</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>

    <li> Great for dark lips.  I am Hispanic and my lips are naturally darker than most.  Upon using this for the first time I had lighter lips and left them soft and smooth.  I do not use dark lipstick colors on a regular basis, mostly tinted lip glosses.  However, I know that any lip color can accumulate on the lips and require exfoliation.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this lip treatment I ordered this just for him. ...make his lips really smooth..:-)</li>
    <li> It was a little late in arriving but it is exactly as pictured and what I ordered.  Pleased</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I am really glad it is now available over the net</li>
    <li> This product really completed my expectations.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing that solved my chapped lips.  I have tried every over the counter lip balm and this is the only one that works!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can put this on at bedtime and my lips are still quite moisturized when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Works for peeling dead skin off your lips. When your upper lip is darker than bottom, this will gradually peel the dead skin making your upper lip the color it was before it went dark.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how many great reviews there are for this product.. Let me begin by saying I have seriously dry lips that are constantly peeling so I based on such great reviews I decided to buy this but it doesn&#x27;t completely satisfy me.. Yes it gets rid of some dead sking and your lips feel softer BUT even right after I remove it from my lips you can see a lot of dead skin still hanging on my lips.. For the price I was expecting something MUCH better and efficient. UPDATE: after a month of using it 4 times a week still no results whatsoever, my lips are still dry, peeling off. I cannot believe I spent 20 dollars on something that has done absolutely nothing for me! I would like my money back folks! :/</li>
    <li> I have very dry lips that peel and using the product has really helped me very much.it keeps my lips nice and moist and free of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Both the exfoliant and the lip balm work great.  I highly recommend this product.  You will not be disappointed.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Another scam product from this line , expensive and leave your lips like dry sand after the scrub. The moister that comes with last like 2 seconds .</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping.  Happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I love this and it really clears the chapped lips.  My daughter also uses it and loves it. Best product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I really like it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...works very well. Can barely notice my lines.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I used it religiously some years ago but had moved away to other products in the last few years. Last year I developed an allergy to lip balm and after trying multiple ones I decided to go back and try lip apeel again. It works fabulously and obviously nothing is aggravating my allergy which is great because my lips would swell ( not in a good way) and sting like crazy. Lip apeel is gentle and I love the balm (smells wonderful) with the ability to keep them smooth with the peel. Definitely recommend. Just because something is an older product on the market, doesn&#x27;t mean it still couldn&#x27;t be great or even the best.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz recommended this on his show and this is my third order. It does make my lips so soft and gets rid of the dry skin on the surface.  I will order this again, I am sure.</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews.  I bought this product on a whim and had never tried a lip exfoliator before.  I don&#x27;t consider my lips to be incredibly dry, but a beauty guru on youtube said something about exfoliating lips for better lipstick application so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  After one use I can now conclude that my lips must have been incredibly dry.  My definition of smooth lips was biased because they had never been this smooth before.  It&#x27;s amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My lips got really dry and flaky after giving birth to my son no matter how much chapstick I put on or how often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and they all seemed pretty positive so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to apply a thin layer of the line peel but I find putting a thick layer on is more effective. When I combine the lip balm with a coat of eos lip balm it makes my lips much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips still get very flaky but when I use this often it solves the issue right away. 3 stars because it works decently but was expecting it to work better for the price.</li>
    <li> Have only used this for a few weeks. Not to sure at this point that it even works. The chap stick is nice</li>
    <li> It works...sometimes.  Sometimes I feel like it makes it worse though.  I think the key to success is everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;That being said...they give you a ton of product.  I bought this months and months ago and I still have plenty.  I will purchase it again when I run out because I do feel that it helps.</li>
    <li> This is great for lips.  I tried this several years ago and have longed to find it again.  I wish I would have thought to try Amazon eariler!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I works really well on my dry lips, I love the smell also</li>
    <li> This product is great for keeping your lips smooth during any type of weather.</li>
    <li> I tryed lots of lip exfolliators &amp; this is the best one by far. Mary Kays version comes in 2nd.</li>
    <li> This works GREAT! have tried a lot of products but this one is the best, a pricey, and don&#x27;t be fooled by the container, it only has product in the very top~ but the good news is that you should use it sparingly and it should last awhile~ I use vanilla buttercream Soft Candy lip scrub by Treat before I use the Lip Apeel~ only gave Lip Apeel 4 stars because the packaging makes it look like there is much more in the container than there actually is~</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the exfoliant portion so I cannot comment on that portion.  The chap stick works very well for me so I am willing to pay the higher price for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lip scrubs, and come back to this one. Its worth the price even though I wild like it to be half of what it costs. Great product</li>
    <li> I have had dry, peeling lips for several months and no lip balm or gloss would cure it. I even put Neosporin on my lips, but they still peeled constantly and I was very self-conscious about it in public. I tried this product based on the reviews and I am so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few days I used the peel once a day - it&#x27;s very easy, only takes a couple of minutes - and then used the balm afterwards. Now I use the peel every few days and using the balm afterwards and whenever my lips feel dry. It&#x27;s very hydrating, smoothing and shiny and it&#x27;s my new favorite lip balm, I take it with me everywhere in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a lot of both the peel and balm left - doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ll run out for a few months. This product really does it&#x27;s job! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, lips feel wonderful after using</li>
    <li> I have tried this before at a BeautiControl party years ago and I remembered this worked well.  I am quite satisfied with this.  It cleans up my lips and makes them soft.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to product for dry lips.  Works great and lasts a long time. I have tried Mary Kay products and didn&#x27;t like as well as this.</li>
    <li> I was surprised on how fast I got it! This product is amazing for your lips !!</li>
