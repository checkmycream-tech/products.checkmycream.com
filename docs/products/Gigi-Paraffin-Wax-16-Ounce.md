      <li>Smells very good and am very happy with the purchase, leaves skin feeling super soft</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to lavender scents, so this Eucalyptus scented wax is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Gigi is by far the best parafin wax.</li>
      <li>The wax has a nice scent that is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>This wax smells delicious and can be used several times before changing.</li>
      <li>Amazing....will be ordering more</li>
      <li>and I can dip as many times as I want.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wax for my therapy spa treatment to hand and feet&lt;</li>
      <li>Was fairly easy to remove from it&#x27;s packaging.  </li>
      <li>Melts easily in the foot spa too.  </li>

      <li>I mix one of these with 2-3 lavender and it is just right.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, nice and strong scent but could be a little overpowering.</li>

      <li>I have arthritic hands and love using my hand waxer to ease the pain and provide deep heat therapy.</li>
      <li>She said it helps, the hot wax has the soothing affect of muscle rubs that contain eucalyptus with the penatrating heat of the hot wax.</li>
      <li>I think I would have added more if the bath was in a different room.  </li>
      <li>The oils in this wax really help my skin.</li>
      <li>Paraffin very helpful in easing aches and pain in wrist joint.</li>
      <li>Very soothing and relaxing to use at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Just as expected and received quick.</li>
      <li>Lightly permeated the house for the next few weeks.</li>
      <li>I have used regular paraffin previously, the addition of tea tree oil interested me.  </li>

<li> I know this paraffin is expensive, but to me its worth it.</li>
<li> I refilled my paraffin bath the other day and the smell just made me want to use my paraffin bath.</li>
<li> She uses it a few times a day to soothe her arthritis.</li>
<li> Definitely less expensive than going to the salon</li>

    <li> I would highly recommend.  Was fairly easy to remove from it&#x27;s packaging.  As soon as I put it in my spa the smell was wonderfully pleasant.  I do keep my spa turned onto low. Lightly permeated the house for the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> Love the eucalyptus scent! I mix one of these with 2-3 lavender and it is just right. Otherwise, nice and strong scent but could be a little overpowering.</li>

    <li> This is great for moisture but is too oily to use all the time but great for treatment before bed.</li>
    <li> I have used regular paraffin previously, the addition of tea tree oil interested me.  I admit the moisture from the oils are nice, but, for me, the product stays too soft to easily remove.  If that doesn&#x27;t matter to you, by all means use this.</li>
    <li> Good price and good product.  No problem with it at all.  Will buy again and its useful.  Thank you for this item</li>

I also bought the Mango shea butter paraffin wax which I know she will enjoy as well. Thankyou so much for two great products and timely shipment!</li>
    <li> Gigi is by far the best parafin wax. i found it at a local store for less money. but I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything but.</li>
    <li> I know this paraffin is expensive, but to me its worth it. I am very sensitive to lavender scents, so this Eucalyptus scented wax is perfect for me. The oils in this wax really help my skin. I&#x27;ve mixed this wax with some plain unscented paraffin and works wonderfully together. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>

    <li> The wax has a nice scent that is not too strong.  I bought this as filler.  Works fine even when I added to my unscented wax.</li>
    <li> Amazing....will be ordering more</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help my wife with some arthritis pain in her hands. She said it helps, the hot wax has the soothing affect of muscle rubs that contain eucalyptus with the penatrating heat of the hot wax. She uses it when her hands become sore from daily&lt;br /&gt;activities, household chores and such. She told me to give it 5 stars. If you have arthritis in the hands that become a problem at times try this product you may find it helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wax for my therapy spa treatment to hand and feet&lt;br /&gt;This is the best Value</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product that will warm and help the arthritis in my hands.  This was highly recommended and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells wonderful and works great in the revlon hand warmer i put it in. very refreshing and great price!</li>
    <li> I have arthritic hands and love using my hand waxer to ease the pain and provide deep heat therapy. This wax smells delicious and can be used several times before changing. Definitely less expensive than going to the salon and I can dip as many times as I want.</li>
    <li> I added only one of these to the rest of the paraffin because the bath is in my bedroom, I didn&#x27;t want the smell to overwhelm me.  It seemed about the right amount of scent.  I think I would have added more if the bath was in a different room.  The scent did dissapate after a week or two.</li>
    <li> Also a bit tingly and soothing.  Same thing could be accomplished much cheaper if you added a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil to plain paraffin beads.</li>
