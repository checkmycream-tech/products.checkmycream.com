      <li>KMS Hairplay Molding Paste is a very good value for the money.  </li>
      <li>He reports that this is the best product, at the best price, for the most product amount he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
      <li>Great service,</li>
      <li>#34;oh great, another product suggested</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>, the fact there is no shine (like most gels) and not alot of residue....HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
      <li>I have bought this products for many years now and this is the best bargain yet.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this paste!  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product...</li>
      <li>Great product at a fantastic price.  </li>
      <li>This KMS paste is the best, superior to other products.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;d give it a 10 if they had that many stars...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, esp.</li>
      <li>I have thick-curly/frizzy hair and nothing I have used has satisfied me.</li>
      <li>The KMS Molding Paste is by far the best hair product I have used and is relatively cheap considering the size you get.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Get it if its available!</li>
      <li>I thought that was pretty good, but I like the KMS so much more.  </li>
      <li>Even better, this is a cruelty free product.  </li>
      <li>You get the strong, matte finish of the Fiber but the easily pliable and movable paste of the Forming Cream.   </li>
      <li>1 Month Edit: This product works best on my shorter hair (less than 1.5 inches).</li>
      <li>Buyer is fast and always able to address any questions.</li>
      <li>Great hold and flexibility - but be careful not to use too much.</li>
      <li>Sooo worth the money for me.</li>
      <li>The hold is great and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, less than a dime sized amount.  </li>
      <li>Super product, now that i could buy it in the larger size, my dollar gets me more product.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, the 6.8oz bottle is a great deal compared to what it costs at the salon for the smaller 5.1oz tube.</li>
      <li>This is great especially if you have short hair.</li>
      <li>It works great without your hair turning really hard.</li>
      <li>Thanks KMS!</li>
      <li>I find the best styling option is on towel dry hair instead of blow dried hair.   </li>
      <li>if it dries, you&#x27;re able to maneuver your hair, but not really change the style as easy.&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
      <li>Works great - a little goes a long way...  </li>
      <li>It smells great too but remember to only use a small amount.</li>
      <li>: the more water and paste you use, the less a matte finish</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s extremely particular about hair products...VERY particular, in fact.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different hair products and ever since I was introduced to the KMS Molding Paste, I will not go back!  </li>
      <li>like I do I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Bought this product for our son who has fairly curly, tough hair.</li>
      <li>This is the first time they&#x27;ve sold it in this larger container.</li>
      <li>I am able to use a small amount of this product working it into my roots to add dimension and then onto the ends of my hair to add definition.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for something that will hold your hair in a more natural way and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard as rock, this is a must have item!</li>
      <li>I have short, straight black asian hair and this paste works really well for holding my hair in place without causing it to take on an uncharacteristic shine or greasy look.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I need to be careful about is using too much product.  </li>
      <li>It works really well at holding my hair in place; although as my hair grows a little longer sometimes I need to add a tiny dab of gel and mix it in to hold everything in place.  </li>
      <li>No Wet look, No stiff feeling, and absolutely NO FRIZZING!!</li>

<li> No Wet look, No stiff feeling, and absolutely NO FRIZZING!!</li>
<li> It has just the right amount of hold without being hard or greasy.</li>
<li> usually by the product from my sister, however we live far apart now</li>
<li> It still remains pliable after application so you can restyle it if you need to, and never makes my hair feel crispy or odd so long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I order large amounts online.</li>
<li> After about 4 weeks my hair is too long and the product didn&#x27;t hold and look as well as with shorter hair</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking really wet like gel, but it also gives enough hold to style.  </li>
<li> u dont need to use alot to style but it holds for a long time....</li>
<li> I have very strong and thick strands of hair and then also have just plain thick hair.</li>
<li> It actually makes my hair seem thicker, especially in those \\&quot;trouble spots.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> After you style your hair you can mess it up and with your fingers put it back in place just like that!</li>
<li> (if hair gets too dry, wet one of your palms under the faucet and fling the excess water off)&lt;br /&gt;1 pump and mix with palms and apply thoroughly on the crown and another pump (or half)</li>
<li> It puts shine in your hair and it goes a long way with just a little bit rubbed from your fingers into your hair.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> The only hair product to tame my unruly, classically thick Asian hair.</li>
<li> Other products would either leave my hair wet looking, stiff, or would not hold at all</li>
<li> It also saves me a lot of time on styling my Hair (like curling it with the curling iron to cut down on the frizzyness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> : i usually towel dry my hair and apply when my hair is damp.</li>
<li> When I get out of the Shower I towel dry my hair, and use a very small amount of the KMS Molding Paste (Like one pump) and run it though my wet hair</li>
<li> Then it seems heavy and greasy.</li>
<li> but I wish price was lower since I have bought this product for less in the past, I&#x27;ll try them again.</li>
<li> Buy it w confidence, i&#x27;ve been using it for the past two years.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard like gel does.  </li>
<li> Can&#x27;t wait for it to come in, I desperately need it as I am out!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used this product for over ten years. I have very strong and thick strands of hair and then also have just plain thick hair. I am able to use a small amount of this product working it into my roots to add dimension and then onto the ends of my hair to add definition. My haircut is shorter so this is a superb product for styling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, esp. after the product that I used from another company was discontinued.  Even better, this is a cruelty free product.  The hold is great and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, less than a dime sized amount.  Great!</li>
    <li> I love this paste!  It is the only product I will use in my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking really wet like gel, but it also gives enough hold to style.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The only hair product to tame my unruly, classically thick Asian hair. I used to use the American Crew Fiber and Forming Cream. They worked very good but the KMS Molding Paste is like a perfect combo of the two. You get the strong, matte finish of the Fiber but the easily pliable and movable paste of the Forming Cream.   The KMS Molding Paste is by far the best hair product I have used and is relatively cheap considering the size you get. It smells great too but remember to only use a small amount. I find the best styling option is on towel dry hair instead of blow dried hair.   Save your money and buy this paste and the larger size.  1 Month Edit: This product works best on my shorter hair (less than 1.5 inches). After about 4 weeks my hair is too long and the product didn&#x27;t hold and look as well as with shorter hair</li>
    <li> Bought this product for our son who has fairly curly, tough hair. He&#x27;s extremely particular about hair products...VERY particular, in fact. He reports that this is the best product, at the best price, for the most product amount he&#x27;s ever used. He&#x27;d give it a 10 if they had that many stars... and I quote!</li>
    <li> I waited for the scheduled 10 business days plus another four. Next time I will just run to the salon.</li>
    <li> I have short, straight black asian hair and this paste works really well for holding my hair in place without causing it to take on an uncharacteristic shine or greasy look.  It works really well at holding my hair in place; although as my hair grows a little longer sometimes I need to add a tiny dab of gel and mix it in to hold everything in place.  It still remains pliable after application so you can restyle it if you need to, and never makes my hair feel crispy or odd so long as I don&#x27;t use too much.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price.  You are getting 6.8 oz for below costs for a 5oz tube in stores.  Buyer is fast and always able to address any questions.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...way ahead any wax you can find on the market. Buy it w confidence, i&#x27;ve been using it for the past two years.Thanks KMS!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will hold your hair in a more natural way and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard as rock, this is a must have item!</li>
    <li> Super product, now that i could buy it in the larger size, my dollar gets me more product.  This KMS paste is the best, superior to other products.</li>
    <li> I have bought this products for many years now and this is the best bargain yet. Get it if its available!</li>
    <li> This hair paste was introduced to me by a hair stylist. That was 5 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It puts shine in your hair and it goes a long way with just a little bit rubbed from your fingers into your hair. After you style your hair you can mess it up and with your fingers put it back in place just like that! This is great especially if you have short hair. Sooo worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has just the right amount of hold without being hard or greasy. Also, it doesn&#x27;t run when I&#x27;m working out and all sweaty. Lastly, the 6.8oz bottle is a great deal compared to what it costs at the salon for the smaller 5.1oz tube.</li>
    <li> KMS Hairplay Molding Paste is a very good value for the money.  It actually makes my hair seem thicker, especially in those \\&quot;trouble spots.\\&quot;  The only thing that I need to be careful about is using too much product.  Then it seems heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> Great service, but I wish price was lower since I have bought this product for less in the past, I&#x27;ll try them again.</li>
    <li> Works great - a little goes a long way...  Great hold and flexibility - but be careful not to use too much.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried alot of diff hair products and this one has a perfect balance of hold and amt required....u dont need to use alot to style but it holds for a long time....big fan of the smell, the fact there is no shine (like most gels) and not alot of residue....HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I have thick-curly/frizzy hair and nothing I have used has satisfied me. Other products would either leave my hair wet looking, stiff, or would not hold at all and my hair would frizz up. My sister who is a Hair Stylist introduced me to KMS products and the Molding Paste. From that point I was hooked! When I get out of the Shower I towel dry my hair, and use a very small amount of the KMS Molding Paste (Like one pump) and run it though my wet hair and I&#x27;m done. When my Hair air dries the kms leaves it with wavy/bounce/curls. No Wet look, No stiff feeling, and absolutely NO FRIZZING!! If you have frizzy-curly hair like I do I highly recommend this product. It also saves me a lot of time on styling my Hair (like curling it with the curling iron to cut down on the frizzyness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually by the product from my sister, however we live far apart now and I was running low and had to order it this time! Can&#x27;t wait for it to come in, I desperately need it as I am out!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair products and ever since I was introduced to the KMS Molding Paste, I will not go back!  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard like gel does.  Before this product, I used to use the AXE &amp;#34;Messy Look&amp;#34; Paste.  I thought that was pretty good, but I like the KMS so much more.  KMS just feels softer, and you don&#x27;t have to sacrifice your hair&#x27;s mold-ability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it&#x27;s great. This is the first time they&#x27;ve sold it in this larger container. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, so I order large amounts online. It works great without your hair turning really hard.</li>
    <li> suggested by my stylist&#x27;s assistant one day after getting my hair cut. i thought &amp;#34;oh great, another product suggested and it&#x27;s likely not going to work&amp;#34;. but i went and bought it anyway.... poof! it did what i was expecting. but be warned, just like with anything - moderation, moderation!!&lt;br /&gt;DIRECTIONS: i usually towel dry my hair and apply when my hair is damp. (if hair gets too dry, wet one of your palms under the faucet and fling the excess water off)&lt;br /&gt;1 pump and mix with palms and apply thoroughly on the crown and another pump (or half) for the sides and back. the trick is to hurry up and style before it dries. if it dries, you&#x27;re able to maneuver your hair, but not really change the style as easy.&lt;br /&gt;note: the more water and paste you use, the less a matte finish</li>
