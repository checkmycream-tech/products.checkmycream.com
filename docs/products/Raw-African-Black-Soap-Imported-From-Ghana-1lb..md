<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great soap!  It is very exfoliating so be careful while scrubbing.  My pre-teenage son is beginning to get acne and he uses it.  Gentle rubbing with a facecloth has helped take care of the bumps and whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Makes you feel squeaky clean no residue.</li>
    <li> Little harsh, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m really loving this soap!! It leaves my face feeling smooth &amp; it&#x27;s not drying at all....I have switched to using my astringent every other day instead of everyday, because my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; was getting irritated w/ everyday use. But, I&#x27;m ok w/ every other day. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this item from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> 6 days to arrive instead of 2 and Product was smaller than 1lb. Purchase the same product this year and it was different.</li>
    <li> the chunk itself isn&#x27;t too brittle or too soft so it&#x27;s very easy to cut into manageable portions. there is a very light scent (really, almost unscented) and there isn&#x27;t any scent left on the skin by the soap. also, it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling like it has a film on it but it also doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling dried out. but! it does dry out pimples which is a PLUS.</li>
    <li> This soap is really soft and fresh feeling.  It makes the great rich lather that african soap is know for.  As a male I use it primarily for shaving and washing my face.  The last bar that I purchased from a street fair lasted me around 14 months.  $10 is a super savings compared to the many cans of sensitive skin formula shaving gels and after-shave creams that I have purchased in the past.  Also I have noticed that my razor blades last much longer with this soap than it did with those multi-ingredient retail products.</li>
    <li> I tend to like toiletries that are natural and not really fragranced to smell like cologne or perfume, so the nutty burnt ash/nutty scent of this was perfect.  And initially, I felt squeaky clean (which should&#x27;ve been my first indication that this product was completely stripping all moisture from my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was way too harsh.  I&#x27;m a black guy who doesn&#x27;t have a bathroom full of product.  I eat right, drink loads of water and already have dark, smooth, radiant, blemish-free skin.  However after using this soap for a few weeks, my skin dried out excessively to the point that it had scale-like patches and started over-producing sebum which then caused major breakouts.  Not even moisturizing afterward helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discontinued use a month ago, and went back to my bars of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s along with moisturizing after a shower with coconut oil and now my skin is back to its former glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this product, but it was a hot mess.  At least for me.  If I could return the remaining, unopened packs for a refund, I most certainly would!</li>
    <li> Out of curiosity and positive reviews, I decided to give this product a try.  It produces a pretty good lather (more than regular soaps) and seems to be cleansing the skin a lot more.  I&#x27;m willing to continue using this as well as trying other, similar products to break the monotony of artificial toiletries.  The only thing I&#x27;d have to get used to is the lack of fragrance as opposed to other soaps.  If it works, it works!</li>
    <li> One can&#x27;t ever fail with African Black Soap.  Never had flawless skin as now!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely gonna buy it - always!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet (waiting to get some raw shea butter), but no rancid smell or abnormalities, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good for now.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. I researched African Black Soap and was looking for the original style raw -- and this is it.  Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and severe skin allergies and had trouble finding a product to wash with.  My cousin recommended Raw African Black Soap and I have been using it every since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using African Black Soap and I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of reviews saying it&#x27;s great for sensitive, oil-y, and dry skin. Uhm, not sure about that. The African Black Soap actually dried out my face to the point that my skin cracked. I have extremely oil-y skin so I can&#x27;t image what it&#x27;s like for people with dry skin. I did however notice that my pores have gotten much smaller in size and my complexion has cleared just within the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still highly suggest the product, but if your skin starts cracking from the soap, I suggest buying raw shea butter.</li>
    <li> So this is like a big chunk of soap! I just cut off a piece of it and I use that in the shower and I put the rest away to help it last longer. Its definitely very good for my skin and very hydrating! it has a lightly exfoliating quality from the texture. If you have never used black soap, give it a try!!! It is good for your hair as well as skin, I use it specifically for acne and psoriasis. In addition I like to use pine tar soap which does wonders for my hair and dry skin.  This is also a very good amount for the price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice really nice recommended 100%</li>
    <li> First off let me say this product looks nothing like the photo. It comes in a bag and it looks like a bag of dog poo. The soap lathers well for all you guys that like a lathery soap this is the soap for you. I have not experienced any skin dryness. Maybe will purchase again. Gave it 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact that the photo is misleading. Would have loved to post a photo of the actual soap but could not.</li>
    <li> i believe this has helped clear my acne and prevent new breakouts. It leaves my face squeaky clean so I have to follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I received this 2 days ago!  You only need a minute amount, and it really lathers and cleans your face and body thoroughly!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Love it. Love love love it!!  It was already cut into bars...  So that was nice!!  I know where to get my soap from now and forever!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast service. Very satisfied!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Soap was old, dry and crumbled. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> Arrived timely. Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be one large chunk as it did. It&#x27;s easy to cut into any size you choose.</li>
    <li> This item seemed to be good but after using it for a week it started to burn my face so I stopped using it. Maybe ill give it a try again some day but I did not like the fact that it had my face burning.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to wash makeup off of my face. This African black soap really gets it off. I also have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and has helped in reducing the oil and acne that I have. It can be a bit drying, but applying a moisturizer afterward takes care of that problem. I also love how you get so much for the price paid. It will last a while!</li>
    <li> My most favorite, truly NATURAL soap, that helps with my red bumps on my arms! I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals, or things bad for you in it! Your skin soaks up what you put on it, and I don&#x27;t worry when I am using this soap! The smell took a minute to get used to because I was always using Bath and Body products, but I love it now! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling anything but fresh when I am done! :)</li>
    <li> Had little rocks in it.</li>
    <li> For all skin types!!  My daughter has never been able to use soap on her face.. she absolutely loves this soap! I was excited to see this on  Amazon!  We usually have to &amp;#34;luck up&amp;#34; with a vendor that has it. I love it also.. It only takes a pinch to lather greatly.. so it lasts. It leaves no residue, just feels clean, smells clean. I&#x27;m going to try it on my hair..lol. I shared it with friends, with various skin issues.. they were thankful of the results &amp; that it&#x27;s easy on the budget. It arrived as a brick wrapped in plastic. Can be cut to fit any size soap dish.. I keep a piece in the kitchen, It&#x27;s proven better than washing hands with dish detergent. A wonderful soap for traveling (a little goes a long way). I&#x27;m loving the handmade natural benefits &amp; look it has.</li>
    <li> Perfect  on black spot  and cleaner</li>
    <li> I love my black soap though when I tell people about it they think I am crazy.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good for my face and with this coooold winter my skin is not dry.</li>
    <li> So this is my first time ever using raw black soap I&#x27;ve used all the processed kinds which worked well but this works best , first off I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews that mentioned hard pieces in the soap this is true so be careful if you scrub too hard you may cut yourself these are the palm kernels that are used when making the soap so if your sensitive I&#x27;d recommend using a loofa and lathering it .It may leave your skin feeling dry when you get out the shower so just use a light moisturizer.  I also have very severe psoriasis like from head to toe and this has significantly began to calm it down so anyone with a skin condition this will help a lot  definitely a well worth it purchase won&#x27;t be using anything else ever again</li>
    <li> Makes face really squeaky clean a tiny portion works up a great lather.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using black soap for a very long time. It&#x27;s so good for my hair and skin, it cleans and helps even skin tone. I have had a hard time looking for real black soap around here and I am SO glad to have it on here!!!</li>
    <li> Product came in plastic bag, in too many broken blocks. I received nugget soap pieces, that crumbled apart even more under water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written reviews for this product before but from different vendors. Just like my previous purchases, I really love this soap. It&#x27;s a staple for my all over due to being made of all natural ingredients. I also appreciate the fact that it&#x27;s hand made in the traditional Ghanaian method. Ever since a friend turned me on to this product from her country, I&#x27;ve been a lifer. It&#x27;s amazing for both the body and face. I rarely get pimples even though I have extremely oily-acne prone skin. One thing I would recommend is to keep the portion you cut in a plastic container to prevent brown stuff getting on your tub. Additionally, it&#x27;s important to keep excess water out of that container since it causes this soap to melt quite easily.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous soap! My girls and I love it. Lasts a long time. I cut it into bars, wrap it in wax paper to store it to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good product, very quick shipment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I was introduced to raw African black soap by my friend and she told me to buy it here. It&#x27;s what I expected it to be. I will order more from this seller.</li>
    <li> Watched a lot of video reviews and read a ton of written reviews people wrote that keep getting over priced product and not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put your worries to bed, this is the real deal and is shipped right and fast!</li>
    <li> Love this soap so much! I really do believe that this is what has helped clear my skin. It has an earth smell, as others have said and it does melt easily with water, so I suggest not leaving it in the shower. Also, its slightly drying, so make sure to moisturize. But with continued use, you&#x27;ll see the wonderful results!</li>
    <li> The actual soap doesn&#x27;t look like the picture but man it leaves the skin soft, smelling good, and it feels like there&#x27;s moisturizers in the soap as well....It&#x27;s a soft soap and a little chunk of it under some water will get it shaped into how you want. A big bag of good soap it is, and I will definitley be getting some more when this is gone!! ~~~~~~ Highly Recommended by me</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a natural soap that doesn&#x27;t make my psoriasis worse and then I was given some black soap. I was apprehensive because every time I tried I new soap I would break out. I&#x27;ve been stuck on Dove for almost ten years. Ive had no flare ups and my skin is doing a lot better. This particular brand has less rocks than my first batch.</li>
    <li> Meh - the Dudo-Osun is a much better soap for the money.</li>
    <li> Outstanding! I love this Black Soap my face is looking so smooth and my pores have shrunk! I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this soap on a whim, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It produces the most lather of any soap I&#x27;ve tried. Given how long it lasts, it&#x27;s priced very reasonably.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes my skin feel amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. I no longer feel the need to apply moisturizer after I was my face! My acne scaring started appearing a lot better as well. This stuff is kind of a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> The ONLY soap everyone should be using. I refuse to use anything other than this soap. You don&#x27;t even need to use lotions or creams after washing with this. It leaves your skin moisturizer. It also helps to remove blemish scars, and has made a huge impact on lessening breakouts. It has a very nice subtle clean  smell. My husband and I, along with our 3 children all use it. Just break off chunks as needed. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Since using this soap, I have developed beautiful fingernails. I am 67 y/o and have always had paper thin fingernails. I now have beautiful strong fingernails. Soap is a little messy when not in use but the benefits are worth it</li>
    <li> I use this bar in conjunction with my clarisonic and it knocks the dirt right out or my pores! My face beems when I&#x27;m done so I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Cleared my body acne up! My scars are fading! Love this! The only thing is dont scrub or exfoliate your skin with this. It&#x27;s too strong to scrub or exfoliate with.</li>
    <li> I started using this type of soap after a major rash breakout on my face. I really like this soap and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! it washes away all the dirt from my face. I use it morning and night. I do recommend to use a moisturizer after because it dries out your skin. I diluted with water (half water and half soap) in a little container in the night, and in the morning it is ready to use. It cleared out my skin A LOT!!</li>
    <li> Scratchy and doesn&#x27;t stay hard long, Turns to a goop of a mess even though I kept it in a sealed mason jar.</li>
    <li> drys the skin out well if you use this just don&#x27;t scrub too long or you&#x27;ll end up with an almost sunburn like pealing.</li>
    <li> It came in a bag and was barely held together.  It came apart in my hands.  When I left it in the shower, the black stuff became a gooey puddle.  It lathers well.  It smells a little generic.  I think it just needed to be pressed together first and then shipped.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s normal for African black soap to crumble into little pieces when in use. But I find that this doesn&#x27;t, which is an extra plus. However if yours does, simply add some water and knead it into a mold. Coming from West Africa myself, I can attest to its quality and potency, definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> This soap did help clear my skin however it was very drying even when using a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. The soap works wonders. It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and it cleans my face without drying it out. The soap was delivered pretty fast. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great soap, good lather and I like the fact that it is organic.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery!!!! This is my second time purchasing!!!!! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. Looks just like picture. Makes my skin extremely soft.</li>
    <li> This is a detergent soap.  The oil used to make the soap does not adequately address the lye used to cause the soapification process.  It stripped my skin of all oil and I had to use sesame seed oil and shea butter to relieve the  itch and dry skin.  Even places that I never suffer with dry skin were dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to use this cleaning greasy pots and pans, and grease from my hands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but I love this soap. It makes your skin so soft. It does have little spiky parts though, so you can&#x27;t rub it directly on your skin.</li>
    <li> I guess this soap is authentic I found it to have only normal cleaning properties. I weighed my bar as soon as it arrived and it only weighed 12 ozs.maybe a lb in Ghana is different.</li>
    <li> Great soap, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my skin like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;Worked miracles on my teenage son&#x27;s back-acne.  I&#x27;ve given small pieces (small because it lasts forever) to everyone I know, and EVERYONE asks for more!&lt;br /&gt;There is a purge period... for me it lasted about a week- this stuff is going to suck ALL the gunk out of your skin, and you&#x27;ll need to be patient with all the pimples that get raised as part of that purge process.  You can expect to lose a little moisture with it... definitely need a good, non-pore-clogging moisturizer to follow this.&lt;br /&gt;I started out using once a day, now I use twice a day as I had to allow my skin time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;I have &amp;#34;maturing&amp;#34; skin (I&#x27;m 35) that suddenly became an oil slick when I turned 30, but is nearly flawless now.  Gave some to my mom (shes 56) who has such oily skin that she hasn&#x27;t been able to use a moisturizer since her 20&#x27;s and uses her lunch break every day to remove and re-apply ALL of her makeup because her skin is so, so oily.  Within a week of starting to use this, she called to tell me her makeup lasted all day.  Within two weeks, she was thrilled at finally being able to incorporate an anti-aging moisturizer to her skincare routine.  Now, I&#x27;m buying 3-4 bars of this a month as I&#x27;ve somehow ended up the &amp;#34;supplier&amp;#34; for my mom, all of her co-workers, my friends, etc.</li>
    <li> I use this to make shampoo. I cut a piece and put it in a travel size bottle with water and a couple of drops of peppermint and tea tree oil and let it sit until it melts, Perfect if you don&#x27;t want all the chemicals in commercial shampoos.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I expected.  It&#x27;s not especially pretty, and doesn&#x27;t smell like a floral garden, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I use it with a washcloth, and it lathers well and rinses cleanly.</li>
    <li> Happy! I can see skin improvement.  Started removing dark marks and great non abrasive for 4bc natural hair</li>
    <li> This Made Me Break Out Really Bad.. Don&#x27;t Knock It Till You Try It Though.. It Just Didn&#x27;t Work For Me. Someone Else May Have Different Results.</li>
    <li> It came with a lot of soap but it didn&#x27;t work for me and I have been using it for 2weeks now</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this soap! I&#x27;ve already purchased one for a friend. It lathers up so much and is super soft. I store the rest of it in the original wrapper in the kitchen drawer instead of in the bathroom. It&#x27;s super hot here and it melts easily if you leave it in the hot air. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived covered in white and grey mold. Thanks for the exposure to whatever weird african mold that is. Returned it. Hopefully I don&#x27;t die.</li>
    <li> Got this for my parents and they loved it. The great thing about African soap is that it is literally the only bar soap in the world that doesn&#x27;t contain lye. I would not recommend this for face washing due to the high ph, but it is very good as a body wash or hand soap.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever bought. At first it seemed a bit strong, but after I&#x27;d used it for a while I got used to it. It is all-purpose, hair, face, and body soap, and works into a better lather than shampoo. Will buy again! However, test it to make sure your skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive before using a lot of it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am liquifying my black soap right now. It crumbled easily and seemed to be very fresh. I was afraid after reading the reviews re: hair and other debris being found in the soap but so far mine feels and looks good. It IS very stripping and it got my hands squeaky clean so I have ordered some oil of Neem to add to it. I am a novice... I am experimenting but hopefully it works for me as I am dealing with adult acne.  I will update this review with my results in about a month. Blessings All!</li>
    <li> Great Soap! It really helps you skin!</li>
    <li> Okay where do I start? This soap arrived in plastic wrap in chunks that were falling apart. I used it in the shower on my face and body hoping it would do what was advertised. The little rocks and gravel in it tore up my skin and left scratches on me. It also all fell apart even more in the shower, leaving a brown residue. I will never buy anything like this again.</li>
    <li> If you use it habitually, it&#x27;ll rid you of acne just make sure not to use in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this, It is too bad...a lot sand mix inside! Terrible for me when i used clean my face.</li>
    <li> ...incredibly surprising. I used to have relatively clear skin, with the occasional breakout at a certain time of the month. More recently, however, my skin was becoming very troublesome. I had pimples and blemishes all over my cheeks. It to bad enough for my family and even my boss to point it out. I tried every OTC solution I could find. All name-brand cleansers, lotions, wipes, creams, gels.... You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Some things helped slightly but nothing really made a significant improvement. I stumbled across African Shea butter when I was on a random trip to New York, and the seller claimed it was good for skin and hair. I figured, why not. It&#x27;s not like it would make things any worse! I applied it after washing my face, and it actually helped a bit, so I looked into African Shea butter products and found the soap.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is magic. Seriously. I&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 days and it has already made more of an improvement than I&#x27;ve seen with all other products combined. It does tend to dry skin out, so I follow up with the butter, and my skin is almost completely clear again.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is oddly soft, so I just break off tiny pieces whenever I want o wash my face. I lather up my hands instead of rubbing the soap directly on my skin but I&#x27;ve heard that either way is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Also make sure to keep the soap bar wrapped and isolated from water or exposed to air or too long, as it can dry out. I just keep it in a ziplock bag.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any skin issues at all, try this. You definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and its a nice chunk too!  It will last quite a long time if stored properly.</li>
    <li> I use this soap along with Coastal Scents unrefined shea butter and my skin is smooth like butter!&lt;br /&gt;This is my new routine now as I decided to use more natural products.  I recommend this soap&lt;br /&gt;to anyone regardless of any racial identity or ethnicity.</li>
    <li> Love the soap! Cleans well, and seems to be effective for lightening acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside, however, is that it came as one big soap (unlike the picture). Still good, but does look odd to have this big chunk of soap in the tub. I&#x27;ll try cutting the next one :)</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It feels real good on your skin and last a long time.  Just cut off a small piece at a time.  I will continue to use this products with the hope that it will improve my skin blemishes as some said in other reviews.  I have both food and environmental allergies and I constantly break out.  I am now also taken biotin vitamins for my skin.  I have gone to a dermatologist, but the medication have side affects and you have to be constantly monitored so it will not affect your kidneys or blood.  No thanks, I rather go with the natural products with the hope that my skin will improve.  I use to do allergy shots, but after several years of taking them, I got off of them.  Well, I&#x27;m not giving up on this soap.  It may take some time to see a significant improvement.  I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I bought African black soap months ago. I was going to try and write a review a week after buying it, but I just didn&#x27;t have the time. I bought the soap from plant guru, because I bought Shea butter and cocoa butter from this company and had good results. I went on YouTube and watched a video on how to make shampoo/body wash out of African black soap. If you have oily hair I would only recommend using the shampoo/ body wash once a week. My hair is naturally oily, and using this more than once a week made my hair look flat. When using the soap as a  Body wash it worked grate. The soap has a different smell then your everyday soap, so your going to like it or hate it. The soap will dry out your skin, so make sure to use a natural lotion to keep your skin moist. Shea butter and cocoa butter work well for a skin moisturizer.  I used about half a bar to make a 32 ounce bottle to make liquid soap.  I felt that the soap came in somewhat decent packaging. It was wrapped in a plastic and had a label sticker on it. I&#x27;m okay with this, but if you want better packaging than I would try buying from a different company.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying black soap from Amazon, worried that I would get duped. But my normal supplier was out of the raw black soap that I like, so I came here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from Nature and Herbs, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. They sell the real-deal black soap and I&#x27;ll continue to shop with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a house of 5, we go through this soap pretty fast, so I&#x27;m happy to have found bulk black soap at such great prices. We use it for everything, literally from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tween daughter had started getting little bumps on her face, but the black soap cleared that right up. We love it.</li>
    <li> soap is excellent in cleaning my entire body. I use is on my natural hair and also on my face.  In the beginning the soap can be drying on your face but it soon adapted to the product.  I am very allergic to many products and this one does work the best.  Will never go back to other facial soaps.  UPDATE 2015&amp;#34;: still using the soap for my entire body including my hair- 4C.   And I still have only good things to say about the soap.  My face is clear and smooth. To moisturize my face after washing I use 100% Shea Butter, and my face stays clear.  I love it on my hair and will not go back to harsh chemicals products.</li>
    <li> This soap is great!!!! I have been using this along with the African Shea butter on my face and I must say I have fewer break outs and my skin is glowing!!!  Yes I recommend this soap if you have breakouts and if you have scars on your face and body!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product it really evens the skin tone and and keeps your skin extreamly smooth,also gets ride of acne scars/marks</li>
    <li> I believe this soap is original and authentic as I did a lot of research.  It is a little drying on my face but it dries up a bumpy breakout on my arms.  I am also having my husband use it for a form of exzema on his hands so it is a wait and see for that.</li>
    <li> Definitely authentic, I suggest you lather a tiny pinch of soap in your hands and then wash your face with this(some people mentioned it scratches their face and I think that charred pieces that didn&#x27;t burn down to ash and lathering it in your hands helps squish them or avoid putting those pieces on your face) and it cleans very well but be sure to use a moisturizer afterwards because I have oily skin and it was still very drying</li>
    <li> This soap works great on my acne , it also improved the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry, flaky &amp; (hormonal) acne skin. This soap has been wonderful for my skin &amp; it&#x27;s kept my hormonal acne under control. I use this twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;My routine includes:&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanse: Raw African Black Soap&lt;br /&gt;-Toner: Thayers Alcohol-Free Witch Hazel w/Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize: Radha Organic Rosehip Oil&lt;br /&gt;-Treat (leave on acne mask at night): Manuka Health Manuka Honey - MGO 400+ (20+) 250gm&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried countless OTC acne products &amp; spent many visits at the Derm using different prescriptions without success but this regimen has really helped me. I purchased all of these products on Amazon &amp; they&#x27;ve done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t  reccomended the soap for your hair because it doesn&#x27;t really  leave it smooth and tangle free unless you dumb half a bottle of conditioner on your head.&lt;br /&gt;I like how it makes my skin feel though and it has improved the appearance of my legs which have KP.&lt;br /&gt;I  only give  it two stars because I  have found  several black hairs in it. I don&#x27;t  know if they&#x27;re something else that&#x27;s  supposed  to be in there....but they look a lot like human hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I think I&#x27;ll  buy from someone else next time.</li>
    <li> highly recommend this bar soap my skin feels ample and beautiful.  It arrived on time.</li>
    <li> FYI: Authentic African Black Soap is not supposed to be black. It is supposed to be brown. Soaps claiming to be ABS and are black are not authentic, even though they may work perfectly fine for some people. They are typically just dyed soaps. If those products work for you, then great! If you want the authentic stuff, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried this soap, I tried Dudu Osun for several months. It&#x27;s authentic, but it&#x27;s been formed into soap bars, which some people might not like. While that soap is great, I wanted to get something that would last longer rather than buying bars of soap. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this because it was totally worth it. While Dudu Osun is great, it felt a bit stronger for my face (I have combination and sometimes hypersensitive skin; I&#x27;m also African American with brown skin around Gabrielle Union&#x27;s color maybe...I wear NW45 in MAC and Golden Deep in BareMinerals foundation if that gives you a better idea) and had a slight fragrance whereas this stuff makes my skin feel less tight after cleansing, and there is no slight fragrance. There is a slight scent to this one, but it&#x27;s not as strong as Dudu Osun. The package came in a plastic wrap when I opened the box and WOW. This block is huge, and the soap is malleable, meaning that you can pull it apart and break it into pieces if you want.It&#x27;s almost kinda squishy. I really love how little pieces last forever. Like with any ABS, it will dissolve in water if you let it sit in it; if you like to melt it down or make your own liquid soap, then this is great but if you want to avoid any melting, then store it in a soap dish.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is drying, but it is tolerable as long as you have a very good moisturizer. Sometimes I wash my face with a few drops of tea tree oil and this soap in order to remove some dark spots, but that is more of a personal thing I like to do. By itself, it&#x27;s very good for drying out blemishes. If you&#x27;re looking for deep exfoliation, this soap is great for that; youcould even take it a step further and use an exfoliation pad. There are some tiny grains in mine, but they haven&#x27;t hurt me like some people have complained. I haven&#x27;t found any hairs in my batch either. I&#x27;ve had this soap for a little over a month and still have about 80-90% of it left, but this is only because a little goes a very long way. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this again. It&#x27;s cost-effective and works incredibly well.</li>
    <li> Item was good, exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This soap has a unique buttery texture. Soothing  and leaves the skin subtle.  GLORIOUS!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you have acne or any kind of bumpy Skin problems, this is your answer. If you&#x27;ve tried multiple treatments, products, etc. Then this is your answer. This has been recommended to me for years but I failed to heed the advice. I began using it not too long ago and almost immediately it began to clear my acne and the bumps beneath my skin. In a span of a few weeks. It&#x27;s less money than all the drug store products and works 100 times better. Give it a try, You will truly be surprised at how quickly it will clear and brighten your skin.</li>
    <li> this is the truth, clears up my skin...it does dry your skin but just make sure you are using a good mosturizer</li>
    <li> I didnt like that soap it broke my face out even more</li>
    <li> This is certainly one of the least-processed soaps I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to use -- and it&#x27;s been a pleasure.  Lathers up well into a light-brown foam, smells soapy, rinses off fairly well.  However, I have to say there&#x27;s nothing fantastic about it.  Not a miracle product, but interesting and inexpensive.  A definite &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; for anyone who wants the most primitive, natural product.</li>
    <li> The raw African Black Soap came in one big lump. I sawed off a small chunk and stored the rest in ziplock bag in small box under the bed (as no one wanted it anywhere near where they store their stuff because the soap looked like ****). The small chunk is still going strong about a month later*, perhaps due to me using it only occasionally and storing it in closed soap container afterwards. Am not sure how I will ever use up the whole thing by myself before it expires (does it even expire? Would I know if it is spoiled?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do use it, it feels authentic. Foams a lot, feels moisturizing during use but after you wash it off the face feels immediately dry, so using a good toner and moisturizer afterwards is a must. I like it but although it makes parts of my face looks better, some small parts (chin and cheek area) have broken out in tiny white acne which is why am using it only occasionally. The soap is still in trial phase and not a permanent part of my routine yet due to the reason mentioned prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good price and value for what you get. But FYI I found a strand embedded in the small chunk of soap but it being supposedly naturally made and left to chill who knows where, it&#x27;s probably understandable and why am still giving it a four star...but a foreign strand of HAIR! If the possibility of something like that occurring to you is not something you can swallow, am not sure this raw form is something for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The small chunk was promptly tossed and another took its place due to above reason.</li>
    <li> I have heard good things about the Dude Osun type of Black Soap, but if you want the most potent type of black soap, you need this...in its RAW form. This works the best for me and those with the common skin issues. It has an earthy smell, no added fragrance, just the cocoa pod elements and plantain skins as well as other vitamin-rich elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please consider buying this before any other type of &amp;#34;handcrafted&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Black Soap&amp;#34; out there</li>
    <li> Ive tried many acne products on my face such as Aveeno, neutrogena, clean n clear, clearasil, proactive, etc. After researching the harmful chemicals in them which could potentially cause cancer or other issues I began searching for natural products. I tried Burt bees but, pimples would disappear then reappear shortly after use. I came across African black soap yet, it wasnt the 100 percent pure kind from ghana and the soap didn&#x27;t work for long. I decided to purchase the raw African black soap from ghana and its the best soap i have ever used on my face. It keeps the pimples away for a very long time and seems as though it cures acne problems all together. Bar soaps are already great for acne but with the ingredients in raw black soap its even better. I use this in combination with aloe Vera or burt bees spot treatment and my face is clearer than any product could have made it. Its worth a try, thanks for this great soap</li>
    <li> I like organic products and it wont break me out.Yes get this for this awesome price</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of my dark spots and it works but it&#x27;s taking longer than I thought</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this soap! I&#x27;ve been suffering from severe eczema since I was 13 years old, and am now 22. I do tons of research on natural products I can use to help with my skin and kept hearing great things about black soap, so I decided to give it a try! Boy am I glad I did. Not only does this soap get your skin squeaky clean, but my breakouts are gone! I love that it came in a huge chunk so that I can just cut it into squares and use it moderately. Next I&#x27;m going to try it on my face and hair. I love that this is just so completely raw and natural and comes at a cheap price! Throw out your processed, skin-stripping brand name soaps and switch to black soap people! It&#x27;s been used for thousand of years; do your research and read about all of it&#x27;s benefits that are more than just skin deep!</li>
    <li> I am not really sure how to feel about this product. I love that it is raw and everything, but when I use it my skin feels sticky afterwards. I can&#x27;t run my hands down my legs smoothly, but more choppy because it sticks to my leg. Kind of hard to explain, but i wish they also put the EXACT ingredients in the soap. It doesn&#x27;t say what is in it which is cncerning. I have dry skin and it didn&#x27;t do too much to help with it, but it has a nice smell/aroma. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I am glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my skin and blemishes however it also dries out my skin so I make sure I moisturize my skin after using this product!</li>
    <li> after using this product i could see a difference in the amount of pimples, or skin blemishes i would have. and i felt soooo clean. Great item, used til the last crumb.</li>
    <li> This black soap really works well to clear up acne when used consistently.&lt;br /&gt;good value. one of the best products around.  love that amazon is helping these co-operatives in Africa.</li>
    <li> It makes  my skin so soft. My children even use it . I only  had it for 4 days it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.  But the stock photo is somewhat deceiving.  I know I only ordered 1 lb. but the picture makes it look a lot bigger than it actually is.  But that being said, I am pleased with the quality of the product and the consistency.  This is my first time purchasing African Black Soap and after looking at multiple different brands I chose this one and I am very happy with the product I received. And I&#x27;m glad now I have a better idea of the size of 1 lb of black soap I will feel more comfortable purchasing a larger quantity in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this Raw African Black Soap.  Will definitely be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Nature and Herbs&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Soap was packaged in plastic wrap and tightly wrapped in a clear plastic bag. Well packaged, well protected.  Inside most bag was nearly air-tight (see pics).</li>
    <li> It is awesome. My daughter has very sensitive skin and really bad Eczema. She started using this soap and her skin is so much better. It lathers nicely just like soap. You can use it on your face and hair. The first time I used it on my face, it literally was squeaky clean. Make sure you don&#x27;t use it directly on your body. Lather it in your hands first and then apply. It does have some rough spots which might tear the skin if you apply directly. Love this soap.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this soap to any with acne or blemish problems. This soap allows your skin to feel clean and soft after every use. To women of color, it truly helps faded any dark spots if use on a regular basis.I use it to shave and some of my friends use it as shampoo. It is mutli purpose soap. Which means I do not allow myself to run out. Amazon sells one pound for about $8.00. This is an excellent price. This product is worth trying because you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied!!! I use it every day.</li>
    <li> not the quality I expected</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, AJ that should tell you how good it is.</li>
    <li> All I use for skin care.</li>
    <li> Best soap for oily skin. Leaves skin very dry, if you&#x27;re not the oily type, do not over use.</li>
    <li> This soap is soft &amp; is easy to shred when making my face wash. And the lather is just lovely!!!! I&#x27;ve searched around for a quality African black soap &amp; I think I&#x27;ve found a winner! :) I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction and my skin broke out in scaly rashes across my shoulder. After I purchased and used this soap, it cleared it within 48 hours. I then used Shea Butter to keep the skin moisturized. This soap is also good in clearing any previous or old acne scar. (It won&#x27;t get rid of acne, though.) I say this is a must-have!</li>
    <li> Cannot comment from experience to the quality as this was purchased by me as  gift for another friend who told me that they are very very happy with this soap!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c7e805a41d79d3c7921048e9a21e98ba]] 5 stars for now. I will update on product performance at a later time. Mostly, because I found a lot of people talking about the packaging (some people rate based on that alone), I wanted to show you exactly what I got so you know what to expect. I also take the soap out and \\&quot;play\\&quot;with it some so you can see what it&#x27;s like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I didn&#x27;t notice it so much when I was filming, or when I played it back on my phone, but on a laptop the crinkles in this video might drive you a little nuts. FYI.</li>
    <li> It had black everywhere. Didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
    <li> Eh it&#x27;s not what I expected, smells the way it looks and doesn&#x27;t look like the picture</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am also on antibiotics for acne so I can&#x27;t claim this did all the work but this soap is DRYING in the best way possible for acne. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I love this soap. I was worried I&#x27;d have to put a lot in my was cloth to lather. Surprisingly it lather great a little goes a long way. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> This soap made my face break out. After  using it for a few weeks it developed mold even though I stored it in a dry airtight container.</li>
    <li> I bought two bars of black soap, one from my local beauty supply and this one off amazon. I must say the one from my local beauty supply seems to do a better job at cleansing and giving that cleansed smell and feel. When I use this one from amazon, I wake up with small pimples here and there vs the one from my beauty supply. I don&#x27;t feel this one cleans as well but I got more bar of soap for $7 off amazon, unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it cleanse as good as another brand would but this is just my opinion. So far I haven&#x27;t found any hair in the bar of soap as a few other reviews stated upon my time of purchase...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff too much on my face- it burns. But on my body as a wash- phenomenal. I use another black soap, Dudu Osun to be exact, on my face. But this as a body cleanser is just so much better than a facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best soap I&#x27;ve used. My wife isn&#x27;t a big fan of it because it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. Don&#x27;t let that deter you though. This soap lathers nicely! Just make sure you wipe your shower floor down after, or else YOU WILL have build-up. It&#x27;s also a far better deal than buying handmade soaps from local Farmer&#x27;s Markets and or Etsy. If you must use scented soaps with oils and all that. You could use this to get clean and use your &amp;#34;fancy soap&amp;#34; sparingly.</li>
    <li> it is a lot of product that will last you forever. has its own smell but not a bad one. can dry out face but fine if you apply a moisturizer. good so far.</li>
    <li> I love the soap, works well for myself and my teenagers. Rich creamy lather and it works as well as the pricey African black soaps I have gotten from other vendors. I cut it up into smaller sizes so that it will last a long time for the money</li>
    <li> Raw African Black soap does tend to be a bit drying, so be forewarned- a good moisturizer is a must if you use this product. That said, I can&#x27;t live without my Black Soap! My face needs the extra acne-fighting boost it gets from this, and I have acne-prone areas on my body that also benefit from using this occasionally. I highly recommend it to anyone battling any skin conditions, as it&#x27;s an excellent remedy for most topical ailments.</li>
    <li> Soap works very well as a natural exfoliator especially for stubborn places like under arms when you are trying to remove build up deodorant. Dries your skin but nothing a great moisturizer can&#x27;t help. You will break out for awhile because it unclogs your pours bringing all the bacteria out. Good time to use a good acne product or just a good toner and leave it alone.</li>
    <li> I did like this product but because it&#x27;s natural, you have to understand their are sharp pieces in it from the shells and other products use to make this.  With that being said, you must lather it in your hands and massage your hands on your face, not the actual soap bar itself.  The soap is extremely drying, so you have to follow up with a mild moisturizer. It is great, however for when you have breakouts.  I would purchase again, however I would rather purchase from those who live in Ghana and I know for a fact it&#x27;s coming from there and it is 100% natural.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my body.  Washing with this and not only getting clean but has a sluffing component to it.&lt;br /&gt;Melts a bit though and sticks to the soap dish but its a natural occurance.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I bought this to try out with a friend of mine after purchasing an ABS bar at Walmart. Looks bigger in the picture than it does in reality, it does have a funky smell. I will update my review once I&#x27;ve tried it for a month.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son to use on his Baby&#x27;s skin. I don&#x27;t have any thin more I can say.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had heard it does wonders for acne and because I was breastfeeding I wasn&#x27;t able to take any medication to help clear my skin up.  The soap arrives in a huge block, which I cut into smaller pieces and placed the rest in a ziplock bag.  It leaves your skin squeaky clean as long as you make sure to wash it all off correctly.  It&#x27;s pretty intense stuff and I think it&#x27;s helped a little bit with the acne, but not a significant amount.  I ended up going to my doctor and was prescribed a topical cream to help which has done wonders.  I still use this (only on my face) but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is original</li>
    <li> My face has become so clear. I love this.</li>
    <li> One of the only products that work for my oily acne prone skin. Leaves my fast tight, dry and smoothe. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Love the soap use it for face and body seen improvement in a week of time</li>
    <li> Dried my skin out! Choose a different brand! There is another brand that is much better than this one. I wouldnt reccommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> works great and lathers very well.... but i think it gets used up pretty quickly and you have to be kind of careful because there are some hard particles in the soap that scratch me up if i&#x27;m not careful... besides that i like it! and will buy again i suppose!</li>
    <li> I received the soap today, and I wasn&#x27;t necessarily skeptical but I did want to know if this soap was as amazing as everyone claimed.... well as you can see it got 5 stars! This soap works! It literally shrunk the bumps I had on my forehead and shrunk the little pimples that I had around my cheek and mouth area! Most of them are even gone!! I was stunned! Make sure you moisturize after washing your face and or body with the soap; it can be drying; I applied Nutiva cold pressed organic coconut oil to my face and my skin sucked the oil right in! Put your skepticism to rest this stuff WORKS!</li>
    <li> it is good but not the best.</li>
    <li> This item is for real, it really works. Needed something natural for my face and this item is the answer. I Love it.</li>
    <li> I am really into skincare and I have tried lots of products, and this product is really good, I have recommended this to several people and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s gentle, non scented, and works great. While it comes in pieces, it makes no difference to me as it still works. A pound is a lot of soap. I had some issues in trying to find out if it was organic, and the supplier was very persistent in insisting that it was. While it is not USDA certified, the supplier claims it is Ghana certified organic. Research shows that Africa is very pro-organic, so i&#x27;m taking their word for it. There is a huge difference between natural soap made with water and ashes (potassium hydroxide) and commercial soap made with lye (sodium hydroxide) and i assume there is a big difference this makes on our skin. African Black Soap is make with water and ash, natural potassium hydroxide, with various oils added. Five stars for the soap, the distributor, and the makers of this African Black Soap! Your skin is the biggest organ of your body. So what you put on it is absorbed into it. My guess is what shows up on your skin really starts internally and this soap is  nourishing your whole body.</li>
    <li> It a good product , keep this product on the site it removed all my spots I love it !!</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;raw African black soap&amp;#34; from another seller (Halal I think) and something was wrong, it looked like mold, but could have been shea butter. Anyway, this seller has the real deal. I love this soap. Keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll likely find bits &amp; pieces of natural debris that can be strained out, so don&#x27;t expect to get processed soap.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how large the bar of soap was.  I cut off a small portion at a time to use and it lathers up very nicely.  My skin feels great after using the soap.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the soap is all natural and the price is fair. We cut it into 5 pieces of soap. The soap, which is very soft at first, hardens to become more like conventional soap. But...1) It smells like clay. This is not terrible nor is is terribly appealing. 2) It leaves dark residue on your soap dish or shower shelf. 3) It&#x27;s somewhat drying. All in all, if you want an all-natural soap, this is one way to go.</li>
    <li> I have read and researched so many natural products that have so many great health claims; most of them fail to meet the mark. Reading the reviews i was skeptical but for the price... what the hell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered with blackhead on my nose for more years than i care to remember. Keeping that area of my face clear of sebum buildup has been a near impossible task. Within 3 weeks of using this product I no longer have the issues I once had (like it has literally cleared up) and now I&#x27;m a believer. It&#x27;s a great soap for face, body and hair (though use a conditioner from time to time as it can be drying). I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s done anything for my acne scars at this time but it&#x27;s early days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the wrapping (basically cling film); break the bar into 3 manageable pieces and use like ordinary soap. The first week of using it felt a little tingly on the face but apparently that&#x27;s just the skin getting used to it. Don&#x27;t leave it standing in water either as it will be a mess. As it&#x27;s naturally made in basic production conditions, i did get a fruit stone in mine, but really - natural is what natural is, right? It&#x27;s a great product and i&#x27;m going to re-order for sure</li>
    <li> Helped clear up my uneven patchy skin. It starts to burn if you leave it on too long. I usually wash up with my regular soap then apply this and leave on for 2-3 mins. This is very very drying so apply a moisturizing lotion afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for anyone that suffers from acne, the occasional breakout or oily skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer, more clear (complexion) and I have less breakouts since I started using this soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is some magical cure all soap.  What I do know is I rub it a few times on a plastic poofs and it lathers up like crazy.  Very impressive given the hard water we have.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that smells good,  this isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s made from ashes,  and it smells like ashes.  The good side is that it&#x27;s not very strong and the smell doesn&#x27;t stick to you.  Also it is very scratchy if used directly on your skin.  it came in very soft chunks,  I could actually break it apart and remold it.  I let it sit for about three weeks and it dried out and solidifed.</li>
    <li> my only complaint about this soap. You leave the soap wet and it continuously dissolves even way after you finish your shower</li>
    <li> It made my skin dry, so I gave it to my daughter&#x27;s boyfriend who loves black soap. Not a waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over a month and I think this soap has helped to reduce my redness and scaring due to popping pimples.  It has not prevented pimples, because I&#x27;m definitely still getting a few.  BUT it does make my face feel really clean, so much so that when I tried using my old face wash my face felt dirty after.&lt;br /&gt;I cut a small piece off the block with a knife and keep it in a soap dish in the shower.  It disintegrates easily so don&#x27;t let it rest in water.</li>
    <li> I made some shampoo with this soap and I love the way it cleans my hair and scalp. I also love its fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I not 100% on this soap.  I use black see mud for a facial soap to take off my make up and thought this may do the same but I was getting more problems than I wanted on my face.  I now use just for hands and bath. No problem there.</li>
    <li> Something in this soap actually scraped me deep enough to draw blood!  SCARY!!!!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my daughter&#x27;s skin. She has ezcema &amp; this helped smooth her skin &amp; she has fewer outbreaks.</li>
    <li> Great soap!! I can definitely tell when I haven&#x27;t used it for awhile. It keeps my pores cleaned out and my skin so soft. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a regular sized bar of this at a soap boutique and paid $6 for it.  This came in and you just cut off as much as you want and it is ready to be used like a bar of soap.  It is a big chunk of soap.  It is very soft soap so it can seem grainy, but wonderful for the skin.  Kids have eczema and this does not irritate it like other soaps.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this combined with Nivea and/or Eucerin hydrating lotions have certainly helped to even my skin tone. To ensure the product lasts longer grate the soap down with an old box grater and place soap shavings in a bowl, pour hot water in bowl to disolve soap and cover with a bowl cover or shower cap, let sit over night to fully melt, pour soap into empty hair activator bottles. This soap has an earthy (not strong) smell and can dry the skins so I add in oils like jojoba, olive oil, lavender oil, etc. and shake and use. This works great for me!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT GREAT SERVICE!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect. I love using this at night time instead of commercial cleansers. I will say it does dry out your skin so make sure to use moisturizer.  i bought the 16 oz and i am sure this is going to last me forever. A little goes a long way. It has an earthy smell to it and i would definatly repurchase once i run out. LOVE LOVE LOVE dont see how i went so long with out knowing of t his product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so i&#x27;ve been looking for something that would work well and not break me out. This product makes me feel squeaky clean after use. I like that. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it falls apart so easily but that&#x27;s not a big deal since the quality makes up for all that. I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s great but I can&#x27;t speak of any of the benefits yet as i&#x27;ve only been using it for a week! :-) So far so good though!</li>
    <li> Really like this product. I have very dry skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry. I still use a night cream to help with the dry skin, but I can honestly say - this is the best face soap I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love it, What can I say?, will never go back to unnatural soaps, Unclogs my pores and leaves my face feeling soft. Will be purchasing again in the future</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I like to use natural soaps and am a big Dr. Bonner fan. I like this soap because it&#x27;s rugged and it makes me feel clean but also a bit moisturized and I know I&#x27;m not getting a bunch of freaky chemicals with this. I use it with a lufa to avoid the tree bark, but sometimes I like it rough and I&#x27;ll go strait bar to body. I like to use it with a bit of baking soda too for my face. It is also a bit cheaper than Dr. Bonners. The one downfall. Don&#x27;t use it as your hand soap for the sink only because it resembles poop (hey, everybody poops) and will leave a brown, kinda gross looking trail where ever it goes (including your shower). I obviously don&#x27;t care because I know it&#x27;s just soap but houseguests get creeped... I try to just break off little pieces at a time to avoid a huge wad o melting poo parade in my shower;) But, still love it!</li>
    <li> I normally get this from the beauty supply store but it was cheaper on here so wanted to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did. I cut Mines into small pieces and turn it into liquid soap. The smell of this alone let&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s the good quality my face and body has never been happier.</li>
    <li> i love it the changes in my skin aren&#x27;t happening fast but it is getting there.African Black soap does what it says</li>
    <li> I do not know what is in this soap but it is not jiving with my skin. It was the strangest thing. When I first used it my skin tingled. I had to wash my face quickly and thoroughly because when the soap sup got into my eyes, it BURNED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 after wash: Moisturized with Palmers coca butter (that i&#x27;ve been using for 5+ years mind you). My face burned like no other&lt;br /&gt;Day 2 after wash: moisturized with shea butter that I bought at a whole foods market (aka no chemicals)--&gt; much less burning pain. I thought maybe there was something in the Palmers but I had my doubts.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 after wash: Moisturized with shea butter and then put on foundation. My face BURNED worse than on day 1.  It felt as though I scrubbed my face with a brillo pad and poured bleach on it. I immediately removed the foundation and put vaseline onto my skin. It took about 8 hours to be able to use a cloth on my face without feeling pain. I asked a friend about this burning sensation and her response was \\&quot;it isn&#x27;t supposed to burn!!\\&quot;. Not that I needed her to tell me that but it was a confirmation that i&#x27;m not crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (12/20/13): I have been using another brand of black soap and I am quite happy. My face tingles, but it does so as much as Noxzema or Clearasil tingles.  After some thought i&#x27;m starting to wonder if the Raw African Black Soap is too unrefined for my skin. Regardless, a natural product shouldn&#x27;t have that effect.</li>
    <li> This soap is not meant for people with sensitive skin. It actually made my skin break out, change texture, and get all kinds of weird. I stick with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Baby Mild soap, with much better results.</li>
    <li> It must have been the dozens of online articles I&#x27;ve read which repeatedly claim African Black Soap (raw, nevertheless) to be the ultimate solution when facing a variety of skin-related issues (problematic, acneic skin especially), that enticed me. As I was confirming my purchase, I was so optimistic and hopeful, it was as if my endless research, disappointment, and trial and error had ceased. To finally come across a product hundreds of people have attested to having wonderful experiences with in eliminating their acne (both facial and bodily), acne scarring, and overall hyper-pigmentation had me bouncing off walls. Upon sectioning off a portion (this soap is delivered by bulk, in a square block) and using this product without a moment&#x27;s haste, my expectations fell dramatically I hate to say. Unless you&#x27;re not frequently accustomed to bathing with raw, wild-crafted, unfiltered soaps, please reconsider purchasing this raw African Black Soap in particular. Odor-wise, this soap smells of pure earth and nothing but: borderline dirt. If that were off-putting enough, the discovery of grainy pebbles (which gave me small lacerations everywhere on my body) and hair-like threads embedded in this soap was the unfortunate deal breaker. The maximum amount of time I&#x27;ve given this soap to live up to its legacy was two weeks. Yes, it did leave my body incredibly clean (with minimal after-dryness) and it seemed to diminish the acne I&#x27;ve had on my shoulders and back, but the smell and what was within the soap itself convinced me to discontinue any further use.</li>
    <li> Love,  love, love. Not the best looking soap but works fantastical on cleaning my skin and lightening the hyper pigmentation that my pimples left behind (noticed it in about a week)! Has a fresh  smell.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34; has sand and other foreign items in it which become exposed after prolonged use. This is absolutely not safe. Some reviewers have stated the same experience. I will not purchase this again. I would like a refund as I did not receive what was advertised.</li>
    <li> I used this today and it was pretty good. Very drying and mines didn&#x27;t come well packaged. When it arrived it wasn&#x27;t in the nice block form like in the picture. It was all crumpled up and broken but I can still use it so no biggie.</li>
    <li> We used  this soap when I was back in Africa. So when I  found it on Amazon l was very happy.My husband  doesn&#x27;t use  any other soap.It cleans very well. I gave a piece to a friend whose husband was having an itching problem and it worked for him.I will recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This soap, idk. I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference in my skin. I bought this really for my closed comedomes (whiteheads), my very oily skin and the little to moderate acne that I have. Didn&#x27;t really clear up or help with anything except for leaving your skin squeaky clean. The first time I used this, it literally burned my face and continues to at times. I guess this product is to harsh. Won&#x27;t buy again! Save your money, seriously.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. I use it on my skin and hair. The price is better than local stores and the Amazon Prime shipping saves me the trip across town.</li>
    <li> I have already cut off chunks and shared it with friends.  It does give a bit of a sting the first few times but the results are worth any sting (and it doesnt compare to the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; of a chemical peel).  Just buy it and you will be in love just like me.</li>
    <li> I will definitely order some more as soon as I run out! I really love this soap and its a true bargain.</li>
    <li> Talk about the best soap ever! will nerver go back to these fancy cosmetic cleanses.&lt;br /&gt;Suprised and african and i dint know about this wonderful soap!!</li>
    <li> This soap is a beauty treatment on it&#x27;s own! Hair and skin are both rejuvenated by this product! It leaves the body clean without any dryness!</li>
    <li> Awesome to all that I purchases except the corset!!!!! I enjoyed my movies very much and I&#x27;m gonna buy more movies</li>
    <li> Supply will last. You will see results for a clearer complexion within a week of use. For excellent results, pair with Eco Tools Exfoliating Gloves. ;) you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to receive bars or a bar of Black Soap as depicted in the advertising picture that you look at...think again. What I received was a plastic container, like the one you receive from a deli for you antipasto salad, filled with soap crumbs!!!!! Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with what this company did. I didn&#x27;t even receive 1lb 16oz of soap!! I&#x27;d really like to know what this co expects me to do with this!!! Pitiful.....</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and quick two day shipment.  Also the soap was exactly same as the picture. I love it because the soap is very gentle after I wash my face and I didn&#x27;t feel tight or uncomfortable, instead I feel clean and feel soft of my skin. I use it to wash my face and body, and the bubbles are very delicate, so that can get in your skin deeply to clean the dirt. I can immediately see my pores smaller after washing with the soap. I ordered 4, so I am gonna give 2 to my Sister because she has very sensitive skin than me, I believe she will loves it, and I heard the soap can minimize the color of  stretch marks, so that&#x27;s one of reason to try it out.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!!! Use twice a day and my face is clear, clean and healthy. It is earthy but that is what I want and expected. I used to use expensive acne multi step systems and would just be left oily, broken out and discouraged. Heard about the wonders of this soap and tried it. Sooo happy I did!!! It is amazing! I no longer have long bedtime or morning routines to clean my face. It&#x27;s cheap enough to try it out and see. I hope it works as well for yourdas it has me. I&#x27;m in my late 30s and wish I would have known about this soap decades ago!</li>
    <li> i just love the black soap helps with acne dark spots and it clear your skin up great  will buy again</li>
    <li> A very good product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Don&#x27;t be afraid of how it looks or feels. I use it mostly on my face but is fine with other parts of your body. I have oily skin. I&#x27;m a 60 year old white female and had heard about this soap.  Went ahead and ordered two different times. Leaves my skin smooth but not dry. Seems to have so sort of healing properties but not sure how. Worked well on blemishes too. Would recommend to give it a try.  Does fall apart easily and I cut small pieces from the larger bar which I leave in soap dish and use a loofah  great product!</li>
    <li> I love this african soap. It is going to last me a very long time. The bar is huge! I broke off a section to use when washing my face and the rest is stored. It truly leaves your face squeaky clean. It removes skin oil, lotions and makeup without drying out your skin. I like that the soap looks rugged and natural. I have used it in the shower as well. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!!!</li>
    <li> I have encountered brief of what some have been saying in terms of finding strands of hair in the soap but not something that bothers me too much. What i love about this soap is unlike unscented soaps sold on the market, they are filled with chemicals even though they are unscented. This too is unscented because its naturally put together but minus the chemicals and it does better for my skin then you average over the counter product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am personally using this for acne scars only been a few days of using it so I have not seen any significant difference in appearance as of yet but I am going to keep with it and will order again in the future if it does anything suitable for my scars. But highly recommend for those who have major sensitive skin and do not like the over the counter soap bars.</li>
    <li> I love it!! It really cleans your skin, but it&#x27;s drying so make sure you have a good moisturizer ready to go!  I bought this to take on deployment with me, and it&#x27;s been amazing, no complaints from me!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I shared it, used it, and it&#x27;s time to buy some more. it did not Strip my skin like most soaps, has a nice mild aroma, and is just great!</li>
    <li> lathers well, feels great on my skin, brighter, firmer, and slowly helping diminish marks on my legs.  all for a great price. Plus I live in the Virgin Islands and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this soap is suppose to burn on your skin, but it did the first time I used it.  It does leave your skin very soft and clean though.  It smells good too.</li>
    <li> This is very nice product.  I use it as an overall body cleanser. It leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> The worst product ever.</li>
    <li> This is great soap for sensitive skin. It clears up acne and bacterial skin infections when used in conjunction with essential oils such as lavender, frankincense,tea tree.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all, it did not meet any of the requirements that it claimed. The performance was very poor and it was just wasted money as far as I am concerned!</li>
    <li> Full of black hairs. Not sure what happened here, but I promptly returned the item never to buy again. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I like this soap alot but I feel like I may need to buy some more soon I swear it goes so quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if there have been any changes in my skin but i&#x27;ve only used it for like a month and my skin was just fine before I started using it. Whatever the case maybe I like it because it&#x27;s different and doesnt smell like most american soaps where you mine as well have poured a bottle of perfume and bathed in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past few weeks and am absolutely amazed. I wash the the black soap and moisturize with raw shea butter after. I have literally been watching some gruesome surgery scars fade away before my eyes. It works amazing for my face and body. Too cool!</li>
    <li> My friend used this soap on what his doctor stated was ringworm. After trying medicated ointment failed, I ordered this soap and he immediately started seeing good results.</li>
    <li> Simple soap, works well on my whole body.  Lathers really well.  Just don&#x27;t leave it soaking wet or it will disappear!!</li>
    <li> My face is so clear because of this. I am in love. I made body wash, shampoo and face wash out of this. a little definitely goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this black soap. It smells like black soap but I can&#x27;t help but wonder what&#x27;s in it. I say this because this particular black soap left a rash on the back of my neck and irritated my skin. I&#x27;ve used other types of genuine black soap and never had this problem.</li>
    <li> I hated the way it felt on my skin. I prefer using Shea Moisture&#x27;s black soap.</li>
    <li> I like it but its no miracle thing.</li>
    <li> Onevof the best soaps i have used so far.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it because my skin is extremely sensitive and unnatural soaps are awful for me. I also use it on my natural 4c hair in place of shampoo. It&#x27;s gentle and has improved my skin and hair! The only thing is that when you break it down in water, there is a it of debris, for lack of a better term. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, as it washes away very well, but if this is an issue for others, perhaps running it through a cheese cloth would be a good solution.</li>
    <li> Gross gross gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bone looking disgusting object was piercing out the side of this soap and extended through the soap.  I didn&#x27;t notice immediately.  I cut the soap to use it when a piece fell out and hit the floor.  I nearly passed out because it really looked like a fossil !  I sent it back immediately and got a refund.  #EWW #ThingsThatMakeYouVomit</li>
    <li> I love this soap I feel clean when I use it and love that it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals I&#x27;m 58 years old (female) and this is the only thing I use to clean my face (along with a sonic brush that I use every other day) along with Hemp lotion my skin feels fantastic. My daughter was having a horrible time with breakouts on her face and back since she finally agreed to try this (after repeated suggestions from me) her breakouts have cleared up almost completely only time she has a problem is when she eats too much junk or forgets to wash her face before going to bed...have bought this soap repeatedly and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with the little acne that I get and washing makeup off my face. When it comes to acne, I feel like it didn&#x27;t make anything worse or better. But when it came to washing makeup off, it took off most, if not all, my makeup in one wash. I also used the soap to wash my body. My boyfriend loved taking showers with this stuff. But I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it. The biggest warning I have for females, and after some extensive research. This soap contains so many different oils that it can mess with your Ph balance. And with that being said, I would be careful on some areas that get washed. I&#x27;m still not 100% about this soap. I feel like it works well with some people and not so well with others. It all depends on your skin type and needs.</li>
    <li> Real nice upgrade after 30 years of Irish Spring hahaha. The soap lathers up right away and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. Just like any other soap, now it makes good foaming.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was a bit concerned that this Product was going to be over rated. I&#x27;m a makeup artist for a luxury line and have high expectations for skin care...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I was pleasantly surprised. Of course it&#x27;s course and has a few grainy pieces but it&#x27;s all natural, I mean really.. What did u expect? The soap came in a plastic bag that was wrapped in cellophane and another bag. It was actually still very soft, think about the texture of clay when Ild cut it from a block in art class. The soap itself had a nice earthy texture. I broke of a tiny pea sized piece and lathered it. I was surprised by how nice the lather was and that there was no grains to it once it was lathered. I used that all over my face and used my clarosonic. It was crazy how much makeup kept coming off! After rinsing my face and patting it dry my skin felt extremely smooth and soft. Not tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in lovvvveeeeeeee. I will def be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked magic in clearning up my skin - I however found something that works better from Paula&#x27;s Choice.  Make sure to moisturize with this - and if you get it up your nose IT WILL BURN.  lol</li>
    <li> Great! Healthy for the skin. I am so glad that my cousin told me about it. It last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like the soap.  It rinses so clean.  I use it on my body and as a shampoo for my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! Washed my face twice with it and what a difference! My husband used it amd said its the best hes used so far</li>
    <li> this soap really dried out my skin and gave me acne.&lt;br /&gt; I really wanted it to work, but I did not like the way it made my skin feel - stripped of natural oils.  Some people said they used it for shampoo, but that did not work either.</li>
    <li> Really improved my skin, reduced my acne and I have a glow! Skin is smoother and I require less lotion even as the weather gets colder. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We use nothing else but this product.&lt;br /&gt;Smeels fresh and clean. Also lightens age spots and helps shrink skin tags. I highly recommend this soap/ You wont regret it I promise. Thanks again amazon for making available such an amazeing product. Sincerely Louise</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very strong compared to the Dudu-Osun.  I had an open cut on my hand when I first got it and it burned like hell when this got in it.  The Dudu-Osun didn&#x27;t do that.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing mind you.  Just sayin.  This version of black soap is probably better if you have some really serious skin problems.  For plain old vanilla white boys like myself who like this stuff just cause its kind of cool to use then the Dudu-Osun is probably more your thang.  At least it is for me.  This one also turns to mush pretty quickly unless you REALLY take care of it......which I thought I was doing.  All that said this is the real deal for sure.  Its ok but I think I prefer the Dudu-Osun.</li>
    <li> before ordering the black soap, i read the reviews on it. there are a mixture of good and bad reviews of the soap. i have sensitive and very dry skin, so i needed soap that wasn&#x27;t going to make my skin feel like it was cracking into a thousand pieces. once i used the soap, my skin felt clean and not overly dry. a couple of bad reviews said that the soap was drying, so after using the soap i always follow up with a face moisturizer( i use Olay Moisturizing Lotion Sensitive Skin)and skin moisturizer( Shea butter mixed with extra virgin olive oil and extra virgin coconut oil). African black soap is still soap, it doesn&#x27;t suppose to moisturize the skin, it suppose to clean it, that is why you should still follow up with a moisturizer after using it. some reviews said that the soap left scratches in their skin, so what i do is take the soap and rub it in my hands( for face) or on a bath cloth(to clean body) and use it like that.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, I wish I could use it (Allergy to coconut oil) but it is amazing. it smells odd at first, but once you&#x27;re washed and rinsed you just smell clean.</li>
    <li> I am sure this soap is great for some people and some skin conditions. It is just way too harsh and drying for my skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is moisturizing and nurturing to my skin. Will Purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> At first I liked this soap but then It started to break my face out. My first batch I didn&#x27;t break out, but this second batch my face has broken out. So I stopped using it on my face but I still wash up with it. I also found that it dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my body to go organic and remove old scars and have it soft and smooth and also pair this with the soft shea butter. I was surprised one day bc i stopped using my acne products bc my face was feeling sensitive so I used the black soap instead, the morning I woke up and my face looked awesome, Now I use the black soap also as a facial soap and the dark spots are slowly fading and my acne is slowly improving.</li>
    <li> Really good soap, helps my face stay clear</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a great soap! It feels great against my skin, doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much, and leaves my skin feeling really nice. I used to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but it&#x27;s a pretty powerful soap: I would get pretty dry skin for the hour or so after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across black soap when living in the desert for a bit and wanting a soap that wouldn&#x27;t completely dry me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shows up in a bag and has the consistency of not-very-soft Play-Doh. You can basically tear a chunk off the size of a golfball, and go to town cleaning yourself. The 1lb bag will probably last me a couple of months. Terrific product, and as a bonus it&#x27;s nice to know that (at least some) of my money is going to Africa for making a great product.</li>
    <li> This worked wonderfully! I got my order on time. The quality was great. I would most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it...it makes my skin soft and even toned</li>
    <li> This soap makes my eyes and face burn when I use it. Apparently my skin is more sensitive than I realized. I&#x27;m reserving it for handwashing soapdishes only. It has a faint smell and does not lather up like my shea butter African soap.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Leaves my skin feeling so good.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed with this soap. It leaves a film on my skin...would not buy again.</li>
    <li> You really can&#x27;t do better when it comes to lather than African black soap.  I would use this in concert with 2 or 3 other soaps - you&#x27;ll need something with anti-bacterial properties at some point because this won&#x27;t do it.  But you cannot beat this product for moisturization and the thick, rich lather.  Can also be used as shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my first African Black soap. I had read so many positive reviews. It&#x27;s not black, but brown (which is neither here nor there) and does not look like you want to wash with it.  Anyway... It arrived promptly and was easy to separate into my own bars because it does arrive in a 1 pound block. Now. I will tell you that I bought the Dudu-Osun soap at the same time for comparison and this is how I reference my likes &amp; dislikes. This Raw bar of soap is priced right until you use it. I was able to cut mine into 4 decent bars. The smell could make you raise a brow. (kinda smells like old dirt...The Dudu-Osun smells much better) but given the ingredients, I figured that was what I was smelling. So after cutting four bars to use in the shower, I was shocked at how fast they melted in the shower...I&#x27;m on day 5 of using a bar and it&#x27;s almost gone. Even the Dudu-Osun bar lasted longer. When you are washing it&#x27;s looks like dirt  is coming off your skin(water will never run &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; and my younger son saw on my soap dish and commented that it look like a piece of poo. LOL But it got me thinking...was I bamboozeled into buying someone else&#x27;s waxy dirt? I also have not seen any changes in my skin to attest to the claims that this is a good soap to use to heal things like dry skin and eczema. If you want to try black soap, do order a couple to figure out what you like. I will not be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this product and the 1st batch was WONDERFUL, better than I expected.  The 2nd batch however, was all broken up and poorly shaped.  I&#x27;m actually pretty scared to use it :-/</li>
    <li> I love this soap, it make my skin feels nice &amp; clean &amp; not dry. I also wash my hair with it &amp; leaves it squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Great for body acne and rashes and other bacterially-generated skin issues. My skin has healed using this soap and olive oil with tea tree oil as a moisturizer. Together these two will clear your skin so fast and have you touching and rubbing your skin in amazement all day! Love it. Black soap alone can do the job of removing the bacteria. The olive oil and tea tree mix heals the scars and prevents new ones from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to liquefy the soap to make it last longer and add my own scents to it. I use a cheese grater and grate about 1/4 of the block of soap and then I put the grated soap in a large bowl and cover with 1 cup of distilled water. If I want it thicker I add more soap...thinner add more water. Let the soap dissolve for a few hours and test out the consistency. The powerful properties remain intake either way. I add tea tree oil, eucalyptus, and grapefruit oils. Just my little blend. I plan to try using rose absolute oil but it cost so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you&#x27;ll see results quickly. Good luck and enjoy!!</li>
    <li> The soap is not package the way it is being advertised in the picture it actually comes in a tall jar and in grainy pieces so u actually have to squeeze them together to use it to form a kind of bar</li>
    <li> I had to write a review on this because I had such high hopes for it and I thought I had done my research on this stuff beforehand but I&#x27;ve learned things first hand about using this soap and its effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First most, I am certain that Amazon and the seller did their part on selling me and shipping me 100% pure African black soap, it came packaged in plastic in one giant chunk, and two smaller chunks. It is raw, so it means it is completely unprocessed, so that means there is still going to be sediment in it from the process it takes to make this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sediment, some people on here think it&#x27;s hair and get freaked out, but i think it&#x27;s ash or fibres from the plantain skins. They are extremely rough and have left me with scratches all over my body. I didn&#x27;t believe it could actually leave scratches despite feeling that the soap was rough ,I thought my partner has just been extra rough during frickle frackle so it didn&#x27;t bother but then i attributed it to the soap when i found circular scratches on my buttocks that look more like a satanic symbol that it does look like love scratches. That&#x27;s when I knew I knew it was the black soap- I had a flash memory of  rubbing the soap in circular motions on my buttocks with reckless abandon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my face at first, which was my original intention. I heard so many raves about it being really great for the skin (I have sensitive, oily, highly acne-prone skin with P.I.H.) and leaving peoples skin soft like butter and potentially being good for diminishing hyper pigmentation due to it&#x27;s shea butter content. I was hearing about it everywhere- even when I didn&#x27;t want to. In the most unexpected of places too, I was watching some speech at some event Obama had at the white house on youtube and this person was talking about African black soap.  I stopped using it on my face when I found out ABS is extremely alkaline/basic. It has a P.H of 10+. higher than that of Dove Soap. So essentially, ABS is worse than Dove Soap (On the same P.H level as Baking Soda, which is a big no-no for use on the skin_, and Dove Soap irks the living jeebus out of my body skin, let alone my facial skin. The reason why P.H is important because in order for your skin to carry out its functions and be healthy (including the acid mantle/ moisture barrier) it has to maintain it&#x27;s natural, acidic, P.H of around 4. It&#x27;s advise you don&#x27;t use a cleanser on your skin that has a P.H higher of 6, and then tone afterwards with a toner with a lower P.H to balance the P.H of skin. Also when I used this soap on my face, I didn&#x27;t apply it directly because I knew it would scratch up my skin (IDK why i thought my body skin wouldn&#x27;t get scratched up) so I would lather it up in my hand and then wash my face with the lather I had created. This soap has a good lather, but what else would you expect with something with such a high P.H&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it on my hair once and although it provided a good lather on my head, my hair got gummy, dry, and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I&#x27;m going to stop using it on my body (I have already since stopped using it on my face) as I feel it&#x27;s my exacerbating my body acne (It&#x27;s at its worse at this point) and dries out my skin. I would rather not have a bunch of tiny, even big scratches all over my skin. I&#x27;m thinking of liquefying it and just using it to wash my hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap also can get really messy and soft easily, If you leave it in moisture/water too long it gets for a gooey, putty like consistency and you end up washing away most of the soap. You have to use it in small chunks at a time and it keep it in a dry container to keep from wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell particular of anything, just a naturally, earthy scent as others describe it. I&#x27;m actually a huge fan of scents like this but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to like the scent of this stuff. It&#x27;s nothing too strong that would irritate people sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone seeing how alkaline it is, unless you are a bar of soap I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you wash your body with this</li>
    <li> Bought some for me and my daughter.  We love this product.  It does melt quickly so have somewhere to store the pieces you are using.  We cut off a piece and use it.  My daughter loves the way the soap makes her whole body feel when done with her shower.  It is a little drying for me so I use it and then use the Coconut&amp;Papaya soap to finish.</li>
    <li> Purchased five months ago for our long-term severe eczema suffering daughter as yet another hopeful &amp;#34;magic bullet&amp;#34; to help with her condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap arrived in a solid block that was easily cut into brownie-sized pieces with a butter knife. We keep the &amp;#34;brownies&amp;#34; in a jar, breaking off a smaller piece when we need more soap.The soap has a very faint and pleasant nutty smell to it. The soap lathers well and we are certain to keep it out of the water when not lathering it to prevent it simply running down the drain as other reviewers have mentioned. At this point, with daily use, we still have about half the soap remaining, so simply based on that it has been a tremendous value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So did it help with her eczema? Yes. From the first time we used it we could tell the soap was much milder than the sensitive skin cleanser we were using and even improved her skin - today only very mild traces of eczema remain. Unfortunately, at least for the purposes of determining how much the soap helped, we made a number of other changes in the ensuing weeks (not the least of which was stopping topical steroids - see ITSAN), so we cannot be certain how much the soap helped overall - we know it helped, just not how much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end we give the soap five stars for its tremendous value and because it helped our daughter with her eczema.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about a year and have noticed a significant reduction on my facial scarring. Its also given me a much more even complexion. All natural ingredients and for a great price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it would be.  Just use a knife and cut off a piece at a time.  Great for skin issues.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after a stunning review on a beauty blog, and it has met all of my expectations. The product arrived in two 16 oz blocks securely wrapped in plastic wrap and a ziploc bag. Upon opening I first noticed the very organic, earthy smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Using a chef&#x27;s knife, I portioned the blocks into individual bars and re-wrapped each separately in plastic wrap. I definitely have enough soap to last for months. The bars are very soft and lather super well. In the morning and evening I simply wet my face and hands, rub the soap for lather(don&#x27;t run it under water like regular soap), wash, rinse, dry my face, dry off the soap and place it back in the plastic wrap, moisturize and go on with my day. My skin feels clean and fresh, and thus far I am very happy with Raw African Black Soap. I also plan to liquify one of the bars and make a shower gel. There are many videos online if you&#x27;re interested in doing the same. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Long lasting and has helped so much with my acne</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome soap. Only thing that has helped me with my acne. I have used it for just 4 days and it already has helped subside the inflammation. Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Came fast, it&#x27;s huge so it will last for a good while.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, peeling patches on my face, and inflamed pimples on face and back, after the 3rd day of using it (day and night on face) dryness and peeling significantly decreased, and pimples are less inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier.</li>
    <li> Good deal and easy to use. I like making my own size of soap. Very good soap for any type of skin.</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to use it on my daughter with eczema, but the newly opened soap had mold on it. Very disappointed and grossed out. I will never order from the venue at all again. I would have bared up with how gross the soap naturally looks, but the mold turned my mind completely from these types of homemade looking products.</li>
    <li> I have been using black soap for about 2 years, this soap is the best,!!!! Listen I have tried everything, and black soap is by far the best, my skin feels amazing,my family and friends see the difference, and now are using black soap, I buy ,by the pound and it lasts forever, lol</li>
    <li> Odering again because it feels so great.  A little goes a LONG way and works well on body and face (I have oily skin).  Skin feels squeaky clean afterwards and absorbs all my nutritious serums and oils.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done the job....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a severe case of adult - cystic acne for the past 3 years, ever since I stopped taking birth control. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun from spending hundreds of dollars on facials, to skin vitamins from GNC, and every type of over the counter acne treatment you can imagine. I finally went to a dermatologist who prescribed me an oral antibiotic, Retin A, and another topical treatment. Using all of these things did clear my acne, but I was not happy. I am not a fan of taking medicine, and I don&#x27;t like using chemicals on my body. Still, I felt like a slave to the medicine because as soon as a skipped a day, a break out would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a YouTube video about African Black Soap, and I looked it up on Amazon. I saw all of the great reviews AND the price, and purchased a bar without hesitation. Let me tell you...this soap is AMAZING!! I had a previous breakout when I started using the soap and it cleared it up within a few days - I have not had a breakout since!! I have been using this soap for 6 weeks now and after the first 4 weeks, I started getting compliments about how &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; my skin looks. You don&#x27;t know how awesome that is to hear after dealing with the nightmare of cystic acne for the past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after the 4 week mark with now breakouts, I decided to stop using my acne medication...now this was the real test. I was nervous, because as I said, usually after skipping just one day of any of the 3 medicines that I had to use, I would get a breakout. Well.....2 weeks later still NO BREAKOUTS!! Just soft, glowing skin!! I am so thankful that I found this soap. I really wish that I would have found it 3 years ago, but now that it&#x27;s here, I refuse to use ANYTHING else as a cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See below for my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with African Black Soap every morning and night; after cleansing, I apply moisturizer and sunscreen in the morning, and just moisturizer at night; I gently exfoliate every 4 days - you can also use this soap to exfoliate by adding sugar to the lather. Buy it, and enjoy!!ys - you can also use this soap to exfoliate by adding sugar to the lather. Buy it, and enjoy!!</li>
    <li> My family has been using black soap for years now. I use it on my face, and my husband says it is one of the best products for helping his face from breaking out after shaving. We have been trying to use more natural products, so I decided to try this raw black soap over the processed kind we normally use. I can say that I would purchase this again. it is a nice quality and quantity.</li>
    <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t be too eager to display this soap for guests, (its not exactly asthetically pleasing) I must say that it lathers better than anything. If left in a soapdish, it would certainly be a conversation piece.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was so much soap. i love it though. my skin looks and feels great. i even washed my hair with it. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn with this product. I do see the dark spots on my face getting lighter...but at the same time, my skin gets very oily after about an hour. I blot, and it&#x27;s back within the next hour. I have oily skin anyway, but it&#x27;s gone to a new level since I started using this.</li>
    <li> Not as pictured. It comes in broken chunks in a tub</li>
    <li> Not for Caucasian skin. I did not realize when I bought.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this soap. My grand daughter&#x27;s other grandma is from Ghana and used this soap to treat eczema. It took a 15yo to teach me about skin care. I follow the washing of my face and body with almond oil and my skin is glowing. I&#x27;m going to order more right now!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I use it for myself and my two daughters! Works great for skin hair and face wash. I love only needing to buy one product. Not drying and completely safe natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Love this ishhhhh. Wish I wouldve known about this a long time ago</li>
    <li> Great product not drying at all</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I use it on my face.. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but not bad either. Its so smooth and washes everything off at the end of the day. It leave my skin so clean is squeaks!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap/shampoo that worked on itchy flaky scalp.  This goes on permanent grocery list.</li>
    <li> This raw African black soap is great. I notice an extreme difference in my skin complexion after I use it..</li>
    <li> It is smaller in person than it looks in the picture but it lasts forever!!! Works great for clearing acne!</li>
    <li> cleans throughly, although it makes skin a little dry</li>
    <li> I love this soap, exactly the same thing I used in Africa where I spent over 10 years - I use black soap since 1985 and this one is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;For the newbies, raw means not processed, not filtered and no additives - you may find small rocks, ashes, charcoal bits and may be insects :) that&#x27;s the exact same soap you would buy at the Makola Market in Accra, may be cheaper there though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it traditional African soap? yes it is, is it natural soap? oh yes.</li>
    <li> It came in a plastic package. Must keep it in a covered container otherwise fungus and bacteria would start to grow on it if water sits on it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;m so glad it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent afterwards, cause I don&#x27;t like the smell of it in the shower. Couple this with some good organic moisturizer, and you&#x27;ll have great skin in no time. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because there appeared to be tiny rocks in the soap, which if you&#x27;re not careful will temporarily scratch you up a bit. Otherwise, great product! Will be buying again!!</li>
    <li> I like the soap and my son whom has acne likes it. The only complaint is that it is crumbles.</li>
    <li> It had sticks and other things I couldn&#x27;t describe in it and when I washed my face and body it left me with lots of tiny scratches. Ill wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy. It was my first time trying African black soap so maybe I just got a bad batch from a bad seller idk but im not trying it anymore from ANYONE! I have beautiful smooth chocolate skin and this mess almost ruined it. I wish I could rate it -0</li>
    <li> Product arrived just as promised &amp; on time.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I will always buy it</li>
    <li> This is the first thing that has started clearing up my skin BUT I advise that you mix it with shea butter as its very drying or get the black african soap shea butter bar</li>
    <li> Sort of rough and no certifications came with it. Just in a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> I use this to cleanse my face. You really only need a really tiny bit to get a lather going. Just a warning, this can be a bit drying and I really only use it after oil cleansing.</li>
    <li> A pound is a lot of soap. The unused bar became moldy after 2 months and we threw it away. We ordered the soap because we had good results with this type of soap before that was given to us by a friend. She couldn&#x27;t remember who she bought it from so we ordered from this company.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like crack for my skin. My skin loves this stuff especially my combination skin. (Some parts oily,  some parts dry,  some parts are whatever it wants to be that day). I was cautious about buying it online so I only ordered one pound but I will be ordering the five pound block next time.  It&#x27;s exactly that same black soap I buy from the flea market but cheaper.</li>
    <li> Soap is soft. Received as promised.</li>
    <li> This product really works for my sensitive skin.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!!!  My daughters use it for their faces and they love it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Like many wonderful things in life looks can be deceiving, this is most especially true with raw Ghana soap.  It is not visually appealing - but then you won&#x27;t be eating it so who cares.  It produces a wonderful lather that cleans and freshens the skin but leaves absolutely NO sticky skin cream-like residue as with Dove and other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it by rubbing gently directly on my skin, or use a wash cloth.  It is a wonderful exfolant (sp) as it contains small soft parts of the natural products in the &#x27;raw&#x27; soap.  I would not rub real hard - be aware.  Also, DO NOT let this &#x27;soap&#x27; set in a pool of water.  It will literally melt -  You Have Been Warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my choice of soap for years.  DO NOT BE FOOLED BY TARGET or other retail stores selling &#x27;Black African Soap&#x27;.  It is not and is in no way like the real thing.</li>
    <li> The black soap is amazing. My daughter had eczema in her back.  I bought the soap and she has been using it for 3 weeks and it cleared it up!</li>
    <li> The soap was perfect!  I cut a chunk off and placed it in a little container so it won&#x27;t get soaked and dissolve.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried this! I have had attrocious acne since I turned 19, now I am pregnant it got a lot worse. I am a bit of a natural health nut and don&#x27;t like to expose myself to many chemicals. This has been a great chemical free acne treatment. My skin has cleared up completely in only 10 days of use. I do find it a bit harsh as I do also have sensitive skin (you can see my dilema! sensitive but acne prone skin! ugh!) so I use organic virgin coconut oil- just a dab- to settle my skin after use. I should probably add I also use colloidal silver gel straight after washing and before the coconut oil. My skin is as clear as it was when I was a child! As an added benefit the two wrinkles I noticed on my forehead have noticably shrunk too! Very pleased with these three products and will be using them for long into the future!</li>
    <li> makes your skin feel so clean, does not have all the additives of regular soap. cleared up my son&#x27;s ringworm (gross I know but it worked!)</li>
    <li> I guess everything depends on your skin type. I read so many positive reviews I decided to order this for use on my face. It did not go well. It somehow both dried my skin and made me break out. I&#x27;m actually still in the process of trying to bring my skin back to normal. It&#x27;s almost there now, but it&#x27;s been a couple of months. Looking like a pizza-faced teenager as a professional adult is not very fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, but if your skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be responding well after the first week or two, I wouldn&#x27;t stick with this. Don&#x27;t be like me and have to spend a bunch of time and embarrassment because you were too stubborn to give up your new soap just because you have a whole pound of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this as hand soap from now on, I guess.</li>
    <li> This raw African black soap is wonderful to use to clear darker areas on face r any part of the body; u only need to use small quantities and perhaps use every other day or every two days because it has a tendency to dry skin if over used or if you already have normal to dry skin. Keep sealed when not in use; economical and a terrific product.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I am 41 started using Raw African soap a year ago. I never felt this clean in my life!!! This stuff is GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap but I have sensitive skin and it is causing bumps on my face. I have been using it on my face for a month. It cleared up the rash and dry spots on my face but it seemed to burn my face if I leave it on too long. After a month, small bumps surfaced on the side of my face.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this soap in my hair. It is wonderful. It cleared up my psoriasis on my scalp. I wash my hair once a week and I never have dandruff. I will continue to use this soap for a long time.</li>
    <li> We use this soap often.  It cleans all the impurities left by other soaps and shampoos.  Leaves your skin feeling really clean.</li>
    <li> First day my boyfriend loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Burned my skin. This is way too caustic!! I recommend testing on the inside of your elbow. If you ever need to exfoliate, use this as a chemical peel. I think I&#x27;m gonna sell it to friends.</li>
    <li> My skin is so oily I would literally have a new zip everyday until i used this soap. I have a friend who recommended it to me and i have never used another soap since. it works great for your face and body but make sure you moisturize because it will dry your skin out</li>
    <li> Best thing i ever did was to switch soaps.  Also, the other reviews about the soap having hairs in it, lol.  Don&#x27;t be stressed or scared, just look up what the soap is made out of.  It will all make sense to you afterwards.  Its all natural and its suppose to be that way.  Great buy.  There is enough here to last you 2 months or more.  So, the price it better than what i was paying for regular soap.  Get it!!!  i also, RECOMMEND using Baking Soda for Deodorant.  It will shock you how it stops the sweat!!!  Regular Deodorant has Aluminum in them.  So, we are poisoning ourselves slowly with these products!  Time to get smart and shop safe!  Switching to rolling your own tobacco is also, much more healthier than buying from big distributors.  I fine &amp;#34;Top&amp;#34; to be a good product in taste for menthol smokers.  Then there&#x27;s &amp;#34; American Spirits&amp;#34; which is organic!  after i switched from my regular brand, my breathing came back.  Seriously, Big, Big, Big frigging difference!!!</li>
    <li> it looks like excrement, literally. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Great product that was delivered quickly. Just as good or better than other raw black soaps that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It came super fast and in two pieces- I cudnt wait to wash my face! I&#x27;m an African American woman and the first time I used this I cud see a difference in my complextion. It was soft and smooth, wud def recommend. There was a tiny tingle, not so much a burn but it went away. I assumed its my skin gettin used to the soap. Oh and no hair in mine or pieces of wood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering my third bar. I don&#x27;t use anything else! My acne scars cleared up so well that I now forego make-up most days with confidence.  I break mine into two bars, and wrap the second and put it in a good container to keep it fresh until I need it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I dissolve it in water and use it in pump or squeeze bottles.  Moisturizers, such as vegetable glycerin can be adding for a moisturizing cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great soap lathers up like you wouldn&#x27;t imagine and you feel squeaky clean after you rinse. Also very mild so it won&#x27;t irritate your skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really soft and melts within a few minutes.  I have to keep mine in the freezer and just cut off what I need.  To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure this this just black soap.  It suds a lot more than the one I bought a few years ago and is a white lather.  My old one suds very little and the lather stayed brown.</li>
    <li> It did the job. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> The latest one I bought was pretty much awesome.  I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this soap I sliced it up in pieces which was very easy and it lathers up great. I have oily skin and every now and then have some acne but as long as I stay on it day and night I have it under control.i wash my face two to three times a day depending on if I go to the gym or not the smell is not bad it&#x27;s bearable so I&#x27;m waiting to see in about a month how this soap really holds up I also use raw organic shea butter at night for a moisturizer on my face which works really well also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ABS for a few years now and I&#x27;ve tried several different suppliers and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve bought. The one I used to buy from halal everyday used to leave my face super dry and skin feeling tight. I don&#x27;t get that with this ABS. I even use it on my son and it cleared up his eczema.</li>
    <li> My sister has used this in the past and so I searched on Amazon for a seller w/good reviews.  I received this very quickly and broke off a tiny chunk that I keep in the bathroom, as well as another piece I keep in a ziploc that I take to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in two ways: 1) every other day on my face in the evening, lathered with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser for a face wash, followed by CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. 2) at the gym on my back to prevent bacne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is serving its purpose well in both instances, and my sister is having great results as well!</li>
    <li> This should be called trash. Sent in bag and has no information about the product. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and I have acnes on my skin..  this soap wasn&#x27;t good for my skin at all .. I&#x27;ve wondering why its like this on me even though its raw !!</li>
    <li> They gave me a great size of the soap that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else and it&#x27;s good on my skin!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, its not harsh on your skin over drying. Would definitely buy again.  Customer for life!!</li>
    <li> Used for a month already. skin become more smooth.</li>
    <li> This soap makes my skin feel amazingly clean and does exfoliate. Be warned my skin is oily and it dries it out. If your skin is dry, I would use it every other day. If you have oily or dry skin you will need to moisturize after using it. It is still a great soap and I love it.</li>
    <li> Kind of crumbly but came on time and helped with acne and stretch marks. 1 lb lasted a month and a half for four people. Make sure to keep in a dry cool place or it will lose some volume (just like any other soap)</li>
    <li> It good for the whole body.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Helped clear up my skin and control oil.  Make sure to use a good moisturizer though, because it can be drying.  I don&#x27;t plan on going back to my old face washes ever!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my nephew, who is a toddler with extremely sensitive skin. none of the pricey organic baby products worked on him but this stuff has done the trick. make sure to cut it into very small pieces for storage. remember, soap breeds bacteria, so ideally you want enough for single usage - or at least only enough to use a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another trick is to put it in a container with water to turn it into liquid form. it will likely be pretty watery unless you use a very low ratio of water to soap. i put it in squeeze bottle in the shower, so the watery consistency isn&#x27;t an issue. you can also add some essential oils if you like. great value</li>
    <li> I received my &amp;#34;brick&amp;#34; in the mail today.  WOW.  First, it&#x27;s generous.  It was easy to break it into three sections, and each section will last a long, long time.  So I have one for the shower, one at the kitchen sink, and one stored in the original packaging to either give to someone or use when my other two run out (which I don&#x27;t see happening for probably a full year).  I used this in the shower today for the first time and it&#x27;s amazing stuff.  It&#x27;s almost hard to describe, but I can only say that there&#x27;s definitely a huge difference from store bought soap (and I&#x27;ve bought the finest).  I can only equate it to how you felt after a Saturday night bath as a kid.  Just clean.  Really authentically clean.  And my skin is so soft which I find especially interesting because I had read a few reviews where people said it was drying.  I don&#x27;t have oily skin.  I assumed I&#x27;d need a moisturizer after using this soap but I didn&#x27;t.  I also purchased the liquid soap for my hair.  I washed my hair using the black soap, then washed again with regular shampoo, and I most definitely saw see and FEEL a wonderful difference. My straight fine hair is as healthy as a child&#x27;s hair.  I&#x27;m 55 years old.  It&#x27;s rare for me to have the amazing results that I often read about on Amazon, but this time I&#x27;m in front of the line.  I did some research before purchasing and I believe that this soap, from the Plant Guru, is the best quality out there.  I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I read reviews prior to purchasing which shaped my expectations. I cut the large soap block into several bars. When not in use, I store the bar inside a soap dish to prevent it from dissolving. It&#x27;s very drying so I only use it on my face a few nights each week. I immediately follow with shea butter. Ocassionally, I use it as a full body wash. I moisturize after.</li>
    <li> Yall yall. This Ghana black soap is liiiiiife!!!!! It improves complexion by helping to clear acne scars and blemishes. I use this along with a face wash and my skin has never been better. Try it. When mine came in it was fine. Before buying I read the reviews and one or two said that theirs had mold in it... but I still bought it and mine was fine. Don&#x27;t let one or two reviews hinder you from trying out a product. With any product there&#x27;s good or bad reviews. You&#x27;ll never know until you try it.</li>
    <li> Love Black Soap. Will continue using it, I think I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> best organic soap really feel the cleanse.</li>
    <li> luv it on face.....great.....</li>
    <li> I bought it because it supposedly had antiseptic properties, and I was looking for a way besides antibiotics to tame the annoying, painful folliculitis that flares up on my scalp. It did nothing for the folliculitis. What it did was burn my eyeballs like hot lava whenever any amount of the stuff got anywhere even remotely near to them. I&#x27;m not sure what the benefit of this soap is. It&#x27;s obviously just ground up bones and tallow.</li>
    <li> It lathes up very good with just a little soap; leaves my skin really clean, soft,it looks healthier. My pours appearance and expression lines have diminished a lot. I have freckles that are disappearing!, my body hair is retaking its reddish tint, and my balding head hair feels soft and with stronger roots, also getting thicker. I have sensitive facial skin, therefore after the use of this soap I have to put White shea butter to protect and recondition my skin otherwise it gets really dry and start loosing its natural defenses. If you have sensitive skin, dont use this soap more than once a day and use some White SHEA BUTTER, otherwise skin gets too dry/ itchy.  I have some flat warts on a finger and are disappearing too. All and All after only 3 days of use. :O  definitively recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: my girlfriend&#x27;s skin is soooooo soft, with no pours, pimples nor black heads. Also she looks younger. After the SOAP she seals her hair with shea butter and Iron/ blow dry her wavy hair, which looks really good after. :D She is very happy with this soap and the African White Shea butter combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed 9/4/12: bought the same product again, and the Quality it&#x27;s still unremarkable. Really pleased</li>
    <li> I ordered the Raw African Black soap and I got what I expected. I had never ordered this product before and I have never ordered from this seller, but I am satisfied with the product. I was nervous about trying it for the first time because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but in using the black soap I found that it made me feel very clean without feeling dry and it also made my skin feel very soft and smooth. I have also used it as a shampoo and it cleaned my hair without stripping it. Overall I really like the soap and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Smells good alittle gritty</li>
    <li> I loooove ABS! I have oily/acne prone skin and am Latina. I was my face once at the sink and once in the shower. In the shower I wash my face once to remove any oil and dirt. Once I have been in the shower for atleast 5 mins I was it a second time. I leave it on like a mask for about 3-5 mins, while I wash my body or shave. I then wash off the soap and am able to--in a circular motion with my fingers, remove any old skin left on my skin. It removes my old skin daily (which is how it removes scars so quickly). I also make a toner made of acid water, rose water and &amp;#34;Bragg Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar with the mother&amp;#34;. Place equal parts in a bottle. I then moisturize with argan cold pressed organic virgin oil.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I think the others&#x27; reviews are blowing its beneficial properties out of proportion. In other cases, some of the claims about this soap are very true:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;Fixes scars and age spots&amp;#34; - I did find that this product lightened some of my hyper-pigmentation from acne scarring, but my actual physical scars are just as deep as they were before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;No body odor after using this!&amp;#34; - I tested this, and this is BS. Sure, right after you shower with it you won&#x27;t have body odor, but that&#x27;s true of all soaps! After a couple of hours or after exercising, you will have body odor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;This cured my acne!&amp;#34; - In my experience, it certainly does help reduce acne, but don&#x27;t expect this to be some cure all - if you get acne for hormonal or dietary reasons, you&#x27;ll still get it while using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;It has hairs and sticks in it/it scraped my skin!&amp;#34; - It most certainly does have some &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; stuff in it - including burned fibers that are way too thick to be hair but at first glance could be mistaken for it, and I&#x27;ve even found what appear to be little rocks in it. Because of this, I second another&#x27;s recommendation to only use this soap to lather - don&#x27;t apply it directly to your skin unless you like being covered in scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;It melts quickly&amp;#34; - This is very true - I keep my bars in a plastic bag and only pull them out when I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &amp;#34;The product arrived in powdered form!&amp;#34; - That&#x27;s a fault of your seller. Mine arrived as 3 bars that looked as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product, just don&#x27;t believe *all* of the outlandish claims you&#x27;ll find in these reviews.</li>
    <li> Good product ! Would purchase again</li>
    <li> I am making my own body products for hair and skin. Friends are always asking me what I use. Now I created a small biz sharing healthy ways to care for your hair and skin. Internally and externally @blsuccess on Twitter</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to reap the benefits of this Pure raw organic black soap. Where do I start, this soap has a very earthy smell which isn&#x27;t bad at all, it&#x27;s super soft, it lathers quickly and immediately goes to work once applied to your face/body/hair. I&#x27;ve only used this soap for a few days and OMG what a difference. My skin is soft, silky smooth and just feels clean. For those that have not used this product before a little bit of a warning: it is normal for this soap to make your skin dry because it is pulling out all the impurities, apply a good organic oil and or organic shea butter (something that doesn&#x27;t clog pores), and you too will see and feel the difference. I will DEFINTELY be reordering from this seller, great quality product, for those that don&#x27;t like the appearance of this soap, get over it! This soap is all natural, raw and organic, very reasonably priced and it comes right from the motherland! What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> A waste of time &amp; money!! After using for only 2 days this product has done nothing but broke my face out!!!</li>
    <li> No more oily skin or pimples. ..just perfect skin ..I love it.</li>
    <li> This soap really does remove all of the impurities from your skin.  I had started suffering from regular acne breakouts and after using this soap for over a month, I&#x27;m no longer getting those breakouts.  I mean my face was starting to look really gross.  Now the acne is gone and the black marks left from the acne scars are definitely starting to fade; which allows me to wear less makeup.  The soap definitely has a natural smell to it, but it&#x27;s ok to me.  Please note that this does come cut in a huge square and pretty much looks like dried poop.  However, it lathers up amazingly and I&#x27;ve event started using this to clean my makeup brushes.  Now, although I love this soap and I&#x27;m going to order it again, I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because there were some large bark pieces in the soap and I&#x27;m almost positive a piece of hair as well.  This is definitely &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; soap, so be prepared for something that in no way resembles the regular processed soap you by in the store.  Overall, it works amazingly on my face and I think I&#x27;m going to start using it on the rest of my body to see if it will help with the occassional ezcema I get.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and always have to use lotion.  Until i started using this soap!  I mean this soap is far superior than anything you could buy in any store including Whole Foods or other health stores.  It is a very strong soap, so scrub your nether regions gently!  The soap does all the work with it&#x27;s rich lather and very clean smell that is all natural with no added perfumes....The best soap in the world in my opinion, and something every black man and woman should explore for our skin; heck, every man and woman period!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent everyday cleanser for face and body. The lather is just foamy enough to give a light bubbly sensation while washing. My skin really likes it, I even notice those little bumps on the backs of my arms are going away. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised.  I generally cut off chunks as needed and liquefy with a minimal amount of distilled water.  I do so mostly so that I can filter the soap due to the bits of rock, pods, etc that you will find in any true African black soap that is not professionally milled and boxes.  Once you do that you can allow to dry to harden if you want to use in bar form or I usually mix with aloe gel and essential oils and used in liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;It can be quite drying but there are plenty of &#x27;recipes&#x27; online that will assist you in getting something suited to your preferences.</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t like soap the breaks apart.</li>
    <li> Absolute no no for hair!!! It seemed like a good idea because I&#x27;m natural but it broke my hair and I had to cut three inches off!!</li>
    <li> It makes sense that a natural product has helped to clear my skin. I would highly recommend this to people who have issues with acne. Be sure to get a good quality moisturizers to follow after cleaning . This can be a little drying to the skin. Can&#x27;t go wrong with something from Mother Nature!</li>
    <li> awesome soap i just have to be careful not to put it directly on skin, will scratch skin, but it keeps me and my family clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> This can be strong. I took off a marble sized piece and put it in a bottle with 8 oz of water.  Shook and let it dissolve. It was still too strong for me. I dumped out some of the water and added coconut oil and now it is perfect. My face gets super clean, doesn&#x27;t dry out, and isn&#x27;t oily. I&#x27;m careful not to scrub hard though. This way the bar will last forever! And it is cheaper than the liquid version. Use an 8 oz bottle from hobby lobby.  They have bath and body bottles you can buy. I got the type with a flip top.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because for years I have suffered with moderately severe dermatitis on my scalp and face. I have had a plaque on my forehead that itches and would not go away no matter what and sometimes even have very dry flaky areas around my nose and eyebrows. I have been slowly trying to switch to more natural products hoping it would help a even just a little, when I discovered this soap. All the reviews were ranting and raving so I thought I would give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this soap. my forehead plaque and dry skin on my face are gone after using this soap either once/day or every other day for the last month.  It comes in a huge block so it takes a while to go through it. The amount of soap and the quality of the product make it worth every penny!</li>
    <li> ok i been using it about three days this soap is awesome , my face is so tight like i got botox awesome</li>
    <li> I have naturally oily skin even into my mid-50s, and have spent a lot of money over the years trying to control my complexion problems, so imagine my amazement that a soap that costs me maybe $1 a month does the best job of anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I keep it in a jar and use a shaving brush to wash my face once in the morning and once at night, and this simple regimen keeps my skin clean, soft and not too oily. Occasionally I exfoliate with a microdermabrasion scrub, but even when I don&#x27;t my skin holds up nicely. That said, this soap CAN over-dry, and when it does I use a little moisturizing sunscreen instead of my usual powder. The only other caveat that comes to mind is that this soap has a high ash content, and while it smells wonderful, the lather sometimes makes me feel like I&#x27;m about to cough if I breathe it in. And don&#x27;t use too much--a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I use on my skin. I melt it down, and have it in a squeezy bottle in my bathroom. It&#x27;s an amazing soap, but it does leave your skin a bit dry. You really need a moisturizer afterwards when using it. especially on your hair. My sister is relaxed, and it&#x27;s a bit too stripping for her taste, unless she does a deep conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> Black soap is great! Yes, it does dry out your skin, but it really cleans well. You need to use coconut oil as a moisturizer after using it. I&#x27;ve tried regular lotions and it wasnt working. Lotions just dry out after 4 hours, but coconut oil lasts all day, makes your skin smooth. It sounds like it would feel greasy but its actually not. You cant even feel it. Lotions, not matter what base always feel some sort of weird, but coconut oil you cannot feel at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the raw black soap!!! I am using it almost one year - my skin looks clean and smooth, my acne and pimples are gone. It does make your skin dry but it is better than pimples and acne! Another thing - one pound of soup lasts  about six months!!! So natural! Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS GREAT.  I NO LONGER USE CONVENTIONAL SOAP AFTER USING THIS.  THIS LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING SMOOTH AND SOFT. THIS DOES NOT DRY YOU OUT LIKE REGULAR SOAPS.</li>
    <li> This product is good for so many things.  I am using it daily and really love it.  I have also recommended this product to others.  As long as it does what it states it will do I will continue to use it  regularly.</li>
    <li> African Black Soap has completely healed my Cystic Acne. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully since 2010. Every other product; both OTC &amp; prescription had failed.&lt;br /&gt;I even use it as shampoo during Winter if I get any dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get the grainy, &#x27;smooshy&#x27; stuff - as I call it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Blended&amp;#34; ABS&#x27;s don&#x27;t have the same effect as *RAW*...</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail after 5 days . I am a Ghanaian so I knew what I was buying . And what I received wasn&#x27;t the black soap . Instead I received a 16oz block of Shea butter . Yes Shea butter. If what you received it of white color and not the color advertised you received the wrong product . ! No it&#x27;s not the same thing . Is just Shea butter ! Which is more of a oil product that is normally used more hair dressing ! Not to treat acne and cleanse the face ! Very dissappointed ! I had high hopes for this product .</li>
    <li> I will never purchase traditional American soap again. This is what soap should feel, smell, and lather like. Even the ingredients list is free from chemicals and preservatives that are becoming more and more of a health risk with each passing day. This is where I will be getting my soap from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heru</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this soap for a little over a year, and I love it. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t write a review earlier. It comes in a big block wrapped in plastic and smells really fresh. It lasts a really long time. This is only like my fourth time buying it maybe. It suds very well and leaves my skin very clean. At first, I stopped using it on my face because it broke me out very badily. But once I got used to it my skin cleared up and looks very nice. I have oily, acne prone skin. If I would have known this soap would work so well, I would have taken before and after pictures. The dark spots on my back were really bad from acne. They&#x27;re not completely gone yet, but they&#x27;ve faded significantly. My face has also cleared up very nicely. I think using this soap along with unrefined shea butter will give the best results.</li>
    <li> Starting around the age of 30, I started breaking out. Not bad but enough to be irritating. I had moved to a dry climate and it seemed that anything I used to treat acne would dry me out so bad that my skin would be flaky &amp; scaly. If I used a moisturizer it would either not be strong enough or too strong that I would get another break out. I&#x27;ve spent numerous amount of years trying to find the right thing (even getting medication from a dermatologist). Finally about 2 years ago, I discovered lye soap while in MO. It worked wonders but I would still get these little white bumps that would never go away and were hard to get rid of. So a couple months ago, I came across the African Black Soap here on Amazon and decided to try it. I love it! It has a clean, soapy smelly and a wonderful lather. I have not had any acne or white bumps. I did experience a tightness in my face after use that felt like dryness. I took another reviewers advice on that and purchased a bottle of sweet almond oil that I apply after washing. What a wonderful combination! I keep getting compliments... \\&quot;you look good!\\&quot;, \\&quot;have you lost weight?\\&quot;, \\&quot;something&#x27;s changed for you... you look like you have a glow to your skin\\&quot;. The only thing that I know that is different is this soap and the oil. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using African black soap for quite some time and it is a permanent staple in my beauty arsenal. I use it for face and body and it is amazing. The reason I love it so much is how clean it is gets my skin, it&#x27;s literally a squeaky clean feeling. I also have eczema and it helps to keep it in check, it&#x27;s gentle and effective. I&#x27;ve used a previous vendor in the past but started to experience large sharp jagged pieces in my soap and the quality seemed to have declined but this seller provides a much better quality product. The soap lathers well and the scent is minimal.</li>
    <li> Preface: I don&#x27;t know what Raw African Black Soap is &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be like/feel like/look like but this stuff has chunks of ... I don&#x27;t know what stuck in it and using it makes me feel like I need to take a bath. Also the inside of my shower looks like a stream of dirt has just been flowing down the side from where the soap rests in the built-in dish. Additionally, it did nothing for my dry skin although I only used it twice before giving up.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome. I like it and would recommend it. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This was exactly as I thought it would be. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Love Black soap great for your face and body.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap.  I cannot wash my face with many products, especially soap because I have sensitive &amp;#34;ginger&amp;#34; skin.  This soap works great, does not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my skin like many soaps do.  However, I do not recommend using a washcloth when using this on your face if you have sensitive skin.  Probably best just to use your hands to lather up! This soap leaves your face very smooth and clean, and it definitely helped to bring some very stubborn set in blackheads to the surface, which I greatly appreciate!</li>
    <li> Found a hair in it. I&#x27;m sorry, I really wanted to like this product, but while taking a shower I noticed a big long straight black hair in it. (I have dredlocks myself). So, I took the chunk apart and found many hairs inside. Ew!</li>
    <li> I have used black soap for a while and this isn&#x27;t the real deal. It seems to be mixed with something else. Will not purchase this ever again from this seller!</li>
    <li> I had recently started getting mini breakouts on my temple area. This soap has put an end to that. It does dry your face out a little,  but that is why they make mousturizers. This is my second tkme ordering thus soap from the same company, and it always arrives on time and in tact.</li>
    <li> Wanted to purchase but read negative reviews, so I changed my mind,  then decided to purchase, so happy I did, love  love love my skin is squeaky clean,soft and smooth with one use. No complaints here!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I will buy this and more products like this again.Feels good on skin.Product came on time no hassles.</li>
    <li> I like this soap on my face maybe once a week for a deep cleaning. It tingles and stings a bit but my face thanks me after! Cleans out pores well. If you have dry skin like me maybe use only once or twive a week as it dries out skin. I sent my mother some and she uses every day. She said it made a positive difference with one wash. Powerful good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to change my beauty routine to a more natural one so I looked at ABS as an alternative to commercial stuff. It&#x27;s definitely soap, it gets me clean the smell is mild and earthy, doesn&#x27;t smell nice or bad. I have noticed it dries your skin out(what do you expect from cleansing soap with no additives), but that can be remedied by applying a moisturizer like cocoa butter afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What I DIDN&#x27;T like about this soap is there is tiny grits in it, either rock or wood pulp, I&#x27;m not sure; but I&#x27;ve had to take caution while bathing that I check for grits on the surface before I start lathering my body with it, otherwise I end up with little cuts and scrapes, OUCH! I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of people commenting on this, so maybe I just received a bad batch? It should of been avoided by using a mesh strainer before molding though for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think I&#x27;ll browse elsewhere and see If I can&#x27;t find a better retailer before purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> this is real, it&#x27;s has a slightly nutty scent (to me at least). it lathers like crazy but isn&#x27;t drying. I use it to get coconut oil off my face (makeup remover) and as a quick mask (lots of lather, keep on the 1-2 mins). love it, I just slice off the amount I need.</li>
    <li> I love the natural feeling on this raw black soap. It helps to make my skin feel smooth and soft. Recommend</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great great great great really can see the difference after using this soap for two weeks.  However it Seawolves really fast</li>
    <li> I cannot rave enough about this product. I was Mr Acne from teenage to adult. It drastically lowers your acne and reduces scars. I wish I&#x27;d known of it a while back. I use it for shower too.</li>
    <li> I started using african black soap a few years ago for my face.  I have hyperpigmentation and this soap, along with my hydroquinone cream has made a drastic improvement in my skin tone.  I Also noticed that since i started using this soap, I don&#x27;t get any acne or breakouts and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m not acne prone, but i honestly haven&#x27;t had a pimple in months.  I will never go back to using regular bar soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is beyond wonderful!!!! When you use it on your skin the soap has it feeling really nice and smoothe.</li>
    <li> Love this.. Great seller!</li>
    <li> This is one of those cautionary items. You don&#x27;t know what you may be spending your money on until you actually get it. Well, this is legit. I&#x27;ve been using the soap for over a week now and it leaves my skin extra clean. It can be drying so I recommend and immediate follow up of a moisturizer. Or if you into \\&quot;melting\\&quot; it down and adding olive oil, I would suggest that also. I like it, it works and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great soap. It does not stain you rag or clothes. Best soap to use to clear up do spots. ...</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy again. Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Makes my skin feel really clean and soft.  I even wash my hair with it which allows me to save on those extra products.</li>
    <li> Love it. Couldn&#x27;t asked for more and the price was good, too.</li>
    <li> Helped my skin clear up in a little over a month. Love it, will be buying more!</li>
    <li> This soap arrived with no LABEL  no DIRECTIONS no LIST of INGREDIENTS, just a Hugh chunk of something...not even resembling soap. It was in a PLAIN ZIP LOCK BAGGIE. I could have been ANYTHING. I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to try it!!! I sent it back immediately.</li>
    <li> You would never think a soap that looks like this would work but it does!  Lathers up so fast and works great for acne.  It might burn the first time you use it if you have open sores but that goes away with the acne.  It will be the only soap I will buy.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday and everything is as expected. For those of you who are not familiar with this kind of soap, cut it into small pieces and store them in a zip lock bag, using a little bit at a time. Given the nature of this kind of soap, you may not want to rub the bar directly onto your skin since the particles can cause abrasions (this is normal for raw black soaps). If you store any kind of authentic black soap in a wet area, it will absorb water and melt, and that is not indicative of a low quality soap. Also, the white film that can sometimes develop is NOT mold and if it you see it form, just know it&#x27;s due to exposure to air and the soap is still ok to use.</li>
    <li> be careful will dry you out but other than that it seems to be clearing up my old acne face. haven&#x27;t seen anything else amazing happen yet though.</li>
    <li> Two and a half. Maybe its because my skin is too sensitive but this is too much for my skin. At first it irritated my face like crazy because I wasn&#x27;t using a strong enough moisturizer after but it did take away a lot of my dark marks. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> Safely packaged and great product to use for toning the skin color back to it&#x27;s natural state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks A Lot!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this! I can&#x27;t say enuf good things about this soap. I first heard of ABS, while reading about Melasma. I do think it has helped my face quite a bit. What I really notice are those bumps on the backs of my arms between your shoulder &amp; elbow. They are gone. And back acne?? who has that..not me or my husband. Nothing worse than planning on wearing a strapless top and get a blemish. It will clear it in 3 days or less! I will say that if you have a open spot, bump anything like that it does burn a tad. And I would suggest you build up to this product. Start by using it once a day on your face for a wk or so, then step up to 2 times. It does dry you out, so you&#x27;ll need lotion of some sort. I was buying Shea Terra Organics ABS. But its $8 a bar! Does this work as well, 80% yes! I do prefer the other but money talks. This is a better amount &amp; price. It is a soft soap! Do not leave it in the shower, It will fall apart. I put it in a dish and leave it on the edge. I buy the larger size &amp; just use a butter knife to cut it up, no problems with that. I&#x27;ve also bought the Nubian Heritage ABS, don&#x27;t bother with knock off stuff. This is the real deal, or if you want to splurge buy the Shea terra organics brand.</li>
    <li> Super soap for healing the skin! so mild and healing.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manor and the soap is all good! Great deal!</li>
    <li> So so natural, as it can get!!!  This will replace a lot of other beauty products I won&#x27;t be using!!!  SAVE $$$, is always a good thing..And the health benefits are outstanding!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I first got this soap I liked it now that it is in blocks I just love it. Thank U</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my skin. As others have mentioned there is a TON of debris and sharp scratching particles in the soap, which is to be expected from a raw unfiltered product. It worked OK when lathered up just in hands, although not always completely free of sand and abrasive bits. I will not continue to use it since it scratches up my skin and is far too damaging.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap about a year ago because I had heard about how good black soap is for the skin however this is one I will never try again. As soon as I put it on it immediately started to burn my face and it felt like my face was on fire. I do not know what is included in the ingredients but I do know soap is not suppose to feel life fire. I am not using the Black Soap made by Nubian Heritage and I love it!</li>
    <li> This soap is incredible , I saw an article in Women&#x27;s World magazine &amp; also heard about it on Dr.Oz. I have sensitive skin , I love the texture &amp; clean fresh  smell that is free of perfumes &amp; dye. My skin looks younger &amp; age spots have faded. It&#x27;s a natural exfoliate . Defiantly would order again</li>
    <li> I discovered Black soap, sometimes called Alata soap, at a crafts fair this summer.  I really liked the bar I purchased there and was looking to find a place to order more.  Horrah for Amazon.  This pound price is a great deal.  It lathers and feels the same on my skin.  It was even free shipping with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/10/2012.  While I do like this soap, I found a fairly thick chunk of wood lodged in it.  I noticed another person commented that they found a stone in theirs.  While I realize this is a hand made product it seems reasonable to expect there to be some screening to remove large foreign objects before molding.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth type of African Black Soap that I have purchased and tried and it is by far the best.  It&#x27;s very natural and leaves your skin feeling very clean.  I actually cut the block in half and have two very good sized bars of soap.  I had tried cheaper bars and they did not even compare to this one.  Also - the liquid soap I bought had too much conditioner in it and left you feeling almost coated, unlike this soap.  It&#x27;s also done a great job of clearing up my skin.  I love it, and plan on keeping it as a staple in my shower.</li>
    <li> This is literally as natural as you can get.  In fact, if you don&#x27;t cut the pieces of this soap large enough it can crumble in your hands.  It may be a good idea to cut a large piece and run it under WARM water to liquefy the glycerin and make it spread evenly to encompass the entire piece of soap.  This soap, while natural, isn&#x27;t all that great for retaining high amounts of moisture in your skin.  Remember, the soap you&#x27;re using is only as good as the water you have.  Higher chlorine content  in a 20 minutes shower will diminish any moisture on your skin the soap may have left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this soap does not have a scent and would be perfect for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies (I experience both).  I find that too often people overlook in the ingredients in their skin products as the source of their issues.  This product is worth the purchase because you get a lot of soap, and there are really no adverse reactions (other than scratching yourself with the natural exfoliating charcoal within the soap itself.)</li>
    <li> This soap lathers really nice. I use it in combination wtih Raw african Shea butter on my face. It has really transformed my skin!</li>
    <li> To be honest, this soap is amazing. It smells earthy and immediately began to clear up my skin. It does feel a little dry afterwards, but that&#x27;s nothing a little witch hazel can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I suffer from Seborrheic Dermatitis, and the prescription creams and shampoos do more harm than good...and the so called  sensitive skin products irritate my skin. So I decided to try and treat my SD naturally, and decided to try the African black soap that I was hearing so much about, and I must say, I&#x27;m in love. I bought it to use on my face and was so impressed that I decided to bathe with it and I use it to wash my hair too. A little bit goes a long way, and I have experienced absolutely no irritation. I&#x27;m noticing a difference in my skin, scalp, and hair already. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> It makes an excellent shampoo too.It has positive effects on the skin and now it&#x27;s available as an add-on item to prime shipping. This is a great example of positive world trade. It&#x27;s imported from Ghana. I&#x27;ve picked this stuff up an my state fair in the past.</li>
    <li> i have very oily skin so i am washing my face with soap frequently (2-3 times a day). I have used lots of kind of soap and i never had dry skin problem. After starting using this soap i wash my face once a day and still my skin dries out so bad that i need to use moisturizer. If i keep the soap on my face more than 10 seconds it starts to burn.</li>
    <li> All ima say is if you want to bleach your face feel free and buy! I will not recommend this to anyone that wants to clean there face or pimples at all!</li>
    <li> This was our third or fourth time purchasing this soap. We have loved the results and it is the first soap that has worked without breaking the bank. However, our most recent purchase arrived today in hundreds of crumbles. The quality control must be suffering as previous shipments were received in a single bar. This shipment is worthless.</li>
    <li> Works great to soften skin.</li>
    <li> The soap I have received looks a lot different than the picture here. It is much lighter in color and it seems like it has sand in it and it hurts my skin. Maybe I should have ordered it from a different seller. Didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> great soap for your face....burns a little the first few time, leaves skin feeling soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Great product.  Purchased as a gift for someone.  They love it.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love using this when my skin gets too oily. It gets rid of blemishes and upcoming pimples right away. I&#x27;m lucky that I have naturally smooth skin and am not prone to pimples, but I do get the occasional one and this really helps. The quality of this soap is pretty much the same as other African black soaps I&#x27;ve bought. It is strong, so I wouldn&#x27;t leave it on too long. One time I left it on a problem spot on my face while I brushed my teeth and my cheek was pretty red after that. But I usually don&#x27;t have a problem when I use it.</li>
    <li> Good soap I just wish I knew for sure that  purchasing this product is helping Africans make money and not causing slave labor.</li>
    <li> I love this black soap, I also took the other viewers advice, to follow up with a moisturizer, and I can tell the difference in my skin, that the dark spots are getting lighter. The soap also came securely packaged. Thanks !</li>
    <li> I am 6 months pregnant and had horrible blotchy, red, scaly skin. After I started using the african black soap, most of the redness and blotchiness went away and the scaliness is completely gone. I love this soap and will continue to use it after my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> After reading many good reviews about this soap, I went ahead and bought one just to try it out for myself.  I am so sad and angry that I want to cry!!!  It made so many cuts on my body (yes CUTS, not scratches.)  And as I tend to scar and not heal perfectly from cuts, this soap is going to leave me with lots of scars.  I HATE THIS SOAP and I HATE whoever that is selling it and allowing such soap to be sold.  I have perfect skin and perfect chest, but NOT ANYMORE :( :( :( I now have scars all over my body and particularly around my chest. If anyone is a lawyer or want to start a class suit let me know.</li>
    <li> this soap is great for sensitive skin good to use on a daily bases its really a great product to use</li>
    <li> I have ordered a different African black soap and was pleased but this one was horrible.  It has huge chunks of rock (?) that is sharp and scratched me several times.</li>
    <li> I am giving a one star not because of the quality of soap. I received 13oz instaed of 16oz (A Pound). I tried contacting seller and they did not even respond. If you want to pay for less than a pound than go right ahead and buy.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It lathers very well and works well for my sensitive skin. It can go quickly, so don&#x27;t leave it under water for long periods. It lathers enough that you can suds up your washcloth and pretty much get yourself washed without keeping the bar under the shower. Also, be aware that you will have to cut the block into bars. I use a heavy knife and try to cut at least 2 inch thick bars because that helps it to last longer and is easier to handle than a thinner slice.</li>
    <li> This is the best of the African Black soaps.  I mix it with filtered water......just a few slices in a honey bear plastic squeeze bottle.  Works great.  I have very sensitive skin....ezema....and this soap does not have any adverse effects.  It cleans good and you can use it on your hair too.  I sometimes add essential oils......lavender, mint, rosemary......whatever you like that is OK for your skin.</li>
    <li> Goodness but this black soap is hands down, the best exfoliator I have ever used. I freely admit to being a product junkie, always trying something new (high end, not the stuff from the local pharmacies), have paid handsomely for exfoliators claiming to gently remove the dead skin cells.  But nothing has beaten this stuff yet!&lt;br /&gt;As many other buyers have said you must moisturize immediately after washing with it.  And I have found that I don&#x27;t need to use it every day, but rather every other day.</li>
    <li> You would think I would put 5 stars since I used the L word on this lovely soap, but--I wish it was bigger. Even though I have a huge amount left, its becoming skinnier and I fear the day when its the size of an atom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would get 3 in the mail (maybe its my bad, since I probably didn&#x27;t read the description well). Instead, I just got one. Big enough, I was okay with it. I never waist my time on reviews, but this was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and again from this company. I don&#x27;t see why I have to search for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace.</li>
    <li> No more harsh soaps with chemicals that strip my face for me!  I noticed a difference in the quality of my skin after the first use, and now two months later my skin has never looked better.  I pair it with Aveeno naturally clear and Neutrogena&#x27;s clearing mineral powder and I am super happy with the results.  And the soap last FOREVER!</li>
    <li> I tend to have some eczema sensitivities which have come back after using the soap, not sure if it is the cause, but will try to figure it out!</li>
    <li> I was half terrified to buy this after so many reviews of other ABS with hairs and pieces of wood in it, etc.  Well, I haven&#x27;t found a hair yet and I haven&#x27;t found a piece of wood yet, but I certainly can feel the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; of this soap when using it.  It is wonderful!  My pores are clean and my skin rinses completely.  It is an amazing product and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells pretty organic, which I like.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last terribly long for how much you get.  I cut the pound up into 4 bars and used probably about 1 every 3 weeks, not impressive in terms of how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the block up into pieces approximately the size of normal soap bars and used them, stored the &#x27;extra&#x27; blocks in the freezer as I saw complaints about the fat in it perhaps going rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel nice and clean as with any other soap, but I can&#x27;t say it is really any different than your average soap.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to clean any better, and doesn&#x27;t seem to either dry my skin out or moisturize any differently than your average soap bar.  But, it is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews from a few others stating there were &#x27;little rocks&#x27; or &#x27;sand&#x27; in the soap.  I disregarded this as probably overstated grittiness or something of the sort, as very few of the large number of reviewers noted this issue.  However, it does certainly seem to have &#x27;sand&#x27; particles in it.  I looked closely at many of them, and they were tan to mostly colorless little rocks, looks like sand.  Also, they were fairly sharp, so when showering I had to run my hand over the surface and remove the particles before using it, as they don&#x27;t make for comfortable use.  Annoying at best.  I suppose it is possible you could cut your skin if you scrubbed hard without removing them.  It is not as though I found 1 or 2 pieces of &#x27;sand.&#x27;  Throughout the entire block I found them, and a lot of them.  Had to remove the particles before every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the above - price, sharp particles in the soap, and short longevity - I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying any sort of black soap again.</li>
    <li> The Black African soap is exquisite.  It takes time to get used to the earthy smell of it, but my skin loves it and I intend to use it for the following years.  Great on irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was excellent.  Prompt and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I used to spend $15 for 1lb just about every 6 weeks then I decided to just buy this instead of wasting my $$. I bought this in June 2013. It&#x27;s almost February 2014, and I JUST got beyond the halfway point. My block of ABS was about 5&amp;#34; wide and deep and 12-14&amp;#34; long. I use it to wash my face, my body and, occasionally, my hair when I want to clarify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABS is very drying so make sure you replenish your skin or hair with lots of moisture. For my face I follow the ABS with Argan oil, for my skin I mix my Cetaphil cream with jojoba oil, and on my hair I follow with Knot Today, glycerin, grapeseed oil and vatika oil. (I have 4c hair -- if any naturals are reading this).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 31 yo woman and had never had trouble with my skin, not even in my teenage years, until going off the Pill last year.  When the zits arrived, I quickly discovered that the usual drugstore suspects weren&#x27;t helping.  The zits weren&#x27;t the normal ones I&#x27;d had occasionally in my life - these were deep, they hurt, and they laughed at 10% benzoyl peroxide.  In addition to my face, they were all over my chest, neck, and back.  Thank goodness it was winter and I could wear turtlenecks!  Google research pointed me to African black soap and I found it from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited 3 months to write this review, and I can tell you unequivocally that this has completely cleared my skin without the need for any other products.  I must use it daily for it to work, and I notice pimples beginning to reappear overnight if I skip it before bed.  It can be a little drying during the winter, so I follow with a light moisturizer.  I use a rotating face brush (Clarisonic, Olay, etc) when I feel my skin needs extra cleansing and I think the two work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of letting the soap work and my skin calm down, I gradually reintroduced all the anti-aging lotions &amp; potions I&#x27;ve been using for years with great effect.  I probably didn&#x27;t need to wait so long and I could have reintroduced them sooner.  So yes, it can work with your usual skincare routine; just replace your cleanser with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read online to use witch hazel as a toner with it.  I find that a bit too drying for my skin, but I plan to try again in the summer when my skin&#x27;s oily. People with oily skin may want to try that right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, this does \\&quot;melt\\&quot; quickly, but the brick you receive is huge and the product&#x27;s so inexpensive, it&#x27;s no big concern.  Once while trying to slice off a thin bar, the soap broke into chunks the sizes of various coins - I&#x27;ve found I like using those because then I&#x27;m not losing much soap to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; in the shower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else described, there are little pieces of ash or wood in the soap. Just be aware of them and pry them out with your fingernail, problem solved.  I choose to lather the soap in my hands rather than applying the bar to my skin for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, this does a fair job removing makeup.  I choose to use eye makeup remover because I wear waterproof mascara, but the soap&#x27;s been fine at getting off whatever&#x27;s left of my foundation by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I&#x27;ve been recommending to everyone I know with skin problems!  I feel a bit fanatical, but it&#x27;s really been that good for me.  Give it a try - you&#x27;ll only be out a few dollars and it just might work for you.</li>
    <li> The soap arrived quickly and is very good.</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy using all organic beauty products.  There are so few out on the market that African soap is a gem to have found.  The bar itself is a 1 lb bar that can easily be cut with a butter knife into 6-7 full size bars of soap.  It arrived undamaged in shrink wrap and is hard enough to be a solid but can be bent without much force.  Saying that, each bar does fall apart quite easily with use.  If you hold this bar underneath water in the shower it will start to shrink after a minute or two.  Water also get into the porous parts of it and weakens it from the inside.  Therefore it is essential to buy a $1 soap saver from any store to place this on after use.  If you leave wet on a counter it will absorb water and split in two next time you pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;Usage wise, I love.  I use a gentle loofa to foam up the soap all but twice times a week, in which I use an exfoliating loofa with it.  The smell of the soap itself a lot of people on here described as &#x27;earthy&#x27; and &#x27;musky&#x27;.  That&#x27;s a fancy way of saying it smells like a dirty leaf.  But a good dirty leaf!  The smell of the bar is pleasant and does not make a strong enough scent to transfer to your skin.  After my first time using it I asked my boyfriend what it smelled like and he said it didn&#x27;t smell like anything, and that I just smelt clean.  He also said my skin felt softer then usual.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on how this soap works for skin issues.  I do have mild acne, which seems to have improved slightly with this soap.  It does say though that this soap cannot cure acne-just help fade scars.  I have a friend with eczema and I&#x27;m going to give her one of the bars to see how that helps.  I&#x27;ll update on that later.&lt;br /&gt;Overall wonderful product.  I will continue to buy it on Amazon because you cannot find this in any store (at least in VA).  The price does change a lot online, but that&#x27;s good.  That proves that this is a genuine product with a supply and demand-rather then a warehouse full of soap.  WhenI bought it it was 7.99.  I see today it it 12.99.</li>
    <li> Tried several African soap products. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> when I first tried your soap it clears my skin but it makes my skin dry.And when I use this soap when it&#x27;s rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product exceeded expectations. I am a truck driver and the soap does a great job cleaning my hands&lt;br /&gt;I love the lather created by this soap</li>
    <li> I just got it today, tried and loved it so far. It lathers very well and does not leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Just got it, will update of needed later. Initial impression: smells really good! Just a nice clean smell. Little goes a long way and lathers quickly. Face feels clean  Update: it&#x27;s been a year and I still haven&#x27;t come close to using it all. I use it with a complexion brush to make sure I get it all off because that was a problem before. I like having such a simple, natural thing to wash my face with.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it exfoliates as well as the liquid Dr. Woods. I wanted to try a more &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; black soap, but will go back to the Dr. Woods product once I work through 1 whole pound of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap at the end of June 2014, and have only been using a little at a time because you really don&#x27;t need very much. The soap worked well and I liked it, but the last time I went to grab a piece, I realized the whole chunk was covered in mold! I&#x27;ve had it for less than 6 months. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this in bulk if I knew it would be moldy in less than 6 months. It was a waste of money considering I only used about 5% of the actual product and then had to throw it all out.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sons who are experiencing razor bumps and acne. They saw a difference in their skin within days.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and also purchased two more bars.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd order.  I have sensitive skin and break out when I use soap.  This soap is the exception.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several months for acne  / acne scars on my face. It works well but not a miracle worker. My acne has reduced a significant amount, sometimes they still flare up (especially since I have hormonal acne - cystic ones along chin/jaw line - this soap will NOT do anything for that type of acne, sadly). Worked well for my cheek/forehead acne though. I still have blemishes though and wide pores but it seems to be having a very small effect in diminishing that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1lb can last a long time, 6 months + if you don&#x27;t let it melt. Get a soap dish that drains and avoid having any water directly spraying onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- A lot for your $$&lt;br /&gt;- Works, reduced acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not a miracle worker as many bloggers boast about. (Oh well).</li>
    <li> I was so excited when this soap arrived. After reading up on the benefits from different sites about this soap I was ready to experience the product. Washed my hair and wow was amazed on the cleanliness and how it pulled all the dirt and oil out. *note: plz use conditioner afterwards. Washed my face with it and did need to apply organic Shea butter to it. This soap pulls the oil out. ... Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this soap enough, it cleared my skin up like nothing iv ever used before, iv been useing this soap for 2 years now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Comes in one giant block but it&#x27;s easy to cut, it you use this too often it dries out your skin really bad.</li>
    <li> The soap I received was a beautiful chuck I enjoy using the soap and I shared with my sister in Laws.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Great soap for washing ones face. Thanks a lot</li>
    <li> probably a bit expensive compare to most soaps&lt;br /&gt;but definitely worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as i type this, i just realized i did not use a moisturizer on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This causes your skin to flake if you do not!  D-:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t forget like i did :-/</li>
    <li> I have been using black soap for most of my life, it&#x27;s great stuff. Being that my whole family has eczema, we all use the black soap. And it work very well.</li>
    <li> I wish the soap could last longer it really clean the skin  I have been using these soap for quite a while now</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for hair, face and body! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> The product seemed somewhat harsh for the first few days of use (tingling, dry skin after use) and I wonder if this has to do with the amount of lye. But after using once daily for about a week, my skin feels refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great for removing makeup and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this is one of those &amp;#34;only time will tell&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying this soap if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worked with it yet  And was VERY Happy to see such fast shipping! I would of 5 stared it , Its just that I havent tried it or used it But Im Sure it will be wonderful! Thanks So much! Very Safe packaging as well!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this soap just like everyone else and I honestly wanted a real true answer from their experience. I have sensitive skin and i have had acne since seventh grade and I am now a freshman in college I have tried everything that you could think of. After using the black soap nothing changed for my facial skin. My skin color is brown and I have dark spot from acne mostly on my cheeks. I thought that using the black soap would take them away but they didn&#x27;t. My advice if you are looking for a cure for your skin is to go to your dermatologist if you haven&#x27;t already. I also recommend that you use Eucerin it is a great lotion it has helped repair my skin.</li>
    <li> Made my skin flawless! Pimples dried up and my face cleared after one use. Even took away dark spots. I&#x27;ll defiantly be making another purchase.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this while browsing on Amazon, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try. I love this stuff, I have never felt so clean.  I grew up with city water and have since moved to the country, so now I have well water. I hate it. This stuff amazingly rinses clean and feels great. It is a tad drying, but lotion fixes that.</li>
    <li> It came like it said it would. I liked it and used it. I still have some. I may buy some again. I cant use it on my face for some reason but I still like how it made my skin feel on the rest of me.</li>
    <li> I have used soap like this since I was a child.  I love how it makes me smell and also how smooth it makes my skin feel!  Be aware that this product isn&#x27;t for everyone.  Try buying a smaller amount in the same production quality to see if your body chemistry supports it.</li>
    <li> I liked the soap.  You have to be careful because the small particles may scratch your skin.  I suggest you work the lather in your hands first then apply to your wet skin or wet your cloth, it lathers really well, check for the small particles before washing your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for five days and its already taking away my eczema and tremendous itching problem I had due to allergies.  I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this soap works wonderfully.  Be careful it is a bit drying, and the first few weeks you may experience a purging of the skin as it gets rid of toxins.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed!  This is only temporary.  Also, I may have gotten a hair in mine.  P.S.  If you do end up getting a hair in your soap, don&#x27;t worry about it so much.  We eat much grosser things than that on a daily basis!  And you&#x27;re not eating it so no worries!  I am very pleased with this product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Staple in my household. Safe to use on the entire family as well as using on your entire body. Product is all natural and great for my boys that have excema. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I discovered black soap a few years back, but this is my first time buying any other than the brands sold in stores. From here on out, this is it for me. The soap in general is good for my skin, but this particular soap is better than I&#x27;d imagined. I have very dry skin, and even without my usual shea butter or coconut oil post-shower, this soap leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I can&#x27;t speak on what it does for acne just yet, as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but as much as my sensitive skin likes this soap, I will definitely be buying more. I recommend this to anyone interested in pampering their skin with natural products instead of the chemical-laden products found in most stores.</li>
    <li> i was a tad iffy about ordering this off of here but once i received it and tried it out i was in love. this stuff is amazing. i have oily &amp; sensitive skin that can cause rashes at times. this black soap is helping out with it all.</li>
    <li> This is my go too soap. My skin loves it and it helped my skin get it&#x27;s natural glow back.</li>
    <li> Wow!  this was really good soap.  If some people order it they need to know that it is not cut like our soap is cut.  I already knew that and I really like this soap and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, exactly the same thing I used in Africa where I spent over 10 years - I use black soap since 2005 and this one is the real deal.</li>
    <li> At first i was skeptical due to the product coming liquified to my home.  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work.  After some time in the fridge, and trying the product out, i realized it&#x27;s great.  my face feels clean without feeling overly dry, and i had a rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away until after i used the soap on a regular basis.  i can tell it&#x27;s natural because when i accidently get it in my eye, it doesn&#x27;t burn nearly at all.  I also like the fact that i&#x27;m helping to support a business from a third world country, possibly second world that i would imagine needs all the help they can get.</li>
    <li> The first few times I used this I had a tingling down through my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap leaves you feeling clean, and if you brush it through your hair and body you get a general sense of health, and post-feeling that it did improve the quality of your skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This seems to be more (shea?) butter than soap. I usually go directly to the source (I am West African) to get my soap so I was under the impression this was going to be a quality product as it was coming from Ghana. It was also broken up into much smaller pieces and was not the massive block as pictured. The smell also isn&#x27;t fresh which is obviously a disappointment since we all want to smell fresh and clean after bathing! I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love black soap! I&#x27;m an avid black soap user. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve ordered from this company. They shipped fairly quickly..i received the product in 2 days. It&#x27;s refreshing. There is no smell and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This soap is messy, so make sure you have a dish to keep it in. I do like it though.</li>
    <li> ok so I just received this soap in the mail like ten minutes ago. I was so excited, I&#x27;ve been waiting for the past few days for this shipment! It only took about 4-5 business days to get here, so that wasn&#x27;t bad. I opened my package to see the 1 lb of Raw African black soap in a perfectly shaped cube, wrapped in plastic wrap, and inside of a ziplock bag. The packaging was super nice everything looked really clean it wasn&#x27;t messy or packaged sloppily or anything like that. The soap itself is a good size it&#x27;s not as big as I imagined but still a good size and great value.I unwrapped the packaging and the soap smelled really good it had a citrus scent to it along with some earthy tones. It smelled really natural and I liked that a lot! I cut into the soap and no hair/sand/hard pieces of material like some other buyers had complained about. The product itself is very good quality and I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase! And again people this is a RAW soap. So it&#x27;s not going to be a smooth cut bar shape like something you&#x27;d get from the store. It&#x27;s all natural ingredient so it is lumpy and you can see the different ingredients in the block of soap itself. Just remind yourself that your buying RAW soap before you purchase this so you&#x27;re not taken off guard when you receive it! Can&#x27;t wait to try this product out on my skin ! Will update my review</li>
    <li> I love this soap skin looks clear and bright my acne scars are fading im so happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Will definitely be ordering this again and again. The person I got it for loved it and has switched to this soap from his old Dove for Sensitive Skin. He tells me that he&#x27;s had skin issues, including eczema when he was a child, and he prefers this one now.</li>
    <li> I wish I could explain the many skin troubles I have. One is the semi- breakout on my chest but not really. Years I have been trying to fix this. One use, one use. Under control. I was amazed. Already cut some off for little sis. We will be buying more and then more.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Came as advertised! My family is Ghanaian and I usually use soap right from Accra. This is the real deal! It&#x27;ll have your face smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom !</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me as a Christmas gift and it works wonderfully. There is no question about authenticity, because this the genuine article for a great price. I use this for facial cleanser, hand soap, and shampoo.</li>
    <li> African black soap is one of the most pure soaps on Earth. If you have any type of skin, this is the perfect soap. This soothes skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. If you suffer from acne, scarring, or blemishes, you will notice a difference with this soap!</li>
    <li> This soap is great!  I use it for my face, body, &amp; hair.  I no longer need a moisturizer for my face and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this black soap. A little goes along way, so I was able to share it with my friends and they loved it too. As a face soap it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and as a shampoo it doesn&#x27;t strip my already dry 4C hair. Good product and good seller.</li>
    <li> It really helps keep my skin clear. I&#x27;ve only been using it for around a week and I can see some slight evening of my skin tone. It has a very odd scent, very earthy, but not at all unpleasant. I usually just lather it when I&#x27;m in the shower and then rub the lather on my body, but I do like the light exfoliation that comes from using the bar on your skin (just remember not to apply too much pressure-- I could imagine that causing scratches and cuts). If you&#x27;re using it as a facial cleanser, I would suggest you follow up with a moisturizer (my personal favorite is shea butter) just because black soap can dry out your face. As far as packaging, this soap came in a sealed plastic bag in three large chunks, I weighed it and it was a perfect pound. I just cut a piece off and store the rest in a tupperwear container on my desk. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting it again.</li>
    <li> Love it, not sure if it helped my stretch marks though, but its a nice soap and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My family is Sierra leonean and this is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to what my grandmother makes. It&#x27;s amazing for breakouts</li>
    <li> Looks exactly as advertised. This huge block should last for a few long time which makes the price really inexpensive in the long run for a good all natural product.</li>
    <li> Ive only used the soap 5 times and my aunt already noticed the difference. My pores are noticeably smaller and it seems to be gentle on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it on my body yet but I think I&#x27;ll just use it on my face for now. I also bought some shea butter that I haven&#x27;t received yet. I also loved the fast delivery. Great all around.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin. I do not like to use a lot of chemicals and this natural soap from Africa is what I needed. I was my face with this soap with the hottest water I can handle and the pat dry and use a natural oil on my face like Shea butter (yellow), natural oils like African Pride oil or such. I typically use it when I shower before bed. After using for more than two weeks I can notice my skin is clearer and smoother. Does it work for everyone? I don&#x27;t know but is working for me!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, it is the only one I use since I found it. The only thing is like somebody else said before, I found some hairs inside it that were not mine. I guess it is because of the way they make it. At first I was constantly checking it but then I was like &amp;#34;meh, they will go down the drain anyway&amp;#34;. Other than that it is fabulous, it leathers really well and it leaves me feeling really clean. Also it has helped me a big deal with some skin problems. I definitely get fewer pimples than before and whenever I get one, it is gone in a couple of days instead of a week or more. I have recommended it to one of my coworkers who has sensitive skin and used to get rashes from working at the warehouse around all the dust. After only a couple of days of using it his rashes cleared up and he is really happy with the way his skin looks and feels now.</li>
    <li> Very fresh and clean smelling. My son uses it to control his acne and I mixed it with Shea butter and wash my body with it.will be ordering again. Make your skin smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> The first few days I started using the soap I noticed a redness to my face (I have combination skin).  So I stopped using it everyday and now use it 3x a week.  I have found that my acne scars are disappearing and my skin has a more even tone.  I love the way that my face looks, and the fact that I don&#x27;t need to use as much makeup to hide the acne scars.</li>
    <li> I have to say I had never heard of African black soap before until I came across a vendor at a fair this past fall. I couldn&#x27;t help but over hear some people raving about the soap as well as pure shea butter…needless to say I had to purchase it. I cannot say enough about this soap!  I have been using this soap since September and my skin looks better than it ever has.  I also worked with a woman from Ghana and she of course already knew of the many benefits.  Word of caution, it can make your skin dry (my face only) but nothing that the pure shea butter cannot cure.  Oh, and my husband and daughter love it too!  Natural all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Becky</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Its natural, sudsy, and nice. Soft! I have eczema and this soap helps to clean my skin without irritating it. I don&#x27;t use it every day ....but once every other day or every third day. My skin glows with it. I used to love the duduosun, but this is waaaaaaayyyyyyyy better.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed, the soap was very soft and crumbled .  I would not recommend this soap at  all to anyone,</li>
    <li> I searched for a natural alternative to soap and a facial cleanser that wasn&#x27;t harsh and is a good product for sensitive skin. I suffer from eczema, and this is great for me. It&#x27;s strong enough to remove my make-up, and gentle enough so that it doesn&#x27;t wreck my skin. I use organic shea butter as a moisturizer after usage. This product is packaged well, and comes as a large block that I cut into smaller sizes. I then store it in plastic containers with lids. It stays moist and lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 pounds (2 orders) since summer.  I only use it as a facial cleanser, but may transition to using this as a body cleanser as well. It has a natural scent, so if you want something with fragrance, don&#x27;t get this, or use scented shea butter after.</li>
    <li> Received a bag of crumbles. The product is not as pictured. Plus, the bag had these fibers in them. The picture is misleading and dishonest.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it was right on time.</li>
    <li> This soap irritated all of our skin. After a light washing we all noticed it felt like our skin was burning. I waited a few days and tried it again, just a light rub with my fingers and rinsed with cool water-NO SCRUBBING and I still felt the burn.</li>
    <li> Huge piece. I cut it into several bars, so a lot of product for the money</li>
    <li> This soap is the real deal it can open your pores, but beware this can hurt your skin to just don&#x27;t wash in the same place twice</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews and how well it worked for the majority I decided on buying it specifically for a face wash for the acne I have on my face. I regret using it because my face broke out even more. I felt squeaky clean but it made my face super dry. So FYI if you have sensitive skin, stay away. However I gave it three stars because my husband uses it for his hands to get all the grease and oil residue off and he loves it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product; however, it clogged my pores really badly. I know other reviewers have said to allow the skin to get used to the product for a few weeks, but at the end of week 2 I decided that my skin will never get used to a product that contains comedogenic ingredients like palm oil, coconut oil and palm kernel oil. As soon as I stopped using this product, my skin was not as bad as when I was using ABS. I&#x27;m a bit annoyed though because now I have even more blemishes to deal with.  I am happy for those people&#x27;s whose skin improved with ABS because as someone who has acne, I know how hard it is to be confident and be happy when your skin is breaking out, so to feel like you&#x27;ve found a solution to this horrible condition is truly awesome. For those thinking about switching to ABS, just remember to proceed with caution. I&#x27;ve read that raw black soap varies from seller to seller, depending on their supplier. It makes sense; however, I think the oils I mentioned above are in  raw ABS in some form or another. It really depends on each person&#x27;s tolerance levels for these oils, I suppose.</li>
    <li> It did absolutely nothing for my skin&lt;br /&gt;problem.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. As a woman of color, my blemishes clears up within weeks even when I don&#x27;t use my face oils and astringent. it really helps with acne or give u the spa clean face look within 3 days. I use it to wash my hair and it leaves it super clean. My hair is natural no chemical whatsoever and, I don&#x27;t have the curliest hair, but I can manage my hair when it&#x27;s wet all suds up. As for body, your super clean and it help any blemish that you have on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have any crazy smell. but if u want a perfume smell, I suggest u use ur black soap first and, then use ur favorite scent  after.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It makes me feel very clean and a little goes a long way. The lather is very rich.</li>
    <li> I love this soap its been 1 year now and Im reordering again thought I would let everyone know about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Im 52 have  sensitive skin and use this every day it cleans all the dirt from my job as a gardener .its wonderful cleans properly wont leave your skin stripped or dry ,I use this on my face and body with no problems what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;1 block I cut into 2 inch blocks I have my college daughter addicted to it she loves it for her breakouts without harsh cleaning, have given it to friends to try and they all love it .&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive ,long lasting,no big bottles in the shower&lt;br /&gt;5 stars XXXXX</li>
    <li> Just got this in yesterday and I cant really give a review on how it helps the skin as this is my first time using it but so far so good and it doesn&#x27;t really have any smell to it. Thank you</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by a co-worker who said it would help clear up my face (acne,dark spots, &amp; black heads). Let me be the first to say I have tried everything (clean&amp;clear, proactive, &amp; neutrogena) and none have cleared and have kept my face clear this long. I started out with washing my face 2x/day and within not even a month I noticed a difference. I do use a toner and moisturizer but this soap does all the work. I not only saw a reduction in acne (still have an occasional breakout-woman probs) but my acne scars have almost subsided completely. I was so impressed I started using it as my body soap and have seen a reduction in dark spots on my back! I will be purchasing this for a LONG time! Love!</li>
    <li> texture and look--I am going to toss it.</li>
    <li> I received my  Raw African Black Soap Imported from Ghana , and it has been very good for me I love what it has done for my dry skin I will be purchasing more soon and I recommend it to anyone with dry skin it really moisturizes well and is sold a at a great price</li>
    <li> Black African soap, best thing ever, great thing to have. I plan on getting more. I use it head to toe.</li>
    <li> It soaped up nicely and did not have any smell to it really.  Additionally i have noticed softer skin and several of the dark marks on my skin fading.  Great product, will use again.</li>
    <li> This is a rare purchase from Amazon that I regret. The soap I received had small pieces of material in it that actually cut my skin. We&#x27;re not talking small surface scrapes, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything sharp in a bar of soap and I was cut deep enough that it drew blood in several places. On top of that if you leave a piece of the soap in the soap tray in the shower it has some serious stickyness that makes a black gooey mess to clean up. In short I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back to Amazon, but I would NOT RECOMMEND purchasing ABS from this seller as there appears to be some serious quality issues with their product. (I understand hand made products won&#x27;t be clean and pure like a bar of Ivory, but I don&#x27;t want a bar of soap to make it look like I&#x27;m recreating the famous Psycho shower scene with all the blood either).</li>
    <li> this black soap has a bad smell but it feels good the skin ....</li>
    <li> I have been having some problems with my skin lately and I have found that normal soap either dries out my skin or creates a weird rash. I heard about African black soap on Twitter and decided to try it. Such a good investment. Within 2 uses my skin made a noticeable change. I will continue using this product along with my coconut oil for moisturizing. Definitely no regrets.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap after reading tons about African black soap.  The soap is fine and lathers like crazy, the scent is mild, but there are particles-super sharp- embedded in the soap that definitely case scratching! I cant say I noticed much of a difference in my skin after use.  The price is great, but I dont know if I&#x27;f purchase this soap again.</li>
    <li> This product was too harsh for my skin.. I actually would like to return. Might work for someone else just not me.</li>
    <li> I use this soap every day and it is wonderful. i try to use all natural products and this definitely meets the bill.</li>
    <li> Feels great against skin, scrubs off lots of stuff. feels super earthy and natural too. sure beats chemicals. quite a large chunk of soap as well. get it!</li>
    <li> Soap was okay, but not real creamy or foamy  like some of the other brands I used before.</li>
    <li> First time trying black soap &amp; was scared to buy it after seeing it can be drying/irritating to skin of some. Well I&#x27;ve been using mine a couple days &amp; putting some pure african shea butter on my skin after &amp; am happy to report no problems. My skin already feels better after a couple uses. Will be using tbis seller again as my item arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> It came all crumbled up so I managed to press it into a ball and tried it anyway. It dried my skin badly. Somebody skimped on the oils.</li>
    <li> This soap cleared up my dark spots like eraser to pencil !!! There are still some faint spots from my more recent acne flare ups but this soap is a staple in my  skin are regimen!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is the best! My skin feels and looks great. Purchasing more soon. I have recommended this to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> We all (family(Husband,Mom,and I)) absolutely loved this black soap. I order another black soap here on Amazon and I was very disappointed. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have taken a chance on that other company and went with you again. I have learned my lesson. Stick with what is good and with what works. If I wasn&#x27;t moving out of the country in 6 days I would order more from you. Your product cuts very easily and doesn&#x27;t have the &#x27;pebbles&#x27; in it. It also doesn&#x27;t sting the skin on my face. I would totally recommend this product. It woke my skin up again and never irritated it. Those out there that have sensitive skin this is a great soap to use.</li>
    <li> Well so far so good, but I think it will take some time to see results. I do like how this soap lathers up and my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was decent. Soap came in crumbles and blocks(Not a fan of that) But it&#x27;s working after 1st use..  Great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  My tub looked like the invasion of dead cells after my bath.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap close to a month now and so far I like it.</li>
    <li> I love the clean feeling after I wash my face</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because I heard about its positive qualities (I read that it can help clear acne scars). It&#x27;s all natural (anything you wouldn&#x27;t eat you shouldn&#x27;t put on your face since it gets absorbed thorough the pores).  It makes your face and skin feel really clean.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> i love this soap. It makes me feel clean. it is grainy if you rub it directly on your skin but the solution for that is lather it up in your hands first then apply it on your skin. I am hoping it would help with my acne.  Will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. It the only soap I use. It&#x27;s great for your skin!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for acne.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It does have lots of little pebbles and rocks in it so beware.</li>
    <li> Very good for bathing and washing, deep cleansing for the skin and very relaxing too!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, Love the soap! Bathing with it; washing my hair! Excellent natural skin cleansing and skin clearing! This seller is great! Fast shipping and great packaging! Thank you again!</li>
    <li> Only had a chance to use it once, but I&#x27;m happy with what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way this soap makes my skin feel! I have recently come to love all things Shea. After my shower, I follow up&lt;br /&gt;With shea butter. My skin is so smooth, soft and not greasy at all. Love, love these products!!!</li>
    <li> I believed that since the soap was raw and handmade that it would be ok for me to use, especially after hearing great stories of how well it have worked for others, like clearing up acne, boy was I wrong. After using for about 1 week my face and chest started to break out in a rash (my face first). It was very red and sore, I stop using immediately then the rash started to calm but it left my face and shoulders very dry with excessive amounts of dead skin. After the soreness went away I decided to buff (exfoliate) my face and moisturize (which I couldn&#x27;t do when it was inflamed, anything I would put including lotion would burn my face) and it seemed to do the trick. My face is now back smoothed, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a history of dry or sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> great product. really clear the acne on my face and back. gave me a glowing complexion.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing African Black soap from HalaEvery day for a couple of years and decided to try this brand due to it&#x27;s great competitive price.  I have to say that I was expecting it to be way better based on the reviews. The soap is fine, but it was packaged in saran wrap. I purchase African Black soap because of the nutrient content.  Wouldn&#x27;t that get lost with such lose packaging? The soap was also not as dense as what I&#x27;m used to using, so it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long. I am glad I gave it a try to settle my curiosity, but I will be going back to the other brand.</li>
    <li> It really dries you out but I just use a really good moisturizer after( like the raw Shea butter stuff that comes in tubs. )  I have adult acne and while I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m cured it has absolutely helped, mostly with the tiny ones that just hang around no matter what I try. I think I will stick with this one!</li>
    <li> This soap is really different and takes some getting use to. I don&#x27;t think it does perform as well as they say.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap like a month ago. I waited to post my review because I wanted to actually use it first and may I say, this soap is fantastic. It lathers well and it lasts a long time. I use the soap for my 4b natural hair and I love it. Will not go back to using store shampoo ever again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a month and I have already notice major improvements in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the standard acne that many have, I have cystic acne. For those who don&#x27;t know, cystic acne occurs from an overproduction of the oil glands beneath the skin. When too much oil is produced and can&#x27;t escape to the surface painful nodules develop. They often hurt and last for several days and because they are so deep beneath the surface of the skin they cannot be brought to a head like other pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen the dermatologist, I&#x27;ve tried all the commercial acne products and nothing worked to control my cystic acne. After a long trial and error of several products I came across this soap. Since I began using this soap my cystic acne has been in more control. Much of the redness is reduced and many of my acne scars have begun to fade away. Everybody is different so it may work better or worse for you. But after everything I&#x27;ve tried I can honestly say this is the one product that has noticeably made a difference for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap!&lt;br /&gt;Does what&#x27;s its suppose to and leaves my skin clean and feeling skin!</li>
    <li> Lathers nicely and smells ok if a little rustic, but the bar couldn&#x27;t be applied directly to my skin because something in it kept scratching my skin. So sharp that it left fait scratches and tears on my skin which were visible.</li>
    <li> Just as described .yes I would recommend this. This is the only thing that works on my skin and I have very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Good Stuff exfoliate as you wash Great price for quantity. I split it up in to 4 nice size bars with a hot knife.</li>
    <li> Wanted something natural to tone and cleanse my skin so I wanted to try this soap as I had been hearing about it for years.  I&#x27;ve been using for over a month now and I must say I don&#x27;t see any noticable difference.  I appreciate the natural effect but somewhat dissappointed in the results.  Unless anything changes over the next few weeks, I don&#x27;t think I will order again.</li>
    <li> I chose this soap because I saw it on Dr. Oz.  I tried African black soap at a health food store and it was not the same.  Tips soap lathers and makes my face feel so clean.  It even lathers down to a small chip.  This year I purchased it for my daughter-in-law.  It comes in a big hunk and you just slice off a bar of soap.  I&#x27;m really glad I found it.  Oh, it&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
    <li> This soap can be very drying to the skin so I use it with another soap with castor oil which moisturizes my skin after, then applied an organic moisturizer. Works well for my acne prone skin and it lightens my acne scar and blemishes.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned about buying this product from King of Natural Product, as people were complaining consistently about sticks being in the soap and how it came packaged. However, having received the block of soap and broken it down into small balls, I can say that the people giving this soap low reviews just are not people who regularly use this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw African Black Soap will melt. It will melt with very little water on it and it&#x27;ll melt a little after you use it to lather up and set it down. That&#x27;s the nature of the soap and you aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong if this happens. On the same note, the vendor has done nothing wrong if your black soap is melting like this. That is the nature of the product, hence most people cutting it into tiny balls to lather with. You waste less if you only wash with small chunks at a time. Also, do not place this in a soap holder that will contain standing water. Always set the soap aside on a dry counter when done or on a paper towel. Anything that will dry out and not just hold the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell. Yes, this is an earthy soap. There is no fragrance in it. No true raw black soap has fragrance other than the natural earthy scent. It isn&#x27;t strong and after rinsing, no one will smell your face and be turned off by it. This is the natural scent of the soap and not the vendor&#x27;s problem or because you did anything wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complained about getting crumbles instead of the solid bar. The vendor I used sent a solid bar. It did not meet the 16oz requirement, but I also understand why his/her measurements are off. The vendor is probably cutting from a 10 lb solid block and cutting another sliver from the block is very difficult to do. Since the vendor can&#x27;t weigh it until the block has been removed, and the crumbles would look bad, we get an ounce less than described. Let me tell you, the cheapest vendor in my area or on any other site sells 10oz for 14 bucks. Even missing a few ounces, this is a steal. Also, if you get the soap in crumbles, just compress them in your hand. Voila! A solid block! No more worries, friend. Either way, it&#x27;s best to break up the soap and use smaller compressed balls to wash with daily so that the soap lasts longer. A pound is more than enough to last you a year of daily use if you only wash your face with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, remember to lather with the soap. Don&#x27;t rub it on your body. Lather in your hands and then spread the lather. It makes the soap last and prevents cutting if there are any solid bits in the soap (of which I found none).</li>
    <li> The first time buying this product and I cut a peice of it instantly me and my mom loved it ,however I went to cut another peice a week later and there was mold in it like wtf are you serious this was a total buzz kill as I was enjoying the product the first time I used it now I&#x27;m scared to finish using it</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine. Delivery was fast and just as descibed. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but my kids are trying it out for mild acne.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my age spots on my face and hands, it worked really well in fading them.  Had my daughter using it for acne and scaring, worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement I found that if you use it under your arms, you will have no body odor!!!!!!!I had my husband try this as a test and he too found the same results! I recommend this to my friends and they too found the great results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love this soap!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past 4 months and STILL have yet to run out. Even works for washing my hair!</li>
    <li> I work for Mac cosmetics and wanted to really get my skin glowing for every foundation application. This is amazing all natural!! Cleared and cleaned my skin so amazing. MAKE SURE you moisturize your skin right after. This product soaks natural oils up so you want to immediately hydrate your skin. I highly recommend this product as an artist and skin care guru!!</li>
    <li> This soap is incredible I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t know about it earlier.  It last such a long time and gives a wonderful lather with a very earthy smell that I really like.  I wont ever buy any other brand soap from now on.  I bought this soap to help with my extreme eczema and it really reduces the itching and irritation I normally get with it.  I am sold on ABS and plan on using it exclusively for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I used to have really bad acne scars on my face and still on my arms and back..... but using this soap it has removed them almost completely....... I have never used anything like this and be so happy to continue using it..... :-)</li>
    <li> I was leary at first and almost decided not to order the African Black Soap.  I am so happy I ordred it.  The soap lathers up very well and cleans great.  It came in a 16 oz block and from the feel of it I imagined not being able to cut it into bath size soaps.  To my surprise I had no problem cutting it at all..  I gave my children and sister part of my bar and they love it too.</li>
    <li> This is the quality of black soap that I like.  It is soft with no added ingredients, so I can make body wash out of it as well.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this soap, my years of acne scars are quickly fading! I use in conjunction with coconut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Lots of lather. Will order again!</li>
    <li> Great soap. Works wonders on my skin. Not harsh.</li>
    <li> I bought one a few years ago and uses it up, and came across this one, this one stung my face like if it had alcohol in it. The first one I tried didn&#x27;t do that, and it was more effective for my acne.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get myself to keep using this because of the looks of it. But it did work great!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s soft and nice,rich foam, but the fishy smell is not so good~</li>
    <li> Will never buy again. Never!... This product is so bad it left me speechless.</li>
    <li> This is a huge bar of soap.  It looks rather like a large granola bar when you first unwrap it, but don&#x27;t eat it!  It&#x27;s soap!  I didn&#x27;t use a knife to cut off a bar, I just broke off a piece.  It&#x27;s a soft soap.  It lathers well, and white.  I use it to clean my face.  I put on a thick layer on castor oil on my face before I shower and let it soak in, then use this soap to wash it off.  So you know it cleans well if it can get off a thick layer of oil.  It hasn&#x27;t a light, slightly earthy smell to it, not unpleasant, but definitely not fragranced.  I am a chemical-free household, and am very sensitive to artificial scents, and this doens&#x27;t have any.  The smell does linger after showering though, sso you&#x27;ll continue to smell like soap for a few hours. Not a problem for me.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this soap and plan on continuing to use it.  The huge bar will likely last me a year or more.  Yes, it does have little grains of sand-stuff throughout it, and I suppose it could scratch you, but I use this bar straight on my body and haven&#x27;t gotten injured yet.  If I find a grain, I flick it out with my thumbnail or smudge it hard with my finger and it disappears. I do lather my fingers first before washing my face, I don&#x27;t put the bar straight on my face.  I&#x27;ve always felt clean and refeshed, and my face feels light and the skin smooth after using this soap.</li>
    <li> Im ready to order some more.</li>
    <li> I use this soap on my body and face. I used to have acne and although I eliminated it with medication, Black Soap has done a good job of keeping my face nice so far. I&#x27;m not sure how it works on non-medicated acne. I like it for the natural ingredients &amp; the squeaky clean feeling I get after each use. If anyone is concerned about the look or smell, it&#x27;s really not that bad. If you&#x27;re used to perfume-y and standard soap bars I could see how Black Soap would take some getting used to. A few drawbacks though are that after about a month or so of use my skin feels a little dry, but that&#x27;s easily fixable with moisturizer. Secondly, it dissolves when left in water so keep it dry when not using. But overall I enjoy using it. I&#x27;d recommend breaking or slicing off good sized chunks to use because if you take little pieces they&#x27;ll crumble right out of your fingers in the shower.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT GETS YOUR SKIN CLEAN AND SOFT ....AND IT HAS KEPT BLEMISHES AWAY FROM MY SOFT SUPPLE SKIN ..LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> This soap is the best! It is all natural made from natural ingredients and it cleans your skin so good My skin has cleared up dramatically, it has made my scars fade away and it exfoliates my skin like magic. i love it!! the soap it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I will definitely be buying some more.</li>
    <li> Such a big piece for that great price...even my sister uses it now</li>
    <li> My face can get dry and scaly - even with moisturizing. Using this soap to wash and then moisturizing with unrefined coconut oil...no more problems. Just sayin...</li>
    <li> helps remove dirt on surface and close pores.  thanks</li>
    <li> Ok so i have purchased many so called organic / natural soap bars. From dodo osun to locally made honey soaps and so on. I cant say this is the best but once my skin got accustom to the soap, the benefits were endless. My skin is not the greatest at all in sense of keepin moisture and blemishes. The first day i used this soap i dried up like an apple in a dehydrator. Felt like dexter was wrapping me up ready for the \\&quot;kill\\&quot;. But as with any new introduction i had to wait and keep pursuing, and it was worth it. After a week, my skin loves this stuff but be careful, it is natural and pressed, not molded so there will be edges that are harder and stiffer than others that will tend to scratch when scrubbed hard. I dont kill myself when scrubbing but i do get the job done. One morning i woke up and thought i had a vengeful ghost in my house as my back and arms were FULL of scratches but come to realize it was the inside edge of the soap. Not the soap but me and the way i used it. Nature is not perfect but she is damn close. THis not a perfect soap but it is damn good. No complaints and -1 star for how quickly it will dissolve in water when used everynight. Personally, i do not recommend scrubbing your face with this. It has no negative affects but a good scrub like Burts Bees Orange scrub can do the job properly for such a delicate area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High hopes for mankind my friends.</li>
    <li> I dream of the day this stuff is sold in supermarkets. I would buy it by the pound -- yes it&#x27;s THAT good. Regular soap just leaves more crap on your face while this actually makes my skin feel clean without drying it up. You really won&#x27;t realize how good this product is until you try it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. My son started using it to clear up his acne and it is working well. I use it to and it feels like it tightens your skin. It also makes it smooth and soft. Will purchase more.</li>
    <li> My brother uses this to help with the psoriasis he has on his arms, legs, stomach. This is working really well.</li>
    <li> Product delivered as described &amp; on time. Lathers great, cleans well without drying skin. If it lasted longer &amp; wasn&#x27;t wrapped/packaged in a piece of an old cement bag...literally, 5 stars all the way. Overall...good black soap!</li>
    <li> so freaking mad!!, i saw comments about hair in the soap and i thought they we&#x27;re being silly, NOPE! i break it up and there nothing... then i take a small ball of it to take my shower... enjoying this new found product my skin felt amazing, i go to get more lather AND THERE IS LITTLE BLACK HAIRS ON MY HAND!! i rub the ball again AND MORE CAME OUT ugh i love the soap but wtf MY HAIR IS DARK BROWN AND KINKY HAIR! I&#x27;m so sad cause i have a huge brick of this ish i have to go through sure its just hair so i just wash it out the soap but damn my house feels violated. for sure buying black soap again in two days i my skin feels so much better and i swim everyday and this stuff leaves my skin clean. so get black soap just not from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(will be updating  with photo when i get home)</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, packaged neatly.  Quality product with a light scent does the job.  I use it on my face every other day to help even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> nothing special i thought it was going to be something better then it is. there are many soaps better then this plus it smells horrible</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but I already feel a difference. My skin is much softer and brighter after about 5 days of use. A little really goes a long way. I made liquid soap for my hair and I use a chunk for my skin, and I still have a huge brick left. Also, a lot of people say it dries out your skin, but I feel the opposite. I can feels the oils still moisturizing my skin after washing. It may not be good for those with oil prone skin, or maybe its good to use just at nights, but my skin loves it. I also follow with Ambi daily moisturizer. I stopped using all my other cleansers and I will probably use this soap for a while.</li>
    <li> Very soft  its a good amount</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s helping my acne a lot and this amount of soap goes a looong way.</li>
    <li> this soap is soon amazing</li>
    <li> Worked for a little while then felt it started clogging my pores</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim. I&#x27;m not sure what all the claims are but I found it to be a very strong soap, capable of taking off a good day&#x27;s makeup and breaking up my eye makeup which most soaps don&#x27;t do very well. The most interesting and wonderful part of the soap is that you only need a tiny amount to create a rich lather. I mean a VERY tiny amount. I cut off a small chunk to use on my face and that chunk is still going strong! I get my hands wet and rub the chunk once and it lathers up my whole face. It leaves it with that \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel, that sort of clean soap residue that some soaps leave and I&#x27;m not sure if that is ideal or not for your face. I use this soap about 50% of the time or less since it is so strong but I do prefer it when I need to remove a face of heavy makeup. It does not seems to aggravate my acne-prone skin which is important to me. Although it is not the miracle acne product I had hoped, I do find it to be effective and cost-efficient because of the way it lasts, and I love that it is from Africa and a natural, handmade product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit** I wanted to do an update because I am so happy with this product. I have only been using it about 3-4 times a week on average for about 3.5 months but I am still using the small chunk I cut off, this stuff lasts forever. I really, really like it and I do feel it is working well for my skin. I highly recommend trying this if you like to use a strong face cleanser as opposed to a light cream-based cleanser. My face feels so clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, love this stuff</li>
    <li> Black soap has palm oil/palm kernal oil in it. Harvesting palm oil destroys rainforest?!</li>
    <li> My acne has been clearing up in just a few days of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my skincare routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I wash my face with African Black Soap using my Olay ProX Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) I moisturize with a few drops of Rosehip Seed Oil and Carrot Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;3) I then put a a few drops of Grapeseed Oil and Tea Tree Oil onto a cotton pad and rub onto my chin and forehead because this is where I mostly get acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And done! Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of weird but other then that it makes my skin fell so good. I use it after I use my body scrub.</li>
    <li> We called this &#x27;white&#x27; soap instead of black soap when we received this. It is a shame WanderingProphet no longer sells their black soap on Amazon as their soap was superior in color, texture and quality. Will not order this soap again.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after cleansing with the raw African black soap from Ghana.  Better than the proactive solution that I sometimes use for my adult acne.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap if you have ezcema.</li>
    <li> Its been almist a month now but didnt really see any drastic changes. Easy to use like the smell.</li>
    <li> I needed a new fragrance free soap that would not irritate my really sensitive skin. This soap is great in terms of taking care of my skin, but it does sort of fall apart and you need to be careful not to mess up the shower</li>
    <li> Incredible soap.  Very different from the highly processed soap I usually buy.  The texture is unique.  Wonderful for razor burn and other minor skin irritations.  Definitely want more.</li>
    <li> I am trying to go more natural, getting rid of the chemicals that I put \\&quot;on\\&quot; my body, not just in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap, it is inexpensive, basic and when I put in a bottle with water and shake it lathers LIKE CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good value, great product, very happy.  Has a slight fresh smell,not musty or earthy that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I am using organic cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with skin issues my whole life. Just started using this soap and love how soft its made my skin. I dont even notice a smell or coloring of my skin. Does have a tingle at times on my face but it doesnt hurt. Seems to be working great so far for me.</li>
    <li> OMG! Had this crazy rash on my face that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Within 2 days of using this the rash started to go away. I had to follow-up with some 100% cocoa butter to bring moisture back to my skin after using. This soap does WONDERS!!!</li>
    <li> This soap a definitely made an improvement on my teenage son&#x27;s skin. Facial blemishes have really cleared up!</li>
    <li> beware that this soap is very rough. The carbon bits are way to large and sharp to the point where i had deep scratches on my skin after using. I&#x27;ve been using raw black soap for years and never had this problem before. not sure if this was just a bad batch.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered in a timely matter. I live in the Virgin Islands so it shipped to Virginia and then it was shipped to me in the islands. The soap looks exactly like the picture and it is by far one of the best black soap bars that i have purchased to date. My whole family uses it and it is safe for all ages. Leaves our skin soft and refreshed. Great product...I plan on purchasing many times again...</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a miracle cure for dermatits and I came across this soap and all its good reviews. I gave it a try but it dried my skin out badly. If u have sensitive dry skin this is not the soap for you.</li>
    <li> I been using raw african soap for years. I use it for shampoo, face cleaning and much more. Great for removing make up too. And if you don&#x27;t melt it, it lasts so much longer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Easy on my skin and yet cleans well. Real soap. Smells nice without flowery fake scents. Will buy again and again if quality and service remain this high.</li>
    <li> When I received the package, I was kinda put off by the packaging; plus it looked nothing like the picture. Maybe I missed reading it somewhere, but the soap is really soft once wet and difficult to use with a wash cloth. On the plus side, it lathers super well and makes my skin look fresh and young!</li>
    <li> I take pride in my face/skin and I was a little skeptic at first, but my friend raved about it so much I decided to give it a try. I saw results in less than a week my complexion was so much more evened out and flawless. The best thing about this product is a little goes a long way so it will last a while and it makes such a rich lather leaving my skin feeling squeaky clean. I will never use anything other facial cleanser again.</li>
    <li> Very soapy and clears up skin</li>
    <li> I like it. I use it on my face mostly. It keeps my skin blackhead and bump free. Will definitely be buying some more when it runs out</li>
    <li> African Black Soap is my favorite soap for bathing.  So far, I have purchased three brands from Amazon.  One was heavily scented with fragrance.  I disliked the strong odor, please the fact that fragrance equates to unnatural chemicals.  Another brand was great, except that it had bits of grit that severely scratched my skin, when I rubbed the soap directly on my skin.  This particular brand that I am reviewing here has neither of those issues, so I like this one best.</li>
    <li> When I first got this soap it was loosely cut and some of the soap was crumbled and out of the saran wrap, but those were the least of my worries. Eager to use this &amp;#34;miracle soap&amp;#34; I immidiately jumped in the shower to give it a try, it lathered up nicely and had a great smell, not to mention on the first rinse it left my skin smooth and clean feeling, I had no doubt it was a thumbs up. That was until I looked into my wash cloth to notice short black hairs, at first I thought maybe it was my hair, ignoring the fact I had a wash cap on, but upon further inspection of the soap I was terrified to find clumps and clumps of hair embed all throughout the soap. I am utterly disgusted with this product and more so disappointed seeing that this soap had so much promise. I will try ordering black soap again, because I know it&#x27;s a great product but never from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I wanted to for this product.  I&#x27;ve used a couple different types of raw African Black Soap and I think this is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far. They all are pretty much the same with slight differences.  This one has a great lather and feels creamy, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t make it oily either.  I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, have VERY oily skin, and have found ABS soap to be the best on my face from all the different products I&#x27;ve used over the years. I wish I would have had this when I was younger.</li>
