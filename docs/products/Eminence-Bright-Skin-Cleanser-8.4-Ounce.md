### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t had anything from eminence that wasn&#x27;t awesome yet</li>
      <li>Excellent at removing make-up AND moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is not the best to take off make up at the end of the day, a bit of a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
      <li>and this is no exception great cleanser without being drying</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>But it cleans my face without stripping it, has a pleasant smell, removes makeup well</li>
      <li>I purchased the Bright Skin Cleanser for myself</li>
      <li>I use in combination with the bright skin masque.</li>
      <li>It is a really good skin cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I have wonderful success with this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I love eminence products but the Bright Skin cleanser and moisturizer smell like Tide, so I would not buy again.</li>
      <li>so I had to transfer to my own bottle.</li>
      <li>Love this product - It is a great cleanser, yet mild to your skin.</li>
      <li>and this is more of a cream/lotion cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Had experienced it at a spa...love the whole line.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE SMELL</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the products in this line.  </li>
      <li>Love the product, but my pump arrived not working</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the stone crop line but wanted more help with sun damage.  </li>
      <li>The Eminence Bright Skin Cleanser really did make a difference.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The cleanser is creamy and glides easily on your skin.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feel clean and removes any impurities</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean, yet smooth immediately after cleansing.</li>
      <li>I was astounded to report that she was right!  </li>
      <li>That is a huge success for me because he is picky.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at my local spa hoping that it it would act synergistically with the Bright Skin Masque and the Stone Crop Serum</li>
      <li>The skin felt good after applying and rinsing the cleanser, the big problem is: this stuff does NOT cleanse the skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like this as much as Eminence&#x27;s stone Crop Gel Wash, but I thought I&#x27;d try it as it&#x27;s more affordable.</li>
      <li>I love how the texture of my skin just changed after using Eminence Bright Skin Cleanser for just a few days.</li>
      <li>It seems to cleanse fine, but would not buy again purely based on the scent.</li>
      <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do any cleaning, I&#x27;ve used it by itself and with my clairsonic, my face still isn&#x27;t clean.</li>
      <li>Arrived very fast.  </li>
      <li>If you want skin brightening, that stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I wish I&#x27;d just spent more and not switched.</li>
      <li>My skin is breaking out more and feels drier (compared to how my skin felt with the other wash).</li>
      <li>AND THAT ITS ALL NATURAL BUT PREFER A LATHER AND MAYBE A SLIGHT SCRUB WOULD BE NICE</li>
      <li>you are looking for an good quality cleanser that actually cleanses, try the Shea and Aloe Facial Cleanser from 360 Skin Care [[ASIN:B009YBEFPM Unscented Shea &amp; Aloe Facial Cleanser]]</li>
      <li>I bought the Coconut cleanser from this line for my 12 year old son who is interested in taking care of his skin and is cleansing daily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old...</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
      <li>Since my discovery, I have only used it in the morning (because my skin is relatively clean after the evening cleansing routine and it only has the oils produced during the night) but have not seen any improvement on my hyper-pigmentation with the use of this and the other Eminence products mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am not sure if it is really supposed to do that though if you don&#x27;t use the whole program.</li>
      <li>Especially for people with sensitive skin and skin issues.</li>

    <li> I purchased the Bright Skin Cleanser for myself and I absolutely love it. My skin feels clean, yet smooth immediately after cleansing. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry afterward either which I find with other cleansers. I bought the Coconut cleanser from this line for my 12 year old son who is interested in taking care of his skin and is cleansing daily. He loves the scent, and the way it makes his skin feel. That is a huge success for me because he is picky.</li>
    <li> Love this product - It is a great cleanser, yet mild to your skin. Longlasting - only a few drops will do it each time you cleanse your face.</li>
    <li> I use several &amp;#34;bright skin&amp;#34; products; I have melasma and I think it works. This stuff is not the best to take off make up at the end of the day, a bit of a &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feel. BUT, I use it in the morning to take off all my acne stuff and use something else at night. I&#x27;ll get it again. I use in combination with the bright skin masque. If you want skin brightening, that stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin feel clean and removes any impurities but I can&#x27;t see it removing any dark spots.  I am not sure if it is really supposed to do that though if you don&#x27;t use the whole program.</li>
    <li> I tend to prefer foaming cleanser and this is more of a cream/lotion cleanser.  I have not noticed any reduction in hyperpigmentation but I don&#x27;t think you can actually expect that when it&#x27;s only on your face a couple of minutes while washing.  But it cleans my face without stripping it, has a pleasant smell, removes makeup well and I like that it&#x27;s organic.  I will probably go with a foaming cleanser next time though.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL AND THAT ITS ALL NATURAL BUT PREFER A LATHER AND MAYBE A SLIGHT SCRUB WOULD BE NICE</li>
    <li> Did not like this product.  Would not use it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do any cleaning, I&#x27;ve used it by itself and with my clairsonic, my face still isn&#x27;t clean. It really isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have wonderful success with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Excellent at removing make-up AND moisturizing. Will buy this line again. Had experienced it at a spa...love the whole line.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but my pump arrived not working so I had to transfer to my own bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local spa hoping that it it would act synergistically with the Bright Skin Masque and the Stone Crop Serum I religiously use every morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is creamy and glides easily on your skin. I usually use circular motions to loosen up the makeup/dirt, then rinse with lukewarm water. The skin felt good after applying and rinsing the cleanser, the big problem is: this stuff does NOT cleanse the skin. After a couple of nights of trying it sans toner and feeling sort of a buildup sensation, I used my toner after cleansing and was extremely disappointed to see all the makeup/dirt residue in the cotton pad. As a cleanser is worthless and I am not sure how good it would be to improve pigmentation issues. Since my discovery, I have only used it in the morning (because my skin is relatively clean after the evening cleansing routine and it only has the oils produced during the night) but have not seen any improvement on my hyper-pigmentation with the use of this and the other Eminence products mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would give it zero stars because it does not serve its purpose and the hefty price tag. I do not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an good quality cleanser that actually cleanses, try the Shea and Aloe Facial Cleanser from 360 Skin Care [[ASIN:B009YBEFPM Unscented Shea &amp; Aloe Facial Cleanser]]</li>
    <li> I love how the texture of my skin just changed after using Eminence Bright Skin Cleanser for just a few days.</li>
    <li> For the price I am not thinking it is any different than Aveeno, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast.  Love the products in this line.  I&#x27;ve been using the stone crop line but wanted more help with sun damage.  Received the wash yesterday and plan to use it with the correlating cream during the day and continue with the stone crop line at night.  I ordered the cream from another vendor and it hasn&#x27;t been shipped yet as of today.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this as much as Eminence&#x27;s stone Crop Gel Wash, but I thought I&#x27;d try it as it&#x27;s more affordable. My skin is breaking out more and feels drier (compared to how my skin felt with the other wash). I wish I&#x27;d just spent more and not switched.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had anything from eminence that wasn&#x27;t awesome yet and this is no exception great cleanser without being drying</li>
    <li> I love eminence products but the Bright Skin cleanser and moisturizer smell like Tide, so I would not buy again. It seems to cleanse fine, but would not buy again purely based on the scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is a really good skin cleanser.  Especially for people with sensitive skin and skin issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old...a friend recommended the product because SHE uses it and sees a difference.  I was skeptical.  She got me a sample of the product and I tried it for two weeks.  I was astounded to report that she was right!  The Eminence Bright Skin Cleanser really did make a difference.  I&#x27;ve not mentioned that I&#x27;m using it, but several people have commented lately that my face is looking younger....I don&#x27;t know WHY it works, but it does.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
