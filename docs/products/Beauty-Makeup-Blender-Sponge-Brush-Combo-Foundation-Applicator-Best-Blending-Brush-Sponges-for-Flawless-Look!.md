      <li>anks for your review of Purple Beauty Makeup Blender Sponge Foundation Applicator Brush - Best Pro Airbrushed Look and Unvarying Coverage Without Even Trying - Natural Ergonomic Wooden Handle Keeps Your Hands Clean - Smooth Texture, Ample Size - Makes a Great Gift!</li>

      <li>Use a mild soap (I prefer Dial Antibacterial) and warm water.</li>

      <li>They were too porous and absorbed most of what I would put on them.</li>
      <li>It makes my face smooth and my makeup is applied evenly.</li>
      <li>This brush is really easy to clean</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic brush combo.</li>
      <li>Having an applicator with multiple purposes is great to save space in my ever growing makeup collection.</li>
      <li>The application of foundation is smooth and goes not streak.</li>
      <li>The sponge side creates a nice air brush soft texture where the brush is better for covering problematic areas and getting around corners of the nose.</li>
      <li>Over time, that equated to higher costs on foundation since you&#x27;re using more but applying less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used one to apply my powder and just like the sponge it applies it evenly and leaves my face looking fresh!</li>
      <li>I hear so many positive things about using beauty sponges to apply foundation</li>
      <li>At first sight, the spong/brush looks like it could be found in a high quality magazine ad (truly exquisite); however, you won&#x27;t find this unique beauty blending combo spong at any of the local cosmetics counter</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have an arsenal of brushes, sponges,and other foundation applicators that I have collected over the years. . .which are now going in the trash!  This is by far the best makeup brush that I have ever used.  The soft sponge side works to blend in powder effortlessly.  You can use this sponge side alone or in conjunction with the brush.  I plan on purchasing on several more of these and I highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have never used these types of brushes before so I am glad I was able to try this. It works great! It makes my face smooth and my makeup is applied evenly. I love the brush as well. I&#x27;ve never used one to apply my powder and just like the sponge it applies it evenly and leaves my face looking fresh! I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!! The sponge is nice and thick, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all and the brush is nice and soft so its not like scratching your face off! The handle part of the brush is nice and sturdy so I don&#x27;t feel like its going to crack when I use it. All in all this is a high quality item for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great quality and blush brush doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> Very versatile quality brush! Definately a tool I will put to good use!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It smelled a little chemically when I opened it but the smell quickly disappeared. This brush is so much better than my beauty blender. Sponge covers and blends great. I have two so I will never be without one</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, especially if you are short on space so having a two-in-one is necessary. I love the sponge for putting on foundation and the brush works great for powder or blush. The tool did have a strong petrol odor when it first arrived, but after it was out of the packaging for awhile the smell dissipated. I haven&#x27;t noticed an odor since.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed, thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup brush. I usually buy the cheapest thing I can find because I assume that they are alike, but I was wrong. This brush is the brush to end all brushes. I&#x27;ve replaced several lower end brushes with this one. Both the sponge and the brush are smooth, consistent, and durable. Makeup applies easier and more evenly before. A fantastic brush that will be the key piece to your makeup kit.</li>
    <li> This was a great product. I got this for a gift as well as myself and I love it. The sponge is soft and makes make-up easy to apply. The brush is soft as well. This is such a great product! When I am looking for a make-up sponge and make-up brush I look for something soft and applies make-up smoothly and keeps it on all day. This product does just that. You will want to have this product. Just buy it, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service! Great product. Refer to my previous post for more details</li>
    <li> Sponge was detached from the stick. Could see three hot glue inside that supposedly was supposed to keep it together! Was expecting the sponge to be a little bigger and soft like the beauty blotter that i use! And a little m more durable!</li>
    <li> The item broke the same day it arrived and the sponge was hard</li>
    <li> This duo brush and sponge set is really neat! I like that the sponge can be used in the small and narrow spaces sround the eyes and nose area and the brush is really nice and soft. I did have a problem with the handle where the brush is attached to, it got loose while applying my blush. I did manage to glue it back together but hopefully they won&#x27;t all have this problem. But once everything is intact this brush works really well. In the pic below you will see me using the sponge side for my concealer. Also I used the brush side for my blush and bronzer . I give it 4 stars!</li>
    <li> The sponge isn&#x27;t soft at all even after wetting it, and the brush came broken/detached from the wand (it wasn&#x27;t glued very good?)  Great idea but I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brush! I love that the bristles are very soft and the sponge is actually really durable.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge has a strong chemical smell, I&#x27;m sure it will fade after use though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> I received this brush as a sample for evaluation and I really like it! I have never used a blender tool like this one but have heard great things about them. Now I see why they are so popular. The blender sponge allows me to get around my nose and eyes really well. It&#x27;s just so much more precise  than the round flat sponges or wedges. I mostly use this for my powder foundation but it works just as good with liquid foundation. The blender is nice and firm so it doesn&#x27;t collapse easily with firm pressure.I have large pores so this helps me get a much better coverage that I have a hard time achieving with other sponges.  I was also very impressed by the brush side, it was more precise than my current blush brush. I also like the two in one for space saving. Overall I am very happy with this and have had no issues with it.</li>
    <li> I love this applicator, the sponge is great for my foundation, and the brush works wonders with my powder foundation.  The brush is soft, and the sponge leaves my foundation like it has been airbrushed.  I recommend this applicator!</li>
    <li> What I Love about Flawless Face Combo Tool:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The sponge absorbs water quite well, which is wonderful for application of cream foundation (pictures below - before &amp; after water)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The sponge does not absorb products very much, which is a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The brush bristles are very soft and hold the right amount of powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This tool is perfect for travel since its a two-in-one, and the handle prevents me searching for the sponge applicator in my bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Critiques of this Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Keep in mind, this is no Beauty Blender.  The sponge is a bit stiff; so its harder to apply creams using&lt;br /&gt;the stippling technique to which I&#x27;ve grown accustomed with my beauty blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is a slight learning curve with the dual-ended product; it takes a little bit of getting used to, but its definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Came apart before first use</li>
    <li> I love the versatility of this makeup applicator. The sponge side creates a nice air brush soft texture where the brush is better for covering problematic areas and getting around corners of the nose. This brush is really easy to clean and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles being shed yet.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup applicator! Having one tool to apply and blend in my foundation and powder. The shape of the sponge end is perfect to get the large areas of face while the pointed end is perfect for around the nose and eyes. No more mess with holding directly onto a sponge caked with makeup. This sponge soaks up enough to apply but not so much that all your makeup ends up in the sponge itself. The other end is a soft bristle and works perfectly for the final touches of blending in the powder. The bristles don&#x27;t fall out onto your face as with some. Both ends are very soft to the the skin. I washed both ends gently with a mild face cleaner in warm water and set out to dry naturally and it still works great! I also found that the tipped end of the sponge is great for cleaning up a messy mascara application right under my eye. You know when you get that occasional splatter or you blink at the worst time and then have mascara everywhere on your fingers while you&#x27;re trying to touch that up without making a mess of the rest? This worked perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I really love this makeup brush combo. It is the perfect foundation brush. The sponge on one side and the brush on the other. It is a lot more convenient than pulling out two brushes, and I can really appreciate the design of it. The quality of the brush is really amazing as well. It has never once lost bristles on me nor has the sponge had any flaws. It also puts and blends makeup with ease. I would highly recommend this brush combo, and in my opinion will be the next hot item for makeup artists like myself.</li>
    <li> Love this dual end brush!! Applies great makeup and gets good coverage</li>
    <li> Beautiful Brush&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is easy to clean and about half the size of beauty blender when its ready to use. The other side of the brush is soft and I use it to apply powder.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup all of the time, but when I do I love to have it look as natural as possible and with the Flawless faces combo brush it blends my makeup into my face a lot better than other brush and helps me to get the look that I&#x27;m trying for where it doesn&#x27;t look too dark. I love that it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 brush instead of having to look for the other applicator all I have to do is grab the one and apply.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush combo. I use the spongy side to apply my foundation, which goes on smoothly and evenly thanks to this brush, and I use the other side to apply a light bronzer. The bristles on the brush are firm enough to pick up and spread the bronzer, yet soft enough to smooth it out without causing any sort of irritation. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Absolute crap. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Adore this makeup brush. One thing I love is having both options at hand. I like to keep my to go makeup bag very light. I don&#x27;t like packing a lot, the less I have to take along the better! Well a brush doesn&#x27;t always do the trick and a sponge can soak up too much product so I prefer to apply with a brush and blend with the sponge afterwards so I love having both together like this. The brush part cleans up easy I just use a drop of Dawn dish soap and do circular motions in my hand and rinse, just like I would all my makeup brushes. The brush is soft like a BLUSH BRUSH or a bronzer brush would be. Both ends of the brush seem to be secured onto the wooden handle very secure, not loose like my elf brushes. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest non bias review.</li>
    <li> This is a super useful (and convenient) tool to have in your makeup bag. Use the sponge for applying your foundation and the brush for applying you powder. It&#x27;s pretty straight forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is soft, yet firm. It&#x27;s exactly what it needs to be to ensure full coverage. Until now, i&#x27;ve been using those cheap foam wedges that you get at the dollar store (or Walmart). This is MUCH better! The foam wedges seemed to devour my makeup. They were too porous and absorbed most of what I would put on them. Over time, that equated to higher costs on foundation since you&#x27;re using more but applying less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is simple too. Use a mild soap (I prefer Dial Antibacterial) and warm water. Use a hand towel to squeeze the extra water out. That&#x27;s it. All clean and ready for next time!</li>
    <li> At first sight, the spong/brush looks like it could be found in a high quality magazine ad (truly exquisite); however, you won&#x27;t find this unique beauty blending combo spong at any of the local cosmetics counter (I&#x27;ve looked!).  It&#x27;s truly the best of both worlds...just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I got it today and went to wash/rinse it out.  When I squeezed the water out, it tore from the rod.  It also smelled a bit like .. I guess the factory.  I have the beauty blender and this doesn&#x27;t even come close.  This is a nice attempt and a good idea.  Overall, though it was a poorly designed product.  It makes sense that the sponge will tear from the sharp metal edge.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on this.  #straighttrash</li>
    <li> This is an excellent make up brush and sponge tool. It is convenient that it has both tools on the same brush because I use the sponge first with my liquid foundation and then do my powder foundation with the brush end. The sponge does an excellent job of spreading out my liquid foundation and making it look absolutely flawless. I would recommend this to anyone looking end up with a flawless finish to their makeup and also have a super convenient tool.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It blends my makeup better than the wedges you buy at drugstores, and better than the paintbrush style ones too.  After playing with it, it&#x27;s more comfortable for me to grab the actual sponge instead of the handle- I feel like I have more control that way. Because of that I don&#x27;t think it will break off the handle for me. I also like that there a powder brush on the other end though so I have everything I need in one place and don&#x27;t need to carry around two applicators for my foundation and powder!  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bristles falling out of the brush side either like some of the cheap brushes!</li>
    <li> Love this concept. I have seen double-ended makeup brushes before but never with a foundation sponge on one end and a powder brush on the other. The sponge is nice and firm and not flimsy like some of these knock-off sponges you see in the stores. The brush end is full and great for applying powder or blush,it is soft,not scratchy. This  brush/sponge is great for people like me who do not have a lot of space for their makeup products. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new makeup tool or someone who does not have a lot of space. I was given this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This makeup tool had a strong smell when I first opened the package which is very strange because I didn&#x27;t notice a smell on the sponge tool that didn&#x27;t have the brush on the end by the same exact brand. It&#x27;s normal to have a subtle smell on fresh brushes but this one was pretty strong. I was still very happy with this tool. The sponge end was sturdy unlike other sponge tools I have tried that just ripped off. I liked that I was able to use a little pressure without worrying that it was just going to fall apart. The the brush end dispersed and blended product evenly and didn&#x27;t shed. The sponge end was very easy to clean and the color keeps it looking clean even after you use it. I can&#x27;t stand makeup blenders that look filthy no matter how hard you try to clean them. It blends wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t absorb all of your product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of juggling multiple tools first thing in the morning when I&#x27;m trying to head out the door, so I was very excited to see a truly functional multi-tool! The sponge tip is a bit wide but I found it easy to use the tip to get fine details, and my foundation has never looked so flawless! The brush end worked beautifully for a light layer of powder. This is a sturdy brush with a good weight to it and it has quickly become a regular in my morning routine!</li>
    <li> On my first attempt to use it, this happen it seperated from the base, I had to use Crazy Glue to put it nk together...however it did arrived on time...I will not order any more..</li>
    <li> I really liked the idea about this beauty tool that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this out. I hear so many positive things about using beauty sponges to apply foundation but they cost way to much. This product I thought I can use the sponge end for foundation and the brush end for powder and I was right because it worked well. My foundation was blended nicely and the pointed tip help me get into those hard to reach area on my face. Its not to soft or to hard I like how it felt when blending my foundation and it didn&#x27;t soaked up all the product in the sponge, which was a concern at first. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a new makeup application tool. I will definitely continue to use this product its really nice.</li>
    <li> As a huge makeup enthusiast, I was super excited to be able to try out this product. Having an applicator with multiple purposes is great to save space in my ever growing makeup collection. I was pleasantly surprised to see that is wasn&#x27;t a tiny applicator tool. The applicator tool is large, but not too large in my opinion. The blender end is soft and allows me to evenly distribute my foundation onto my face and neck. The brush end is soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other brands often do. My one major issue with this tool is the smell. It had a horrible chemical smell when I opened the plastic bag it came in. The smell still remains, but not as strong. I am hoping that the smell goes away after a couple washings. I don&#x27;t want to have to discontinue use because of the smell, but it is pretty bad and irritates my senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this applicator, the sponge is great for my foundation, and the brush works wonders with my powder foundation. The brush is soft, and the sponge leaves my foundation like it has been airbrushed. I recommend this applicator!</li>

    <li> I love this brush. First of all the purple color is simply beautiful! I was amazed bright and depth of the color. I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I have to say that I honestly love and use the brush daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning for work I am in a hurry trying to do make up, my hair and get lunch ready. This brush is easy to work with because of its size and I love the soft sponge for concealer application. The application of foundation is smooth and goes not streak. This brush is perfect for on the go and travel needs! It has multiple uses and with two brushes it is very convenient. The sponge is perfect for liquid foundation and the brush can be used for blush or a finishing powder. The bristles of the white brush are soft and very secure, they do not fall out when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge makeup tool fan and this brush is amazing. The size of the brush is perfect for me, it saves me space by combining two brushes in one and reduces the stress of having to carry around several brushes on my trips. Cleaning the brush is also very simple on both side and the bristles do not fall out. I highly recommend this high quality brush!</li>
    <li> Nice brush picks up foundation very well and applying easy I will recommend this to a friend.</li>
