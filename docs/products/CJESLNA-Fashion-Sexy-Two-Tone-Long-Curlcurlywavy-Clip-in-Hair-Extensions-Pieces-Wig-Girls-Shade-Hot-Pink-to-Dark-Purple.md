      <li>Other than that it was a great buy!</li>
      <li>This might be an easy fix if you can hand sew or have a sewing machine to reinforce the stitching that&#x27;s already there that connects the fibers to the mesh piece.</li>

      <li>but they are actually pretty nice.</li>

      <li>If your looking for good quality hair extensions you should definitely consider uniwigs because I tried everything g else</li>
      <li>The color was just like pictured and not bad quality for the price.</li>
      <li>They are really vibrant and soft and look totally amazing !</li>
      <li>The color is a bit faded compared to the picture but other than that great</li>
      <li>so I can look more realistic</li>
      <li>Its exactly how it is in the picture will only be able to wear temporally tho, but it expected with the price, I love the color tho!!!</li>
      <li>It is very secure and very soft.</li>

      <li>This is really pretty!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many of these before and they were pretty decent for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a fun piece for anyone&#x27;s collection.</li>
      <li>I think the quality is worth the money paid.  </li>
      <li>So, you&#x27;re looking for fun extensions to wear out at night or with a costume, I would recommend this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Barbie hair u get what u pay for</li>
    <li> The hair is heavy and gets tangled really fast. I had to blow dry it straight for two reasons: it was wet when i pulled it out the package, as if it was just dyed and washed(it smelled bad too) and because the ends were ratchet. this hair tangled quickly so i would suggest blow drying it if you want it either straight or to be less tangled. but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Okay, so I had never used or even touched hair extensions. These were just a little experiment, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But they are great! Pretty, the perfect thickness and length, easy to clip in, and nicely curled. I going to order more for sure!</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s not made to really last forever, but I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months and have worn it about 5 times once to the club, and also while dealing with my 2 year old and it stays on nicely. I&#x27;ve even washed it and blow dried it once so far and it still looks nice. All and all a good buy. Not something to wear everyday if you&#x27;re planning on it lasting a while.</li>
    <li> I received mine with a very strong chemical smell AND  2 broken clips. thanks a lot! and wont let me add the photo. nice!</li>
    <li> Hair is a beautiful color, however, after three days wearing it became so tangled that it was impossible to detangle. Looks too bad to wear, so I purchased human hair extensions. I will never purchase synthetic hair again.</li>
    <li> About what I expected, it took about a month to order. For the price they&#x27;re ok. It&#x27;s just one piece so if you&#x27;re adding color underneath your hair they are perfect, if you are extending your natural hair you may want to order two or three. It wasn&#x27;t the color ordered, but I didn&#x27;t mind much.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think my hair was that long... I attached the extension right at the top of my ears and my hair covered the extension.  It would work is your hair isn&#x27;t so long... I think the quality is worth the money paid.  Not very long lasting - maybe a few times if you don&#x27;t go dancing or anything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
    <li> Far, far too long for my shoulder-length hair. The end result it that it looks super fake, even though on its own the curl is quite fetching and natural.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible wtf,I hate the smell</li>
    <li> The wait wasn&#x27;t too bad. The hair looks great exactly like the pic. Its soft and doesn&#x27;t look FAKE. Only problem is my hair is wayyy too long for it so you can&#x27;t see it ... 😒😳</li>
    <li> So, you&#x27;re looking for fun extensions to wear out at night or with a costume, I would recommend this.  If you&#x27;re trying to fool some people into thinking this is your natural hair, stay away.  The color was as portrayed but it did have a synthetic smell right out of the packaging so I hung it up to air out and now it&#x27;s fine.  One of the clips on the end of the track wasn&#x27;t completely attached but I fixed that with a sewing kit.  I haven&#x27;t tried using any styling tools on this so I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not that would work.  For the price, it was a good purchase although I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ll be able to wear it before it looks tangled.  I would purchase this product again for a costume.</li>
    <li> This was great fun and so pretty,easy to use</li>
    <li> it is good but can u straighten it</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll have fun with this at college this fall. She loves changing her hair up.</li>
    <li> I love these hair extensions. They give my hair a fun look, they are a bit long but nothing a pair of scissors can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and super fun. Love the fact that i can use this as an alternative to harsh chemicals on my hair.....took about 4 weeks to recieve though</li>
    <li> Beautiful wonderful feels real an very soft curls perfect</li>
    <li> Pretty! came faster than expected</li>
    <li> i ordered this may 20th. it says that i should get it by july 2.  i checked the mail and its already here. an entire month early.  beautiful color cant wait to wear it!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake. Tangles easly. Should have bought some from Sally&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not good quality and it tangles real easy. Over all it a waste of money</li>
    <li> Very vibrant colors. Need 2 hair pieces to make it look nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft and comfortable c: I noticed that some people find it to be shorter than their actual hair, but they have to take into consideration that if it is curled it will be shorter. It is a tad bit shiny and frizzy, but doing those de-shineing treatment soaks should help. I would definitely purchase again. It&#x27;s a great price, great color blend, and the delivery was fast :D</li>
    <li> Great of you already have long hair and want to add color: bad if your adding length</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it cause there was a odor to it</li>
    <li> allot better then I expected for 5.00 and super long too!</li>
    <li> Totally Awesome!!!!!! I Love It Love It!!! The hair was totally worth buying!!!!!!!!!!  Buy it! Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> I received these on time. The color was just like pictured and not bad quality for the price.I really liked how these looked while braided into my hair. The only thing I did not like is that they feel heavy when clipped in.</li>
    <li> Darker than I expected. Never wore this outside. There&#x27;s that funny eeky smell. It&#x27;s short for my hair too haha.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the color I ordered. I got red with black at the bottom. And the hair stunk something awful!!!! A horrid chemical smell. Washed it 2 times and soaked overnite, in the strongest smelling shampoo I have, and still had that smell. Don&#x27;t like the clips, they are put in by little bolts which are impossible to remove w/o damaging hair. They were in places that didn&#x27;t work.  I can&#x27;t use this color, and don&#x27;t know anyome who wants to.  Maybe some hallowen, someone might? There was nothing I liked about this hair. A bunch of stinky, ugly colored hair. The smell was revolting. My cats went nuts. Plus, not geting the color I ordered, I feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is really pretty! It&#x27;s not as long as I thought it was going to be but the color is vibrant! It hasn&#x27;t shed at all and the clips are great and don&#x27;t slip out. I bought one but I might get one more just to make it blend a bit better. My hair is short so if you have longer hair you only need one. Great product for the price! Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> bought it a while ago , and i have yet to ware it &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; tried it at home , and it itches bad. probably because its fake hair.</li>
    <li> Loved the bright colors of the wig! I was hoping it would keep its curls better.  When I got one knot in it, it created a bigger mess that I had to brush out.</li>
    <li> You need to buy at least two.  THey tangle and get ratty easily.  You can&#x27;t use heat tools on them.  They are a ONE TIME use item</li>
    <li> Item broke on first application a clip came off the thread. Is not enough hair to cover my head so looks terrible. Took absolutely a life time to get here. The only reason I gave 2 instead of one star is because the people selling it contacted me to let me know that it was arriving earlier than they though and that I like the colour of it though I had originally expected the upper half to be brighter pink. Overall not happy with purchase waste of money but then again I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love the colors but it does have a fake look to it</li>
    <li> Came more curly then shown in picture but if you run your fingers through it breaks it apart a bit. a little shorter then expected but looks and feels real. i would buy again</li>
    <li> There was a lot of fallout when trying to untangle the ends. Other than that it was a great buy!</li>
    <li> The color is great but hate how shiny it looks it makes it appear fake. Also the extensions sheds like crazy and the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; bunches up making them appear unnatural.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair extension for my 7 year old and she loves it.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! Good for one time use</li>
    <li> It looks gorgeous! my hair is short so its a little akward but styled right its everything I imagined bought another extension to blend in.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this hair and its such a beautiful color. Believe me my friends couldn&#x27;t tell it was fake lol cause of how pretty the curls were. When I walked into my favors store people loved it. But if you want to make it look more real you should definitely curl your natural hair first then apply them so I can look more realistic but overall I loved it. If your looking for good quality hair extensions you should definitely consider uniwigs because I tried everything g else and it got messed up the next day and uniwigs can lost a pretty long time with proper care.</li>
    <li> It was awesome! One thing to remember if you have thick hair it looks different in a cool way but you might want 2 it is a amazing product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS EXTENSIONS :) I even ironed them to make them straight and they turned out perfectly! I love them both straight and curly :) Def buy they are great for the amazing price their being sold at :)</li>
    <li> It was very bright n colorful the clips were very sturdy and hair price was great quality.. Tho it was I bite shiny I put a lil hair powder on hair piece. I put the hair in and it didn&#x27;t slide out witch would have been embarrassing.. I would buy again..</li>
    <li> absolutely love these extensions! they aren&#x27;t as shiny as most synthetic extensions giving them a more natural appearance and they don&#x27;t have any smell of chemicals at all! they do tangle a little easily but nothing a brush cant fix. will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> It came all tangled and I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
    <li> you can tell its fake but it looks ok when it is styled right</li>
    <li> product was actually soft and does not feel too fake. The extension can be worn higher or lower depending on the desired length. The purple and blue is not as loud as it seems on the screen, which can be perfect for even everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;Really love this product, and would recommend for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;If you can wait for longer shipping, there are other sellers on Amazon that sells for cheaper...</li>
    <li> Fits well and made well. The color is a bit faded compared to the picture but other than that great</li>
    <li> They took along time to get here but they are actually pretty nice. Unfortunately by the time I got them I had cut my hair and they didn&#x27;t look very good with my bob haircut. So I straightened them out and cut them to fit the length of my hair, so now they look like cute hot pink peekaboo highlights!</li>
    <li> Really pretty in person. Theyre not super shiny like other clip ins I have gotten but they look like &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hair. They smell like plastic but I  used some Pantene detangler on them and fixed the prob. It was shipped from China so it took me about a month to rcve. Id buy again but I wouldnt want to wait forever to receive it like I did this time.</li>
    <li> I ordered these fun colorful extensions for a concert I was going to. They were inexpensive to say the least, so I thought if they weren&#x27;t what I was looking for then no big deal. They came within two days, and were so fun and easy to clip in! They come curled already, and have five clips to snap right on to under your hair. They weren&#x27;t heavy or falling out, they were perfect!</li>
    <li> The hair does not curl and the hair falls out before its first use.</li>
    <li> it gets tangled as soon as you put it on</li>
    <li> Its exactly how it is in the picture will only be able to wear temporally tho, but it expected with the price, I love the color tho!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this off wish, I like it but its not full like I thought it would b! But although I still like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with synthetic hair extensions before, so I know how to style them (curl or straighten) without burning them. But anyone who hasn&#x27;t will have problems. They tangle super easy and then they aren&#x27;t usable! I got two uses out of them and then had to throw away 👎</li>
    <li> Overall it was nice.&lt;br /&gt;but one of the clips came broken .so I was not able to keep it in .even with pins :(</li>
    <li> I purchased the pink &amp; purple extentions and they are a very pretty color. I only wear them if I&#x27;m putting my hair in a braid. But they do get tangled very easily.</li>
    <li> Very cute. Bough for my daughter. She is having trouble getting if to &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; into her hair. But her friend said she will teach her.</li>
    <li> Great way to get a little goofy with your hair without bleaching the crap out of it and leaking Manic Panic everywhere. Will definitely order from again.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t look like the color I thought it was going to be. a little disappointing. errrr,</li>
    <li> Buy two instead of one,its nice but thin.</li>
    <li> Very thick and abundant! Long even, big detail for layered medium length hair when putting it on. The waves are wide and beautiful.</li>
    <li> omg i love this so much</li>
    <li> I will never buy hair off of here waster of my money</li>
    <li> Vibrant color! Beautiful curls! I can&#x27;t wait to style my daughters hair and put this in! Trial run was perfect!</li>
    <li> I  have long brown hair and wanted to add a little temporary color without the damage. While these extensions are synthetic they are still great quality! I can&#x27;t wait to order them in every color as its the perfect amount of fun to spice up your hair!!!</li>
    <li> When I opened the box to see what it would look like it was three colors instead of 2 like it was supposed to be I ordered light purple and dark purple not bright green dark purple and light purple I was very disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted!</li>
    <li> This is a fun piece for anyone&#x27;s collection. I believe with proper care it could last a long time.</li>
    <li> They are so beautiful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many of these before and they were pretty decent for the price. Unfortunately, this one seems to fall apart a lot. By fall apart, I mean I am often finding strands just falling out. I don&#x27;t think they were sewn in too well and the one clip is starting to fall off as well. This might be an easy fix if you can hand sew or have a sewing machine to reinforce the stitching that&#x27;s already there that connects the fibers to the mesh piece. This is the only one out of 5 (I ordered a bunch in different colors) that has this issue, so it must just be a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, other than that minor issue, the color is vibrant and it blends into my natural hair quite well.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome color combo. It&#x27;s extremely curly and thick so you have to curl your hair when wearing it. I got this like 8 months ago and it&#x27;s still held its curl and looks nice. I have shorter hair so I cut mine down and ended up removing all the ombre but the pink alone still looks cool.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my new look complete! Thanks!</li>
    <li> i just recieved it yesterday i love it! I had to trim mine way to long for me,It did smell funny i just sprayed it down with my sea salt spray smells way better, and very light feeling also witch is great...thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of darker than in the picture. It is very secure and very soft. The curls never undo no matter how much you run your fingers through them</li>
    <li> SUPER HEAVY. Would NEVER be able to wear comfortably!!</li>
    <li> These hair extentions are so beautiful! They are really vibrant and soft and look totally amazing ! I was sceptic all at first because of the price, but they are SO worth it !</li>
