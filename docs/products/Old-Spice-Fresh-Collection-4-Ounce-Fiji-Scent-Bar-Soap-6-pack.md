<li> This package came up with a search of &amp;#34;soap on a rope&amp;#34; and other items were actually soap on a rope, so that is what I expected, not 6 normal bars of soap :(</li>
<li> While I use the products because I like the scent I also like the fact that the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
<li> My boyfriend used to use plain, boring Dial soap that smells like laundry detergent but this soap smells so masculine and irresistible.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i could still pick up the scent, especially awhile after i got out of the shower and into my day, but it just isn&#x27;t as strong as other body washes. But maybe you would like that, and i found that i did as well. So, don&#x27;t expect a strong scent right away, but more of a lingering softer scent throughout the day. I have enjoyed this product so far, and a six pack of soap is a great value. Also, the new soap design/shape is an interesting touch, but i found it didn&#x27;t change much of my opinion of this soap, but it was a nice change never the less. If you like feeling clean, smelling nice and a great value, i would recommend this to you</li>
    <li> This is a nice addition to the Old Spice Fresh Collection.  Fiji is a great sent, manly, but islandie also.  You&#x27;ll feel like your on vacation all the time.</li>
    <li> This package came up with a search of &amp;#34;soap on a rope&amp;#34; and other items were actually soap on a rope, so that is what I expected, not 6 normal bars of soap :(</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome! Found it here for a great price.  I have been looking for Fiji Bar Soap in stores for months now and it seems to be discontinued or something.  This is my &amp;#34;other half&#x27;s&amp;#34; FAVORITE soap of all time! It smells like you just stepped out the front door and right into a tropical paradise. Have been purchasing this soap for over a year now in local stores and then one day it seemed to disappear off the shelves. I was so excited to find it here and not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it.  Thanks for making our day!</li>
    <li> smells great. lasts long. for real cheap.</li>
    <li> I like a number of Old Spice scents, and use the Fiji antiperspirant in the summer. It makes me think of the tropics, and my wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Fiji-scented soap, I had to try it, but I&#x27;m struggling to get much of any scent from it, much less the Fiji notes. I get a basic soapy clean scent, but it&#x27;s faint. I&#x27;ve used 2 bars so far, so either I got a weak batch, or the scent just doesn&#x27;t translate well.&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is very nice - it lathers well, rinses off clean, and it fits the hand better than larger bars. It sounds like the other scents may be stronger - I may give them a try when I get through the last of this.</li>
    <li> I love the Old Spice Fiji line pf products and use many of them including this soap, deodorant, body wash, body spray and shampoo.

    <li> I love this soap! My boyfriend used to use plain, boring Dial soap that smells like laundry detergent but this soap smells so masculine and irresistible. My boyfriend likes the soap too and is permanently using this until a better one comes out.</li>
    <li> I still prefer the gel over the soap. I feel like it conditions the skin better leaves a longer lasting scent.</li>
    <li> This soap labeled foreign made for Old Spice Canada.  Worth the price does a good job.  Lathers well, but melts down quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and gets you clean without drying out the skin.  About all that you can ask of a soap.</li>
    <li> This product does not have the same smell and it does not make your body smell like the Fuji after your done taking a shower. It smells like regular bar soap if not no scent at all. This seems like a dollar store. In my opinion, this soap is a sham. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does however retain shape even when left in the tub. Wonder whats in this soap. It just cleans. Finally give away the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY unless u want something to just stay clean</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve smelled.  I love it, and it works great.  I stay dry all day!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, Ill order again.</li>
    <li> I love the Fiji deodorant, was very excited when I saw these bar soap packs.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the soap doesn&#x27;t deliver. They need to put more Fiji scent into the product. Forget about the scent lasting through a few hours, you can barely smell it in and immediately after showering.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again until they come out with new formulation with more scent, that lasts at least a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the soap is made for men. Has a nice shape that fits in your hand perfectly. It also washes off quickly without that residue feeling. But I can anticipate this soap will dry my skin out in the winter. So I&#x27;ll only be using it in the summertime and after the gym for now.</li>
    <li> Why else would you buy this product? I bought it for the scent and because I enjoying the Fuji deodorant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have the same smell and it does not make your body smell like the Fuji after your done taking a shower. It smells like regular bar soap you can buy at a dollar store. In my opinion, this soap is a sham. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> To put this simply, ignore this product.  There are better bar soaps in the market at very good price.  I purchase this product thinking it has some kind of Old Spice perfume.  I was mistaken, not hint of smell after you shower.  Ignore this product and get something better.</li>
    <li> He uses this exact same deodorant, so I thought these would be nice as a stocking stuffer. I didn&#x27;t realize when I got them how many bars there actually were in the package, so I just used one as a stocking stuffer. Hubby loves the smell as do I and we have plenty to last for a little while.</li>
    <li> They are good, however the smell is not actually amazing, thats the reason of the 4 stars, besides that the soap is great</li>
