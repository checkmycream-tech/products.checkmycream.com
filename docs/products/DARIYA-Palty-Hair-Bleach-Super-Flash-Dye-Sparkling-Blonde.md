### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>perfect ombre hair...</li>
      <li>so impressed.</li>
      <li>I have never used this product before, but I must say I&#x27;m so happy with it!  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t damage my hair the leave in conditioner was great!</li>
      <li>Will buy again :D</li>
      <li>i loved it and it didn&#x27;t even damage my hairrrr!!!</li>
      <li>It turned out to be great!</li>
      <li>was too distracted by the beautiful color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great as a lightener.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that great.</li>
      <li>Probably the best hair dye I have ever used, much better than the ones sold in chain stores.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It came out really bright.</li>
      <li>It did a really good job of turning my hair a reddish coppery orange color, which was a pretty good lift!</li>
      <li>but i really liked this bleach</li>
      <li>I used my own brush.</li>
      <li>it came with gloves, a nice brush bottle to apply the die, conditioner and a hair cap.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;- effectively lifts hair color 1-2 shades (you can keep it in longer to lighten up to 3-4 shades --</li>
      <li>so if you want to make sure your hair says healthy but you want to bleach it use this product :)</li>
      <li>buy more if I wanted to lighten my hair again.</li>
      <li>Great and fast shipping yo.</li>
      <li>Make sure to follow instructions on the box.</li>
      <li>so i wasn&#x27;t asian and the product was perfect.!</li>
      <li>You might need more than one box though.</li>
      <li>I love it I been using this product for 4yrs</li>
      <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve used Palty hair dye about 3 months or more ago</li>
      <li>thats okay because i was going to dye it anyways</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I corrected the color and its already getting healthy.</li>
      <li>I think it looks better with time, depending on how you cut your hair or style it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, I guess that shows how strong this bleach is.</li>
      <li>My hair turned out wonderful even though it started out as black.</li>
      <li>i love this so much and my ombre is super gradient which i love most people i know bleached their hair twice to make it ombre</li>
      <li>I do recommend this product for anyone that wants to lighten their hair to a bright, golden color.</li>
      <li>And when he got it, it felt light</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with the dye and would dye it Sparkling Blonde again.</li>
      <li>Still, it faded to a coppery light brown color.</li>
      <li>I dyed my my hair light brown 2 days after I used this dye and it worked well in giving me the color I wanted from the box.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite being allergic, because I DIDN&#x27;T drip it onto my scalp, it was a pain free, chemical burn free, hair treatment.</li>
      <li>This is by far the strongest and most effective bleach I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
      <li>BUT if you still want light hair, it&#x27;s better to do a gradient—light bottom to natural top (or a one shade lighter color).</li>
      <li>Although you can figure out most of it on your own without the translation, you may miss essential information like the fact that it needs to be applied within 20 minutes of mixing the color because it&#x27;ll lose its effectiveness after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was lighter than the picture so about 2 inches of my hair was bright blonde and the rest the orange color</li>
      <li>Thank you so much and will buy it again for sure.</li>
      <li>will definitely buy more hair products from here!</li>
      <li>hair ended up being a brown color with some light blond streaks in it.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that comes with the dye works really well to protect the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No orangey color to it because I used purple shampoo right away.</li>
      <li>I DID get some bald spots, but they went away when I used the right shampoo and a hair spray that I got from Skinfood.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(the product is very creamy and easy to distribute onto your hair; most bleach products will dry quickly before you can spread it through your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So I was pleased with the ends of my hair but the roots I need a little more research.</li>
      <li>Pretty good - a lot of work &amp; took a lot of time (&amp; re-applications) for my dark brown hair to lighten up</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, my hair was pretty damaged.</li>
      <li>I got this for my first attempt of ombre hair.</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair since I was 17.</li>
      <li>This was my first time in using a Palty product.</li>
      <li>Mix it with white conditioner if you want a more pastel color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i thought that because it is supposed to be made &#x27;special&#x27; for resistant dark hair, that it would do a better job.  </li>
      <li>However, I must tell you that if you want to achieve a certain hair color, you need to use another dye to balance it out.</li>
      <li>I normally have dark brown or black hair and it lighted my hair greatly!</li>
      <li>first u apply the beach to tips of your hair for 15 minutes then rap in tin foil then after that go up as high as you want it to go for another 15 minutes then rap in foil</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars since it did lighten my hair better than any American blonde hair dye, I think it would have lighten my hair more if I left it on for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>but it is really a 0.</li>
      <li>and I never had any problem fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and i didnt expect it to come so fast it was supposed to take until the 6th</li>
      <li>Note:  If you want the blonde color featured on the box your hair must be light brown or lighter.  </li>
      <li>so I stopped worrying as much.</li>
      <li>It didnt really damage my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>the whole stipulation of buying asian bleach doesn&#x27;t really add up, i don&#x27;t suggest it for a huge lift...</li>
      <li>And it works better than the bleach I previously tried, not to mention at a cheaper price (despite the shipping gdi).</li>
      <li>I left mine of for about 20 minutes and my hair color matched the box exactly!</li>
      <li>And what really surprised me was how the bleach did not damage my hair as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I know a moderate amount of Japanese but the illustrations on the directions were easy to understand</li>
      <li>really liked the results, but I don&#x27;t think I will dye my hair again until it&#x27;s healthier or back to being all black.</li>
      <li>There are no english instructions, I just mixed everything together(except for the conditioner of course) and my hair turned out fine.</li>
      <li>i had to complete the lightening process with the revlon frost and glow and then with the dark and lovely platinum hair color shade which was only five dollars.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered this product, I was really excited to use it because I have black hair</li>
      <li>It gave my hair a soft gradual ombre effect.</li>
      <li>but this stuff my hair feels so soft</li>
      <li>;, well dumbnuts, go to a professional or try peroxide hair treatment</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because it really hurt my head and two days later I still feel it pulling my hair roots</li>
      <li>My hair is a natural auburn/brown color and after one application it was maybe one shade lighter.</li>
      <li>My natural hair color is chocolate brown.</li>
      <li>although this is a product mainly for asians with jet black hair, you have to still pre lighten your hair before you get the actual result of the cover, i got the result on the cover because my hair was light brown already</li>
      <li>The dye applicator looks like it would be a pain to use, however it actually made the process much easier.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I was originally looking for a non bleach hair dye, but of course I was blind and only read &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also before I dyed it again the same day the virgin part that was pure blonde was very soft (:</li>
      <li>So just Dec. 2012, I went from light brown to jet black hair and now my hair is starting to fade into a medium brown color.</li>
      <li>I have hair past my shoulders and needed two boxes, but could have probably used three comfortably.</li>
      <li>The tip of my hair is golden and coppery colored and it fades into dark brown.</li>
      <li>Also if you plan to dye your whole head of hair blonde then one box is definitely not enough.</li>
      <li>first recommendation is if you have long hair, play it safe and get two boxes, especially when it involves a dye that bleaches your hair because now its too late for me to apply a second box soon after -- it may snap my hair.  </li>
      <li>My second recommendation is to look up the instructions in english first because the instructions in the box is in Japanese.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Please be aware that there is not much product in the box, so you may need two!</li>
      <li>I purchased this an an asian market near me.  </li>
      <li>I have thick jet black hair and this product works great for lifting the black to an orange brown hue.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And if you don&#x27;t want dry damaged hair, or too much of it, YES you&#x27;re SUPPOSE to DEEP CONDITION YOUR HAIR /PRIOR/ to the actual bleaching.</li>
      <li>I have asian hair and this worked on my dark brown hair really well!</li>
      <li>It put just the right amount of dye on each section of hair, with a little left over.</li>
      <li>I tend to stick to Japanese product, especially because I am Asian and my hair is very sensitive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting another one of these because I want to go a little higher up this time.</li>
      <li>The purpose of this is to just really wash out your dark strands.</li>

    <li> although this is a product mainly for asians with jet black hair, you have to still pre lighten your hair before you get the actual result of the cover, i got the result on the cover because my hair was light brown already but my roots were jet black, so it resulted in platinum blonde hair with brown-orange roots</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this a 1 but it is really a 0. My friend bought this for me for my birthday. And when he got it, it felt light so he opened it up. Turns out there was nothing in it. If i wanted a box for my birthday i would go to the junk yard!</li>
    <li> It works really well. Make sure to follow instructions on the box. Also if you plan to dye your whole head of hair blonde then one box is definitely not enough. One box is just enough for highlights.</li>
    <li> I purchased this an an asian market near me.  I&#x27;ve used Palty before and decided to give this one a try since my bf loves blonde hair (why he&#x27;s dating a typical asian girl like me, I have no idea). My hair went from a dark brown/tea color to something similar to the box, but not quite, but that&#x27;s my fault because I ran out of dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first recommendation is if you have long hair, play it safe and get two boxes, especially when it involves a dye that bleaches your hair because now its too late for me to apply a second box soon after -- it may snap my hair.  I believe I would&#x27;ve gotten the desired color if I had a second box.  My second recommendation is to look up the instructions in english first because the instructions in the box is in Japanese.  Although you can figure out most of it on your own without the translation, you may miss essential information like the fact that it needs to be applied within 20 minutes of mixing the color because it&#x27;ll lose its effectiveness after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite happy with the dye and would dye it Sparkling Blonde again.</li>
    <li> I was using this dye (bleach) to get out the dark brown, nearly black hair dye that I disliked in my hair. It did a really good job of turning my hair a reddish coppery orange color, which was a pretty good lift! I think with two applications of this I could have had my hair the shade on the box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that there is not much product in the box, so you may need two! I have hair past my shoulders and needed two boxes, but could have probably used three comfortably.</li>
    <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t lighten your hair to blonde unless you use it several times. My hair is a natural auburn/brown color and after one application it was maybe one shade lighter.</li>
    <li> This was my first time in using a Palty product. I have asian hair and this worked on my dark brown hair really well! I used this to bleach my hair for the Milk Tea Brown of Palty. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have naturally black hair with some dark brown and brown streaks in it from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;My hair ended up being a brown color with some light blond streaks in it.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that comes with the dye works really well to protect the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair was pretty damaged. I have naturally thin hair so this made me look like I had even less hair.&lt;br /&gt;It recovered over time so I stopped worrying as much. I DID get some bald spots, but they went away when I used the right shampoo and a hair spray that I got from Skinfood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the results, but I don&#x27;t think I will dye my hair again until it&#x27;s healthier or back to being all black. I think it looks better with time, depending on how you cut your hair or style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to girls with thicker hair. You might need more than one box though.</li>
    <li> Note:  If you want the blonde color featured on the box your hair must be light brown or lighter.  If you have black or dark brown hair, it will take you 2-3 times of dying before your hair looks like the box.  I had dark brown/reddish hair (my hair is thick and reaches midway down my back); I used this as a lightener for my hair so that I can re-dye it red, I used (2) boxes for 15min. and my hair became an orange/red hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like other bleach/lighteners&lt;br /&gt;- effectively lifts hair color 1-2 shades (you can keep it in longer to lighten up to 3-4 shades -- but it&#x27;s damaging to your hair).&lt;br /&gt;- creamy consistency (the product is very creamy and easy to distribute onto your hair; most bleach products will dry quickly before you can spread it through your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- not enough product (this is pretty expensive -- but one bottle wasn&#x27;t enough, and the conditioner was a waste!)&lt;br /&gt;- very strong, not good for sensitive skin (it does sting/burn; it also made my eyes watery)&lt;br /&gt;- can&#x27;t use a hair dye brush or bowl with this -- it&#x27;s too watery to be used this way.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll need a second or third box cause this one box I bought didnt cut it. but it did lighten my very black asian hair.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was originally looking for a non bleach hair dye, but of course I was blind and only read &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to bleach, but idgaf aka I was too lazy to return it. And it works better than the bleach I previously tried, not to mention at a cheaper price (despite the shipping gdi). Also, to the people who complained about getting chemical burns and etc, you&#x27;re not suppose to put the bleach onto your scalp (wow the amount of curses in my mind as I&#x27;m typing this after reading some of the comments). If you&#x27;re countering this with, &amp;#34;oh but i dont want my roots to show!!1&amp;#34;, well dumbnuts, go to a professional or try peroxide hair treatment instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being allergic, because I DIDN&#x27;T drip it onto my scalp, it was a pain free, chemical burn free, hair treatment. I only got it to lighten my hair, meaning, no, I don&#x27;t care if I get the same color as the box—Instead I kept it on for less than 20 minutes (and w/o the cap) but even then I turned blond at some parts (fyi my hair is black-brown). However, if you do want that color, you&#x27;re going to have to NOT BE ALLERGIC TO BLEACH and follow the directions on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, don&#x27;t let the bleach dry on any patch of hair unless you don&#x27;t want it to get lighter. If you feel immediate burning, wipe/wash it OFF, it&#x27;s not for you. BUT if you still want light hair, it&#x27;s better to do a gradient—light bottom to natural top (or a one shade lighter color). So concentrate the bleach at the bottom of your hair, slowly and minimally working it half or less up, and use garnier or something for the rest/to even out the color of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you don&#x27;t want dry damaged hair, or too much of it, YES you&#x27;re SUPPOSE to DEEP CONDITION YOUR HAIR /PRIOR/ to the actual bleaching. I rec&#x27; manic panic color dye if you want it pink or blue or something, since it&#x27;s vegan so you can keep it on and not worry about it burning. Mix it with white conditioner if you want a more pastel color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is done...&lt;br /&gt;Oh, wait. Great and fast shipping yo. Would def. buy more if I wanted to lighten my hair again.</li>
    <li> Probably the best hair dye I have ever used, much better than the ones sold in chain stores.&lt;br /&gt;Love Japanese products</li>
    <li> Left it on for 15 minutes since I chickened out of being a blonde asian. I have semi virgin dark asian hair and it turned my hair orange (as expected).  I dyed my my hair light brown 2 days after I used this dye and it worked well in giving me the color I wanted from the box. I gave it 4 stars since it did lighten my hair better than any American blonde hair dye, I think it would have lighten my hair more if I left it on for 25 minutes.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my dyed brown hair. I am a white male and this dye did not cause my hair to fall out because it&#x27;s meant for Asian hair (So people on forums have been saying). I know a moderate amount of Japanese but the illustrations on the directions were easy to understand so I didn&#x27;t have to read a thing. The dye applicator looks like it would be a pain to use, however it actually made the process much easier. It put just the right amount of dye on each section of hair, with a little left over. I left mine of for about 20 minutes and my hair color matched the box exactly! And what really surprised me was how the bleach did not damage my hair as much as I thought it would. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my hair was left a bit dry, but it was nothing that a conditioning treatment couldn&#x27;t fix. I do recommend this product for anyone that wants to lighten their hair to a bright, golden color. You don&#x27;t have to be Asian to use this product!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I was really excited to use it because I have black hair and this was supposed to be THE hair dye that would turn my hair blonde. Unfortunately, they sent me the wrong color and after many emails and attempts of contact, I notified amazon to refund my money. I got to keep the wrong product but was never sent the actual hair dye I ordered.</li>
    <li> Finally, my hair is died in all directions. I tried bleaching my hair for the past couple of months using different products that usually work, but it wasn&#x27;t fully turning. This did the trick--and then some. It turned my hair almost platinum blonde, and it isn&#x27;t a hair dye--it&#x27;s sort of a mixture between dye and bleach. it came with gloves, a nice brush bottle to apply the die, conditioner and a hair cap. I gave it 4 stars because it really hurt my head and two days later I still feel it pulling my hair roots so be careful. There are no english instructions, I just mixed everything together(except for the conditioner of course) and my hair turned out fine.</li>
    <li> so i was planning on ombring my hair with this product which i did and it came out fabulouuuuuuus!!!!! i loved it and it didn&#x27;t even damage my hairrrr!!! i love this so much and my ombre is super gradient which i love most people i know bleached their hair twice to make it ombre but i did it all in thirty minutes! first u apply the beach to tips of your hair for 15 minutes then rap in tin foil then after that go up as high as you want it to go for another 15 minutes then rap in foil thennn waaaa laaaa! perfect ombre hair... so impressed.(: and i have mexican hair...so i wasn&#x27;t asian and the product was perfect.! will definitely buy more hair products from here!</li>
    <li> I had no idea the directions weren&#x27;t in english.&lt;br /&gt;I was too distracted by the beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;It made me so blonde it lasted a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;I might consider buying it again someday.</li>
    <li> I have thick jet black hair and this product works great for lifting the black to an orange brown hue. Great as a lightener. Use this product as a base color than color your hair to the color you initially wanted. If you want the color on the box I would suggest 2 or 3 applications of the product to get the desired color.</li>
    <li> My hair turned out wonderful even though it started out as black. No orangey color to it because I used purple shampoo right away.</li>
    <li> I love it I been using this product for 4yrs and I never had any problem fast shipping. Thank you so much and will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve used Palty hair dye about 3 months or more ago and it was the Palty Turn Color Deep Black so my roots grew out a lot. Being the dummy I was I ordered this dye to lighten my hair because well my hair was black as I was applying the dye from ends to roots (bad idea if your roots have grown out a bit) my roots became a platinum almost white color. It was lighter than the picture so about 2 inches of my hair was bright blonde and the rest the orange color I was wanting. So I was pleased with the ends of my hair but the roots I need a little more research. So if you have virgin roots do those last. Also I ran out of the dye and I bought 2 boxes my hair was past my shoulders. Hope this was helpful, and well I did put the dye on curly hair so it was a bit difficult since my hair is super curly so if you have curly hair I suggest to flat iron wait a couple of days keeping your hair straight till its dirty because the dye will stick better to get an even coverage. (: But I do love palty because the dye does work and still it did not damage my hair as bad. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I corrected the color and its already getting healthy. But yes if you have virgin roots do them last when using this product. Also before I dyed it again the same day the virgin part that was pure blonde was very soft (:</li>
    <li> i used it to ombre my human hair lace wig.  i thought that because it is supposed to be made &#x27;special&#x27; for resistant dark hair, that it would do a better job.  my wig was a medium brown and this product did lighten the bottom half of the hair, but no where near the color that shows on the box. it lightened it maybe one shade lighter.  it may work differently on non-wig hair.  i had to complete the lightening process with the revlon frost and glow and then with the dark and lovely platinum hair color shade which was only five dollars.  i think i could have skipped this one which was more expensive and did not lighten hardly at all.  this is only my opinion for a wig, on non-wig hair, it may work totally different.  some wig makers sneak in some synthetic hair in their human hair wigs, making it harder to color.</li>
    <li> Pretty good - a lot of work &amp; took a lot of time (&amp; re-applications) for my dark brown hair to lighten up</li>
    <li> My hair was a dark brown and it turned an orangish but thats okay because i was going to dye it anyways but i really liked this bleach i&#x27;ve tryed another bleach (splat that comes with hair dye) and it made my hair feel dead and crappy but this stuff my hair feels so soft and i didnt expect it to come so fast it was supposed to take until the 6th and it got here on the 2nd so if you want to make sure your hair says healthy but you want to bleach it use this product :) i hope this helps</li>
    <li> the whole stipulation of buying asian bleach doesn&#x27;t really add up, i don&#x27;t suggest it for a huge lift... however the product itself is definitely quality for a box bleach.</li>
    <li> I have never used this product before, but I must say I&#x27;m so happy with it!  I normally have dark brown or black hair and it lighted my hair greatly! I just wish I had enough to cover all of my hair :/ next time I need to buy two boxes. Didn&#x27;t damage my hair the leave in conditioner was great! Will buy again :D</li>
    <li> I have Asian hair -- black to dark brown. I got this for my first attempt of ombre hair. It turned out to be great! I applied this product on the tip of my hair and left it on for 15 min and on the area above tips and left on for 10 minutes. It gave my hair a soft gradual ombre effect. The tip of my hair is golden and coppery colored and it fades into dark brown. I&#x27;m getting another one of these because I want to go a little higher up this time. The only bummer was the applicator. It&#x27;s not that great. I used my own brush. Otherwise, it does its job. No surprise.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair since I was 17. Long time. My natural hair color is chocolate brown. This is by far the strongest and most effective bleach I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. It didnt really damage my hair as much as I thought it would. I tend to stick to Japanese product, especially because I am Asian and my hair is very sensitive. I used this bleach last 2011. It came out really bright. Although I have to warn you that it fades out to a brassy gold orange color. I paired Milk tea brown with this, and my hair was ash platinum blonde. So fab!  The following year I needed to darken my hair for work so I used chocolate brown. After few months, it faded to an ash blonde color. So I darkened it again. After 2 mos., Hair came back to blonde so I decided to dye my hair red. Still, it faded to a coppery light brown color. So just Dec. 2012, I went from light brown to jet black hair and now my hair is starting to fade into a medium brown color. So, I guess that shows how strong this bleach is. However, I must tell you that if you want to achieve a certain hair color, you need to use another dye to balance it out. The purpose of this is to just really wash out your dark strands. And if you have thick medium length hair, 1 box is not enough. If your hair is long, you might need 2 or 3 boxes. Quite expensive but so worth it.</li>
