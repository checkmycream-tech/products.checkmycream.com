      <li>It is a very good product and delivered was on time.</li>
      <li>This product is brilliant.  </li>
      <li>I gave a disposable one to my best friend as a sample, and she loved it, too.  </li>
      <li>I try to be eco-friendly, and based on my research of menstrual cups, this sounded like a good place to start without dropping $30 on something I didn&#x27;t know if I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>It is great for spotting and light days though.</li>
      <li>Since switching to Softcup, I honestly forgot I was having a period.</li>
      <li>Softcup is so comfortable that I honestly forget that I have one in at all.  </li>
      <li>Every woman is different but for me, these are the best!</li>
      <li>I was so satisfied with this product that I decided to give Reusable Softcup a try, and I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>A great new way.</li>
      <li>/clean it twice a day, at most), environmentally more sound...</li>
      <li>you know, I honestly cannot think of any right now.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to dispose of these when they can be easily rinsed and reinserted.  </li>
      <li>though that was one of the huge benefits of this thing?</li>
      <li>I have had no issues with leakage and clean up is quik and easy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; and it was comfortable.</li>
      <li>I triple checked the directions to make sure I was inserting it right, looked online for help, but the cup just would not keep the blood</li>
      <li>I had no problems using these whatsoever and was able use it comfortably on the first try.</li>
      <li>Its a super awesome thing if you have heavy periods, like me, or even light periods...</li>
      <li>I was able to understand placement and removal on the first attempt at each, and have had no issues at all.</li>
      <li>I want to start off by saying that I was really excited about trying the softcup.</li>
      <li>It felt good (as in, couldn&#x27;t feel it much at all), but it leaked and I even got a large bubble of blood that seeped through my shorts</li>
      <li>I was previously a tampon user and I had heard of the Diva Cup, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t very interested in trying something that I would have to shell out close to 40.00 for, without knowing if it would be a good product for me.  </li>
      <li>The full cycle up ring is a bit firmer than the 12 hr ones, I believe this was intentional as the cup does soften over the course of days.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like how you have to take it out but other than that the cup was great</li>
      <li>it is very easy to use and comfortable and can&#x27;t see ever going back to tampons!!!</li>
      <li>I am in love with the Soft Cup.</li>
      <li>Also, if you are not comfortable with your own body or have a problem seeing blood you&#x27;ll have to get over it to enjoy the perks of this product!</li>
      <li>It was so nice to be able to partake in this activity without a mess!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy enough for me to remove and clean it.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Basically, with Softcup, you can pretty much go on with your life and do whatever activities you want.  </li>
      <li>After a couple of tries, I was able to get the hang of it within the first couple of days of my period.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first, but I tried it out and it worked brilliantly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not giving up on menstrual cups altogether, but I&#x27;m certainly giving up on this one and never buying from this vendor again.</li>
      <li>They worked great for the most part--I would say be careful if you are extra active there might be some leakage</li>
      <li>A HUGE pro for this product over standard menstrual cups is that it can be kept in during intercourse for mess-free lovemaking.  </li>
      <li>I really like the convenience of these.</li>
      <li>I generally have to push the front lip of the cup back into place after using the restroom to make sure it&#x27;s snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(reusable Softcup is much more economical that the disposable version, and also much cheaper than buying a new box of tampons or pads every month), convenience (only have to empty</li>
      <li>While satisfied with the product I wanted to try the Softcup to see if I was missing something.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see that as a problem though because the 12 hour wear time would generally allow me to get back to my own bathroom before needing to empty it.</li>
      <li>I changed to softcups back in October, first the 12 hr version and now the reusable for one cycle cup</li>
      <li>A reusable product, easy to keep clean, leaving less waste on earth.</li>
      <li>Your vagina is still naturally lubricated and it doesn&#x27;t absorb that and throw your body&#x27;s pH out of whack like tampons can.  </li>
      <li>I am a 35 year old childfree woman.</li>
      <li>No leaking and one you get the hang of it, no mess.</li>
      <li>sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the cup for a full hour, before it started to leak like crazy.</li>
      <li>Exactly what i expected.</li>
      <li>I used to regularly take 800mg of ibuprofen every day of my period and go through a normal amount of tampons.</li>
      <li>Beware, there is a  slight learning curve but definitely worth the effort.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t say that for any other product on the market, that I&#x27;m aware of.  </li>
      <li>I had been spending close to 10.00 for a box of disposable Softcup (still well worth every penny), and a box with two of these will last me two cycles, at less than half the cost of one month&#x27;s worth of the disposable.  </li>
      <li>I now barely even remember that I have one inserted.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leak or pop out of place, and my partner barely knew it was there</li>

<li> I would even go so far as to say that Instead should make one that you can use for multiple cycles, in the way that Diva Cup and other menstrual cups do.  </li>
<li> Regardless of what studies and other things say, I can only tell you my personal experience.</li>
<li> I have only had one leak and it was due to an overfull cup, same would have happened with a tampon.</li>
<li> Makes my life a slightly less complicated :)</li>
<li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry you out like tampons can do.  </li>
<li> Some other reviews say that they just wipe it out with toilet paper</li>
<li> Slightly too big for me.</li>
<li> The individual cups were still wrapped in plastic which made it slightly less</li>
<li> women report more cramping than with tampons or pads, I get bad cramps and did not notice an increase in discomfort with the change to softcup.</li>
<li> However the package was crushed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty much useless except for swimming.</li>
<li> you haven&#x27;t used a softcup before start on a less heavy day so you can get used to inserting and removing without too much of a mess, once you get the hang of it</li>
<li> There&#x27;s less waste, and it&#x27;s a little easier on the wallet as well.  </li>
<li> Also this is awesome because no more uncomfortable itch or rash associated with days of using treated cotton crap!</li>
<li> There is a little bit of a learning curve with inserting these...</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste time on it.</li>
<li> I could feel it after a few hours, so I felt as though I wasn&#x27;t inserting them correctly.  </li>
<li> I had terrible cramps and have severe endometriosis my whole adult life.</li>
<li> (sorry to be graphic, but that is just ridiculous!).</li>
<li> I would recommend these to anyone not currently happy with tampons or pads.</li>
<li> When I failed to get it to them in under 24 hours (sorry I work and have a life...), they refused to accept my return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I no longer have to deal with that uncomfortable feeling from irritation like I did with tampons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They worked great for the most part--I would say be careful if you are extra active there might be some leakage</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying that I was really excited about trying the softcup. I try to be eco-friendly, and based on my research of menstrual cups, this sounded like a good place to start without dropping $30 on something I didn&#x27;t know if I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product came opened (purchased from AmericaRx). As in, the plastic wrap was completely removed and the box was crushed enough to see the contents. When I contacted the seller, they asked for a picture of the package. When I failed to get it to them in under 24 hours (sorry I work and have a life...), they refused to accept my return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I figured I would still try it. The individual cups were still wrapped in plastic which made it slightly less sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the cup for a full hour, before it started to leak like crazy. I though that was one of the huge benefits of this thing? It felt good (as in, couldn&#x27;t feel it much at all), but it leaked and I even got a large bubble of blood that seeped through my shorts (sorry to be graphic, but that is just ridiculous!). I triple checked the directions to make sure I was inserting it right, looked online for help, but the cup just would not keep the blood contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy these. I&#x27;m not giving up on menstrual cups altogether, but I&#x27;m certainly giving up on this one and never buying from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. A reusable product, easy to keep clean, leaving less waste on earth. I was able to understand placement and removal on the first attempt at each, and have had no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Beware, there is a  slight learning curve but definitely worth the effort. Love these! Makes my life a slightly less complicated :)</li>
    <li> I was a tampon user for about 15 years. I had terrible cramps and have severe endometriosis my whole adult life. Regardless of what studies and other things say, I can only tell you my personal experience. I used to regularly take 800mg of ibuprofen every day of my period and go through a normal amount of tampons. Since switching to Softcup, I honestly forgot I was having a period. It did not leak and my cramps were reduced to the point that I took only ONE ibuprofen the entire duration of my period. Every woman is different but for me, these are the best! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find these 15 years ago. I would recommend these to anyone not currently happy with tampons or pads. They have lived up to everything they promised for me. I am a 35 year old childfree woman.</li>
    <li> It worked for about 5 minutes until it began to spill over.  Don&#x27;t waste time on it. It&#x27;s pretty much useless except for swimming.</li>
    <li> A great new way. I really like the convenience of these. No leaking and one you get the hang of it, no mess.</li>
    <li> I changed to softcups back in October, first the 12 hr version and now the reusable for one cycle cup and I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The full cycle up ring is a bit firmer than the 12 hr ones, I believe this was intentional as the cup does soften over the course of days. I no longer have to deal with that uncomfortable feeling from irritation like I did with tampons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used a softcup before start on a less heavy day so you can get used to inserting and removing without too much of a mess, once you get the hang of it if you know how to kegel you can dump the cup without removing it! I have only had one leak and it was due to an overfull cup, same would have happened with a tampon. I generally have to push the front lip of the cup back into place after using the restroom to make sure it&#x27;s snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women report more cramping than with tampons or pads, I get bad cramps and did not notice an increase in discomfort with the change to softcup.</li>
    <li> I read lots of opinionated reviews before purchasing...Its a super awesome thing if you have heavy periods, like me, or even light periods... I recommend trying it out when you get it before its that time so you can figure it out. Also, if you are not comfortable with your own body or have a problem seeing blood you&#x27;ll have to get over it to enjoy the perks of this product! Also, I recommend having water within reach if you are doing the reusable cup. Also this is awesome because no more uncomfortable itch or rash associated with days of using treated cotton crap! and it&#x27;s way cheaper too.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product and delivered was on time.</li>
    <li> Slightly too big for me.</li>
    <li> I would have gave it a five star but I don&#x27;t like how you have to take it out but other than that the cup was great you don&#x27;t feel it when it&#x27;s in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but it is just too messy and it leaks on heavier days.  It is great for spotting and light days though.</li>
    <li> I would give this product an infinite number of stars.  I was previously a tampon user and I had heard of the Diva Cup, but I honestly wasn&#x27;t very interested in trying something that I would have to shell out close to 40.00 for, without knowing if it would be a good product for me.  I ran across disposable Softcup in my local drugstore.  I purchased a box of them and gave them a try.  There is a little bit of a learning curve with inserting these... I could feel it after a few hours, so I felt as though I wasn&#x27;t inserting them correctly.  After a couple of tries, I was able to get the hang of it within the first couple of days of my period.  I now barely even remember that I have one inserted.  This product is brilliant.  I have a moderate flow and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leakage.  I was so satisfied with this product that I decided to give Reusable Softcup a try, and I ordered it from Amazon.  I think I&#x27;ve decided that the reusable version is the best option for me.  There&#x27;s less waste, and it&#x27;s a little easier on the wallet as well.  I had been spending close to 10.00 for a box of disposable Softcup (still well worth every penny), and a box with two of these will last me two cycles, at less than half the cost of one month&#x27;s worth of the disposable.  It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to dispose of these when they can be easily rinsed and reinserted.  I would even go so far as to say that Instead should make one that you can use for multiple cycles, in the way that Diva Cup and other menstrual cups do.  Recognizing the benefits of a product that is worn just under the cervix (Softcup) over menstrual cups worn in the vagina, I am not tempted to switch at all.  Softcup is so comfortable that I honestly forget that I have one in at all.  It&#x27;s easy enough for me to remove and clean it.  Again, I wish that Instead would make one that can be used for multiple cycles and perhaps include a storage case for it.  A HUGE pro for this product over standard menstrual cups is that it can be kept in during intercourse for mess-free lovemaking.  I was skeptical at first, but I tried it out and it worked brilliantly.  You can&#x27;t say that for any other product on the market, that I&#x27;m aware of.  It didn&#x27;t leak or pop out of place, and my partner barely knew it was there (I told him just in case it was an issue).  It was so nice to be able to partake in this activity without a mess!  Basically, with Softcup, you can pretty much go on with your life and do whatever activities you want.  Pros: comfort, cost (reusable Softcup is much more economical that the disposable version, and also much cheaper than buying a new box of tampons or pads every month), convenience (only have to empty/clean it twice a day, at most), environmentally more sound... Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t dry you out like tampons can do.  Your vagina is still naturally lubricated and it doesn&#x27;t absorb that and throw your body&#x27;s pH out of whack like tampons can.  There is no TSS risk with Softcup, either.  I cannot believe I&#x27;m in my 30s and I&#x27;m just now discovering this product.  I can&#x27;t believe that I had to deal with tampons and pads for 20 years without even knowing this exists.  Cons: you know, I honestly cannot think of any right now.  I gave a disposable one to my best friend as a sample, and she loved it, too.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I only wish I had known about it twenty years ago.  I will never go back to tampons or pads.</li>
    <li> I had no problems using these whatsoever and was able use it comfortably on the first try. I have had no issues with leakage and clean up is quik and easy. The only issue i could see is that i prefer to rinse it out and that would not be possible in a public restroom. Some other reviews say that they just wipe it out with toilet paper but i feel like that could have potential pitfalls. I don&#x27;t really see that as a problem though because the 12 hour wear time would generally allow me to get back to my own bathroom before needing to empty it. All in all it is very easy to use and comfortable and can&#x27;t see ever going back to tampons!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a Diva Cup user fro two years. While satisfied with the product I wanted to try the Softcup to see if I was missing something. I am in love with the Soft Cup. Threw my Diva Cup away yesterday. It&#x27;s works as promised. I didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; and it was comfortable.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected. However the package was crushed.</li>
