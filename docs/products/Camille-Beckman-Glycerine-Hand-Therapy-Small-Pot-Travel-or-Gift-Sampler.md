### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect gift!  </li>
      <li>But if you don&#x27;t mind or like a variety of scent this product works great!</li>
      <li>Even my manicurist is impressed.      </li>
      <li>Some of the scents are stronger than others so this packaging is perfect for finding your scent or no scent at all)</li>
      <li>My daughter just loved it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good buy!</li>
      <li>It smells so great and works so well.  </li>
      <li>And these stocking stuffers R great.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the sample size of Sampler 1 and nice packaging.  </li>
      <li>It smells good and feels so good!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I can find it on Amazon!!  </li>
      <li>It comes in so many fragrances!!  </li>
      <li>They are a hit and are good for on-the-go.</li>
      <li>I would have loved to have tried some of those scents.</li>
      <li>Wife loved it.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful smelling rich hand cream, does not leave an oily residue.</li>
      <li>The sampler is a great way to find your favorite scent.</li>
      <li>LOVE this lotion!  </li>
      <li>I think it will be nice for her to have one in each home, one for her purse, and perhaps one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the aromas.  </li>
      <li>This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results.</li>
      <li>I will give them I try when I run into them while out shopping. :)</li>
      <li>I love Camille Beckman products.</li>
      <li>This is a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>I love Camille Beckman hand cream.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to someone looking for something that smells and works great.</li>
      <li>This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product.</li>
      <li>Good price and fast shipping,</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just too strong and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because you can&#x27;t exactly do a \\&quot;sniff test\\&quot; online -- but this is the next best thing!</li>
      <li>I really enjoy these products...</li>
      <li>The hand therapy cannot be beaten, it&#x27;s so silky smooth and smells divine.</li>
      <li>They fit....</li>
      <li>Even though these were different than what was ordered they are still very nice</li>
      <li>The drawback is in the age of free shipping, the cost of shipping these products adds significantly to the price.</li>
      <li>I know it cost a tiny bit more than most lotions, but it is well worth the extra price because it feels so good and heals damaged skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
      <li>I was new to the Camille Beckman line -- and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember when I was first introduced to this lotion, but I always look for it because it is the silkiest lotion ever!  </li>
      <li>My husband surprised me with this sampler knowing how much I love Camille Beckman products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>The only downside of these sampler packs are the small size of the containers (though perfectly sized for a purse, pocketbook, or carrying bag).</li>
      <li>I think this will be the first winter my hands don&#x27;t crack and bleed.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite go-to lotion for the problem areas, such as elbows and heels.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way it penetrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are very scented.</li>
      <li>If you do not like too much scent</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, if you have never tried Camille Beckman, I wholeheartedly recommend trying a sampler to see which flavors really work for you.</li>
      <li>thanks much.</li>
      <li>and she enjoyed trying the other ones.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Camille Beckman lotions for several years, originally getting them as gifts.  </li>
      <li>though the sizes are really small (smaller than I was expecting) fits well in your handbag and does a great job as a hand cream.</li>
      <li>French vanilla and white lilac are okay and smell like you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>After using the cream, faithfully, for several weeks, my hands and elbows have never been so smooth and soft in years.  </li>
      <li>Since there was a discrepancy between the two, I have to give this particular product a lower rating.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Adorable little jars to sample before buying the fullsize, give as a gift or pop in your bag to refresh hands.  </li>
      <li>they stay fresh because they&#x27;re not in there for months.....and using the samplers gives me a chance to test out the different fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I even put it on my feet and it makes my sore, dried out heels feel smooth again!  </li>
      <li>and I already have a few more favorites that I will more than likely repurchase in a larger size later</li>
      <li>Was I pleasantly surprised!  </li>
      <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week.</li>
      <li>Love having the small sizes to try out different fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use this product only, and would highly recommend it to anyone with problem hands.</li>
      <li>It is very creamy and works well on my dry hands and elbows.  </li>
      <li>The bonus is you have 6 different flavors to decide which one you really prefer in order to purchase a larger size.</li>
      <li>I thought I was going to be receiving the Camille, English Lavender, Gardenia Breeze, Glycerine Rosewater and White Lilac scents that are listed at the top of the page, but instead got the Camille, French Vanilla, Mango Beach No2, Tuscan Honey, Midnight Monarch and Morelia Monarch scents listed further down in the product description</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated with my dry hands and elbows for most of my adult life, and have tried countless products over the years, to no avail.      </li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 4 black jars and 2 white.</li>
<li> Sometimes I empty them into a bowl</li>
<li> Had used one, White Lilac, in the past</li>
<li> I now have about 50 other people buying it.&lt;br /&gt;yorkeyhall271954@yahoo.com</li>
<li> However, very few stores carry it and the ones that do have a limited selection.</li>
<li> /&gt;It feels like you have a slight film protecting your skin.  </li>
<li> Camille has a slightly soapy smell and Rozalia has a flowery baby-powder smell.</li>
<li> Plus the small size makes it convenient to tuck them in my purse, the car, my desk drawer, my nightstand...</li>
<li> While in a Pennsylvania gift shop a few years ago, I purchased a jar of Camille Beckman Glycerin Hand Therapy Cream, assuming that I would be disappointed, as with all the other creams.      </li>
<li> I am just a tiny bit disappointed that I did not receive the items my husband bought for me which were supposed to be:</li>
<li> and they haven&#x27;t failed me yet!  </li>

    <li> I really enjoy these products... They are very scented. If you do not like too much scent these are not for you.. But if you don&#x27;t mind or like a variety of scent this product works great! Convenient to pack and carry..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated with my dry hands and elbows for most of my adult life, and have tried countless products over the years, to no avail.      While in a Pennsylvania gift shop a few years ago, I purchased a jar of Camille Beckman Glycerin Hand Therapy Cream, assuming that I would be disappointed, as with all the other creams.      Was I pleasantly surprised!  After using the cream, faithfully, for several weeks, my hands and elbows have never been so smooth and soft in years.  Even my manicurist is impressed.      I purchased a sample packet of assorted fragrances, so that I may purchase another jar of the cream in a different fragrance.    I will continue to use this product only, and would highly recommend it to anyone with problem hands.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it.  Had used one, White Lilac, in the past and she enjoyed trying the other ones.  Good price and fast shipping, thanks much.</li>
    <li> I was new to the Camille Beckman line -- and I LOVE it. I think this will be the first winter my hands don&#x27;t crack and bleed.

Plus the small size makes it convenient to tuck them in my purse, the car, my desk drawer, my nightstand...</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the sample size of Sampler 1 and nice packaging.  There was enough product in the sample size to help decide if I would purchase that fragrance. I really like the way it penetrates my skin and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like you have a slight film protecting your skin.  I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love Camille Beckman hand cream. However, very few stores carry it and the ones that do have a limited selection. The sampler is a great way to find your favorite scent. Camille and Rozalia are the highlights of this collection. Camille has a slightly soapy smell and Rozalia has a flowery baby-powder smell. French vanilla and white lilac are okay and smell like you&#x27;d expect. I&#x27;ll definitely pass on Mango Beach in the future--it&#x27;s just too strong and the smell doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion!  It smells so great and works so well.  This is my new favorite go-to lotion for the problem areas, such as elbows and heels.  I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to someone looking for something that smells and works great.</li>
    <li> I like to buy these samplers to keep one at a time in my purse.  They fit....they stay fresh because they&#x27;re not in there for months.....and using the samplers gives me a chance to test out the different fragrances.  When I find one I like I buy a bigger one for use at home.  I love Camille Beckman products.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite of mine.  I buy several of these samplers to give as gifts.  Sometimes I empty them into a bowl so folks can just pick out what they want.  They are a hit and are good for on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Adorable little jars to sample before buying the fullsize, give as a gift or pop in your bag to refresh hands.  I have used the Camille Beckman lotions for several years, originally getting them as gifts.  Some of the scents are stronger than others so this packaging is perfect for finding your scent or no scent at all) but your hands will tank you</li>
    <li> I am including these in a Mother&#x27;s Day gift (variety is the spice of life) for someone who divides her time among the households of family members. I think it will be nice for her to have one in each home, one for her purse, and perhaps one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she won&#x27;t need to &amp;#34;pick a favorite&amp;#34; until she is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could envision them as teacher&#x27;s gifts or stocking stuffers, Easter basket gifts, and so on, and so forth, depending on the time of year. Perhaps I will order others.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling rich hand cream, does not leave an oily residue. I bought the sampler pack as well- though the sizes are really small (smaller than I was expecting) fits well in your handbag and does a great job as a hand cream. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the aromas.  The hand cream contins glycerin</li>
    <li> I have been using Camille Beckman glycerine lotion $ 15 Years. I will never use ant thing else. I give gifts at Christmas. And these stocking stuffers R great. Everyone loves this Camille Beckman. I now have about 50 other people buying it.&lt;br /&gt;yorkeyhall271954@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with this sampler knowing how much I love Camille Beckman products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 4 black jars and 2 white. I do like the samples that were included, however I did not receive any of the items described above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sampler included: French Vanilla, Tuscan Honey, Camille, Mango&lt;br /&gt;Beach No.2, Midnight Monarch, and Morelia Monarch. Even though these were different than what was ordered they are still very nice and I already have a few more favorites that I will more than likely repurchase in a larger size later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am just a tiny bit disappointed that I did not receive the items my husband bought for me which were supposed to be: Camille, English Lavender, Gardenia Breeze, Glycerine Rosewater and White Lilac. I would have loved to have tried some of those scents. I will give them I try when I run into them while out shopping. :)</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Camille Beckman since I discovered her product in a gift shop. The hand therapy cannot be beaten, it&#x27;s so silky smooth and smells divine. The only downside of these sampler packs are the small size of the containers (though perfectly sized for a purse, pocketbook, or carrying bag). The bonus is you have 6 different flavors to decide which one you really prefer in order to purchase a larger size. The drawback is in the age of free shipping, the cost of shipping these products adds significantly to the price. Nevertheless, if you have never tried Camille Beckman, I wholeheartedly recommend trying a sampler to see which flavors really work for you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember when I was first introduced to this lotion, but I always look for it because it is the silkiest lotion ever!  It smells good and feels so good!  I know it cost a tiny bit more than most lotions, but it is well worth the extra price because it feels so good and heals damaged skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I even put it on my feet and it makes my sore, dried out heels feel smooth again!  It comes in so many fragrances!!  I think I have about all of them!  I&#x27;m so glad that I can find it on Amazon!!  Sometimes I can&#x27;t find this lotion in stores so I rely on Amazon to help me out and they haven&#x27;t failed me yet!  It&#x27;s definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This is simply the best hand lotion I have ever used. I love that it isn&#x27;t greasy, and I can actually see the difference in my hands when used a few times a week. The scent is not overpowering either. I have paid a lot more for a jar of hand lotion, but I have never had these results. I have a smaller size tube in my purse at all times, too. This makes a great gift, and I have converted a lot of new customers for this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product description listed directly below pricing is different from the description further down on the product page.  I thought I was going to be receiving the Camille, English Lavender, Gardenia Breeze, Glycerine Rosewater and White Lilac scents that are listed at the top of the page, but instead got the Camille, French Vanilla, Mango Beach No2, Tuscan Honey, Midnight Monarch and Morelia Monarch scents listed further down in the product description (I didn&#x27;t notice this before I checked out).  Since there was a discrepancy between the two, I have to give this particular product a lower rating.</li>
    <li> Love having the small sizes to try out different fragrances.  Each container has a couple of applications.  It is very creamy and works well on my dry hands and elbows.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift!  My daughter just loved it!</li>
