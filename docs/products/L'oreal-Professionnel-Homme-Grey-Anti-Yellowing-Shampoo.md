    <li> It does what it says and helps to remove the yellowing stains that naturally occur with grey hair. I only use it once a week and only a little is needed.</li>
    <li> I continue to receive compliment about the color of my silver? white? grey? hair. Anyway the color definitely has no tinge of yellow!&lt;br /&gt;I am now on my second bottle and plan on getting another, then another and another.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low in my \\&quot;very\\&quot; rural area for these two products.  Finally, after spending some time on the internet.  I found just what I wanted on Amazon.  With low shipping cost.  I often find just what I want on Amazon.  Thank You</li>
    <li> this made my hair bright and shiny like no other grey hair shampoo I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Have had trouble finding this in stores. Great shampoo for my gray hair.</li>
    <li> This did what it advertised it would do, take the yellow out of white hair.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need alot and it really conditions your hair nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get alot so I would suggest using another shampoo in between using&lt;br /&gt;this to make it last longer.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great!  I have tried numerous products to get the yellowish tinge out of my silver (not grey hair....tried to put silver on my driver&#x27;s license renewal and they said \\&quot;nice try.\\&quot; lol  Okay had to go with GREY there.....) This is actually the only product that has actually gotten the yellow tones out of my hair.  Only have to use just a little bit to get a great lather, and it seems to condition my hair, too.  Leaves it soft &amp; shiney.  Good product!</li>
    <li> My grey hair was showing shades of yellow and sometimes green from product use.  This shampoo brought back the natural silver-grey color that I wanted.  So glad that I found it on Amazon as I have never seen it on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo, leave hair soft and clean. Only negative leaves a slight purple tint in hair. May look for a different brand.</li>
    <li> I do like the product which I use once a month. It&#x27;s made for men but works for me which is great. It does stain the shelf so I put something on the bottom.</li>
    <li> The label on the shampoo  identified it as  L&#x27;Oreal PROFESSIONNEL Paris but all information was printed in the German language.  At the bottom of the label are the English words - Made in Spain.  When I had the label translated I discovered that it included no specific directions for use.  I did try the shampoo twice and allowed the lather to remain on my hair for several minutes.  It had no visible effect that I could see; my white hair is still tinted yellow.  I&#x27;m afraid to use the shampoo for a longer period of time without knowing if it could damage my hair.  Perhaps it is a rip-off that&#x27;s actually harmful.</li>
    <li> Good product very much overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have a platinum blonde undercut and my stylist recommended this to me to keep my hair from yellowing from product use and the hard water in our city. This shampoo is great! It is harsh, and I only use it once a week which is enough to keep the yellow tones out of my hair. It&#x27;s really purple and dense and if you leave it in too long or use it too often it will leave a purplish tinge in your hair. Even if you don&#x27;t have dyed or bleached hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day unless you use a lot of conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to he yellow of white hair!  I&#x27;ve tried 5 others and nothing  compares to this products results</li>
    <li> My daughter bought me this a couple of years ago claiming my white hair looked a little yellow, not any longer thanks to this product. I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.</li>
    <li> Good product. Helps to keep your grey from turning yellow.</li>
    <li> but dryes the hair at maximum, i didn like it, turns my hair a straw, never saw my hair like this before</li>
    <li> It helps.  Have to be careful about how often you use it or it will give your hair a purple tint.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shampoo to make my white hair really white - I have found the solution.  This product is amazing</li>
    <li> Purchased this shampoo for my husband who has beautiful gray hair, but it was beginning to show signs of yellowing.  He has used the shampoo three or four times and the yellow is disappearing.</li>
    <li> This is a great cleaning shampoo that leaves the grey and white hair sparking.  I use it about once a month and it does not leave that &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; tint that some of the whitening shampoos do.  I would recommend this shampoo for people with grey and/or white hair.</li>
    <li> I find this product better than others I have tried, but I still have a slight yellowish area in my bangs that will not go away.  All in all I will continue to use the product.  It has only been a month since I began using it.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that actually works.  Have been struggling with light yellow in my white hair for month--this fixed it in just two shampoos.  Regular use now should keep my hair looking beautiful.  Thank you L&#x27;Oreal for a great product.</li>
    <li> The shampoo does tone down the yellow somewhat but after using it for a month, it really dries my hair out.  I wash my hair every other day so now I am down to using it once a week.  I won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
