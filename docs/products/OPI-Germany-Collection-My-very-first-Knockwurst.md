      <li>I first saw it where I go for manicures/pedicures.  </li>
      <li>Thanks seller!</li>
      <li>Love this polish such a pretty color</li>
      <li>It loos exactly as shown in the pic.</li>
      <li>Okay so I got this bottle in the mail about a week later after making my order.</li>
      <li>pretty.</li>

      <li>Odd name for such a lovely color.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a little thick, but if you put the color on right, &amp; use Top Coat, it will last, it&#x27;s just so fresh looking to me.</li>
      <li>looks like a color an 85 year old would wear on a daily basis!</li>
      <li>The next 3 days I finally decided to use my new polish.</li>
      <li>Oh and I still have shine (although I used Revlon&#x27;s quick dry base coat &amp; quick dry top coat) which have done wonders for me.</li>
      <li>It looks pretty similar to the color of the bottle on this page, maybe slightly darker.</li>
      <li>A little grayer than expected but shipped quickly.</li>

    <li> Great color that is not pink, nor lavender, nor beige, but a combination of those colors that work well against my skin tone.  It&#x27;s also easy to apply.  Does not go on chalky or too sheer.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and the color choices are great. Odd name for such a lovely color. It is very neutral and goes with anything. With a base coat and top coat, it lasts about 7-10 days without touch-ups.</li>

The next 3 days I finally decided to use my new polish. The very first coat went on opaque and was nice but I wanted like 2 coats. I ended up doing 2-3 coats (I don&#x27;t recall) &amp; absolutely LOVE this polish. No streaking and it&#x27;s a beautiful CREAMY pasty greyish-pink, definitely a neutral color. It&#x27;s been about a week now since I&#x27;ve had the polish on &amp; there&#x27;s some type of anti-chip formula in this polish. I&#x27;ve been washing dishes, constantly washing my hair, taking long showers, wrestling with my pit bull dogs, you name it, I&#x27;ve done it &amp; yes I&#x27;ve got an itty bitty chip that is so not noticeable. Oh and I still have shine (although I used Revlon&#x27;s quick dry base coat &amp; quick dry top coat) which have done wonders for me. Get this polish ladies, it is beautiful, definitely my longest wearing polish EVER. I will be back to purchase another bottle as this is now my favorite polish to wear! (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Love this polish. It is a perfect pinky nude and it takes such a long time to chip. I washed dishes and bathed my daughter everyday and it took 4 or 5 days to chip.</li>
    <li> I new I was taking a chance when ordering this online. The color is closer to a lavender but that was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great neutral, goes with everything!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t like light pink polish but this one is quite opaque abd pretty. Like amazons OPI Prices.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  It came immediately.  Thanks seller!</li>
    <li> Love this polish such a pretty color</li>
    <li> This color wears more lavender then pink. The opacity is great but the formula is think. It is a unique color and I thought it was very pretty for a neutral shade.</li>
