      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>They came in handy at Jersey City Fashion Week.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also great for lipliner of drawing fine lines for a more imaginative makeup.</li>
      <li>The tips are fastened very securely to the plastic handles and unlike q tips don&#x60;t &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; or pull off.</li>
      <li>These are ok....</li>
      <li>I will buy more.</li>
      <li>(they are a bit pointy) but for a basic line they are perfect.</li>
      <li>arrived fast great quality</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more when I run out of them.</li>
      <li>In a lot of cases they work much better than q tips.</li>
      <li>I love these applicators they work fabulously for my eye liner.</li>
      <li>I know they weren&#x27;t intended for that, but they work just fine.</li>

      <li>These are super cheap feeling</li>
      <li>I was buying pricey disposable wands before thinking it was the only way to find good quality, but these are my favorite so far!</li>
      <li>Very fine tips that (in my testing so far) stay sharp will allow me to apply dye or paint with great precision.</li>
      <li>They are cheap quality though and you will go through them fast.</li>
      <li>I am using this product to apply my latisse economically.</li>
      <li>Professional products bought so easily like this and delivered to your door is novel and far better than going into a wholesalers.</li>
      <li>These will work great for my purpose - small touch-ups on my leather projects.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually been able to reuse it brush by just wiping it off after the eyeliner application.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The lipstick brushes are only OK (my reasoning for the 4 instead of 5 star review).</li>
      <li>or if I&#x27;m supposed to use them for some other kind of application.</li>
      <li>thanks 👌</li>
      <li>My answer to this challenge has been to use eye shadow as liner, which works really well, but which also requires using a liner brush and cleaning the liner brush and basically spending too much time worrying about makeup and the brush maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You definitely need to go over it with a lipstick brush (defeating the point) or perhaps a lip gloss wand to smooth the streaks.</li>
      <li>Eyeliner is my particular bugaboo.</li>
      <li>Also, they are nice and firm so they actually separate the lashes and get rid of clumps.</li>
      <li>These are great for applying a thin line of color without having to wash or clean the same brush (or buy a bunch of more expensive brushes).</li>
      <li>The other problem is you have to clean the brushes often else</li>
      <li>I saw these on Amazon the little light bulb came on in my brain - what if I could just use one and toss it?</li>
      <li>but I found that if you wiggled the head back and forth, the tip would soften and make it much easier to apply the gel eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting a soft tip.</li>
      <li>They were too soft and when I tried to pick up color from a jar of cream eyeliner</li>
      <li>Pour a small amount of alcohol into a bottle top or similar container.  </li>
      <li>I have a drawer full of expensive and cheap pencils that smudge and run and pull my eyelids and basically sit in the drawer unused.</li>

<li> True, these are stiff, non-resiliant, pointy little wands.</li>
<li> I got these to use with my watercolors, and so far they seem to do the job where lifting color from tight spots are needed.</li>
<li> The tips on these are really hard, like the applicators on cheap lipgloss except small and pointy.</li>

<li> but I expected that.  </li>

<li> That being said, I don&#x27;t do my water line and would be a little hesitant to use one of these</li>
<li> They make lipstick look streaky since the bristles are so firm.</li>
<li> The brush is a bit stiff</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a defect</li>
<li> They&#x27;re all hard.</li>
<li> The brush doesn&#x27;t get hard after the cleaning.  </li>
<li> The bristles are stuck together and hard.</li>
<li> However the ends are not great and do not hold the product well.  </li>
<li> These are the worst brushes ever, hard tip makes it impossible to apply product, very nonabsorbent.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m one of those women who like makeup, but hate to spend a fortune on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

    <li> Really good that I can pick these things up so conveniently online . Professional products bought so easily like this and delivered to your door is novel and far better than going into a wholesalers. I am using this product to apply my latisse economically. I can fully recommend !</li>

    <li> Where have you been all my life?  I traditionally use the gel eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve gone through so, so many expensive eyeliner brushes and in the end, they always fray and you have to throw it away.  The other problem is you have to clean the brushes often else you&#x27;ll get eye infections.  This is the perfect solution!  I never even knew this existed until I found it by accident.  The brush is a bit stiff but I found that if you wiggled the head back and forth, the tip would soften and make it much easier to apply the gel eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve actually been able to reuse it brush by just wiping it off after the eyeliner application.  The brush doesn&#x27;t get hard after the cleaning.  This is a must for every gel eyeliner use!!!</li>
    <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
    <li> Love these!  Helps me with sanitation and speed when doing other&#x27;s makeup.</li>
    <li> These are the worst brushes ever, hard tip makes it impossible to apply product, very nonabsorbent. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
    <li> As I was looking for gun cleaning brushes I stumbled across these. They work great. In a lot of cases they work much better than q tips. The tips are fastened very securely to the plastic handles and unlike q tips don&#x60;t &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; or pull off. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re all hard. I was expecting a soft tip. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a defect or if I&#x27;m supposed to use them for some other kind of application. The bristles are stuck together and hard.</li>
    <li> Got them for a friends business, she was excited to use them and thought that they were perfect! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The tips on these are really hard, like the applicators on cheap lipgloss except small and pointy. There&#x27;s almost no give on the tips so it&#x27;s kinda like applying with a toothpick. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>

You definitely need to go over it with a lipstick brush (defeating the point) or perhaps a lip gloss wand to smooth the streaks.</li>
    <li> I have a bunch of MAC Chromaline pots that I use as eyeliner. These are great for applying a thin line of color without having to wash or clean the same brush (or buy a bunch of more expensive brushes). I have one for each color, they&#x27;re great for travel, and they&#x27;re nice and small. They&#x27;re also great for lipliner of drawing fine lines for a more imaginative makeup.</li>
    <li> These will work great for my purpose - small touch-ups on my leather projects. Very fine tips that (in my testing so far) stay sharp will allow me to apply dye or paint with great precision.</li>
    <li> True, these are stiff, non-resiliant, pointy little wands. BUT, there&#x27;s a way to soften them up since water does nothing!  (Esp. now that you have 100 pcs.) Pour a small amount of alcohol into a bottle top or similar container.  Move the wand around until it softens the bristles.  Run under water to remove any alcohol and let dry.  Now it works wet/dry.</li>
    <li> I love these applicators they work fabulously for my eye liner. I will be purchasing more when I run out of them.</li>
    <li> Just perfect! Helping me a lot to simulate the makeup to my clients. Great!</li>
    <li> arrived fast great quality</li>
    <li> Use them for spot coverage to get into the tiniest places&lt;br /&gt;Use another one for precise eye lining&lt;br /&gt;Use another one for clean-up or correction&lt;br /&gt;Use them for everything&lt;br /&gt;Pack them in your travel carry-on, your daily makeup bag, bring them everywhere.</li>
    <li> I purchased these after reading disposable mascra wand all these would be good for is liquid eye liner and maybe lip stick ....</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me.  They were too soft and when I tried to pick up color from a jar of cream eyeliner I either can&#x27;t get enough color on the brush or I end up fraying the brush when I press a bit harder against the cream eyeliner to pick up color.</li>
    <li> These are super cheap feeling but I expected that.  However the ends are not great and do not hold the product well.  I purchased for gel eyeliner and the ends have no give the slide across your eye.  Attempted to use them a couple times... just threw out the rest.</li>
    <li> These are ok....good for the price i guess. They are cheap quality though and you will go through them fast. one only lasts me about a week.</li>
    <li> They came in handy at Jersey City Fashion Week. Great applicator when doing multiple looks!</li>
