      <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better than burt&#x27;s bees.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>

      <li>Not greasy but nice, light coverage.</li>
      <li>My lips are feeling way better and not chapped.</li>
      <li>It has nice mild taste, and goes on really silky.</li>
      <li>First off it smells like coconut, the balm goes on smooth and has a light sweetness to it</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like coconut -- it smells mildly sweet and waxy.</li>

      <li>No tight feeling, no dryness -- just moist and doesn&#x27;t feel like a huge thing of open cracking</li>
      <li>This lip balm is a shoe in if you like coconut-it is very moisturising and made of all natural ingredients</li>
      <li>I decided to try something new</li>
      <li>With the ingredients listed I thought it would be buttery soft on my lips</li>
      <li>Seems like its all natural ingredients (although i havent checked the company)</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product, from *my* experiencing pretty fast effects from only a few applications in 24 hours.</li>
      <li>It felt like my lips were contracting inwards and feeling super tight all the time as I didn&#x27;t apply anything to my lips.</li>
      <li>When I applied it on my lips, it was like really greasy, but it does moisturizes the lips for a long time.</li>
      <li>was starting to get dry and chapped on the lips from it being cold outside, but most of all I think I was getting super chapped from allergies.</li>
      <li>Not as waxy as other normal chapsticks.</li>

    <li> I decided to try something new and I LOVE anything coconut so I thought why not? First off it smells like coconut, the balm goes on smooth and has a light sweetness to it and I like the fact that the base is bee&#x27;s wax. I will continue to use this in addition to my regular brand but overall it&#x27;s a great buy and a great lip balm! If you like coconut, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Best chap stick I have ever bought and when I lost it I shed a little tear because it was so great</li>
    <li> I ordered this chap stick looking for something a little more natural that I could feel good about using.  I like that it is certified organic, so I don&#x27;t feel like I am digesting harmful unnecessary chemicals every time i lick my lips. It has nice mild taste, and goes on really silky.</li>
    <li> With the ingredients listed I thought it would be buttery soft on my lips but it&#x27;s not.  Has little smell and a bit stiff.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This Coconut Cream lip balm is really amazing.  It lasts for a really really long time.  I put it on before bedtime and in the morning there&#x27;s still some on my lips, protecting and smoothing them.  I like the feel and the flavor and will be purchasing this product for many years to come now that I have discovered it!  Invest the 3 bucks and see for yourself if it isn&#x27;t better than what you&#x27;re using.</li>
    <li> My daugther loves this product!</li>
    <li> The lip balm&#x27;s smell is a little bit like artificial flavors which makes the coconut smell of the lip balm kind of nasty. When I applied it on my lips, it was like really greasy, but it does moisturizes the lips for a long time. This is an okay lip balm since it&#x27;s so greasy and mushy and the taste is okay. But really fast shipping. Took only 4 days to come.</li>
    <li> this is the best lip balm there is.  it&#x27;s much better than burt&#x27;s bees.  all organic ingredients and is long-lasting</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Best lip moisturizer out there.</li>
    <li> I love it!  You use it so much less than other lip balms!  I recommend it.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this lip balm, but I should have listened to other reviewers. The taste is coconuty, but has a weird fake coconut taste that I just can&#x27;t get past. It also leaves a sort of whiteness on your lips that I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
    <li> I just bought this from the local supermarket yesterday. It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like coconut -- it smells mildly sweet and waxy. A sweet, waxy tropical smell I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to get dry and chapped on the lips from it being cold outside, but most of all I think I was getting super chapped from allergies. It felt like my lips were contracting inwards and feeling super tight all the time as I didn&#x27;t apply anything to my lips. Whenever I stretched my lips or anything touched the outside chapped part of my lips, it stung. vertical ridges lining all along the edges. Sorry for it sounding graphic. But this is probably the worst it gets for me when it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this stuff probably 3 times since I bought it about 24 hours ago. My lips are feeling way better and not chapped. It&#x27;s healed up a lot and really isn&#x27;t bothering me now. No tight feeling, no dryness -- just moist and doesn&#x27;t feel like a huge thing of open cracking wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, from *my* experiencing pretty fast effects from only a few applications in 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Smells like the beach to me. Sooo good. Not as waxy as other normal chapsticks. Seems like its all natural ingredients (although i havent checked the company) id use this to replenish moisture but not to protect against wind</li>
    <li> Very good product, very quick shipment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> this stuff works great however it took almost three weeks to make it to my house. its very tastey and it smells wonderful</li>
    <li> This lip balm is the BEST one out there! I have tried so many lip balms including Burt&#x27;s Bees and I swear by this one. This is a coconut lip balm which really moisturized your lips without making look &amp;#34;greasy/sticky&amp;#34;. I love the smell of it but it&#x27;s not strong. You only need to apply it once or if you have really dry lips then maybe twice a day and it keeps your lips moisturized all day. I highly recommend this product----and for it being an organic product it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is a shoe in if you like coconut-it is very moisturising and made of all natural ingredients</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Not greasy but nice, light coverage.</li>
