      <li>I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, and wish I had been told that it stains - skin, clothing, even sink counter!  </li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>But I like how it works my eyes, better than those over the counter products.</li>
      <li>I love the brightness they add to the eye.  </li>
      <li>They should be disposed after 10 days after opening also.&lt;br /&gt;Laiter lasts longer not to mention work way better than Innoxa.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to give this more of a try</li>
      <li>There was at most a 5-10% whitening of the eyes and lasted a couple hours.</li>
      <li>Love the way this brightens the whites of my eyes--also makes my eye color pop.</li>
      <li>I love the drops.  </li>
      <li>Most people have not heard of this, but I read about it in an obscure news rag.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>No alcohol like so many eye drops.  </li>
      <li>It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because it could be just a bit whiter, but i love it.</li>
      <li>Better than visine</li>
      <li>This product does a great job of brightning my eyes in the am, I very often don&#x27;t get enought sleep, but the bley eye drops fool everyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>eyes sure didn&#x27;t get whitened or brightened.&lt;br</li>
      <li>visine worked better.</li>
      <li>I buy a lot from Amazon and love them.</li>
      <li>You will be pleased.</li>
      <li>Amazing product to make the whites really brilliant white.</li>
      <li>The drops do an okay job.</li>
      <li>Works, and works for many hours if you put two drops in each eye.  </li>
      <li>These are the best for lasting clarity.</li>
      <li>Maybe a couple hours at most.  </li>
      <li>These drops are so interesting.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work ok.</li>
      <li>each time visine did better.</li>
      <li>My eyes felt so much better after using it.</li>
      <li>Love love love these drops they make my eyes look fantastic</li>
      <li>it does make the eyes look so clear and beautiful...</li>
      <li>pretty good product.</li>
      <li>i am very glad to be able to buy them in such good condition through amazon</li>
      <li>There is also the important question of how safe this product is for the eyes.</li>
      <li>That is how good this product really works.  </li>
      <li>Just one tiny drop of these in each eye leaves the whites so bright that you would swear I had just returned from a restful spa vacation!</li>
      <li>I have tried other brands but this one (in my opinion) works best.</li>
      <li>, I was really impressed at the difference as I did only one eye at first to test it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re lucky and put a drop in your eyes without hitting anything else, then you&#x27;re ok.</li>
      <li>but I thought I was going to see a huge difference for the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff does make you eyes appear much more bright and white</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
      <li>The product works great though, almost immediately takes the red out of my eyes</li>
      <li>it does work but you need more than one drop run out faster than it shoul last but def good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best to make sure you&#x27;re not wearing your \\&quot;outfit\\&quot; when you put it on to prevent staining (methylene blue is a medical grade dye).  </li>
      <li>They make my green eyes dazzling!</li>
      <li>I came across these drops in Europe as an actor, make up dept would put 1 drop in each eye just before a close up, and sure your eyes &#x27;popped&#x27; on screen looking healthy , clear whites and defined irises.</li>
      <li>Clean face, put on moisturizer and put in eye drops.</li>
      <li>Good for special occasions and have had may people comment on how blue my eyes are.</li>
      <li>The whites of you eyes are bright and all the red is kept away all day!</li>
      <li>they  cool  off your  </li>
      <li>These drops are very soothing to the eyes, more so than the ones you can buy over the counter.</li>
      <li>I gave it 2 stars because the company that shipped it allowed me to return it for a full refund.  </li>
      <li>The best I ever used and fantastic if you had a late night!</li>
      <li>I could not recommend it more highly.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a bit much for eye drops but having young looking sparkling white eyes is priceless.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Turns you eyes white and healthy looking and brighter...definitely buy again and again. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These drops are unbelievable!! I&#x27;ve used other redness eye drops in the past but none of them compare to Collyre Bleu. My eyes felt worse and even more red the next day after using the other name brand eye drops but not once has that happened with these...in fact, my eyes are whiter than ever after using them! I&#x27;m def a loyal customer!!!</li>
    <li> the product meet my expectations</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected.Didn&#x27;t completely clear my eyes ad hoped.</li>
    <li> Most people have not heard of this, but I read about it in an obscure news rag.  Said movie stars use it to whiten their red or bloodshot eyes.  I have dry eye &amp; allergies.  This stuff is amazing.  Not only does it whiten, but has an ingredient in it that soothes.  No alcohol like so many eye drops.  Good stuff!  My eyes are brown, btw.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a staple in my morning routine. It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because it could be just a bit whiter, but i love it.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes feel a bit funny. The blue really gets in your tear duct and stains any skin it may get on. Not worth the $ in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These drops do make red eyes appear whiter, but only for a few hours.  And if you have a history of migraines stay away from it.  There&#x27;s an ingredient that triggers migraines and I ended up getting one of the worst migraines I&#x27;ve ever had from just one day of use.  I gave it 2 stars because the company that shipped it allowed me to return it for a full refund.  I would give them 5 stars for customer service.</li>
    <li> Keeps your eyes so clear!</li>
    <li> excellent glow for the eyes</li>
    <li> My eyes tend to get extremely irritated and sometimes slightly yellow.  This product made my eyes white instantly!  I could not recommend it more highly.  The only slight down-side to it is that it only lasts for a short period of time.  Maybe a couple hours at most.  Aside from that, I am completely happy with it!</li>
    <li> The first eye drop that worked for me. I have red eyes due to my GP contact lens and this product actually made my sclera white. My eyes felt so much better after using it.</li>
    <li> This product whitens the sclera  but settles on the yellow stain of the eye turning it blue.  How long does it take for the yellow  stain on the eye to disappear?</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t burn my eyes. It seems to work ok. Be carefule because it will stain your skin and whatever it drips on blue. I just use a wet paper towel to wipe around my eyes after I use the drops.</li>
    <li> They were just ok, what I didn&#x27;t like is that the sling under the eye stays blue for a while.</li>
    <li> Consistently brightens eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several blue drops but I swear by this one. My MUA (makeup artist) used this product on me during allergy season and worked instantaneously!  It&#x27;s best to make sure you&#x27;re not wearing your \\&quot;outfit\\&quot; when you put it on to prevent staining (methylene blue is a medical grade dye).  The only downside is that the drops sometimes collects in the cap and you have to be really careful not to move it around to prevent getting any on yourself. Also, do not be alarmed if you find blue drainage when blowing your nose; your tear ducts are connected to your nose so there&#x27;s a likelihood of some of the drops seeping into the nasal passages.</li>
    <li> I have read many good things about these eye drops online.  However, I was not impressed when I received them.  The blue colouring will stain the surfaces in your bathroom, so watch out.  Also, it will sometimes dry around your tear duct--giving you the impression of having on eye shadow (not a good look, especially if you&#x27;re a guy like me.)    I did not notice much of a change in the clarity of my eyes after I put in the eye drops.  I would suggest that you save your money.  I am still looking for some good eye drops that will make your eyes \\&quot;pop;\\&quot; however, these ones do not.  I think the Rohto V brand (which you can buy in a drug store) works better and is a third of the price.</li>
    <li> These drops are very soothing to the eyes, more so than the ones you can buy over the counter.</li>
    <li> These eye drops have been a lifesaver for me. I usually wake up every morning with red, bloodshot eyes, caused by either lack of sleep, allergies or my recent use of Latisse. Just one tiny drop of these in each eye leaves the whites so bright that you would swear I had just returned from a restful spa vacation! I have tried other brands but this one (in my opinion) works best. I use them daily as part of my morning ritual.    One word of advice: Do not get these drops on your clothing or bed linens! They will permanently stain fabric.</li>
    <li> I came across these drops in Europe as an actor, make up dept would put 1 drop in each eye just before a close up, and sure your eyes &#x27;popped&#x27; on screen looking healthy , clear whites and defined irises. It works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had different brands of eyedrops( same idea) but that one so far worst, made my eyes look green and stained on white surfaces ! Not cool</li>
    <li> I would never buy this product again!! I used this product for a month. It the same thing any other over the counter eye drop would do. It really didn&#x27;t last long as far as making my eyes whiter. What a waste of my hard earned money!!</li>
    <li> These are great eye drops that actually reduce redness and they DO color the whites of an eye into blue! Amazing! Not for the whole day, of course, but for a couple of hours, worth to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I used Innoxa for some time, but when I used them they were now known in USA, so there was no place to buy them unless I stock myself up while traveling. They should be disposed after 10 days after opening also.&lt;br /&gt;Laiter lasts longer not to mention work way better than Innoxa.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking into returning this product. It is a powerful blue dye that stains the skin which, as another reviewer suggested, is especially awkward for a guy. There was at most a 5-10% whitening of the eyes and lasted a couple hours. There are other more easily available and less expensive products that achieve the same effect. There is also the important question of how safe this product is for the eyes. Remember the problem with red dye #2 back years ago? I&#x27;d worry about damaging the eyes with continued use. This product is definately not worth $40!</li>
    <li> Awesome eye drops and AMAZING seller!  No regrets in any way with this purchase!  Your red eyes will be GONE!</li>
    <li> This product does a great job of brightning my eyes in the am, I very often don&#x27;t get enought sleep, but the bley eye drops fool everyone.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product before. Now it is in a different box and doesnt seem as effective but still makes a little difference. Have the ingredidents changed i wonder. I still use it though. I also wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to buy and ship to ireland</li>
    <li> I got this stuff thinking it would make my eyes sparkle a little more mabey be a little bluer but unfortunately, it DOSENT WORK AT ALL, THE SUBSTANCE IS BLUE AND IT DOSENT DO ANYTHING! You may as well just get blue food dye and stick that in your eye. also after being in my eye for like 2 min, it caused redness and irritation.</li>
    <li> Product stains everything it touches blue. When placed in the eye it burns like hell. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Says it is &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; blue. It&#x27;s more like dark blue food coloring. It&#x27;ll stain your skin and eyelids. A few drops also hit my sink and I&#x27;m not sure the stains are coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re lucky and put a drop in your eyes without hitting anything else, then you&#x27;re ok. The fluid soaks in I assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it does remove redness, but not really the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; tint. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a tingling or temporary burning sensation like some others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you&#x27;re not afraid to put a drop of dark blue liquid in your eyeball, then it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
    <li> These eye drops worked pretty well. I&#x27;ve always had problems with red eyes and Laiter Collyre Bleu made them whiter than the other brands and they felt hydrated. I like how the hint of blue makes my eyes look whiter.</li>
    <li> it does work but you need more than one drop run out faster than it shoul last but def good.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. The solution looks like a dark navy ink and in stains everything around but your eyes. It does nothing to brighten up your eyes. It will dye your waterline and inner corners navy blue right after applying which looks awful. The worse thing about this product though is that it causes blurry vision for few hours. I couldn&#x27;t get rid of this even after trying to clear up my eyes with regular eye drops from the pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;No returns, so if you get fooled by the promising description, Collyre \\&quot;Blur\\&quot; are yours. Save your money and get Bausch + Lomb Opcon-A instead which not only make your eyes look fresh, white and rested, but it will soothe them.&lt;br /&gt;Either Collyre Bleu is a bad product with good marketing campaign OR Bright Eyes sells fake version.</li>
    <li> These are your average &amp;#34;Get The Red Out&amp;#34; style drops. It does the job if you&#x27;re looking to TEMPORARILY get rid of the redness as this contains Naphtazoline. As far as the blue dye (Methylene Blue) that is in these drops makes it slightly more effective to how your eyes will look versus Clear Eyes or Visine. In my opinion these are not worth paying $20+ for and obviously not something you want to use everyday because of rebound redness.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of putting eye drops in all day due to dry eyes, try these. I add one drop every morning. You can use these on other eye colors besides blue. My daughter uses them and she has brown eyes. The whites of you eyes are bright and all the red is kept away all day!</li>
    <li> This one I do like very much. It gets the red out fast and the whites of my eyes are clear of redness. Will buy this again</li>
    <li> did not live up to stated claims- no increase in scleral whitenesss nor increase in eye blueness - no irritation- if you want to refund purchase price I would take it.  dp skoog</li>
    <li> this s*** its gonna damage your eyes, and you look weird with blue eye, i returned and i don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I do like these eye drops a lot. They seem to clear my eyes up a lot. It&#x27;s not a miracle drop and does require continued use, so one application may not do it. But I did native my eye freckles lighten up and whiter eyes in a couple of days. So I have to say that this might need to go on every model, bride and vain woman&#x27;s list. Men too! (Because I don&#x27;t want to stair into your yellow or blood shot eyes. BEWARE: The only draw back is that you need to apply these before you wash your face. Any leakage can result in some dark blue dye around your eyes or on your cheeks.</li>
    <li> Stained my eyes blue...I had to call in sick from work to visit the doctor about my blue eyes....HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!....Waste of $$$...DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED AS I WAS!!!</li>
    <li> Heard about this product several weeks ago and had to wait to get it due to high demand and sell-outs on many sites.  Was a little hesitant to pay that much for eye drops, but product had gotten rave reviews. Result?  It&#x27;s ok.  I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference, and wish I had been told that it stains - skin, clothing, even sink counter!  Overall glad I tried but didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff as my eyes tend to be red, even after getting my eye surgery and no longer using contacts. I bought this while traveling abroad for holiday/work, so I was not sleeping a lot at night (as per usual) and flying long hours.... These drops work wonders on my eyes! They are white and they shine. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice eye drops. I used after I got eye lash extensions and helped to make my eyes more white. Better than visine</li>
    <li> I got this brand rather than the brand I bought previously because it sounded like it may be a better product. While I have no complaints on my prior brand (which really does work to brighten and get the red out very well) I did choose this and am sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really stings, my other brand didn&#x27;t. This didn&#x27;t seem to clear the eye of redness and brighten it up as well either.. it went in the garbage (yes I should have asked for a refund) and I reordered my old brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may really want to look at another brand.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but it does work. Be careful nit to get it in your clothes, because it does stain and it is very difficult to get out.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. I love the drops.  It works well to eliminate yellowing from the Florida sun!  I keep this around the house</li>
    <li> Love the way this brightens the whites of my eyes--also makes my eye color pop.</li>
    <li> Love love love these drops they make my eyes look fantastic and I&#x27;ve tried everything. I&#x27;m greatful for reviews or else I would have never bought this product! At 30$ it&#x27;s a bit much for eye drops but having young looking sparkling white eyes is priceless. Oh beware the Blue color drops look freaky and you have to use them with a towel in hand to prevent a mess. Just use a tiny drop is all you really need and they should last you a while. Enjoy</li>
    <li> Got the product in time. Be careful with your clothes, it stains. But I like how it works my eyes, better than those over the counter products.</li>
    <li> makes your eyes so white, but you can&#x27;t use it too much! leaves blue stains on your face. other than that go for it!</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because this product really worked for me.  And I will be ordering next week for this particular product one more time.  That is how good this product really works.  Yes I was recommended to this product from somebody else and I have already recommended this product to my sister to use she said it has really worked for her as well. The only things is that you will see a blue ring ,before eye whitening</li>
    <li> Crazy expensive, but amazing how white my eyes get - it&#x27;s like Photoshop in a bottle.  Never had any kind of stinging so I don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about–they may not work for everyone but when they do work they are the best.</li>
    <li> These eye drops are amazing! The best I ever used and fantastic if you had a late night! Just couple if drops!</li>
    <li> I used blue on one eye and use visine on the other eye. visine worked better. visine is $2. collyre eye drop is  $28. I tried it as directed couple of times. each time visine did better. I also tried it with another eye drop called murine. Murine worked 125 percent better than collyre blue. Murine is $3. My conclusion is that murine and visine produce longer lasting, much clearer eyes and they cost $1-$3 dollars. Collyre should stop the hype and should not be seling it for $28 dollars at all. I am glad that Amazon.com did the right thing and took the product back and credited my account for it</li>
    <li> I love the brightness they add to the eye.  If you only put one drop in each eye per the directions, you will never have them run down your face.  Just have a tissue ready so when you tip your head forward, you can dab any excess.  You shouldn&#x27;t have to do this if you only use one drop per eye.  It would be nice if they didn&#x27;t cost so much but they do last quite a while.  I wear contacts and they don&#x27;t bother them a bit.</li>
    <li> Because I like the product.  It works.  The others are fakes and do no work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> literally are the best eye drops ever!! my eyes are ALWAYS red but now they are white. SO THANKFUL. will buy again and again and again</li>
    <li> I think they are illegal in Switzerland. But when I lived in Switzerland my mother always bought these eye drops (not the same brand but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s similar). Put a couple of drop in each eye and the eyes really pop, the white of the eye is really white. I&#x27;m not an optomologist but  haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects.</li>
    <li> Works very well, would buy again.  Eye drops makes my eyes look bright and the drops don&#x27;t burn at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and had it shipped all the way to South Africa because of the great results it promises. I dont want to mislead anyone here, so unless you want blue eyes, because the product is a deep blue dye...then don&#x27;t bother. It has no effect on the yellow of your eyes. Infact it taints the yellow and turns it an offish blueish colour. Odd Product this one! No wonder theres no refund for opened packs. I dont recommend it. And you have 20 days to use after opening it...I&#x27;m highly disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> This stuff does make you eyes appear much more bright and white, I was really impressed at the difference as I did only one eye at first to test it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product..Please read other comments on product. ITs pricing for Blue food coloring. I did try the product as directed..didn&#x27;t see any results.. Sorry</li>
    <li> product works surprisingly well, just one drop goes along way</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent price and product.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> makes the white of your eyes super white</li>
    <li> Hydrating, but I saw no improvement from the tint. In fact, having applied the drops well before putting in my contacts, I noticed later that the drops had tinted the edge of my contacts... I keep them in my desk at work for back-up on days I&#x27;m wearing my glasses. I much prefer the Blink gel drops; it takes a moment to adjust to the thicker drops, but the Blinks last all day.</li>
    <li> Great for eye strain from working on the computer all day.  They seem to make a difference in how white the whites of my eyes appear as well.</li>
    <li> I hate that it expires after only 20 days, otherwise it works well and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> It works, but i look like a drag queen after using it because of the blue dye staining around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I am a certified Amazonoholic - I buy a lot from Amazon and love them. This eye drop is probably my best buy all year. I really was prepared to be disappointed but was so wowed.by this product. This immediately makes my sclera as white as a baby&#x27;s. I have never seen anything like this! I have already turned many people on to it already!  Buy it with confidence. You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> The drops do an okay job. I bought them for my wedding, and they work slightly better than your basic visine or clear-eyes. The dye stains anything it touches like mad.</li>
    <li> I did not see my eyes get any whiter. and the blue color ran down my face and made it impossible to use this product once make up was applied.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work any different than other eye drops I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It makes my eyes twinkle....lol</li>
    <li> This produkt dosen&#x27;t Work it dosen&#x27;t Make your Eyes brither i dont Think is good and it is wery espensiv</li>
    <li> i never understood why this product cant be bought in chemists as was the case when i first started using eye drops. i am very glad to be able to buy them in such good condition through amazon</li>
    <li> Though it gives me the jollies dropping dark blue liquid in my eyes, I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this to anyone. Rather than a redness reducer is just a dye. If redness is the issue, stick to Opcon-A and Naphcon-A. This is a novelty product. If you don&#x27;t mind tossing $20 down the drain, buy it for your little sister.</li>
    <li> Did not brighten my eyes....gave me a slight headache.  Disappointed for the price I paid.  Can this be returned?</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says!  You will have brighter,&lt;br /&gt;whiter eyes and will love the results BUT BE CAREFUL!!!  The dye&lt;br /&gt;used is not FDA approved and is HARMFUL to your vision and eye&lt;br /&gt;health.  You may want to consult with an eye doctor first, mine&lt;br /&gt;said \\&quot;stay away from blue dyes\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> so refreshing !!! I get alot of migrains and it all starts in my eyes. I used this product before any reading or computer work and it really does help....LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> No, did not meet expectations, it just covers the dingy look of the eyes, doesn&#x27;t permanently remove the dingyness! Waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> These drops are so interesting.  I&#x27;ve never used them before, but decided to buy them based on other reviews.  They get 4 stars because I&#x27;m not willing to pay this price again for something that last just as long as Visine allergy or Obcon A. Though the blue color is interesting.  It makes the red scar tissue appear &amp;#34;gray-scale&amp;#34; like a black and white photo, giving the impression that the eyes are whiter. Note to people that have punctal duct plugs, they will stain the plugs and make your plugs look dirty for at least a couple weeks.  If you don&#x27;t have scarring from sun damage, these are probably amazing drops.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever. IT does not whiten or brighten your eyes, infact it made my eyes more red.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use these often, but when working the over night shift, this will make me look less tired, more awake.</li>
    <li> I have dry, red itchy eyes and have tried a few brands of blue drops. These are the best for lasting clarity.</li>
    <li> i  love  the  blue  eye drops  they  cool  off your  red tired  eyes  and  give  them  a  radience  of youth  i  will  tell  anyone  to  buy  this  product . I  have  made 4  purcheses  so  far .They work miracles on  your  eyes .</li>
    <li> I first purchased in France. This is a bluing eye drops that neutralizes redness. It is inky and will stain clothing and counter tops. Amazing product to make the whites really brilliant white.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I was able to get my hands on these eye drops! They are by far the best in the world. It is impossible to track them down in the states, so this was amazing! Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> pretty good product. the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> No doesn&#x27;t work well. Also leaves blue dye in the corner of your eye.</li>
    <li> I like it but cant use it every day because it make my eye more red. Good for special occasions and have had may people comment on how blue my eyes are.</li>
    <li> It does not work and it stained my clothes and towel.</li>
    <li> Whitens the eyes but doesn&#x27;t last long. If you get it on your skin remove ur right away otherwise it will stain your askin</li>
    <li> the Collyre Bleu Eye Drops are wonderful.  It really does take the red out your eyes and brightens them up.  In turn, your whole face seems to light up.  I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I have yellow, blood shot eyes. Not jaundice-yellow, but yellow enough that when I flitatiously asked a date a few months back what color of eyes I have, she responded, \\&quot;they&#x27;re kind of yellow.\\&quot;  It didn&#x27;t work out between us.  I decided to see a doctor about it, they ran all sorts of expensive tests and concluded that I am as fit as a fiddle with yellow eyes. So I called my brother, who is Columbia medical school trained Ophthamologist, and gave him the results. He muttered something about genetics and then yelled at his kids to share their toys. I was dejected. Medical science had failed me and now I would never fall in love. After a heady bout of internet research, I found this product. It seemed sketchy (and it still does), but after researching the individual indredients and determining that it wouldn&#x27;t make me blind, I dropped the 40 bucks. It came. And, yes, the drops are BLUE. So blue, in fact, that they stained my bathroom sink. Undaunted, I put two drops in my right eye and closed it for two minutes (like the instructions say). Guess what. It worked. Kind of. The red blood shot veins completely disappeared. Really. The yellow abated just a tinge, but enough that it was noticable. And, what&#x27;s better, I didn&#x27;t go blind! So I showed my roommates and had them guess which eye the drops went in. They could tell. So here&#x27;s my review: you will notice a slight improvement and you won&#x27;t go blind. Four stars because it&#x27;s expensive for a moderate improvement. But, hey, the eyes are the window to the soul, so they may as well be as clear as possible, right?</li>
    <li> Only tried it for 30 days so far, going to keep trying. Clearing up slowly but surely. Will tell a friend.</li>
    <li> I tried this and didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference although I have yet to try when my eyes look tired and bloodshot. It is very blue so be prepared to dab the extra blue from the corners of your eyes. best to drop into eyes before any makeup is put on. I&#x27;m going to give this more of a try but what I read what more exciting than the actual result</li>
    <li> For over $20.00,I would NOT recommend this product-just go to your local Walmart and get Clear eyes complete 7 symptom relief-I am not a spokesperson,but this was my alternative to the Collyre Bleu,and it only cost around $6..I am the&lt;br /&gt;eye drop conneseur, lol,have tried several,also&lt;br /&gt;Visene allergy drops come in close second-I only gave it 1star bc it wouldn&#x27;t let me write a review without giving it something-so definitely,&amp;#34;0&amp;#34;stars!!</li>
    <li> Made the whites of my eyes greyish.</li>
    <li> Have used these for about a month and the difference is dramatic.</li>
    <li> Made my eyes blue- great for freaking out my roommate, so that&#x27;s why I gave it an extra star.</li>
    <li> good but not excellent,it whites your eyes but I thought I was going to see a huge difference for the price.</li>
    <li> Works, and works for many hours if you put two drops in each eye.  I sometimes go with 1 drop in each eye, and typically then the redness returns within a couple of hours.  Two drops gets me through an entire date. :)  Like any redness relieving drop, you can&#x27;t use this constantly or you&#x27;ll get a bounce-back red effect.  But, if you just need something for once a day or less, this is a great product.  I have been using it for years.  Note that it will stain clothing or skin, so be careful with it.</li>
    <li> No issues with the dye getting everywhere. Just use a little and maybe a Q-Tip to wipe up should you have any residue. :)</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, especially for yellowing. Doesn&#x27;t really take the red out. Soothing on eyes.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price....</li>
    <li> This truly does whiten the whites of your eyes making you look more awake, alert and younger.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My eyes always feel dry and it can get hard to move them around. It doesn&#x27;t help that I sit in front of a computer all day at my job. These Eye Drop relieve the dryness. The liquid is blue to help balance the yellow in your eye to make it look whiter. It is important you try your best not to get it anywhere else but inside your eye or you could have blue everywhere.</li>
    <li> Two drops turns you blue.  I hated it, my husband like it better.  Yellow eyes aren&#x27;t my problem though, I hoped it would be a killer red-eye reducer.  Stick with Naphcon for clear eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years. I found out about it when I used to attend conventions on a regular basis. Late night&#x27;s with clients combined with early morning&#x27;s at a convention used to make for some bloodshot eyes. Well a few drops of this and your eyes are wedding white. I continue to use it to this day. As far as I know Amazon is now the only place to buy it. I recommend you buy 3 at a time. Once you start using it you will never want to be in a position that you run out.</li>
    <li> Since my first purchase, I am hooked. I am really happy to know there is a product like this on the market and it is affordable. This product not only brightens my eyes, but it addresses the dryness as well.  If I have an interview or an event, I can depend on this product making my eyes brighter.  The whiter your whites, the brighter your eyes will be. I have used it on a few others and their eyes brightened right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with Original Laiter Collyre Bleu Eye Drops</li>
    <li> excellent product..do not use with contact lenses. Eyes really shine and light up</li>
    <li> Made my eyes look bruised and dark,&lt;br /&gt;Just the opposite of the goal I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Better using it to make your toilet water blue&lt;br /&gt;My eyes sure didn&#x27;t get whitened or brightened.&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed with the seller or the product. Avoid this one.</li>
    <li> I bought these to reduce yellowing and redness; they worked for redness, but very messily!  The blue stains the lash line and will get under your eye if you&#x27;re not careful.  Since it only works on redness, I&#x27;m going back to cheaper, easier visine.</li>
    <li> This product never fails to make eyes clear, bright, shiny and white. Perfect for every day use, and especially nice with glamorous evening eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but willing to try since nothing else was working. My eyes are slightly discolored from age and highly allergic as well (red, itchy, watery). Two drops in each eye greatly improved their appearance.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but I will definitely be keeping these drops around. Makes my eyes feel good too.</li>
    <li> Item was not as described. Listing said it would last 2-3 months, package said discard after 20 days. The product works great though, almost immediately takes the red out of my eyes In the morning after I wake up. I&#x27;m just disappointed that it won&#x27;t last the 2-3 months as described.</li>
    <li> Extremely irritating to my eyes.  They turned red.  It does not work.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find these eyedrops.on Amazon.  I had ordered.a different brand, which were cheaper, prior to trying these....and the first brand didn&#x27;t work.  I searched for quite some time trying to find.a replacement for the colleyer bleu that came in little individual vials.  This product is the replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They passed the husband test!  I put these in mightiness beauty routine.  Clean face, put on moisturizer and put in eye drops. I walked into the family room and my husband (who is unaware of the eye drops) begins to tell me how beautiful my green eyes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find these drops the most effective when I use them in my morning facial routine (before makeup) and at night during my facial routine.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase these eye drops from now on.  They make my green eyes dazzling!</li>
    <li> it does make the eyes look so clear and beautiful...young again... I don&#x27;t think it could be good for the eyes... I don&#x27;t know... it&#x27;s dye... you can just order the dye.... I feel like it makes my eyes not focus...</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s blue dye everywhere.  Ruined my bathroom sink.</li>
</ol>
