      <li>Great service, AMAZING product.</li>
      <li>Good aroma.</li>
      <li>Good quality of oils, as always from Plant Therapy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it in a sleep blend, but it&#x27;s also good for any boo-boo blends since it supposedly helps with bruising.</li>
      <li>Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, good product</li>

      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>Great company and great oils at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Liked it</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
      <li>Sure beats taking meds.</li>
      <li>and their customer service is top notch.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this order.</li>
      <li>Love plant therapy.</li>
      <li>Another winning oil from PlantTherapy.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t ordered it specifically for it, but after doing more research on Marjoram oil uses, I entertained the thought of applying it to my shoulders for tension and pain.</li>
      <li>I love they</li>
      <li>:) I believe that Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy Majoram is equally as effective as the doTerra brand for a much more reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>Seems like a very good oil, although it is the first time I have purchased this brand as well as this particular &#x27;scent&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I purchased Sweet Marjoram to make my own menstrual cramp relief blend (5 drops sweet marjoram, 3 drops ginger, 2 drops Vetiver, 10 ml carrier oil).  </li>
      <li>Before too long my shoulders felt good!  </li>
      <li>Excellent quality, fresh and pungent, Marjoram EO is quickly absorbed as I massage it in to various sore muscles.</li>
      <li>Clean, strong smelling oil.</li>
      <li>so both Amazon and offer free shipping on their website.</li>
      <li>They are the real thing!!!</li>
      <li>As I got interested in oils, I made a few mistakes in purchasing for the best price rather than from a trusted source.</li>
      <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy is just as good, they have a certified aromatherapist on staff who can answer any questions you have (especially about ingesting, NOOOOO!)</li>
      <li>This Marjoram smells woodsy and sweet, with just a hint of a camphorous smell.</li>
      <li>Good for my inflammation for my back pain.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dappling in essential oils for about a year now, and PT is for sure my favorite.</li>
      <li>I own several other oils from this company and they all smell great.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Plant Therapy products and essential oils, I am just a beginner using essential oils but find their products very good quality</li>
      <li>I love their prices, and will continue to support the brand here and directly through the company.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
      <li>Also, my order arrived in very timely fashion!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how any other company could be any better!</li>
      <li>I look forward to buying more as I add to my essential oils.</li>
      <li>and you just really DO NOT need to spend that kind of money on an oil.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time trying Plant Therapy products and my first time using Marjoram.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that Plant Therapy offers free shipping and doesn&#x27;t hike up their prices like some of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands that do so for their tiered selling.</li>
      <li>I love essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I also like how they have quick reference notes on side of bottle that list common uses in addition to labeling the top of bottle and color coding oils for easy categorization.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
      <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
      <li>Appears to be a high-quality and packaged very well</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you are looking for some Marjoram oil!</li>
      <li>I really like this EO.</li>
      <li>I find the aroma very relaxing.</li>
      <li>The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones.</li>
      <li>Plant Therapy is really my go-to for essential oils though.  </li>
      <li>ad in 2 drops of clove or cinnamon oil to get some warmth as well (think icy hot) add organic almond oil or fractionated coconut oil to fill the rest of bottle.</li>
      <li>If the headache I&#x27;ve got right now doesn&#x27;t go away in the next little bit, I&#x27;ll be giving this a shot to test that out.</li>

    <li> Great service, AMAZING product. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Plant Therapy</li>
    <li> Another winning oil from PlantTherapy.</li>
    <li> Smells great &amp; works for what I need it to! The only weird thing was the label was put on kinda wonky. But that doesn&#x27;t affect the product; just thought the seller might like to check with their labeling source.</li>
    <li> Good for my inflammation for my back pain.</li>
    <li> Love Plant Therapy products!!  They are the real thing!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this EO. Just a day or two after I received it, I had a stress headache. I applied a couple of drops on my temples and the pain started easing. Sure beats taking meds. I have had great results with all my Plant Therapy products. I look forward to buying more as I add to my essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil.  Love plant therapy.</li>
    <li> It was my first time trying Plant Therapy products and my first time using Marjoram. Given the low cost compared to other, well-known companies, I expected a lower quality. I&#x27;ve had fibromyalgia and jumped through hoops of hope for over 5 years playing the looking-for-relief game. I hadn&#x27;t ordered it specifically for it, but after doing more research on Marjoram oil uses, I entertained the thought of applying it to my shoulders for tension and pain. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Before too long my shoulders felt good!  That has never happened, even with pain medication. I don&#x27;t see how any other company could be any better! I ordered the 30 ml today! Love the scent, the quality and the price! The quality, price and delivery of the product impressed me for sure.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy never disappoints!  I bought this oil to add to others to make some blends but also to diffuse.  Great quality oil.  I am proud to support Plant Therapy as they have great oils at great prices.  I highly recommend if you are looking for some Marjoram oil!</li>
    <li> I like Plant Therapy a lot. I love they so both Amazon and offer free shipping on their website. The quality is great. This is a harder to find essential oil (at least an affordable option). I love their prices, and will continue to support the brand here and directly through the company.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, good product</li>
    <li> As expected highqualityand fadt shipment. Liked it</li>
    <li> I would recommend Plant Therapy products and essential oils, I am just a beginner using essential oils but find their products very good quality</li>
    <li> Appears to be a high-quality and packaged very well</li>
    <li> I find the aroma very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Use 3-4 drops on my knee for pain and it seriously helped!</li>
    <li> I purchased Sweet Marjoram to make my own menstrual cramp relief blend (5 drops sweet marjoram, 3 drops ginger, 2 drops Vetiver, 10 ml carrier oil).  This blend worked wonderfully to ease my cramps (they&#x27;re very bad the first two days). :) I believe that Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Happy Happy Happy! Got this to use in a muscle rub. After work, my neck, shoulders arms and hands often ache. I used this in a blend for sore achy muscles and sit works great. I would buy again!.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils. I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know that it&#x27;s 100% pure. I tried five different brands. The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones. The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil, love all of Plant Therapy oils.</li>
    <li> Good aroma. Good quality of oils, as always from Plant Therapy.</li>
    <li> As I got interested in oils, I made a few mistakes in purchasing for the best price rather than from a trusted source. Now that I&#x27;ve purchased several oils from Plant Therapy, I know that if I order one of their oils that&#x27;s it going to be what it&#x27;s advertised as. This Marjoram smells woodsy and sweet, with just a hint of a camphorous smell. I&#x27;ve used it in a sleep blend, but it&#x27;s also good for any boo-boo blends since it supposedly helps with bruising. I&#x27;ve also seen where it can be used in blends to help with migraines. If the headache I&#x27;ve got right now doesn&#x27;t go away in the next little bit, I&#x27;ll be giving this a shot to test that out. I also like the fact that Plant Therapy offers free shipping and doesn&#x27;t hike up their prices like some of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brands that do so for their tiered selling. Great company and great oils at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Clean, strong smelling oil.</li>
    <li> Steaming with this definitely helps take the edge off my wife&#x27;s migraine headaches.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and brand. I own several other oils from this company and they all smell great. I also like how they have quick reference notes on side of bottle that list common uses in addition to labeling the top of bottle and color coding oils for easy categorization.</li>
    <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this order. I love essential oils.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, fresh and pungent, Marjoram EO is quickly absorbed as I massage it in to various sore muscles.</li>
    <li> Plant Therapy Majoram is equally as effective as the doTerra brand for a much more reasonable price!  Also, my order arrived in very timely fashion!  Plant Therapy will definitely be my source for essential oils from now on!</li>
    <li> I will be trying, this today.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a blend I was wanting to make.  Can&#x27;t remember what blend now!  Plant Therapy is really my go-to for essential oils though.  I know there are other companies pushing their (much more expensive) oils down your throat, and you just really DO NOT need to spend that kind of money on an oil.  Plant Therapy is just as good, they have a certified aromatherapist on staff who can answer any questions you have (especially about ingesting, NOOOOO!) and their customer service is top notch.  I&#x27;ve been dappling in essential oils for about a year now, and PT is for sure my favorite.</li>
