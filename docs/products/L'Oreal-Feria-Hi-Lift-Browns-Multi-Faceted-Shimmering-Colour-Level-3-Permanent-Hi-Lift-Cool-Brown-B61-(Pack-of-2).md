### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>This has been the best boxed kit I have used to remove orangey/reddish/bronze tones from my highlighted/bleached hair.</li>
      <li>Worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>if you have any warm tones in your hair, beware!!  </li>
      <li>I bought this product because the color shown is beautiful, and the box advertised &amp;#34;maximum lightening&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this product is great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with color...</li>
      <li>So happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>I had really great results with this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;In summation, great product, but before you buy it, read everything on the box.  </li>
      <li>All hair color is a bit drying, but i really love the Feria and the conditioner smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>i used reviews to make my decision to re dye my hair good luck, when i do my touch up</li>
      <li>Good luck with your hair.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m still very glad I used this kit, and I will continue to use it after highlighting my hair each time, to remove orange.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Have tried many!  </li>
      <li>I usually love Feria stuff, too!</li>
      <li>I was pretty impressed, it wasn&#x27;t brassy at all.</li>
      <li>The color on the box looks amazing</li>
      <li>I do like it, it suits the rest of my hair and skin tone nicely, but when I have work in two days, this is uncool.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for years, and I&#x27;ve never had this happen before.</li>
      <li>At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>is the best alternative I have found so far; I discovered this color like 10 years ago</li>
      <li>Soaks it right up and does great with almost all cheapo home kits.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and with my trim</li>
      <li>And it saved me about 80-100 bucks (or more if I went somewhere nice) that it would have cost for lifting my nautural color then having highlights done on top of it.</li>
      <li>After it sits on the roots you&#x27;re supposed to apply it all over, but I didn&#x27;t because it would have gotten on my new highlights, it still turned out great-- nice and even.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Still, even this was better than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>so I am so glad that I can still get it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly.  </li>
      <li>I normally love L&#x27;Oreal Feria.  </li>
      <li>Now I can match the top of my head to the ends, instead of just the ends to the top.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
      <li>One star is too many.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels more like</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It colored evenly to a nice light brown.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>My highlights are the most silvery looking and</li>
      <li>i think i will leave it in 10 more min</li>
      <li>I love having my hair done in the salon</li>
      <li>While the resulting colour is not awful</li>
      <li>After realizing the devastation of the difference, I read the warnings more closely, and yep, there it is, do not use on dyed hair.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair color.</li>
      <li>I really liked the promised colour shown on the box, Hi-Lift Cool Brown (almost a caramel colour), and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised.  </li>
      <li>Most of my hair turned out fine, the rest...</li>
      <li>This product is the best I have used so far; it did exactly what it said it would.</li>
      <li>Wow, this worked great.</li>
      <li>This product said all the right things and appeared amazing but didn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
      <li>that I had just gotten it really felt nice and healthy, like nothing had been done to it at all.</li>
      <li>The smell was strong.</li>
      <li>exactly what kind of hair it will and won&#x27;t work with...  </li>
      <li>It lightened the top of hair the medium/darkish top, removed the brassiness that my ends go in the sun and left me with a lovely light medium brown with a nice copper tint head of hair.  </li>
      <li>I know it was my own fault, I certainly learned my lesson.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, very straight hair that has been prematurely greying for years.</li>
      <li>Another important thing to note with this product:</li>
      <li>With the choices of non-drip hair color available, there&#x27;s no reason to use one</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go THAT light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would say it is a light to medium ash brown.</li>
      <li>I think if it was on light brown or med brown hair even, it would have took.</li>
      <li>Product lifted my med-dark brown hair to a light &amp;#34;peanut buttery&amp;#34; brown.</li>
      <li>Instead of getting a different Loreal that I always use, I thought this would be a great alternative to bleaching or highlights -</li>
      <li>a light straw/beige color, which is the color I want.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too light despite the color</li>
      <li>I originally bought this hair color to try to cover purple hair dye that I regretted doing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really unique product in the Feria line</li>
      <li>With my fair skin, I generally look for the word \\&quot;ash\\&quot; when deciding on hair color.  </li>
      <li>But, my scalp is more sensitive to this colorant than to most others.  </li>
      <li>My hair does normally pull warm which I try to counter with ash or cool dyes.</li>
      <li>My roots turned a beautiful light brown, yet my dark dyed hair didn&#x27;t budge AT ALL.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair color product!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There was NO RESULT after a full 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>My hair felt basically the same as before I used the product texture wise.</li>
      <li>the people who complained that it didn&#x27;t work on dyed hair (i.e. it won&#x27;t be able to bleach or strip your hair of color) - read the box!!!  </li>
      <li>It says VERY clearly (more so than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought), exactly who the product is meant for and exactly what it should be used to do and</li>
      <li>It lightens my hair to a nice light brown/dark blonde (starts a cool light brown the first 4 weeks then lightens more to a more golden, lighter shade the next four weeks before I color).  </li>
      <li>As I am sure many other routine dye&#x27;ers out there understand, we don&#x27;t always read the fine print on the paper....</li>
      <li>Most of the time I am successful but this time, when trying to also lighten, I dont feel I went cooler, I may have actually ended up with a warmer color overall than the cool medium/dark brown I started with.</li>
      <li>really like this they oughta make a version for great 100 percent grey coverage like excellence products from loreal.</li>
      <li>I went to have dinner with my family, and the first thing my 9-year-old niece said to me was, &amp;#34;Auntie!  </li>
      <li>next day I looked at it more closely and I was blondish!</li>
      <li>I love Feria because it makes my hair feel super soft and conditioned after I use it.</li>
      <li>Definitely NOT the light blonde/ very light brown shown on the box.</li>
      <li>(I wonder how much photoshopping was done for that look) but it is light and my husband actually said he liked it.</li>
      <li>I hoped the pain was worth it.  </li>
      <li>Naturally, my hair is a medium ash brown, and it goes orangy whenever I try to lighten up more than a shade.  </li>
      <li>My natural color is medium-dark brown, more of an ash shade.  </li>
      <li>there is a lot of really nice dimension to the color as well, making it look naturally blonde.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing is that Loreal mailed me a ten dollar coupon which was more</li>
      <li>AND, it really upsets me because a good part of my hair color looks &amp;#34;mousy&amp;#34; and not even in overall color.</li>
      <li>I want to add pictures, but it&#x27;s not letting me right now.  </li>
      <li>I timed it just right, then washed the color out of my hair with luke-warm water.</li>
      <li>I applied the dye to the ends first but decided i would just put it on the roots right after applying the dye to the length...then put a bag on my head and set the timer for 40 min</li>
      <li>I know this is my mistake, but I really feel that they should make this more clear on the box.</li>
      <li>product also gets along very, very well with my hair itself.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t correct the purple so much, but I liked how it colored the hair near the roots that was my natural color.  </li>
      <li>Well, this haircolor did absolutely nothing to my hair!  </li>
      <li>It seems it would work great on natural hair, my naturally dark roots turned the EXACT shade the box showed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awful! The color on the box looks amazing so I wanted to take a chance on it, even after reading the reviews. My hair is medium brown so I thought it would work out. It didn&#x27;t. The roots have weak, light reddish-strawberry blond tones that I wanted to stay AWAY from.  The rest of my hair looks slightly lighter, only vaguely than my natural brown. It is NOT what is on the box at all.  I will now have to spend a lot of time and a lot of money at the hair salon to fix this. I really just hate the reddish tones it said it would NOT do.</li>
    <li> My hair is much lighter than the \\&quot;before\\&quot; dark brown on the box, and after coloring I don&#x27;t even see a difference from what I started with! I even left it in for 5 extra minutes just in case it needed a little more time to work. You&#x27;re better off getting the heavy duty toner and color at a salon store than mess with this. I usually love Feria stuff, too!</li>
    <li> I like the color, but I used this color over dyed dark brown hair, and it didn&#x27;t take. It took on my roots only. I think if it was on light brown or med brown hair even, it would have took.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every brand and shade of hair color in the blonde-brown range.  This is by far my favorite hair color product!  It lightens my hair to a nice light brown/dark blonde (starts a cool light brown the first 4 weeks then lightens more to a more golden, lighter shade the next four weeks before I color).  Naturally, my hair is a medium ash brown, and it goes orangy whenever I try to lighten up more than a shade.  I get lots of compliments when I use Downtown Brown, and people are usually surprised that I only spend $10 every two months on color.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> Turned my dark brown/almost black hair maybe 1.5-2 shades lighter but only starting about 3inches past the roots which turned Brassy ORANGE BLONDE.I hate my root color now.I&#x27;m a little hesitant to buy it again to try and lighten it more...really didn&#x27;t work how I thought</li>
    <li> I have used the Downtown Brown off and on for years.  My natural color is medium-dark brown, more of an ash shade.  Any attempts to achieve a light brown with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; light brown dye always failed.  I was unhappily left with orangey hair and forced to buy dark brown to color over it.  The first time I tried this dye, I was pleasantly surprised.  It colored evenly to a nice light brown.  Just what I had been searching for. Good luck with your hair.</li>
    <li> Wow, this worked great. I&#x27;m a male who was blond when I was a kid, then my hair got progressively darker as I aged until it reached its current color. I would say it is a light to medium ash brown. My hair is probably a half shade lighter than the lightest shade that is recommended on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some pretty bad experiences with \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; dye, so my expectations were pretty low. In high school and college I was always dying my hair with whatever cheap crap was on sale at CVS and in the past when I tried dark hair \\&quot;lift\\&quot; products they turned my hair an ugly orangey color. So for years I&#x27;ve just had my natural hair color with some blond streaks in it. I would never bleach my entire head, and what a salon charges for lifting natural colors and lifting them well is just so much more than I want to pay. But I figured I&#x27;d give this color a shot. I had really great results with this product so I&#x27;m going to be as detailed as possible with how I went about doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how it went down: Didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a day beforehand. I was due for a haircut and I had some blond highlights in my hair, the roots were probably about four inches or so grown out. You&#x27;re not supposed to use this product on highlighted hair (and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it, you&#x27;ll see why later) but I chose to anyway. I followed the instructions exactly. It&#x27;s REALLY important to do your roots last. I can&#x27;t stress that enough, I think that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve had such bad luck in the past. I timed it just right, then washed the color out of my hair with luke-warm water. I squeezed half the conditioner tube in my hair and left it in 10 minutes then hopped in the shower and rinsed ASAP, making sure I didn&#x27;t exceed even a minute of the time. After that I towel dryed my hair a little. Though my hair was wet I could tell it was lighter and I didn&#x27;t catch any orange tones. Then I COATED it in leave in conditioner and let it dry overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I looked at it more closely and I was blondish! The color I had was a very very light brown, I would say a dark ash blond-- very much like the color on the current box. I was pretty impressed, it wasn&#x27;t brassy at all. My hair felt basically the same as before I used the product texture wise. I was due for a cut for a while and I had a lot of split ends and the standard minimal damage you would expect on parts of hair that had bleach based highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spots of my hair that were highlighted looked bad. They were gray, almost blue looking. It wasn&#x27;t HORRIBLE, but let&#x27;s just say it would not look good if my hair was that color all over. Still, even this was better than I thought it would be. I was expecting what was left of my highlights to be green or something. Anyway, I hadn&#x27;t gotten a haircut in about four months and I needed one so I went to the salon that day to get a few inches cut off and decided to get highlights. The hairdresser didn&#x27;t say anything like \\&quot;did you try and color your hair yourself?\\&quot; which seems to be a catch phrase for a lot of stylists. I don&#x27;t think she even knew it was dye. Anyway, I decided to get highlights through a cap, the cheapest ones possible, about 35$. My hair is a bit medium-long for guy standards I guess. Most of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; blue green highlights got cut off. The new ones that went over the old ones made them a bit lighter. Some of the old highlights that didnt get rehighlited or chopped off after were so sparce you couldn&#x27;t even notice them, they just looked like another shade and I think in the next few weeks the \\&quot;gray\\&quot; from the dye shampooed out completely or mellowed to an ashy blond. I have very fine hair and with my trim that I had just gotten it really felt nice and healthy, like nothing had been done to it at all. So I really think this dye does very little damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with this product as a base I had a really great shaggy \\&quot;surfer\\&quot; looking hair cut and color. And it saved me about 80-100 bucks (or more if I went somewhere nice) that it would have cost for lifting my nautural color then having highlights done on top of it. I used it again for root touchup a few months later. After it sits on the roots you&#x27;re supposed to apply it all over, but I didn&#x27;t because it would have gotten on my new highlights, it still turned out great-- nice and even. I&#x27;ll probably use it forever now. I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim as I&#x27;d never seen a drugstore hair dye that promised to turn my naturally medium brown hair lighter.  I have the problem that my ends naturally go a copper red and the top is always darker, it&#x27;s kind of annoying.  I don&#x27;t mind the dark copper or my natural hair color, I just want uniformity, which usually means to get it to look natural, I have to dye it all medium brown and then get copperish highlights. Total pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit I was beyond skeptical about this product.  So much that I bought permanent dye remover just in case.  I didn&#x27;t leave on my hair the recommended time I probably left it in about half as long as was recommended for all over coverage. Every experience I&#x27;ve ever had trying to dye my own hair has always ended with my hair WAY too dark.  I let my hair air dry so I styles as usual and waited to see if I was going to look like a patchy mess...about an hour or so later I was in heaven!  The product had done exactly what I hoped it would do.  It lightened the top of hair the medium/darkish top, removed the brassiness that my ends go in the sun and left me with a lovely light medium brown with a nice copper tint head of hair.  It doesn&#x27;t look dyed either as the differences in timing and underlying color has left me with natural depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people who complained that it didn&#x27;t work on dyed hair (i.e. it won&#x27;t be able to bleach or strip your hair of color) - read the box!!!  It says VERY clearly (more so than any hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought), exactly who the product is meant for and exactly what it should be used to do and exactly what kind of hair it will and won&#x27;t work with...  It clearly says that it&#x27;s primary purpose is to remove brassy reddish tones and cool hair colour, that it won&#x27;t work on anything lighter or darker than medium brown hair and that if you aren&#x27;t trying to get rid of red you should use xyz other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say is that it didn&#x27;t cover the few grey hairs that I have, which kind of sucked (the tweezers came out), but then again, I didn&#x27;t leave it on the full time so YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summation, great product, but before you buy it, read everything on the box.  It&#x27;s a really unique product in the Feria line and I&#x27;d hate for them to discontinue it because people are expecting a hoe dye kit to make them blonde when they have brown hair.  There is a subtle lightening, I&#x27;d say about two shades, but it&#x27;s the cooling without darkening or changing the overall feel of the hair that makes this product awesome.  Now I can match the top of my head to the ends, instead of just the ends to the top. And all for less than the price of lunch. Total win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually just went and bought five boxes just in case it gets discontinued. If you have hair issues like mine you may end up feeling like you just hit the jackpot.  I know I do, over $180 in salon fees saved!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> Have tried many!  I have been using this shade for a year and will not switch ever!  Covers grays(30s) and shines...use that purple shampoo a couple times between  touch - ups which are every 4-5 weeks.  Use 2 bottles for even coverage for thick hair or if length is past shoulders! Naturally dark to light brown hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dye very excited at the thought of creating a naturally lighter shade for my dark DYED hair. No where on the box does it state that it should not be used on previously dyed hair (does state not for highlights). As a hair dye regular, I barely skimmed the warnings inside and began to dye. Following directions, I waited until the last 10 minutes to apply to my roots. My roots turned a beautiful light brown, yet my dark dyed hair didn&#x27;t budge AT ALL. This left me with an amazing line of light roots and dark hair. After realizing the devastation of the difference, I read the warnings more closely, and yep, there it is, do not use on dyed hair. I know this is my mistake, but I really feel that they should make this more clear on the box. As I am sure many other routine dye&#x27;ers out there understand, we don&#x27;t always read the fine print on the paper....we&#x27;ve done this a hundred times! I know it was my own fault, I certainly learned my lesson. So my box dye wound up costing $40 (two original boxes, and then two \\&quot;OMG I have to cover this up\\&quot; boxes for my VERY long hair). My roots are still at least 1-2 shades lighter....whoops, guess I will be reminded of my mistake everyday....  It seems it would work great on natural hair, my naturally dark roots turned the EXACT shade the box showed. Very disappointed it did not budge the old dye!</li>
    <li> For starters, my hair LOOOOOVES color. Soaks it right up and does great with almost all cheapo home kits.  I got to the color on the box from very dark brown in about 3 colorings that were spaced out, hence the 4 stars. I have a lot of red in my hair and it really kept the brassiness to the minimum while I worked on getting to a lighter shade. there is a lot of really nice dimension to the color as well, making it look naturally blonde.  I also ignored the timing instructions. I always apply my color the same way (roots to ends) and leave it on for 45 minutes no matter what. I also cover my hair with a plastic cover to keep heat in and help the color set.  I finally got bored of the upkeep this color required as far as roots go and went back to my natural, but it was a fun (and cheap) way to go medium blonde for a while.</li>
    <li> I color my hair every 4 weeks myself at home (med. brown), I noticed the ends of my hair were getting very dark after several months. I used this product &amp; it really worked. It took the darkness out of the ends. Worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This product said all the right things and appeared amazing but didn&#x27;t work as advertised. I perfectly fit the criteria with natural medium/dark brown hair, followed the directions and ended up with an orangey milk chocolate color, NOT cool dark blonde. It did lighten evenly, I can give it that, but not enough and not in a cool tone. Using the product was easy and simple although, the fumes were intense enough to choke me several times. I pretty much hate the color on my head right now and can&#x27;t wait to have it fixed.</li>
    <li> my hair turned green, especially lower on the strands.  my hair was dyed previously and had gold tones.  if you have any warm tones in your hair, beware!!  the box says it is a cooler color, which means the dye contain blue/violet tones.  i forgot my pre-k lessons that yellow + gold &#x3D; green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my roots however, looked just like the box.</li>
    <li> I followed directions and applied to roots only the last 10 minutes of the 30 total time. The top/root area is the only part of my hair you can really see a color difference which is disappointing. There is a slightly softer brown color on the very top layer which helps blend. I actually applied the color to the under layers an extra 10 minutes before anywhere else since I read others say it didnt lighten their hair as much as expected. These under layers didn&#x27;t change much at all, still dark brown. My hair is very thin and fine. The overall texture is nice now with a fresh color - soft. Its overall more brassy than expected from a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; hair color. My hair does normally pull warm which I try to counter with ash or cool dyes. Most of the time I am successful but this time, when trying to also lighten, I dont feel I went cooler, I may have actually ended up with a warmer color overall than the cool medium/dark brown I started with. No shimmers or hints of highlighting like the picture shows. very flat color. Probably wont buy this color again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Feria haircolor for years and decided to try a lighter color for the summer.  My natural hair is medium brown.  Well, this haircolor did absolutely nothing to my hair!  It is the same color but with some ash tint to it along with more damage.  Now I will have to go get a professional deep conditioning treatment to repair the damage.  This is the first time I have been so disappointed in a Feria product.  I will not recommend this product as it didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
    <li> My hair colour is the same dark brown as shown on the box before colouring.  I really liked the promised colour shown on the box, Hi-Lift Cool Brown (almost a caramel colour), and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised.  The actual results are nothing like the colour on the box.  At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up two boxes, since I have thick hair, and took them to my beautician to ask her opinion on the colour.  After talking with her I decided to let her do the colouring for me since the shade difference was so drastic.  I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly.  After applying as directed, 20 minutes in, my beautician checked my hair and said \\&quot;it&#x27;s not making your hair lighter, if anything it&#x27;s darker, even toned, but darker.\\&quot;  I was quite disappointed as I had flip-flopped back and forth trying to talk myself into this \\&quot;extremely\\&quot; lighter shade for almost a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box promises Extreme Lightening-a promise that didn&#x27;t deliver.  While the resulting colour is not awful (it&#x27;s very similar to the natural colour of my hair in my teens),  I was really wanting the lighter shade shown on the box.</li>
    <li> Product lifted my med-dark brown hair to a light &amp;#34;peanut buttery&amp;#34; brown. Slightly strange color but pretty cute actually. A little warmer than I would like but may try the UL 61 next time. Using &amp;#34;bluing&amp;#34; shampoo helps with timing out brassiness too. I used Aveda &amp;#34;blue malva&amp;#34;. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I like the result, but it is definitely not what is on the box. Most of my hair turned out fine, the rest...streaks of frosted purple. I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for years, and I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. I do like it, it suits the rest of my hair and skin tone nicely, but when I have work in two days, this is uncool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll use this again!  I originally bought this hair color to try to cover purple hair dye that I regretted doing.  It didn&#x27;t correct the purple so much, but I liked how it colored the hair near the roots that was my natural color.  This Downtown Brown looks so natural and very similar the the hair I always had when I was young.  The package states that it doesn&#x27;t cover grays, but it did mine, go figure.  It left my hair healthy looking and shinny. I still hair some purple in my hair, but I think I&#x27;ll just grow it out.</li>
    <li> I saw this color and was apprehensive to try it.  Going to a salon to have highlights or to get it dyed has always been a nightmare.  To have any type of lighter color I had to have it bleached.  Even then the color wasnt true to the chosen shade when I left the salon. My natural hair color is a very dark brown..  Tried this color 8 weeks ago and the results were a lighter natural color not as light as the box color.  A few days ago reapplied d the results are so close to the color shown.  So happy with the results.  I did my roots first and left color throughout my whole head for 25 minutes.  The only wish is that it covered grey as I have some.  Other than that....fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, very straight hair that has been prematurely greying for years. I love having my hair done in the salon but, since my hair grows so fast and money gets tight at times, I have to have a product for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product because of the actual color lift.  My natural hair color is dark brown but my greys have gotten to the point that I just cannot attempt to maintain my natural color (the roots grow in lighter because of the grey).  I have to go lighter so that new growth looks more natural and this product is great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike golden and red tones in my hair because they look harsh and fake on me.  With my fair skin, I generally look for the word \\&quot;ash\\&quot; when deciding on hair color.  This product definitely is for women that prefer/want cooler (ash) tones in their hair.  My hair color and tone actually looks very similar to what is displayed on the product box and it only looks better with successive colors.  It doesn&#x27;t get too light despite the color lifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also gets along very, very well with my hair itself.  I do use the deep conditioner included in the box and split ends are not a problem.  But, my scalp is more sensitive to this colorant than to most others.  I have to wait at least three days from the last hair-washing to avoid discomfort during the color process.  My scalp needs that extra oil for protection.  This product also seems to have a bit more residual odor than other home products but it only lasts for a day and I&#x27;m more than willing to put up with that for the beautifully-colored, super-soft hair that I have for the next 6-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> If you have dyed your hair in the past year i would not recomend this since the only part of your hair that changes is your new hair growth. The rest of your hair that has been dyed previously does not change. So i got stuck with golden roots which were not cool at all luckily i had some left over brown hair dye to cover them. The only good thing is that Loreal mailed me a ten dollar coupon which was more then i spent on purchasing it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this anyway.  I have naturally dark brown hair with quite a bit of gray along the hairline.  I color, a lot.  I usually try to match my natural color as much as possible to color the gray, but wanted to try a bit lighter for summer.  Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This stuff stinks - bad.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The application is not easy.  It&#x27;s difficult to get only the length of your hair and not get any on any of your roots.  I managed to at least keep the roots at my part color free for the first 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It burns while it processes and I worried all my hair was going to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;4.  My roots are noticeably lighter.  The length is no lighter, but shinier.  It doesn&#x27;t look awful or really even bad, just nothing close to what the box promises.  My gray is not purple or blue.  None of my hair is red or brassy.&lt;br /&gt;5.  My hair is not dry or damaged after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;6.  It looks and feels more like I added a brown glaze over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably color my hair again in a couple of weeks and use a different product.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very dark hair so if I go to the hairdresser to do my honey blond color they will charge me a fortune every month.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best alternative I have found so far; I discovered this color like 10 years ago and since then I am addicted.&lt;br /&gt;I have now moved to Europe and for some reason this color is impossible to find here, it remains only available in the states so I have to stack up every time I go there or I have my friends ship them for me, it&#x27;s a pain but totally worth it if I want to maintain my natural honey blond hair color for a fraction of the money it would cost me if I had to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> lightenes my choc brown hair like 4 - 5 shades to a light brown with shimmering golden hi lites doesn&#x27;t look red. I love this stuff. don&#x27;t want blonde but lighter brown as im over 40 and dark hair makes me look older. kinda got the color that Jacqueline Smith has ( ths spokeslady for kmart clothes, former charlies angels# her hair is lighter brown wth blonde hi lites. # not dark like when she was a charlies angell. I love this. ppl complimented on it. its my fav, normal color now. I don&#x27;t go to the salon anymore and ppl think I do.! I have used other hair colors from a box that turned my hair red/ orange or auburn. this feria colors my dark hair to a light brown with hi lites, as I want. some people think I go to a salon and get it professionally done. I have gotten compliment. thanks  this is the only stuff I use now. (PS- I put saran wrap over my head to help with processing my dark brown hair and leave it on for 50 minutes, - about the same if I m doing roots, then do the ends for 5 mintues. then rinse) the saran wrap helps with getting a lighter color...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this they oughta make a version for great 100 percent grey coverage like excellence products from loreal. im 50 but luckily my family greys later in life. mom didn&#x27;t get greys til age 60  .  but gotta switch over to excellence when I start getting greys.</li>
    <li> Oh No!  My hair is close to the color on the box, perhaps a bit lighter.  As the color developed, I began to panic, because it appeared very, very dark, and kind of blueish-green.  I rinsed it out, conditioned it and blew it dry.  Green.  Dark, murky brown with green highlights.  I went to have dinner with my family, and the first thing my 9-year-old niece said to me was, &amp;#34;Auntie!  Why is your hair green?&amp;#34;  Uh......</li>
    <li> I have bought other colors which make my hair either too orange or too ashy, this is just right for my light to medium brown hair.  All hair color is a bit drying, but i really love the Feria and the conditioner smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This has been the best boxed kit I have used to remove orangey/reddish/bronze tones from my highlighted/bleached hair. My hair is naturally very dark. I have used many different bleach kits which have left my hair with ugly orange tones, and using this kit afterward always makes my hair a light straw/beige color, which is the color I want. The color on the box doesn&#x27;t really show what color you are going to end up with, because it varies extremely based on how dark your hair is to begin with and whether you are applying it to bleached hair/highlights/ombre. Heads up-You will go through a variety of shades of hair with this kit. Immediately after using this, getting out of the shower and blow drying/styling my hair, it always has a purplish silver tone. Almost lavender looking all over. My highlights are the most silvery looking and my natural dark hair color is a lightened lavender tinted brown. The first time this happened, I went back in and used a different kit, because I thought my hair was going to stay lavender/silver looking. Wait for the second wash! The next time I used the kit, I knew what to expect and wanted the lavender tint, as a fun alternative to regular highlights. But after the second shampoo, all of the lavender was gone and I was unexpectedly, but happily left with really beautiful salon looking beige highlights. The only reason for four stars is that now, after maybe five washes, as the toner has continually been removed more each wash, my hair is starting to show the orangey tones again. It is nowhere near as bad as when I had first applied highlights with a bleach kit. So I&#x27;m still very glad I used this kit, and I will continue to use it after highlighting my hair each time, to remove orange. I can just tell that I may need purple shampoos and other products as the toner from this kit wears off. Another important thing to note with this product: The hi-lift means that it contains bleach. I&#x27;ve read that the developer is 20 volume and that you can purchase a 10 volume developer to use instead if you want the toning aspects of this kit without bleaching your hair much. The point of this kit really is to lift dark brown hair to a lighter brown, and not allow it to get orange in the process. So, when I use this to improve the color of my highlights, my underlying natural color is slightly lightened as well. As long as you understand what this product does, you can use it to achieve a great beige tone in hair, or lighten your dark hair to a lighter brown. Be patient after the first shampoo, and you&#x27;ll see the lavender tones disappear. I HIGHLY recommend this kit for anyone doing bleaching on dark hair at home. It is a life saver when you end up with a head of orange hair. It&#x27;s cheap enough to keep a box on hand for anyone who regularly plays with hair color at home, just in case of a hair emergency. Clairol Shimmer Lights offers a purple shampoo that would probably complement this kit well when the toner from this box wears off.</li>
    <li> Having very dark brown hair, I learned long ago that I could not try to lighten my hair out of a box. It always turned \\&quot;bad dye job red\\&quot;.  I was very hesitant to try this. I keep peaking as the colour was doing it&#x27;s job and cried when my roots had red hues. I cried in the shower as I was rinsing it. Imagine my surprise after it dried and actually looked good. No reds, just much lighter hair. As other reviewers have stated, it is no where as dramatic as on the box (I wonder how much photoshopping was done for that look) but it is light and my husband actually said he liked it.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have used so far; it did exactly what it said it would. My hair had been previously colored, is medium brown naturally, and I got most of my greys covered, but the rest of my color is phenomenal. I will buy only this product from now on. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This was my first time to use Feria.  I love the way it makes my hair feel and I like the color.  The problem is that my roots are still grey except now they have a bluish tint.  I even bought a second bottle and colored just the roots and it is worse than the first time.  Not good.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few colors that actually lightens my black hair.</li>
    <li> I have colored my hair for 40 years, this color just turned my hair dark charcoal black. My hair was the color on the front of the box. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the color................</li>
    <li> I would recommend this color to everyone and it looks goods with a tan too. L&#x27;Oreal out did them self this time.</li>
    <li> Thus review is for the high lift downtown brown. My hair is dark brown; I followed the directions, and put the dye on everything except the top inch of my roots for the first 20 minutes, then my root for the last 10 minutes.  My hair is about a half shade lighter but, my root are orangey yellow. I want to add pictures, but it&#x27;s not letting me right now.  Very dissappointing.</li>
    <li> It says NOTHING about this on the box, just one sentence inside that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;recommend&amp;#34; use on dyed hair.  Then it GIVES directions for use on previously dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot anyway.  Even left it on the lengths for longer than directed and the correct time on the roots.  It turned my naturally dark brown roots orange.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting any gray coverage, that at least was made clear, and those definitely weren&#x27;t affected.  But on the lengths that haven&#x27;t been dyed in several months?  Nothing.  Not a thing.  You couldn&#x27;t tell at all.  So now I have orange roots and dark brown hair.  One star is too many.</li>
    <li> OK I have dark brown almost black hair....but i dyed my hair with L&#x27;Oreal expertise.. the one with the all over dye, then you put on the highlights, in the french eclair color... it came out a dark reddish brown and the highlights were orange...so i found downtown brown and read every review...fast forward...got the dye used it 14 days after first dye job...oh put a protein treatment on the day before using downtown brown....I&#x27;m happy with color... the orange is now sandy blonde, honey blonde, the reddish brown color is several shades of light to medium light brown....my roots very close to my scalp however appear red but I think it will settle in.. its only been 3 days...I applied the dye to the ends first but decided i would just put it on the roots right after applying the dye to the length...then put a bag on my head and set the timer for 40 min.. I like the color and I&#x27;m surprised it came out because it says wont work on previously dyed hair and not to be used on highlights i hope this is helpful i used reviews to make my decision to re dye my hair good luck, when i do my touch up i think i will leave it in 10 more min let you know</li>
    <li> This product did not do what it promised. I&#x27;ve read every review and some say this particular colour is only for &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair (which is not indicated on or in the box). Others say they&#x27;ve been colouring forever and it worked for them. Well, I&#x27;ve been colouring forever and it did not work for me. I have medium brown hair and after using this product, I am left with slightly lighter brown hair but only where the few greys were.Other than that, no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal and Feria products for over 10 years and have not has one problem ever till today. I will definitely be writing to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have brown hair and are looking to lighten it, L&#x27;Oreal has other formulae that will work, or try another brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this Feria Downtown Brown in hopes to lighten my dark brown hair. I love Feria because it makes my hair feel super soft and conditioned after I use it. I usually like the results of the color. I have to admit the Downtown Brown did NOT lighten my hair at all, It didnt even alter the color in any way. It didnt even cover the few gray strands I have. The smell was strong. If I didnt get left with really soft shiny hair as the end product, I would have been very upset. I guess I will just have to see a salon to lighten my hair.</li>
    <li> HOW IT WORKS ON A HUMAN HAIR WIG review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon, I bought it at Walmart.  I&#x27;m writing this review in case anyone is interested in using this on a wig, to lighten it, as there really isn&#x27;t much info out there on wig lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried on an Estetica remy hair 4/33 (dark brown/auburn mix) wig.  I cut a &amp;#34;sample swatch&amp;#34;, taped the end, and followed the directions to a T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was NO RESULT after a full 30 minutes.  Leaving it on longer is not an option as this product stops working after 30 minutes anyway.  The swatch, when dried, was EXACTLY the same color I had started with.  Texture was coarser, too.  Needless to say, I didn&#x27;t bother trying to lighten the wig afterwards.  So if you are considering this to lighten a human hair be careful and wig use a test swatch first!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair color. The Rite Aid I usually buy it at stopped stocking it for some reason so I am so glad that I can still get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product did not lighten by dyed black hair even a single shade. It does not work on dark dyed hair. They should have put that on the box!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair about 4 months ago a deep shade of brown and unknowing that this stuff wouldnt dye, dyed hair, i gave it a whirl about one hour ago, it dyed about 3 inches of my hair and left the rest DARK BROWN.. VERY VERY VERY unhappy about this and i will be complaining to the company...</li>
    <li> Run don&#x27;t walk from this product.  What a mess.  When I say it separates, I mean that last night it was all over my shower and the surrounding application area.  With the choices of non-drip hair color available, there&#x27;s no reason to use one that drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color results were decent, but my hair is not in the same condition as usual after coloring and conditioning.  I need to use additional product today to tame my flyaway hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product then looked up reviews before using.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  After reading many negative reviews for this product, I carefully opened the box to read the instructions inside for myself.  One of the hair coloring tips is that it is not recommended for use on hair previously dyed to dark brown or black.  That would explain why so many who color their hair regularly were dissatisfied with this product.  I will be returning it.  My one star rating is based on the fact that it should state \\&quot;not for use on previously colored hair\\&quot; right on the box.  That would clear Loreal from being accused of misleading the consumer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so far beyond disappointed.  I bought this product because the color shown is beautiful, and the box advertised &amp;#34;maximum lightening&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It is the most painful hair color I have ever used.  I had to stand outside, while my husband held a hand mirror for me, and I still feel as though I inhaled battery acid.&lt;br /&gt;So....  I hoped the pain was worth it.  But there is absolutely no difference to my dark hair- though it is advertised as especially for dark hair.</li>
    <li> Do NOT like this haircolor at all! I normally go blonde, but a couple of months ago, I went back to being a light brown. The color always fades, so I went slightly darker this last time. Today, I decided I wanted to lighten up a bit and saw this on the shelf. Instead of getting a different Loreal that I always use, I thought this would be a great alternative to bleaching or highlights - I didn&#x27;t want to go THAT light again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as soon as I mixed the products and applied to my hair, the overwhelming smell of chemicals almost knocked me out. I could not keep my eyes open and could hardly breathe! Let&#x27;s just say that I have been using hair colors since I was 16 - I am now 50. Not a beginner at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and after rinsing my hair, I can say it lightened up a very tiny bit. Definitely NOT the light blonde/ very light brown shown on the box. AND, it really upsets me because a good part of my hair color looks &amp;#34;mousy&amp;#34; and not even in overall color. While the hair feels soft, it is NOT all shiny and radiant like the claims on the box state. Not one bit. I would run out and get my regular color, but my head is quite red at the moment from the harsh chemicals. I am not happy with this or the results. Loreal should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color. It is the closest thing to my natural color.</li>
    <li> I normally love L&#x27;Oreal Feria.  I like the color of the hair on the box, but that&#x27;s not what I got.  Actually, my brown hair didn&#x27;t show much of a difference at all.  It says, &amp;#34;Extreme Lightening.  No Brass&amp;#34; on the box.  It didn&#x27;t lighten my hair at all.</li>
