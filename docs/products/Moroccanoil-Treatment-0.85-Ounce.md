<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for fine hair conditions, tames fly-aways and smells lovely.  It is a thick product, and one would think it too heavy for fine hair, but it is not! I am a repeat buyer.  I particularly like the larger size with alternate dispenser.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Brand new in original packaging. Came fast too.</li>
    <li> Been a fan of this oil for a while. This was a decent price but shipping with prime was longer than two days.</li>
    <li> great product.  Worth the price.  Makes my hair soft, shiny, and more healthy looking despite all the blow drying and flat ironing I subject it to.</li>
    <li> I use this in a small amount and rub into wet hair. It really helps your hair get dried much quicker with your blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan Oil products. It really hydrates my hair and makes it exceptionally soft and silky. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice oil, in fact I reordered a larger bottle.  My hair tends toward the dry type and this oil is perfect for shine.</li>
    <li> This bottle was the tiniest bottle ever, but it only takes a small amount to do the job.  So I went to the mall and purchased the jell to go with this product.  Like I said the tiniest bottle ever does not make for a nice Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> I have always used Moroccan Oil, however this is a relatively difficult product to find in an actual store (especially when you live in Oxford, Ohio) so I always buy mine from Amazon. This product came in the two days that the vendor promised it would, and the product itself is amazing. I have natural highlights and a natural shine to my hair, however this oil makes it 5x shinier and healthier looking. I would recommend this product to anyone-no matter their hair type or color-because it keeps it healthy and shiny and is also a good heat protectant. Also, a little goes a long way with this stuff. I have thick hair well below my shoulders and I only use a raisin sized drop of the oil after every time I wash my hair. A 2 oz bottle usually lasts me 4-6 months, and sometimes longer if I am not blow-drying and straightening (in other words damaging my hair all the time. It seems like your spending a lot of money for this tiny bottle of oil but I promise, it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Wonderful treatment, use after hair wash everytime!!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Leaves your hair soft and de-tangled. Moistens your hair without grease.&amp;#34; - my wife</li>
    <li> I do like the way this smells and I do like that it seems to be working, my hair definitely feels less crunchy. I&#x27;d say the biggest drawback to this product is the small bottle it comes in. I wish it had a pump or a spray. When you pour it in your hand you feel like you are getting too much or too little, so you end up wasting because you don&#x27;t want greasy hair and you don&#x27;t want dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Change the packaging please!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It is rich and delicious smelling. I have bought many many imitators to try to save a few dollars but the are heavy, don&#x27;t smell half as good and leave my hair just oily.&lt;br /&gt;I towel dry my long hair well and then put a pearl drop of this oil in the palm of my hand and rub then my hands together. Next I flip my head/hair upside down and apply the product to the middle section of my hair and slide my hands down to he roots (imagine your hands in the praying position...fingertips, fingers and full palm completely pushed against each other).it is almost like I am double ironing motion but with my long hair in between. I repeat another pearl drop, rub hands again and flick my head/hair back so that I am in a normal standing up position and drag my hands through my bangs, roots...like my hand is a wide toothed comb.  I make this motion several times all the way down until I reach the middle section of my long hair.  (My hair goes down about 8 inches from my shoulder blades).&lt;br /&gt;I even put this on my face, it is not heavy at all and I do not break out (note: I have combination skin that tends to be a bit high maintanence lately...I am prone to frequent breakouts!)</li>
    <li> It smells good! My hair feels like silk after applying it. Although the product is tiny, it could be used for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great! Perfect for travel. No leaks :)</li>
    <li> Prefer the &#x27;Light&#x27; version for my hair; however, this weight is perfect for my dry skin.  Get both!</li>
    <li> this is the best stuff I have ever used.  It repairs color damage and helps with frizz and split ends.  Leaves my hair shiny and not weighed down.</li>
    <li> Bought the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula for my mom for Christmas after she complimented me on the health and shine of my hair when I started using the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; formula because I have light strawberry blonde hair. I also use moisture repair shampoo and conditioner - my hair has never looked or felt healthier (since before I started coloring it anyway). I trimmed my hair a few inches because I had ALL split ends right before I started using these products - now I have very minimal split ends and it&#x27;s been months! Very pleased! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is really a little bottle but that&#x27;s .85oz, the price is good and the oil a miracle, if you want a beautiful and shiny hair then that is the way...</li>
    <li> Love it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have really long healthy hair and Moroccanoil is part of my secret. It does not weigh hair down, and it makes a huge difference!</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this stuff sooner, your hair never looks greasy, even if you accidentally slop it on, it will absorb it and shine brighter and brighter, grateful for the drink after a shower and style.</li>
    <li> I really like this. I bought it after watching YouTube. It gives hair a shine &amp; it&#x27;s not weighed down. There is a nice fragrance to it also. 05/01/17- I still love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best ever oil for my hair. Does not leave it heavy or greasy but dimishes frizz and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> This has replaced a whole shelf of products. My hair easily tangles and is dry. Now I just use this after washing my hair and tangles disappear and my  hair is moisturized. It was recommended to me by my stylist and now I use it every time I wash my hair. It&#x27;s worked fabulously for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair shiny and soft. It&#x27;s a little pricey for the amount you get, but worth it.</li>
    <li> leaves hair nice &amp; soft and smells nice too</li>
    <li> Amazing, makes my hair noticeably smoother, softer and shinier and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair platinum blonde from a rich brown and was in need of hydration. Wow, this stuff really works!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it came shipped on time and sealed! Which is more than I can say for some products. It&#x27;s the real McCoy</li>
    <li> amazingly beautiful hair in less than a week. love this oil:-)just a little bit of it works wonders with my hair and my little girls&#x27; hair too...</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair (think mariah carey vision of love). I got the Morrocan Oil moisture shampoo first, and it totally revived my curls, so I thought I would try this too. The first two times I used this oil, my hair was hideously dried out and frizzy. Even my hubby, who knows I&#x27;m sensitive about it, gave me the crooked brow/lip when I asked if it was &amp;#34;that bad.&amp;#34; I think it was because I waited too long to apply and my hair dried a bit. I&#x27;m still not sold on using for my curly hair, but will try to add to soaking wet hair. Meanwhile, it&#x27;s pretty amazing(!!!) on my blow out. Only added to hair below my shoulders; my hair is 22&amp;#34; long.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results -shiny &amp; healthy! It also cut my blow out time almost in half.  If I can get the right process for my curls, it will be a 5star.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but it just pours out and doesn&#x27;t have a drip dispenser. Kinda expensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked so good.</li>
    <li> I like this oil it adds shine and smells nice!</li>
    <li> Does not have the fragrance that it usually has from other purchases from other vendors.</li>
    <li> Good product.but it&#x27;s a little bit expensive</li>
    <li> The best product ever for sun damaged hair!  Makes dry hair shiny and soft in a single application.  A very little goes a long way, use it sparingly.  I have short hair, I use a drop rubbed into the palm of my hand.  I either smooth it over the top or rub it into the roots depending on the look I&#x27;m going for.  Shipping from \\&quot;Makeuptrading\\&quot; was super fast!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Hair-Treatment-85oz/dp/B001RQOSBS/ref&#x3D;sr_1_20?m&#x3D;APOPECP2OXDOB&amp;s&#x3D;merchant-items&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1394630409&amp;sr&#x3D;1-20</li>
    <li> Smells so good and makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I have loved this product from the first time I tried it 4 years ago.  I have tried many other things and other brands, but I always end up coming back to this product.  Although the bottle is small, it lasts me quite a while, and I find it to be worth the price.  There are cheaper brands out there, but I highly recommend MoroccanOil and will be sticking with this brand myself for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and haven&#x27;t once come across anything that works nearly as well. Moroccanoil oil treatment is a GODSEND for my mixed, curly 3c-ish hair. I use just a dab all over my hair after washing and sometimes in-between washes to keep it moisturized and detangled. After having used for years, I took a hiatus to try some other things last year and my hair was never as silky or manageable without this stuff. I usually also use a gel of some sort in addition for curl definition, but this stuff on it&#x27;s own works just fine. One small bottle lasts me at least 6 months. Try it and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Very good product! Good Price! I received on time! Good seller! If you need something for your hair, you can buy it here! I Recommended!</li>
    <li> Nice add on to leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> Love this product! It makes my hair feel great and conditioned without weighing it down. It smells great, too!</li>
    <li> Received promptly and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my split and dry ends</li>
    <li> Love the Moroccanoil!</li>
    <li> Loved this product my hair is amazingly healthy now just after 2 weeks of usage. I don&#x27;t even have to straighten my hair anymore</li>
    <li> I love the way it smell and feel , I just wish it was in a much bigger bottle !</li>
    <li> A little thick  but works great</li>
    <li> Great quality product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is so silky soft. A little goes a long way.I would recommend trying this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. There&#x27;s something better.</li>
    <li> I use this very sparingly after I wash my hair.  While I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  I try to only put it on the ends of my hair and my hair always seems to be oily after a day or two.  I&#x27;m using a minimal amount as well--a drop in my palm that is then rubbed into the other hand and then put on my hair.  I&#x27;m going to continue to work out what is best for me, but I really don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.  If you use and like this, Amazon has the best price.  I just don&#x27;t think its for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Made my coarse hair silky and smooth. It smells wonderful! I used it with the masque which I also love.</li>
    <li> Just received my package today and it is 100% the real deal! At first I was scared to buy it since it has mixed reviews here.. But I&#x27;m so glad it is the original oil! The smell is sooooo good! No more freeze hair! Woo</li>
    <li> Just placed order for Christmas Box collection.  Love Morococan Products for their performance when used on my fine hair.  Lotion not as light on hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so, I knew it would be great</li>
    <li> This hair oil is the BEDT thing out here!  All you need is a little,  and you will see magaic work in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for a long time now. I have tried the cheaper brands from local stores and I am a stickler for paying less for something that is the same thing, but I honestly will pay a little more the real deal. There really is a difference and there is no comparison to how Moroccan Oil makes my hair look and feel. Even my husband has noticed the difference and loves how soft my hair is when using this product.</li>
    <li> Works well with the HERSTYLER Ceramic flat iron.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and great on my hair</li>
    <li> not greasy as long as you don&#x27;t apply to much.  use a drop</li>
    <li> I love this oil. After washing my hair I use just a little bit of it and dry my hair. It makes look and feel shiny and silky</li>
    <li> girlfriend loves it in her hair.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Just a few drops needed to see and feel the effects.</li>
    <li> Great product for your hair!  A small amount applied after shampooing makes hair shine and smell lovely.  Small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about the way my hair products smell, and this one smells wonderful! A little goes a long way.  I mix a drop in with my hair straightening product and also rub a drop between my hands, run my fingers through my hair, then hairspray.</li>
    <li> Moroccanoil products are top of the line. An inexperienced stylist FRIED my fine hair in a perm &amp; the oil treatment has helped preserve my hair!</li>
    <li> It is truly a top of the line product, and does what it claims, but it is pricey so be ready to pay if you need a large bottle.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Makes my hair silky-smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product was excited to find if cheaper on amazon than at the salon.</li>
    <li> I love it,it makes my hair shiny and soft. I recommend it for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t make hair too oily</li>
    <li> Love it, I bought this bottle because it&#x27;s so much more practical when going out of town, instead of taking the large bottle I can just take the small with less worry about it breaking. Love the oil, just a little bit goes a long way and I love how it leaves my hair, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, just strong and healthy! I&#x27;ve gone to using almost only Moroccan Oil for all my hair care needs!</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a facial lotion all summer and haven&#x27;t peeled once, even though I&#x27;ve been on our boat or in the pool every weekend. In the past I used it on my hair occasionally to keep it soft, but I read an article in a woman&#x27;s magazine that tested different products as facial lotion and it scored well. I tried it, and now this is my morning lotion!</li>
    <li> Helps makes hair manageable</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This oil works wonders! I have never been successful at straightening my hair. after applying some of this miracle working potion, my hair straightened completely, wasn&#x27;t at all frizzy, and stayed that way for two days.. I definitely recommend this product! It is a great hair restorative as well!!!</li>
    <li> I was never able to let my hair grow past my neck because it would dry out so bad. Now I&#x27;m able to let it grow and try different hairstyle without worry of drying out my ends. This product is the best argon oil I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used several. This one is very smooth and silky - easy to distribute into hair.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> There just isn&#x27;t anything exceptional about this moroccan oil for the price. I much prefer the $6.00 Organix spray for the same results.</li>
    <li> Great product for my hair!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for me.  Makes my hair shiny and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair and it became dry and brittle.  I went to the doctor and it was determined that I am anemic.  A friend recommended this product to me and my hair is starting to grow back and it is not brittle.  The best thing is that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at one time.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this on my hair all the time and I love this stuff. I had to order a little bottle for myself.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair so healthy. Smells fantastic</li>
    <li> Perfect Product. Great hair treatment, make a world of difference for your hair and scalp. The smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she really likes it. Her hair looks and smells really good since shes started using the oil.</li>
    <li> Moistens and softens the hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Use small amount on damp hair.  It makes my hair so soft, silky and manageable.  Oh, and it is very lightly scented - big plus!</li>
    <li> was kind of small, but i definitely recommend it especially if you put bleach in your hair!!</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite oils ever especially for a prepoo &amp; for a wash n go</li>
    <li> OMG I *LOVE* this stuff!!!  I have long, thick, coarse hair.  I use about three palm-dollops every couple weeks - emulsify by rubbing with both hands, then massage in to my hair from the ends up.  It makes my hair so much healthier - doesn&#x27;t leave anything even remotely like an oily feel, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all - and the fragrance I find heavenly.  A little goes a long way.  I started out with this small size so I could see what it&#x27;s like - I&#x27;ve gotten three uses out of it and the little jar is about half empty.  Next time I&#x27;m going to get the big jar, now that I know how much my hair drinks this right up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan oil for years... Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I purchased a very small bottle of this product from a salon.  I really liked the results.  No frizz and it also protects against heat damage.  It made my hair soft and shiny and smooth.  I use just a few drops on my below shoulder length hair when it&#x27;s damp and before styling products.  I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and I had absolutely no frizz whatsoever, even when it rained!!  I color my hair and also heat style several times a week and this miraculous stuff gave my hair a very healthy look and feel.  I use another good product, Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Primer, that does essentially the same thing, so I don&#x27;t know if I would become a regular Moroccanoil user, but I just had to see what all the hype was about.  It definitely does what it promises, however, I would suggest that those with fine hair use the lighter formula, as this one can be heavy.  The fragrance dissipates quickly but the effects are long lasting.  I would advise against buying this product on Amazon because many reviewers have claimed to have received counterfeit products.  You can visit the Moroccanoil website for salons in your area that carry the full line of MO products.  Paying a bit more will ensure you receive the original formula and you will be able to see for yourself how well it works.  I&#x27;m stashing my tiny MO bottle in my travel case because it&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling and I won&#x27;t have to worry about the TSA confiscating my cosmetic items, lol!  All in all, I&#x27;m glad I finally tried this product.  It works every bit as well as others have reported.  Be sure you buy the real thing because you will be amazed at how healthy and shiny your hair looks.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Man! This stuff is amazing. It smells fantastic and it just really nice. Love it.</li>
    <li> Not only works on hair...is great on my skin!  Had read on Pinterest that it was a good wrinkle preventer.  It works amazingly well for all my skin.  Everywhere from my face to my feet!  Also great on my hair.  Just don&#x27;t use to much on your hair or it will get greasy  only use a tiny bit.  That is all you need.</li>
    <li> A hairdresser friend of mine introduced me to this product through my grandson who had long unruly hair.She had sent some to WI with him and when he went back to Hawaii I kept it for my hair.  I recently ordered more when I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I have long bleached blonde hair and this product helps keep it snarl free with little to no weight and zero greasiness.It leaves a fabulous scent that reminds me of my grandmother and makes my hair shine. I love it and hope to never be without it. A drop in the palm ;then  rub it around on your hands and run your fingers through your hair and brush it.Boom;no snarls. Look great and smell better; IMHO!&lt;br /&gt;Laurie S.</li>
    <li> Great experience from start to finish.</li>
    <li> This truly makes my hair feel silky smooth and there is a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> excellent!!!!!! I recommend people to try it. Works great</li>
    <li> Good for my hair. Good for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Works well but small and expensive. But totally worth it for my hair</li>
    <li> Perfect fro frizzy hair types. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> smells great, I have thin, straight hair and use tiny, tiny amount on my ends during cold months.  I could see this being good for all hair types.  not super oily or heavy</li>
    <li> Great stuff, though I wish it was slightly thicker, and I think it may slowly evaporate from your hair, as it&#x27;s best to apply once a day, regardless if you wash your hair or not.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it!!  Using this product has helped my hair tons.  I put it on before I dry my hair, does not look oily at all.</li>
    <li> The greatest hair oil ever!!!</li>
    <li> so great smells amazing and makes your hair full of nutrients and soft and just how you want it</li>
    <li> Yes, there is Moroccan oil in it (argan), but also has smoothing serum in it.  It seems to be more of a smoothing serum treatment to me.  Therefore, I feel it is a little misleading.</li>
    <li> Very nice makes hair smooth</li>
    <li> The best there is....</li>
    <li> Loving this for my hair lately! Size is travel friendly and perfect for my on the go, constantly flying and traveling life. A little bit goes a really long way.</li>
    <li> I have thick, asian hair and I apply this when my hair is a little damp and use it before and after I blow dry. Keeps my hair from frizzing and adds a really nice shine without weighing my hair down too much. I love the smell of the oil, too.</li>
    <li> This product does make your hair so manageable. It certainly lives up to all the great reviews. So good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I put it on my split ends and it works great.</li>
    <li> SUCH A WONDERFUL SMELL. I JUST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT SO I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR YET. WILL BUY MORE OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Makes me hair feel amazingly soft and smells great! I have oily hair and this is not too heavy like most products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I use this after the shower and before I blow dry.</li>
    <li> Was not impressed by this stuff. I apply it lightly to the ends of my hair but it either makes them too oily or makes my hair feel coarse.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes my hair soft and smells sooooo good. Don&#x27;t use too much and don&#x27;t use near scalp or hair will be oily.</li>
    <li> Love this Moroccan Oil! It really helps my hair a lot. Makes it shiny and after using for a week or so, so much easier to brush. I put a dime size in my hair after showering and just run it through. The little bottle lasts about 4 months :-)</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Not sure I can live without it.</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service!</li>
    <li> Great oil for my Locs and it smells simply fantastic will probably be needing more in the near future thanks</li>
    <li> Good product, came quickly</li>
    <li> Awesome product for damaged hair</li>
    <li> So far I like this stuff. I have only used it for a few weeks so I don&#x27;t know if it works for not. I have 3A curls that are pretty dry lately, so I use this on wet hair before I put on my product. My hair is looking fairly good, but I can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s because of the oil. Regardless, I will buy another bottle and keep at it. It&#x27;s an enjoyable product.</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly.love this product</li>
    <li> i love this stuff so much, and its made my hair so shiny, beautiful, &amp; healthy! i highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works like magic on your hair especially if it&#x27;s dry and brittle.  This product will give your hair a smoother look and shine.  Plus it smells great!  Shipping was right on time.</li>
    <li> The smell alone is enough to hook me!  Works great on my naturally curly hair and also works to help smooth my hair when straightening it.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (also naturally curly with loose ringlets) and it helps smooth her hair without looking crunchy or oily!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like my empty bottle from the salon I was replacing.  Going to buy if from their website, might pay a little more but at least I know it will be the real deal.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so shiny. Smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought the item for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Other than that I don&#x27;t know anything except it&#x27;s the authentic Moroccan Oil sold in salons.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. I have a medical condition that makes use of my hands difficult and I have very thick hair. My cousin recommended this line to me. I LOVE it, you only need a little bit and your hair is basically perfect!!  Give yourself a few minutes for a quick blow-dry and style and your hair stays that way for at least three days! Or let it air dry and still look great!! Exactly what I needed, relief on my hands from trying to style my hair daily, and a look that stays for a few days!!! I HIGHLY recommend this line to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason Argan oil has been used forever: it&#x27;s great for giving you shiny hair, healing split ends, and getting frizz under control. It also bears a significant effect on hair health from the high levels of Oleic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Vitamin E, and numerous other natural antioxidants and fatty acids. My hair gets pretty dry, even when I don&#x27;t chemically treat it, so this comes in quite handy. That said, it doesn&#x27;t exactly make my hair soft or smooth, and if it sits for too long it can get a funky odor. I&#x27;ve used this against  [[ASIN:B00P3D8E84 Cashmere Falls Heavenly Hydration]], which is a Moroccan Argan oil base, but with a few additional ingredients that make my hair incredibly soft and smooth after just one use, plus it has no odor and is surprisingly lightweight. So, this brand is good if raw oil is what you prefer, but the Cashmere Falls brand works better if you want the same shine and long-term hair health, plus the added softness and smoothness that this falls a bit short of.</li>
    <li> I have used different oils and this one doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything different for my hair than the cheaper ones. Not sure what it is supposed to do honestly. When I first put it on my hair looks Shiney and smooth. After about 20 minutes my fly away breakage is back and it lacks the shine. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the fault of the product as I said all other oils I&#x27;ve used have done the same. I&#x27;ll stick with the cheaper solutions. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> Great product. Nice scent. Light weight moisture works real well on my thick, fine hair that was starting to.dry out</li>
    <li> I like this brand the best; does not look like I poured oil on my freshly cleaned hair like some other oils I have tried.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE OIL IS REALLY HELPFUL BUT I HATE THAT IT REALLY DOESNT SMELL THAT GOOD AS I EXPECTED THE OIL TO SMELL</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this on my hair &amp; it is wonderful. Makes hair soft &amp; conditioned without feeling tacky or oily. It diminishes any fly-aways and/or split ends while making hair look healthier &amp; shinier.  The scent is truly divine, too.  It also works on hands, feet &amp; any especially rough areas of your skin.  When using on hair, I apply a very small amount (less than the size of a pea) to wet hair prior to blow drying.  It can be used on dry hair, too, if you don&#x27;t use hair spray.  This is a lovely hair treatment, for even those of us with hair needing a boost of body, texture &amp; overall shine and control.  It would work on all hair types &amp; a little goes a long way. Treat yourself; your hair &amp; skin will love it.  Plus, the scent makes you feel as if you are on vacation which is an added bonus.  Highly recommend this lovely product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My style is suggested that to me and she does my hair. I have long very fine hair, but a lot of it! This little bottle is just enough to last me for about 3 months. I only use a few drops and on the shaft and tips of my hair only! Again this is because I have find here, I imagine if you have thicker hair that you would go through more that&#x27;s then I but regardless of your hair type I would suggest only starting off with a few drops at a time and do not use on your scout! I would really like to give this product 5 stars but in good faith and in knowing that other people are going to see this review, and how I rely on other people&#x27;s reviews I just could not. The reason why I can&#x27;t give this five stars is because it&#x27;s a very ineffective to use. What I mean by this is it&#x27;s hard to use the amount that you want because it&#x27;s just an open mouth on the bottle. My solution is to put it in a bottle that has a dropper which you can buy here on Amazon or clean out one you might have around the house. I really wish that this company would make this bottle size easier to use by adding a small dropper! Also it should be noted that this stuff smells really great and it makes your hair so soft and shiny. In addition the stuff really makes your hair look healthy and vibrant. I would also like to suggest that if you like this product try getting the spray only use a couple of springs to start off way above your head wait 5 minutes and then comb it through. If you comb it through too fast I could make your scalp greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k. It didn&#x27;t perform the miracles raved about on the internet. I think I could hair conditioner might do just as well and cost a whole lot less. But, it might be worth a try to see if it does a better job on your hair.</li>
    <li> Best oil 4 your hair ever this little bottle last me 3 yrs no laying tomyou using it constantly every single day it leaves your hair a healthy shine so soft and the smell is fenomenal i started to use this oil 8yrs ago it was introduce to me by a hindu lady at a beauty place and i fall in love ever since i highly recommend it to you guys you&#x27;ll love it !!! ♡</li>
    <li> I love this product and i am frequent customer it is the best in the market, besides it is oil it is not greasy and keep your hair shiny</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
    <li> thick liquid but absorbs into the hair like lotion to dry skin so i know my hair loves it and light pleasant scent</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever! Makes my hair sleek and shiny without making it oily! I took a star off because its expensive and a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> Is great for my hair and nails!  It was recommended to my by my beautician.  A very good product for me.</li>
    <li> Great product - works</li>
    <li> Some people complain that they don&#x27;t think this is legit Moroccanoil. I have a big bottle from my salon and comparing the 2 I can&#x27;t see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love Moroccanoil - using it regularly definitely keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I haven&#x27;t noticed any split ends since I started using it but that could also be because I get a trim more consistently than I used to. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As nice as it makes my hair feel and the better the hair health, though, I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in it&#x27;s appearance. I have uncontrollable hair and I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that really allows me to wear it down confidently, so I won&#x27;t throw any shade at Moroccanoil. It&#x27;s worth it just simply for your hair&#x27;s health. I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than I thought. Perfect for travel. It smells great, as I was told from someone from Youtube. I hope to order more in the future.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s makes your fingers just glide through your hair. I love the smell and it&#x27;s not super oily.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good but way too small. I paid 15$ for a bottle the size of a tic tac.</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter who likes the product line; she is very pleased with this item  and will use it accordingly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works great to keep the frizz down without weighing my hair down. A little bit really goes a long way. I put it on after my hair is dry.</li>
    <li> A hairdresser got me using this great product.  Only use a very small amount.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bleached hair? Damaged hair? THIS WILL HELP. It&#x27;s like a miracle repair oil. I&#x27;d highly recommend this if your skin or hair needs some attn. Smells  good (strong but good). Use sparingly - a little goes a long way :)</li>
    <li> This is the original of this stuff, and the only thing to be careful of is using TOO MUCH. On very dry hair, a couple of drops, starting at the ends of the hair and working up toward the roots and top of the head, is plenty to provide shine and conditioning.</li>
    <li> It is cheap but I didn&#x27;t expect it would be this small haha</li>
    <li> I am a hair product junky. This is the best for my hair. My hair is long ,thick and coarse.&lt;br /&gt;I always come back to this one. Great smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick but with the right amount of use, it&#x27;ll not make your hair heavy or oily since it penetrates well. I also like it&#x27;s soft and natural aroma.</li>
    <li> Wife is ready to order more. In fact, she already has.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t leave with out it.  Had to go with on our trip. Love this.</li>
    <li> It is excellent. Leaves hair soft, easy to comb, shiny. It was the best purchase I made. All commented that my hair is beautiful, shiny. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair as soft as imaginable! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> weightless, and non-oily.  Wonderful product to nourish the hair.  I use it everyday, and it is non-greasy no matter how much I use.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I ordered a small bottle of this because I wanted to try it first for multiple times before investing in a big bottle. I have sensitive scalp so lot of products don&#x27;t suit me.  What i liked about this product is the smell and silky feel it gives to the hair. Giving 3 starts because after a day the hair looked a bit greasy and it seems my scalp was slightly itchy.  I am going to try their lighter formula which is what I had tried at my cousins and see. Love the sexy smell</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny amount. Keeps hair static and frizz-free. Smells delish too!</li>
