    <li> Works good for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used to carry this product and then changed. I found it on Amazon! The price is higher, but this container holds more of the conditioner. Helps stop breakage and drying of my hair.  Only need to use a little at  a time.</li>
    <li> it made my hair very soft</li>

    <li> Very happy with this product.  It helps to maintain my long hair and keep split ends outta sight! Definitley reccommend it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love  this leave in conditioner. It smells natural as if you just washed your hair and weightless. I have frizzy dry hair and it tames it down very well. When it dries it becomes a  little stiff as if I put gel but then I grab a bunch of hair and squeeze it and it becomes natural... soft and not frizzy. I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>

    <li> delivery was quick and the product was great although it leaves the hair a bit smelly but it works.  I probably will be buying this again with the help of amazon.</li>
    <li> This is another product that I give to my hairdresser to use on my hair but not as leave-in, instead as conditioner to be washed out.  I am hoping for tangle free hair when the comb goes through it.</li>
    <li> i got it for a friend</li>
    <li> This really does nothing for my hair. It&#x27;s like using gel. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Leaves your hair so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Alter ego products are the best hands down. Makes hair shiny, soft and silky while the ingredients are working to maintain the vitamins needed for the hair.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t purchased through here, but bought at my local salon for about $10.  This is hands down, the BEST leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have dry, curly hair and use a small dime or quarter amount on the ends and very frizzy parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This lasted me nearly two years, using it once a week or so. No icky smell, no stickiness, just conditioned hair!</li>
    <li> Love this leave in conditioner , noticed less hair shedding when combing . Leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; bouncy .</li>
