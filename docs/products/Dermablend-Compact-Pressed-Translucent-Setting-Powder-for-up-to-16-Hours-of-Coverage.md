      <li>IVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF DERMABLEND PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT COVERAGE.</li>
      <li>so to hear someone say that to me made me feel really good.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff and</li>
      <li>It is the best setting powder; it makes your complexion and makeup look smooth and shine-free.</li>
      <li>The cool beige finish is better for my skin tone and blends in much better for an even more flawless look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even with the powder &amp;#34;&amp;#34;it comes right off&amp;#34;&amp;#34;!!!</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best powder I have found&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Goes on very smoothly and removes the shine well.</li>
      <li>I recently went out shopping and a women was so impressed with my skin that she said it looked like I didn&#x27;t even have pores.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have had many women switch to it over the years based on my results.</li>
      <li>I have been using Dermablend setting powder for many years.</li>
      <li>Quite satisfied with product and service.</li>
      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>You will be pleased.</li>
      <li>And I use a Dermablend cover cream on top of this setting powder.</li>
      <li>I love the translucent color.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>okay guess I was expecting more when they said 12-16 hours...not true!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and if you want to apply more, you can, but you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>I am darker skin and this works fine.  </li>
      <li>it is fine</li>
      <li>Great powder , no white caste in pictures</li>
      <li>After allowing it to set into the concealer, lightly blend with a brush to sweep away excess powder.</li>
      <li>I am African American and love this shade because it blends in perfectly and give me a matte finish.  </li>
      <li>Finishes your make up in a good way especially when used together with cover cream.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>I have a drawer FULL of concealers, but this one is in my makeup bag.  </li>
      <li>Used with dermablend quick fix &amp; it completes the &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Good texture, not too wet and not too dry, good pigment for coverage and not too light in color.  </li>
      <li>Really sets your foundation when you use it afterwards and also very good for dabbing away those little shiney spots on your face (if you get those I do) during the day or evening.</li>
      <li>After moisturizer and sunscreen, I apply this with a kabuki brush then a apply a bronzer (I use MAC Golden Refine)</li>
      <li>well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are minimal, which is a good thing for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>i am happy with it-It was plainly put and I knew just what I was getting-m zamichow</li>
      <li>SUPER FAST DELIVERY!</li>
      <li>It provides the right amount of invisible set that I need.  </li>
      <li>I like this powder very much.</li>
      <li>next I add  some more bronzer over the concealed areas and as needed over the rest of my face and then finish with this setting powder.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, as a teenager, my skin was quite oily and my pores are large....</li>
      <li>This powder works very well.  </li>
      <li>It really work well for me.</li>
      <li>AND REALLY KEEPS THE FOUNDATION</li>
      <li>This really sets and holds your face together well.</li>
      <li>, I am olive skinned so you can imagine, other than that the product seem to be okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had facial scar revision surgery, so I have to take special care in applying make-up.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This product really finishes off my makeup to a soft silky look.</li>
      <li>have oily, reactive adult skin that is very prone to irritation and breakouts.</li>
      <li>I love it, however since i used it religiously everyday i am already hitting pan.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the reason stated above: Compact powder only comes in white and doesn&#x27;t come in cool beige or warm saffron like the loose setting powder.</li>
      <li>I had high expectations for it because of the price I can say it definitely delivers.</li>
      <li>I will give it a 3 start just because the product states that goes on clear when in reality is that stains white, eventually when your skin adapts disappears</li>
      <li>I only wish this compact came in the cool beige color because this compact powder makes my make-up look a little too pale compared to the loose setting powder in cool beige.</li>

<li> Otherwise, it sets your make-up well for a long time.</li>
<li> I just received it not too long ago.</li>

<li> Works for a few hour,s but</li>
<li> I have experimented with countless powders in all price ranges, and I&#x27;d say this is mediocre.</li>
<li> I was not impressed, I ordered a translucent powder, I got snow white</li>
<li> This Dermablend product is so hard to find anywhere, so I&#x27;m grateful I can order it online.</li>
<li> I have the worst skin ever and without going into detail, I have to use special products to  camouflage alot of flaws.</li>
<li> ITS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE FOR MY BUDGET</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!!</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel clogged or unable to breathe.</li>
<li> To expensive anyway:(</li>
<li> I believe this worsened some existing small pimples and may have clogged pores on my nose and cheeks, but it didn&#x27;t cause a horrible reaction or result in unmanageable acne breakouts as some powders have.</li>
<li> Does not do what it claimed :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought this was a translucent powder; it is not, it made my face white.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed, I ordered a translucent powder, I got snow white, I am olive skinned so you can imagine, other than that the product seem to be okay.</li>
    <li> helps a lot with keeping the make up on</li>
    <li> Great powder , no white caste in pictures</li>
    <li> The only draw back with this is the application, which requires you apply it and let it sit for 2 mins and then, brush off excess.  Otherwise, it sets your make-up well for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this powder after foundation and contouring to set the make up.  Love it.  I get an all day wear.  It provides the right amount of invisible set that I need.  I am darker skin and this works fine.  I use my compact powder thereafter.  I apply with a powder brush as opposed to the applicator enclosed.</li>
    <li> does not cover as promised</li>
    <li> IVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF DERMABLEND PRODUCTS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT COVERAGE. THIS POWDER COMPACT IHAS A LOT OF STAYING POWER, AND REALLY KEEPS THE FOUNDATION ON. ITS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE FOR MY BUDGET AT THIS TIME--SO I WILL PROBABLY BUY CHEAPER PRODUCTS UNTIL I CAN AFFORD IT!</li>
    <li> Used with dermablend quick fix &amp; it completes the &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Silky and mate as expected</li>
    <li> best choice because it can be used by all.  I am African American and love this shade because it blends in perfectly and give me a matte finish.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have had many women switch to it over the years based on my results.</li>
    <li> I love the translucent color. It can be worn with any makeup. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and if you want to apply more, you can, but you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> Works for a few hour,s but not all day like they said! Its okay guess I was expecting more when they said 12-16 hours...not true!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this is by far the best powder I have found&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this powder for years now</li>
    <li> The setting powder held my concealer on all day.  After allowing it to set into the concealer, lightly blend with a brush to sweep away excess powder. On another note, the powder arrived cracked and some of the powder came loose in the compact, but overall it is still useable, so I didn&#x27;t bother returning.</li>
    <li> This Dermablend product is so hard to find anywhere, so I&#x27;m grateful I can order it online. It is the best setting powder; it makes your complexion and makeup look smooth and shine-free. The compact is convenient to carry in your purse or makeup bag.</li>
    <li> This compact setting powder does as the description says: Sets your make-up for long lasting wear.

    <li> I have the worst skin ever and without going into detail, I have to use special products to  camouflage alot of flaws. I recently went out shopping and a women was so impressed with my skin that she said it looked like I didn&#x27;t even have pores. Let me tell you, as a teenager, my skin was quite oily and my pores are large....so to hear someone say that to me made me feel really good.  It sets your make-up and gives you an air brushed look. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I&#x27;ve had facial scar revision surgery, so I have to take special care in applying make-up. Good stuff and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This really sets and holds your face together well. It does everything it is purported to do. You will be pleased. This how I use it. After moisturizer and sunscreen, I apply this with a kabuki brush then a apply a bronzer (I use MAC Golden Refine) then I finger pat concealer where I need it (I use one from Dermablend) next I add  some more bronzer over the concealed areas and as needed over the rest of my face and then finish with this setting powder. It last through my twelve shift at work.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a very long time.  It works really great with Dermablend foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dermablend setting powder for many years. This translucent powder helps to keep make-up intact and prevents it from rubbing off on your clothes (or someone else&#x27;s). I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This powder works very well.  The only issue I have is that the case broke in two pieces at hinge shortly after I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have experimented with countless powders in all price ranges, and I&#x27;d say this is mediocre. About 2 hours after applying, my face is shiny and oily again, whether I use this over moisturizer, sunscreen, concealer, foundation, or any combination thereof. This defeats the purpose of a setting powder for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks white in the compact but is translucent on the skin once blended with a powder brush. The included puff can cause it to clump up on the face, but the brush picks up enough powder to distribute it evenly and blend. It&#x27;s not chalky, and you can pick some up out of the compact just by brushing your finger across the powder, which are two qualities that put this ahead of some setting powders. For the price, though, there are similar options at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, reactive adult skin that is very prone to irritation and breakouts. I believe this worsened some existing small pimples and may have clogged pores on my nose and cheeks, but it didn&#x27;t cause a horrible reaction or result in unmanageable acne breakouts as some powders have. The ingredients are minimal, which is a good thing for acne prone skin. In the end, the fact that did nothing to help combat shine, along with the fact that I believe it may have worsened clogged pores, caused me to return it.</li>
    <li> The perfect powder for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a great fan of all things Dermablend and this product is no exception.  Truly sets makeup for the entire day!</li>
    <li> I love the product It really work well for me.</li>
    <li> I will give it a 3 start just because the product states that goes on clear when in reality is that stains white, eventually when your skin adapts disappears but you have some sort of deposits in your pores, I end up using the blotting papers to remove the excess. Do not use the sponge that comes with since it&#x27;s like cotton and you need to diffuse it properly to avoid the blotchy white spots.</li>
    <li> i am happy with it-It was plainly put and I knew just what I was getting-m zamichow it is fine</li>
    <li> I have unbelievably dark circles under my eyes.  On my upper lids,  I don&#x27;t mind....it saves me from having to use eyeshadow!  Underneath is a different story.  I have a drawer FULL of concealers, but this one is in my makeup bag.  Good texture, not too wet and not too dry, good pigment for coverage and not too light in color.  Very very happy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! SUPER FAST DELIVERY! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!!!! Even with the powder &amp;#34;&amp;#34;it comes right off&amp;#34;&amp;#34;!!! It&#x27;s same as a cover stick.. But, the cover stick I bought at the store worked better!!! Save your money! To expensive anyway:(</li>
    <li> This product really finishes off my makeup to a soft silky look. I have been using it for 25 year!</li>
    <li> Works well to maintain makeup all day.</li>
    <li> I like all Dermablend products but especially the cover cream and powder. I have been using them for years and years.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied with product and service.</li>
    <li> This is a staple for me.  I use it to set my regular makeup (not Dermablend).  And I use a Dermablend cover cream on top of this setting powder.</li>
    <li> This powder is everything! I had high expectations for it because of the price I can say it definitely delivers. It sets my makeup and keeps it from rubbing on my clothes!</li>
    <li> I love it, however since i used it religiously everyday i am already hitting pan. I just received it not too long ago. Other than that I&#x27;ll be repurchasing</li>
    <li> Splendid product. Really sets your foundation when you use it afterwards and also very good for dabbing away those little shiney spots on your face (if you get those I do) during the day or evening.</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claimed :(</li>
    <li> Finishes your make up in a good way especially when used together with cover cream.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to travel with, fits you make up bag well.&lt;br /&gt;I will alway recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Goes on very smoothly and removes the shine well. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel clogged or unable to breathe. I like this powder very much.</li>
