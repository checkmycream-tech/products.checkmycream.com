<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The brand we&#x27;ve usedbfrom day 1</li>
    <li> The product is great and comfortable for the baby to use.</li>
    <li> My baby had baby rash all over his body and it started spreading to his scalp. His pediatrician recommended this and after a couple of baths, his rash began to clear up</li>
    <li> We have been using this body wash on our daughter from day one. This is very gentle on skin and does not irritate skin or eyes at all skin isn&#x27;t dry too</li>
    <li> Great product. Only wash I use on my 2yr old daughter with ezcema since she was a newborn. I think my husband sneaks and uses it on his sensitive skin also :)</li>
    <li> Very soft, no smells: perfect for those who are sensitive to fragrances or hard chemicals in soaps or shampoos!</li>
    <li> We use this every night at bath time for my severe eczema-prone toddler. It&#x27;s pretty gentle, but cleans him up!</li>
    <li> Non-scented, which it&#x27;s great. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my baby&#x27;s skin and scalp like others.</li>
    <li> Great for babies with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor products are great, nice and gentle for the baby.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor products are amazing and do wonders for my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> My son has sensitive skin, to the point that all shampoos that we used up until now (J&amp;J baby wash, J&amp;J naturals, even Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy Moisturizing wash) dried his skin.  This doesn&#x27;t. And, it&#x27;s tear free.  And it doesn&#x27;t dry his hair out. Love it. Now I can&#x27;t wait to try it in my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this for my newborn and my 7 yr olds hair and skin. I was using expensive products on my 7yr olds long, tangled, dry hair. This works WAY better.  I just use some leave in conditioner afterward.  It also has a good rating on the EWG website.</li>
    <li> My newborn had rashes all over his face and body after using this for a while. Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> After using Aveeno baby products for months we tried Aquafor to see if it would be better for our baby&#x27;s skin. But after two uses we switched back. We just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My baby has very sensitive skin and this is the only  wash/shampoo that does not irritate her skin.</li>
    <li> works great for my baby&#x27;s dear skin&lt;br /&gt;Keeps his mild eczema in control in combination with cetaphil cream</li>
    <li> My husband was told to use this by a dermatologist for an allergic reaction he had. It works well for him and the price on Amazon was the best I found.</li>
    <li> I get this for my toddler who is allergic to any Johnson and Johnson product. We have used it for 3 years, and it is the only shampoo I have found that doesn&#x27;t trigger her eczema!</li>
    <li> Nice wash, but it got pretty expensive so we are trying different brands now. Kids stuff prices are pretty much out of hand nowadays.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin babies. Aveeno gave my kiddo a rash, but the Aquaphor works great. I love the pump top and that I can use it for his hair and body.</li>
    <li> the cap breaks often for all i ordered. like the product in small bottle, but not in this large bottle.</li>
    <li> This has a great rating on EWG - chemical free and smells good and lathers well.  After TONS of research, I will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> The best for my baby&#x27;s eczema prone skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have any strong fragrance that hides his natural scent or to irritate his skin.  It really is tearless.</li>
    <li> The only thing I could use on my one month old for his baby acne on his face. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and smells, so I wanted a fragrance free, gentle shampoo and body wash for my newborn. I tried a few different shampoos, but they all had some sort of smell. This is truly is fragrance free and leaves my baby with that wonderful new baby smell - why would anyone want to mask that with a fragrance? :)  This is also really nice for his skin and never irritates him. I love the size of the bottle and the dispenser - very easy to use during bath time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I tried all the usual suspects at target and I swear by this soap.  I do use paul mitchell no more tears for&lt;br /&gt;his shampoo.  As far as soap goes this is so gentle and works so great.</li>
    <li> Great safe shampoo for my toddler. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I made the switch after Johnson and Johnson went to a new formula that is too strong of an odor for my liking.</li>
    <li> Use this regularly for my 5 month old! We love it- makes baby&#x27;s skin smooth and soft without any artificial smell!</li>
    <li> This item is used by my granddaughter for she has eczema and cannot use any soaps that have dyes or harmful chemicals. I too have used this product and I love it. I purchase this monthly for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Great value and really helps keep our sons skin from getting dried out behind his knees and on his ankles.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my babies eczema! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> In the transport of rupture</li>
    <li> Older version and received something that was not ordered.</li>
    <li> My son is using it since birth. He is 3 year old and we still use it on him. Good for dry and sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my 12 year old daughter who suffers from eczema.  She really can&#x27;t use anything with fragrance or harsh chemicals.  Though she detests the smell, I remind her that its the lack of smell that keeps her skin from breaking out.  The pump is a nice feature and it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I use this an my 95 yo Mother who is bedridden and has Alziemers as a Touch Up between baths.</li>
    <li> Aquaphor body wash is perfect for my son. Very gentle on his skin. 100% one of the best products created. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and body wash does not lather and foam like most commercial soaps, but it cleans me and most importantly, does not irritate/dry my skin like all the many other brands that I&#x27;ve tried! I used to have bad dandruff, but after just using this shampoo, my flaking has mostly disappeared, which shows me that my scalp was reacting to all the other shampoos that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy that I found this shampoo and body cleanser because I have very sensitive and dry skin from severe lifelong eczema. This product really is a life-saver!</li>
    <li> Gental wash with no fragnace, this is good product, but my wife didn&#x27;t like so much.</li>
    <li> I am been using this product for my child since he was 6 months old and never had any dissatisfaction with the product.</li>
    <li> I loves everything about it and it didn&#x27;t dry out my daughters skin it was also very good for her hair</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s skin is very sensitive. This is the only soap that I know would not provoke an eczema flare on him.  Love the pump and the large size container (compared to what is available in the store).</li>
    <li> no issues for my my little kiddos... he loves it!</li>
    <li> ...and so far, no issues with using it on our infant. The pump feature is very useful; allows me to get the liquid onto a wash cloth only using one hand.</li>
    <li> This product seems to help our son&#x27;s eczema issue more so than some other products that we have tried.</li>
    <li> This has helped clear up our baby&#x27;s cradle cap when paired with a soft toothbrush. Once shampoo is in, use a toothbrush to loosen and remove cradle cap. I have found that giving him a bath every other day has pretty much eliminated all of his cradle cap!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My son doesn&#x27;t break out at all. No scent whatsoever. My doctor even recommend I put it in my nasal rinse, weird I know, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Love this baby wash! Works for shampoo too. Doesn&#x27;t dry out baby skin so its especially wonderful in the winter months. The pump makes bath time so much easier as you are able to keep one hand on the baby at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous baby shampoos/baby washes and this one is hands down my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have finally found something that doesn&#x27;t destroy my skin. My allergies are severe, and it has been a long road finding the right product. Fragrance free soap free is it. Thank you Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Aquaphor/eucerin products and this baby wash was no exception! It&#x27;s unscented, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out baby&#x27;s skin.  I got it mainly to get rid of cradle cap on baby&#x27;s head but now we use it for his whole body.  I&#x27;ve thrown out or given away all other baby shampoos/bath washes because the baby Aquaphor is so much better.  Our pediatrician highly recommend it too!  Save yourself the money and don&#x27;t bother with the Johnson and Johnson&#x27;s or Aveeno stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this wash for newborns and kids with super sensitive skin. My first child was a redhead with incredibly sensitive skin. This is the only soap we could use that didn&#x27;t cause him to breakout in a rash. We tried Johnsons and Johnsons (worse by far, and sad to hear that they were using formaldehyde in there product at the time), Burt&#x27;s Bees (love but better for toddlers), Dove (suggested by Pediatrician, but still very irritating), and a few others. We tried Aqauphor and decided to stick with it once we realized his skin could tolerate it. We now have two more children, and continue to use it as a wash for all three. We also use Burt&#x27;s Bees and SheaMoisure products from time to time with our older two.</li>
    <li> Great for kiddos with sensitive skin like my son who gets eczema. Its the only cleanser we use.</li>
    <li> Very mild. Works great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My son has severe eczema, and every spring, summer, and fall he is broken out head to toe. This year our doctor recommended using aquaphor bath wash, and lotion. It has been a life saver and has changed our sons skin dramatically. Would not use anything else now.</li>
    <li> extremely pleased with this product. My daughters skin hasn&#x27;t been irritated.</li>
    <li> My son has terrible eczema head to toe and this was what his dermatologist recommended I use as his shampoo. Also these bottle last forever! Love this product! I always used johnsons product since they are for babies and used in hospitals but my sons head always itched and so did his while body. I asked the dermatologist and she said the johnsons products are actually very harsh! Since using this as his shampoo his scalp is no longer super dry and itchy! I wish I would have found thus years ago!</li>
    <li> Aquaphor is the best soap for babies with sensitive skin. There is no other soap on the market today that so effectively cleans my baby with irritating his skin.</li>
    <li> I know this is better for my child&#x27;s skin than other soaps, but it does not have a pleasant fragrance. I do not consider it fragrance free. I will continue to use, but I wish it had a different smell or no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Been using 4 long time...good 4 sensitive skin</li>
    <li> We have tried many skin and hair washes for baby, and this is the only one that has not caused a skin reaction in our child. And it seems to truly be easy on the eyes, too. We buy it in bulk and have a container at every sink and tub/shower. Only thing I&#x27;ll add is you can get even better pricing at a brick/mortar drug chain when they have a sale. Otherwise, we shop Amazon.  UPDATE: We still use this and we still love it. Now and again we try other products but keep coming back to this one.</li>
    <li> Love this soap &amp; all of the Aquaphor products we use!  One of the few that does not make my now one-year-old rashy!</li>
    <li> Best for babies with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema and very sensitive skin. We tried many different brands of &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; baby wash. This baby wash was better than some of the more expensive brands at cleaning without irritating. The two in one (shampoo + body wash) is an added bonus so you can use the same washcloth from head to toe. I also love the pump for ease of use.</li>
    <li> Just excellent, 100% recomended.</li>
    <li> We been using this product for my daughter. Great product, recommend by our pediatrician. She seems to have reactions, rash etc. with other brands, since we start using this product her skin and hair has significant improvements. Will recommend this one any time.</li>
    <li> We buy this for our toddler who has very sensitive skin.  At stores it is pretty pricey, but this larger size with a pump from Amazon lasts us months.  It makes her hair really shines and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like so many other baby shampoos.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My toddler has very dry/sensitive skin, and there is no other body wash that calms her itchiness like this one. Although it says it&#x27;s unscented, I do pick up a slight glycerin-like scent; but it&#x27;s nothing off putting. Also, a little pump on sponge will create a nice lather, or a little pump when you are filling the tub will make a nice bubble bath. Definitely would recommend to any mommy with a kiddo with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great for my kid</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my 8 year old daughter who has issues with eczema. My daughter has been using this for a while now and loves it as an all over body wash. As another dry MN winter was approaching, I decided to give this product a try as a face wash. I have huge problems with face washes burning my skin. I found that this dye and fragrance free baby wash far exceeded my expectations! Hooray - at last I have found a product that works! It has made the perfect face wash for our dry winter months. I will be buying again with the subscribe and save feature!</li>
    <li> Use it every day for my 2 year old, works great gentle no side effects</li>
    <li> I know this is for babies, but it&#x27;s great for my 9 year old.  He suffers from psoriasis, and this is the only kind of soap he can use without aggravating his flare ups.</li>
    <li> Perfect baby wash...also awesome for sensitive adult skin</li>
    <li> I have 4 kids with very sensitive skin.  We only use aquaphor for them now and we&#x27;ve been so pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It&#x27;s amazing!! Keeps my baby&#x27;s hair &amp; skin soft</li>
    <li> I have a 2.5 year old daughter with Eczema. It is so hard to find products I can wash her body or hair with.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy Exederm Baby Wash which works very well. But its hard to find it in the local stores. I went to CVS and I saw this product (Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash) on the shelf. It was $1 cheaper than the Exederm product and the ingredients were very similar so I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Price is a little lower than other products we use. [[ASIN:B00JF3S29Y CeraVe Baby Wash and Shampoo, 8 Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B004DGK3Z4 Exederm Cleansing Baby Bath 8 oz (237 g)]]. At CVS I paid $7.99 for this bottle and Walgreens had it on the shelf for the same price. Sometimes coupons are in the paper for Eucerin products. Sine this is new I expect to see coupons soon.&lt;br /&gt;- We trust the Aquaphor brand in our home because the ointment is is one of the few things that works for our daughter. Its pricey but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;- It makes bubbles. Most of the other products we use don&#x27;t lather well, such as CeraVe, but this does lather.&lt;br /&gt;-  We have been using it for about 5 days each time we bath her. We have not had any issues. Thank Goodness!&lt;br /&gt;- We have not used it on her hair yet. I use Exederm Shampoo on her hair which keeps her from scratching.&lt;br /&gt;- This works well for the 1 year old too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I have none at this time.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff. I have used it on all 3 of my kids, my two youngest have extremely sensitive skin and this stuff works well. I like to purchase it on Amazon with my subscribe and save to get the extra discount!</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema, and this product works well for his sensitive skin. Also, my family doctor recommended baby shampoo to me, and this one works great on me.</li>
    <li> I have two older boys allergic to fragrance, and the store where we have been buying our fragrance-free shampoo stopped carrying it. So, I found this and decided to try it. So far, only one boy has tried it, but he likes it, and he is very picky. He says that his head doesn&#x27;t itch like it did with other shampoos. So, I think we will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> A great basic body wash for baby. One bottle lasted 8 months of nightly baths. Fragrance free, gentle, and well priced. Pump dispenses good amount.</li>
    <li> Use on my 9 month old with excema.  Works well at releaving symptoms and clearing up skin.</li>
    <li> Great new size! This will last forever! The one I had before lasted 10 months. This is a must for my eczema prone baby.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a baby. I purchased this because i had acne issues and it&#x27;s hard to find a decent cleanser that doesn&#x27;t have scent and gentle on skin. I have to say so far, this is the only wash i can use on my face and not break out or have red irritated skin.  Please don&#x27;t change the formula Eucerin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my son&#x27;s scalp!</li>
    <li> I really like the pump type, this is a humongous plus but some smell would be nice, this is way too organic</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to remove the oil from my baby&#x27;s scalp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for bathing my grandson. No irritation.</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin, this shampoo works very good for her!</li>
    <li> the only wash that works for my baby who has very sensitive skin. yes! tried them all! nothing works except this!</li>
    <li> Really cleans hair and makes it soft and easier to comb. My son loves trying to wash his hair and I do no have to worry because it will not irritate his eyes</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema and after trying a lot of different baby washes, this is the ONLY product that was actually gentle on skin and didnt cause any irritations.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for soft and smooth skin. Our pediatrician recommended it, cant be more happier with the purchase. Really Good !!!!</li>
    <li> Love this baby bath product.  Very little is needed to make a nice bubbly bath.  The scent is pleasant and not overdone.  It&#x27;s never made my little one cry if it&#x27;s gotten in his eyes.  I only wish they had it in a very large bottle.</li>
    <li> Great soap. My daughter&#x27;s eczema cleared up after we switched to this from Johnson&#x27;s Natural Head-to-Toe Foaming Baby Wash.</li>
    <li> I like Aquaphor products. They&#x27;re gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> Its great, we love it. Very gentle for the baby&#x27;s skin, and it is &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; for real... While I find most &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; products have a bad smell, I don&#x27;t know why, but this one is not like that. It is truly without a fragrance and is very gentle. I have it on subscribe and save list and would definitely recommend it for your baby.</li>
    <li> As described, its fragrance free and mild. My kid definitely liked it. Will definitely purchase more as my kid started liking it.</li>
    <li> A friend recommend this product to me when my face was breaking out from trying to find a product that worked for my skin. Never in a million years did I think it would work but I just bought my 4th bottle and I do have to say it&#x27;s amazing and for the price; doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> Works great on my baby&#x27;s skin. She is prone to eczema and we were not able to use other soaps that we had used for our first child.  While she still has some eczema patches from time to time, this does not exacerbate it.</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to additives and this works great for me!</li>
    <li> severly sensitive skinned 12 yr old....recommended by allergist and dermatologies...can tell right away when we are out.....really helps</li>
    <li> This is our go to brand for kid soap/shampoo for both baby and 5 year old.  Doesn&#x27;t dry their skin as much as other brands and is usually reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since my daughter introduced it to me since my granddaughter turned 2-weeks old. Wonderful results.</li>
    <li> My daughter was having issues with rashes and after we started to use this shampoo she did not have any more issues.</li>
    <li> Our baby has vey sensitive skin.  She is now 11 months old and this is the only wash that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s the only one we use now.  The bottle with the pump is great for bath time.  Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> My son has extremely sensitive skin and this stuff works so great! His skin is so smooth and soft.This soap really cleans fabulously while still be gentle on skin. It lathers well and rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it when he was only a baby and we still use it now that he is 2.5. This bottle also lasts a very long time, I buy it only once every 4 months or so.  I would recommend this wash for any child, whether they have sensitive skin or not, it just works so well I love it.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;BABY&#x27;&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Eucerin&amp;#34; were not printed on the bottle and it said &amp;#34;Made In Mexico&amp;#34;.  The descriptions says origin is Germany.  That&#x27;s not acceptable and we will be returning ours.</li>
    <li> My little daughter has eczema on her scalp and the oil that the dermo gave her makes her hair really greasy. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the eczema but it has really helped with the itch and scabbing. With the oil and this shampoo, my daughter&#x27;s scalp looks much better.</li>
    <li> Can rest assured products, trusted brand</li>
    <li> We always but aquaphor. Not my kids have sensitive  skin and that&#x27;s the perfect product for them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our niece and her mom finds it totally useful.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my son&#x27;s eyes when it gets in it. Tried another brand but went back to this one because of its mildness.</li>
    <li> Smells great and very moisturizing</li>
    <li> I like this baby wash because it is so gentle, but it is not enough to get the goo out of a toddler&#x27;s hair.  By the end of the day, my little one has smeared yogurt, dirt, paint, and anything else she can get her hands on through her hair.  When used as a shampoo, this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  Her hair, which is long and curly, looks dirty and lifeless.  It&#x27;s a bit of a catch 22 though, because she also has very sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t been able to find a shampoo that is potent enough for active curious kids that doesn&#x27;t cause a skin reaction.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t all that great &amp; smelt a little weird</li>
    <li> Great product,  perfect for my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> nothing special, just produce a lot of bubbles</li>
    <li> This is so gentle, it really helps my son with his eczema.</li>
    <li> Got for my toddler as a way to avoid dry skin that get aggravated by over the counter/regular baby shampoo. Works well</li>
    <li> works really well on my son&#x27;s very sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t cause eczema flare ups.</li>
    <li> I use this gentle wash on my toddler who has eczema, it is mild, has no fragrance and is tear free. I also have sensitive skin and use it as a facial cleanser and I am very satisfied. I have this item on subscribe and save monthly, awesome value I LOVE SAVING MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> For the lack of better alternatives, we use this for after swim rinses. The kid has eczema and regular 3-in-1 soaps (Dial brand?) leave the skin dry and flares up eczema. This soap is gentle and does the job well. Still looking for better options</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitiver skin child. Recommended to me by our dematologist</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my kids pedi and is expensive at drugstores, hard to find sometimes.  This bottle was huge! It&#x27;s lasting forever.  I will buy it again.</li>
