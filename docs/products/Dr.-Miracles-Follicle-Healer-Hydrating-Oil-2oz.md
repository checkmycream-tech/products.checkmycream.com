      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that it would work as the product claims.</li>
      <li>I did my own quick research before even considering buying it</li>

      <li>I like that it comes with a dropper and easy to apply to the hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was thinning at the top of my head and its full now.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I used this a couple of times a week in the itchy spots and the crown area while I had a full head sew in.</li>
      <li>my scalp feels cool  </li>
      <li>I was told by one of the best dermatologists that a large portion of my follicles at the crown were dead and scarred over and would not grow back.&lt;br /&gt;She suggested I buy some Marilyn vitamins and try to thicken up the surrounding hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rating this with 4 stars because although it has not &amp;#34;grown my hair like crazy,&amp;#34; I have noticed a tremendous difference in the texture of my 4C hair.</li>

      <li>It pretty much has all the recommended oils if you Google about hair growth.  </li>
      <li>A bit too heavy, but nice for weekly hot oil treatments</li>
      <li>and my scalp wasn&#x27;t showing as much.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>so I cut my whole hair off.</li>
      <li>but I love how it feels and it arrived much faster than expected.</li>
      <li>I am hoping that with regular use, I can save my edges, so I am willing to deal with the greasiness and smell for the time being just to see if this product is worth it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The right side of my head has always been longer than the left and its gettng even longer!My bang is growing longer, My edges are fuller.</li>
      <li>My hair was a good length and thick, but I was limited to certain styles because of the bald spots at the crown.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I had a mild case of alopecia due to stress,  </li>
      <li>My hair feels amazingly soft.</li>
      <li>my hair feels soft</li>
      <li>is not thinning, but I&#x27;m transitioning from perm to natural &amp; my hair and scalp get super dry, especially after washing, so I bought this due to its dropper in order to apply oil directly to my scalp.</li>
      <li>I braided my hair in two french braids, a style I normally would only wear around the house because of the bald spots, you could barely tell there was ever a bald spot.</li>
      <li>I have used this product daily for the last 3 weeks, and it has turned my once dull, dry hair into shiny and smooth.  </li>

<li> I saw short little hairs in the areas that the doctor said would never grow back.</li>
<li> I am going to check all the other local dollar stores for this....</li>
<li> so I apply it every week 1/2 or every two weeks after I wash my hair, to semi-dry hair before I finish the blow dry process...</li>
<li> I had some health issues which resulted in dry, damaged hair.  </li>
<li> I had alopecia areata a few times and the hair would just never grow back the same.</li>
<li> If I can&#x27;t find it I will still buy it at regular price cause in the past 5 years I was stuck at the same length.</li>
<li> My hair is now past my shoulders, reaching to the middle of my back</li>
<li> You can use product every other day.</li>
<li> I have tried other products for my thinning hair, but none worked like Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Follicle Healer Hydrating Oil.  </li>
<li> I read the other reviews  </li>
<li> My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t put it on your hair any time except before bed because it made my hair greasy.</li>
<li> Knowing the above cons, I have started using the product again as I recently began wearing a weave again and am concerned that my already thin edges may be in trouble.</li>
<li> Even after using hair infinity and transitioning from relaxed to natural, the crown was thin and spacey.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t  way your hair down.</li>
<li> but I am losing LESS amounts of hair when I shampoo and comb out my hair.</li>
<li> Once I washed and blow dried my hair</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
<li> Also I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
<li> behind myears,  my crown, forehead and nails especially my cuticles.</li>
<li> Seriously just used this stuff for the first time tonight and already am obsessed!</li>
<li> i have gotten some dandruff which i am not pleased about.</li>
<li> but I have owned some dr mircales products in the past.</li>
<li> I can not honestly say how it works.  </li>
<li> I did not liked this product at all.</li>
<li> To my surprise when I took my weave out I noticed the hair on my crown wasn&#x27;t as thin</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s only my problem, but my scalp was itching and flaking terribly after using it.</li>
<li> ill just say.</li>
<li> Grew my hair like crazy.</li>
<li> (imagine my surprise while driving one day and realizing I couldn&#x27;t move because my hair was stuck behind me because I was leaning on it!!!).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Seriously just used this stuff for the first time tonight and already am obsessed! I totally see and feel the difference in my dry ends. My hair feels amazingly soft. I bought mine from Walmart for under $4..I did my own quick research before even considering buying it and I am so glad I did. I loved the tingling sensation and the smell grew on me. Overall I will be buying this product from now on!</li>
    <li> This product is great! My hair has grown so much since I first started using it, which was around March! It&#x27;s not too heavy and you don&#x27;t have to use much to hydrate your hair! I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it though.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t put it on your hair any time except before bed because it made my hair greasy. I loved the tingling sensation it gave to my scalp. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do. I love Dr. Miracles products.</li>
    <li> Beyond my expectations! Love it, the cool, mint smells great and cools &amp; soothes my scalp. Buying 2 more!!&lt;br /&gt;My is not thinning, but I&#x27;m transitioning from perm to natural &amp; my hair and scalp get super dry, especially after washing, so I bought this due to its dropper in order to apply oil directly to my scalp. WOW! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product years ago and stopped using it after a couple of weeks as it&#x27;s very greasy even when using just a small amount and the smell is not the best. However, I did enjoy the cooling and tingly feeling when applied to my scalp. Knowing the above cons, I have started using the product again as I recently began wearing a weave again and am concerned that my already thin edges may be in trouble. I am hoping that with regular use, I can save my edges, so I am willing to deal with the greasiness and smell for the time being just to see if this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Dont know if its actually helping my hair grow in length but will continue to use. I only use overnight and then wash my hair bc it makes ir oily and greasy looking also i have gotten some dandruff which i am not pleased about. Makes hair shiny and silky.</li>
    <li> Have not used this product as directed,  so I can not honestly say how it works.  May write a review later</li>
    <li> A beautician recommended when I mentioned to her that my hair was thinning and breaking. It pretty much has all the recommended oils if you Google about hair growth.  I like that it comes with a dropper and easy to apply to the hair.</li>
    <li> I love Dr miracles it made my hair grow and alsoits a good oil and its ddifferent, and thats what i like</li>
    <li> I was told by one of the best dermatologists that a large portion of my follicles at the crown were dead and scarred over and would not grow back.&lt;br /&gt;She suggested I buy some Marilyn vitamins and try to thicken up the surrounding hair. I had alopecia areata a few times and the hair would just never grow back the same. Even after using hair infinity and transitioning from relaxed to natural, the crown was thin and spacey. My hair was a good length and thick, but I was limited to certain styles because of the bald spots at the crown.  . I used this a couple of times a week in the itchy spots and the crown area while I had a full head sew in. To my surprise when I took my weave out I noticed the hair on my crown wasn&#x27;t as thin and my scalp wasn&#x27;t showing as much. I thought this is probably because I have not washed and straightened it. Once I washed and blow dried my hair I could not believe what I saw. I saw short little hairs in the areas that the doctor said would never grow back. I braided my hair in two french braids, a style I normally would only wear around the house because of the bald spots, you could barely tell there was ever a bald spot. My hair was growing in. The smell is like ben gay or something, but I don&#x27;t care. I will be trying more of DR. Miracle&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair that also be used on fingers and toes. I just love it. My advice you should try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this with 4 stars because although it has not &amp;#34;grown my hair like crazy,&amp;#34; I have noticed a tremendous difference in the texture of my 4C hair. It also worked to stop the breakage issue I was having within days. I only use it once acday abd my hair is much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I just stopped using it because of my laziness but this item works. I had a mild case of alopecia due to stress,  so I cut my whole hair off. Then I begin to add follicle healer, my n hair, nails, and face are living and loving. I add some to these places before I go to sleep. .. behind myears,  my crown, forehead and nails especially my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I just started using but I love how it feels and it arrived much faster than expected. I read the other reviews  I bought it and they are totally right I should have ordered the  3 pack! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Leaves scalp greasy. Itch relief only temporary</li>
    <li> OKAY...I bought this stuff from the dollar tree in my area (I cannot find it there anymore) I had never herd of this actual product but I have owned some dr mircales products in the past.I just picked it up because It was a dollar and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.If I had&#x27;ve known what it did I would have cleared the shelf.Let me say This stuff is making my hair GROW! Like, my hair DOES NOT grow lol.. I have tried all types of products even hairfinity and my hair is stuck at the same length but since I have been using this I have not only noticed length but also thickness.I was thinning at the top of my head and its full now.The right side of my head has always been longer than the left and its gettng even longer!My bang is growing longer, My edges are fuller.Idk if the oil has anything to do with stopping hair loss but I am losing LESS amounts of hair when I shampoo and comb out my hair.I am going to check all the other local dollar stores for this....If I can&#x27;t find it I will still buy it at regular price cause in the past 5 years I was stuck at the same length.Also I don&#x27;t use it everyday.I wear weave so I apply it every week 1/2 or every two weeks after I wash my hair, to semi-dry hair before I finish the blow dry process...because my edges are left out of the weave sometimes I apply it to my edges.</li>
    <li> I like the item, keeps my hair hydrated. Easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t  way your hair down. You can use product every other day.</li>
    <li> It really works! I love it! Great price every time I order. It feels good on the scalp after you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> A bit too heavy, but nice for weekly hot oil treatments</li>
    <li> Grew my hair like crazy. I love this stuff and highly recommend it! Makes your scalp feel great too, can&#x27;t wait to get some more!</li>
    <li> I did not liked this product at all. It doesn&#x27;t have any positive effect on the appearance or feeling of my hair. Leaves it very greasy after use and it&#x27;s hard to wash the oil off.</li>
    <li> No lie i grew inches in days i love it and now i keep buying it. It smells good and it feel good on your scalp. Also its only $3.59 or something like that at Walmart under $4 ill just say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that it would work as the product claims. Just a look at the ingredients tells you that the ingredients will nourish your scalp. Because it comes as an ointment dropper and not a container I&#x27;m not used to using it daily. Calling customer service for verification on some ingredients was pleasant and not painful.</li>
    <li> I started using the Follicle Healer Hydrating Oil about 2-3 years ago after reading about it in Essence magazine.  I had some health issues which resulted in dry, damaged hair.  Once my health was back on track and I started using Dr. Miracle&#x27;s, my hair bounced back!!!  My hair is now past my shoulders, reaching to the middle of my back (imagine my surprise while driving one day and realizing I couldn&#x27;t move because my hair was stuck behind me because I was leaning on it!!!).  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works great my scalp feels cool  my hair feels soft</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s only my problem, but my scalp was itching and flaking terribly after using it. I needed to use prescribed shampoo to get rid of dandruff. I&#x27;m not saying it caused the problem, but it worsened it significantly. Maybe it helped with hair growth, but I used different products simultaneously.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for the last 3 weeks, and it has turned my once dull, dry hair into shiny and smooth.  It it is working great so far.</li>
    <li> I love this and it makes my scalp feel refreshed and tingly</li>
    <li> I have tried other products for my thinning hair, but none worked like Dr. Miracle&#x27;s Follicle Healer Hydrating Oil.  I recommend this product for those who where braids and are experiencing thinning edges.</li>
