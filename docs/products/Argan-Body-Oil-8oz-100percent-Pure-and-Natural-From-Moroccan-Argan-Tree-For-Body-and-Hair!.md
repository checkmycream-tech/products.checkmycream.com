    <li> I have coarse, curly hair, but most often straighten it.  Argan Oil helps soften my hair and gives it a shiny look, but when too much is used, my hair appears and feels greasy.  When you push the pump, a large amount comes out, so I often will put half of it on my body and the other in my hair.  It has a nice smell to it.  I recommend this if you want a shiny and smooth look, but be careful during application or your hair will look and feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Working well for my skin and hair!  Good stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a different (and more expensive) brand of Argan oil in the past.  I like the other product, but wanted to see in there was something better available.  I read that Best of Nature was 100% pure argan oil, unlike the more expensive brand, and that it was the argan oil that was the key ingredient.  This product was a bit heavier and I had to get used to the difference in consistency, but I think it is a superior quality.</li>
    <li> Great oil, will buy it again soon</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with the product and I would definitely buy and recommend them. I got my product on the day it said I would get it but I actually received it earlier than the time expected. Thanks I will be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> Love it.Wonderful for hair and skin. Will never be without it. Very good price for such a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here I purchased it and I m super ecstatic...This product is Amazing by far and I plan to purchase it again...My hair feels soft and smooth, frizz free....I just wash and I apply argan oil liberally and that&#x27;s it...just this one easy step..one easy product. I m glad to see that it really is 100% argan oil and I can pronounce the ingredients then it&#x27;s worth it for me....I love it!</li>
    <li> It is hard to tell after three days of usage.  Unlike other hair oils, with this argan oil my hair do remain moisturized at several hours.  I will continue on my hair and start using on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> I put this product everywhere!  So soft and silky!  No smell, so it doesn&#x27;t conflict if I am wearing perfume! Use it on my face and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the feel on my skin</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfectly for hair and especially for face luv it great value!</li>
    <li> I have 3b/3c hair and this has worked wonders for me. I put it on both wet and dry hair. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This is great. You only need a dab.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and on my body.  It is very nourishing and leaves both my hair and skin very soft and perfectly moisturized.  This is well worth the money- a tiny 1oz bottle of &amp;#34;fancy salon name brand&amp;#34; argan oil costs more than this whole thing- and it is the exact same oil!  Will most definitely buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty tip for the ladies:  Once every 2 weeks, I pamper my processed hair by saturating it in this oil, wrapping it and letting it stay on overnight.  When I wash my hair in the morning- despite years of processing, my hair feels like silk and smells like heaven! :)</li>
    <li> I really like this product and Argan Oil overall.  It locks in moisture and provides a barrier to humidity.  I live in the humid south and when I blow dry and flat iron my hair I MUST HAVE my argan oil.</li>
    <li> Great price, great value.  I bought two.  It does not smell as awesome as the other one I was using, but I can&#x27;t touch the price either, so who&#x27;s complaining!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic on the hair, after you wash your hair and towel dry it.  It is also great on your skin and your hands and face.  I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product, it&#x27;s the best thing I have purchased in a long time and I am telling all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> This Oil was a present for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. Says it is an excellent lotion for her skin,&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy,  and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;She is going to order more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried it by adding a little to my shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Works great. Like the feel of my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;James P.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil. I use it on my face and in my hair.</li>
    <li> The product works fairly well, but the pump is honestly terrible. I love the idea and I bought this bottle because of the pump, but it doesn&#x27;t let you pump more than once quickly and it&#x27;s hard to control. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The oil is very smooth and works really well for my wife. I also use it because I shave my head and it really moisturizes my scalp after I have shaved it.</li>
    <li> When I Use this oil on my skin it really feels very Soft. Up-till now I am loving it. Using it on my hair also to see if it changes my texture from rough to smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Great does a good job.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Amazing, pure, moisturizing, and scent free. My hair loves it. I use it on my skin after a shower as well, and it gives a great sheen to my skin without looking or feeling greasy. I will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> I purchased argon oil on QVC  first - and just loved it.  It was good - but pricey.  I turned to AMAZON - as I often do - because I knew I could do better here.  I was right.  This is a very good purchase.  The oil does what it is supposed to do, and it comes in a convenient pump bottle.  I did all the comparisons between many different brands and found this one was the best deal.  I put it on my skin and my hair.  It soaks in and does not get goopy.  I love it around my dry eyes where I often have problems with products I must be allergic to.  My eyes do not get irritated or tear even if I get the oil in my eyes.  You owe it to yourself to try this product.  You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this argan oil for about a week and a half now and I absolutely love it and so doesn&#x27;t my hair! I&#x27;m in the process of growing out some really bad chemical damage and a bad razor cut so I have a lot of frizz and my hair has looked very dull and dry. And since I refuse to put any more chemical treatments in my hair after my past experiences with them I&#x27;ve been left to deal with a lack luster mane. I did a lot of researching different kinds of oils and a lot of places charge ridiculous prices. With this product you receive a substantial amount for a very affordable price. I also received this product shockingly fast! When I first got the oil I made sure I practically saturated my hair with it because it was in serious need of reviving. I massaged it into my scalp and made sure my ends got some tlc too. Having so much of this product in my hair did make it look greasy but the aftermath once I washed it out the next day was incredible and results were almost immediate. I now use half a pump every time I wash my hair and apply while still wet, focusing on my ends and passing the what remains on my hairs over the rest of my hair. Another thing I love about this product is its skin friendly! I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate-severe acne for years now and I tended to break out even more from a lot of products I used. This product actually nourishes my skin! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying directly to skin but I now feel safe with my hair against it. I truly can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff but try it and see the results for yourself! oh and I am by no means sponsored etc by this company. Just a truly happy costumer.</li>
    <li> This product is the same as more expensive argan oils, and the service is great.  When one of the bottles in my shipment leaked it was replaced immediately, no hassle to me whatsoever.  I would not hesitate to order this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> The texture is a little heavier than I am accustomed to and it has no scent.  I thought Argan Oil had a beautiful exotic scent but this has no scent at all. It leaves a oily residue on skin but does disappear after a while. Seems to moisturize hair and skin effectively.</li>
    <li> The oil is excellent for fingernails.  I do not use it on my body because it is a small bottle.  Coconut oil goes farther.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely wonderful for dry hair and skin!  I use it every day and it really makes my skin feel great and my hair shine.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Many people are confused into thinking what they&#x27;re buying in the store is &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; when often it&#x27;s a mixture of a small concentration of argan, but also has alcohol, and other ingredients.  I wanted PURE, and that&#x27;s what I got with Best of Nature.  I highly recommend this product.  I use it on the ends of my hair after I flat iron on the occasions I do.  It does not leave my hair feeling greasy at all.  I also use it as make up remover.</li>
    <li> I am a black male with 360 waves and i cant say enough about this product it keeps my hair healthy and looking Great.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these for family members who wanted to try this for skin and hair. Nice quality and product.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. It is none greasy, no smell, not heavy, very light and saturated.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks better..more refreshed However it tends to create blemishes from time to time on my face..Body skin is soft as silk..Also use it on hair...has helped stop breakage..due to chemo chemicals that have played havock on my hair and skin..</li>
