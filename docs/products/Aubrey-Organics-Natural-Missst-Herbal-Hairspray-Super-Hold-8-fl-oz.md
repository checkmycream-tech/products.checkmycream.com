      <li>search for cruelty free hairspray continues...</li>
      <li>search for cruelty free hairspray continues...</li>
      <li>I was pretty happy with the regular hold of this hairspray but wanted to try the super hold to see if it was better</li>
      <li>I will continue to search for something that provides clean finish and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
      <li>: this is great for the colder months with humidity, but I found out that it does not hold up well in the summer when it starts to get hot outside or just when the humidity goes up.</li>
      <li>It holds as good as a regular hair spray.  </li>
      <li>Also, The hairspray leaves white flakes throughout your hair, which isn&#x27;t a good look.</li>
      <li>gave this to my friend who has super curly hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a medium size and runs out quickly.</li>
      <li>This is the first cruelty free hairspray I have tried.</li>
      <li>ON THE HAIR LONG LANGLASTING GOOD</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>My family and i are going on the more natural route, and  i was looking for more natural hair care products.</li>
      <li>It is a great hold especially for being natural.</li>
      <li>Fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t cause an itchy scalp or sticky feeling.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely sensative, so most people would be OK.  </li>
      <li>Held all right, but produces a ton of dust flakes when I touched my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have always used \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hairspray, and I ordered this Super Hold Aubrey Natural hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i would definitely buy again:)</li>
      <li>It holds pretty well.</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and again!!</li>
      <li>This was my first try to find something</li>
      <li>The first time she used it, she sprayed it on her hair, and she commented that the mist of hairspray that landed on her neck and face felt sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered my old stand-by Eurphora Firm Mist Finishing Spray which works beautifully for me.  </li>
      <li>There are several safe hairsprays on the market</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray - it really will hold my fine, limp hair.  </li>
      <li>It made my eyes itch the whole day when I first tried it.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, after thoroughly brushing my hair through, it left no white stuff on my hair, unlike most hairspray that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she really likes it, has had no troubles with it at all.</li>
      <li>and I find that it really holds the style throughout the day just as well as the synthetic stuff, even through a workout.</li>
      <li>It simply smells like natural ingredients as opposed to the toxic chemicals that many are used to smelling in their products, homes, etc.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product since I&#x27;m moving to more natural personal care items.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves it as much as I do and was really pleased when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less money than the retail store.  </li>
      <li>This is such a great product because it is natural and it really works well with just a small amount of spray needed each time you use it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;2nd time: I sprayed a light mist on my wet hair, thinking that I could use it for styling as I blowdry my hair.</li>
      <li>so mix it 50-50 with the regular hold to achieve just the right about of stickiness.</li>
      <li>The only natural hairspray that really works!!</li>
      <li>and then it dawned on us that we had been using this new hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Not only does this spray hold EVERY BIT as well as normal (toxic) hairsprays, but it also washes out 10 times easier!!</li>
      <li>(Then again, if you&#x27;re washing every day, I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d even be interested in this natural spray; washing itself with such frequency is stripping.)</li>
      <li>but they all made my fine textured, limp hair look greasy and stuck to my head.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t spray evenly and didn&#x27;t hold my short fine hair for more than a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Aubrey and Amazon for giving me back my all day hair do.</li>
      <li>I bought this spray because I am sensitive to chemical, but need spray for dance performance.  </li>
      <li>Just a few light spritzes and it takes care of ALL my fly-away hairs.</li>
      <li>My search for a natural hairspray continues.</li>
      <li>But as someone else stated, it squirts out of the bottle rather than sprays and this results in uneven coverage and having to apply more than probably necessary.</li>
      <li>I intend to use no other hair spray ever again!!</li>
      <li>First, this works great for a firm hold, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>I usually find it a bit too strong</li>
      <li>I only need a small amt of natural cleaner to easily wipe it off the mirror, so</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember what I was using, I think a major name product.</li>
      <li>used it on 3 different day on clean dried hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This also happens when I used the regular hold Aubrey Natural Missst Herbal hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from those minor complaints, I still think this is a legitimate alternative to the average drug store hair spray which is full of toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>It felt very sticky, and weighted my hair down.</li>
      <li>this might not be a good idea, as brushing it out of your hair is next to impossible.</li>
      <li>Too heavy with a surprisingly large amount of alcohol.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> To be fair, I&#x27;m not a hairspray connoisseur, but this stuff works, which is important, and it smells lovely, which is a real bonus.  I bought it to keep my rag curls curly throughout the day, they stayed for two!</li>
    <li> Held all right, but produces a ton of dust flakes when I touched my hair.  I stopped using it, but my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This works great!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It&#x27;s the first hairspray I found that&#x27;s all organic and without questionable ingredients. It holds all day with only a tiny spray so thought the bottle is expensive, it will last quite a while. I disagree with those who said it smells terrible. It simply smells like natural ingredients as opposed to the toxic chemicals that many are used to smelling in their products, homes, etc.</li>
    <li> I love this product and plan to buy it again! Not only does this spray hold EVERY BIT as well as normal (toxic) hairsprays, but it also washes out 10 times easier!! The minute the warm water of your shower hits it, it dissolves. No more scrubbing and scrubbing to get all the gunk of normal sprays out of your hair (of course all of this scrubbing also ruins your hair by totally stripping it!). And its non toxic for the environment! What&#x27;s not to like!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: I do note that if you touch the hair that has been sprayed when it is dry, it can create a white residue.....guess Ive found the downside.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT I USE IT EVERY DAY NICE ON THE HAIR LONG LANGLASTING GOOD ON MY MY HAIR WOULD GET IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> I bought this spray because I am sensitive to chemical, but need spray for dance performance.  First, this works great for a firm hold, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and dries quickly.  I like it for what it does. However, I have used it twice now, and each time I have had a headache the next day. I am extremely sensative, so most people would be OK.  Also, I agree with another commenter that this product takes two days to wash out, and with all the washing my hair feels stripped.  I am looking for another product.</li>
    <li> The only natural hairspray that really works!!</li>
    <li> This hair spray does not spray - it squirts, leaving hair clammy and dry. It may be a natural product but it damages my hair the same way other chemical sprays do. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product my wife and I love this hair spray. We tried others and this bets them all !</li>
    <li> Its organic and that&#x27;s the only best part.  However it doesn&#x27;t spray evenly and clumps (white small patches) worse than other chemical sprays, which shouts out to the world that your hair has been cemented with a spray, which is a deal breaker.  Even if its organic, if the finish is not clean, there&#x27;s no point in using this.  I will continue to search for something that provides clean finish and organic.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Guess my search for a better one is over.  This one is amazing [[ASIN:B0034SYR22 Flex Hold Sculpting Spray with Argan Oil DermOrganic 8 oz Hair Spray For Unisex]]</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray - it really will hold my fine, limp hair.  I usually find it a bit too strong so mix it 50-50 with the regular hold to achieve just the right about of stickiness. It does have a very strong fragrance to it but it doesn&#x27;t last too long (thankfully).</li>
    <li> It holds pretty well. I like that it&#x27;s on the natural/chemical-free side.</li>
    <li> the hold on this hair spray is great.  It holds as good as a regular hair spray.  It flakes a bit and I am not a fan of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those minor complaints, I still think this is a legitimate alternative to the average drug store hair spray which is full of toxic chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the first cruelty free hairspray I have tried. I have always used \\&quot;super hold\\&quot; hairspray, and I ordered this Super Hold Aubrey Natural hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this hairspray smell SOOOO good. I feel like I have just left the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on 3 different day on clean dried hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time, I sprayed a couple of pumps of hairspray onto my cleaned dried hair. It felt very sticky, and weighted my hair down. I tried combing it with my hand, and the hair was stuck together by the hairspray that I wasn&#x27;t able to run my hair through. I brushed my hair, and I could see that my hair was glue together. Fortunately, after thoroughly brushing my hair through, it left no white stuff on my hair, unlike most hairspray that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd time: I sprayed a light mist on my wet hair, thinking that I could use it for styling as I blowdry my hair. Big mistake. it still glued my wet hair together. I had to pull the brush I was using hard to get it through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd time: I thought maybe I needed to shake the bottle well. So, I did. Same result... hair glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my friend who has super curly hair. The first time she used it, she sprayed it on her hair, and she commented that the mist of hairspray that landed on her neck and face felt sticky. Now, she started spraying it on her hand, and then applying on her hair for control. She uses it like hair gel, and it works well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice that when I used this hairspray, throughout the day, the skin where I part my hair would start to itch. I skipped it one day and used another hairspray, and no itching. I tried it again, and it would itch again. It&#x27;s embarrassing when I could be having a conversation with my co-worker, and I would start scratching my head. This also happens when I used the regular hold Aubrey Natural Missst Herbal hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I mentioned this to my co-worker who I gave the bottle of hairspray to, and she commented that she did notice little bums around her hairline, but her skin isn&#x27;t itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for cruelty free hairspray continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend pricing around for a lower price. I got mine at Vitacost, and they have the best prices on many products.of hairspray to, and she commented that she did notice little bums around her hairline, but her skin isn&#x27;t itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for cruelty free hairspray continues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend pricing around for a lower price. I got mine at Vitacost, and they have the best prices on many products.</li>
    <li> My family and i are going on the more natural route, and  i was looking for more natural hair care products. I was nervous about buying it and it not holding good or smelling bad. It is definitely not either of those. It holds great, and smells good too. Glad that i tried the product and i would definitely buy again:)</li>
    <li> Definitely keeps hair in place. If I tousle it, I can just wet it and comb it out and it&#x27;s moldable again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find something that won&#x27;t harm my lungs or fill my body with chemicals and this is it. I was skeptical that it could hold my fine blond hair but it does with only 2-4 spritz and it holds all day. I don&#x27;t gag on the fumes like I did with conventional hair spray. This was my first try to find something and I did. The scent is vague, not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t get everything sticky. The hair spray dries nicely and isn&#x27;t gooey. I plan to keep using this from now on!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this is great for the colder months with humidity, but I found out that it does not hold up well in the summer when it starts to get hot outside or just when the humidity goes up. I&#x27;ll use this in the winter months but I&#x27;ll find something else for the summer.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I bought it hoping to find a hair spray without harmful ingredients. However, when I tried it and brushed it out of my hair at the end of the day, I was greeted with a storm of white flakes. This is a dreadful product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies, and this works for me.  A little goes a long way.  Don&#x27;t care for the odor, but that seems to go away after it dries.  I should say, I put it on wet hair then dry, just for some body.  Don&#x27;t use it in the traditional way</li>
    <li> This is such a great product because it is natural and it really works well with just a small amount of spray needed each time you use it.  It lasts all day!!  I intend to use no other hair spray ever again!!</li>
    <li> This product is stick, sticky, sticky.  Too heavy with a surprisingly large amount of alcohol.  I ended up dumping it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this hair spray! It smells great and works amazing!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t remember what I was using, I think a major name product. Had to use a razor blade to scrape it off the mirror, and started wondering what it was doing to my hair! Found this product and it works just the same as far as holding my thin hair in place. I only need a small amt of natural cleaner to easily wipe it off the mirror, so I know it&#x27;s much better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product and have been using it for 2 years now. It is a great hold especially for being natural. My experience with the seller has been good. The price is okay, I would like it if it was less given it is not as large of a bottle as you would see usually for hair spray. It&#x27;s a medium size and runs out quickly.</li>
    <li> This item was as expected. Works great to hold a style for a day but definitely don&#x27;t apply too much, just a light mist and its good. It does cause build up after a couple days of daily use but since I wash my hair every other day, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. If you are looking for a nice natural hairspray then this is a good choice, it holds the style and you don&#x27;t have to worry about what products you are using on your hair.</li>
    <li> This was a good hairspray but I discovered I was allergic to it.  It made my eyes itch the whole day when I first tried it.  I gave it to a friend and she really likes it, has had no troubles with it at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not as good as the chemical sprays. You can&#x27;t just spray and style as it gets too wet</li>
    <li> I quit using hairspray several years ago because I couldn&#x27;t breathe after spraying my hair.  Given a choice I would rather have out of control hair and healthy lungs as to use the toxic brands.  Then I found this at my fav healthfoold store and tried it.  It&#x27;s great, makes my hair shiny, has great control, brushes out easily and I can still breathe.  There are several safe hairsprays on the market but they all made my fine textured, limp hair look greasy and stuck to my head.  My husband loves it as much as I do and was really pleased when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less money than the retail store.  Thanks Aubrey and Amazon for giving me back my all day hair do.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray..</li>
    <li> Very nice spray and does the job.  Fresh scent and doesn&#x27;t cause an itchy scalp or sticky feeling.  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I was pretty happy with the regular hold of this hairspray but wanted to try the super hold to see if it was better and it is. I have not had the dusty experience others have and I find that it really holds the style throughout the day just as well as the synthetic stuff, even through a workout. I am really happy with it. Go Aubrey!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product since I&#x27;m moving to more natural personal care items.  Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t spray evenly and didn&#x27;t hold my short fine hair for more than a couple of hours.  I&#x27;ve ordered my old stand-by Eurphora Firm Mist Finishing Spray which works beautifully for me.  My search for a natural hairspray continues.</li>
    <li> Works great. A little greasy until your hair adjusts to it.</li>
    <li> Just a few light spritzes and it takes care of ALL my fly-away hairs. Smells great, hold is wonderful, and its healthy for my hair &amp; scalp! What could be better? :) I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and again!!</li>
    <li> This hairspray has a great hold but it is very sticky.  Everything in the bathroom has to be wiped down each time we use it because it is so sticky.  The floors, counters, toilet seat, etc. must be wiped down or else large sticky spots are left.  We couldn&#x27;t figure out why our socks were sticking to the tile in our bathroom and then it dawned on us that we had been using this new hairspray.  If it wasn&#x27;t so extremely sticky on everything but our hair I would have given it a much better score.</li>
    <li> it will leave white stuff on your hair. do not buy it</li>
    <li> This spray holds my hair well.</li>
    <li> This hairspray definitely does the job by holding your hair in place. But as someone else stated, it squirts out of the bottle rather than sprays and this results in uneven coverage and having to apply more than probably necessary. If you are someone who washes their hair daily, this hairspray might be for you. (Then again, if you&#x27;re washing every day, I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d even be interested in this natural spray; washing itself with such frequency is stripping.) However, if you are someone (like me) who is on a no-poo regimen (I wash with rye flour and condition with vinegar every 5 days) this might not be a good idea, as brushing it out of your hair is next to impossible. Last night, after wearing my hair in a teased-out bun, I had to actually do a water rinse because it felt so bad. Also, The hairspray leaves white flakes throughout your hair, which isn&#x27;t a good look. I even tried cutting this spray with water to weaken it  a bit but that did very little.</li>
    <li> Truly a very strong hold!</li>
