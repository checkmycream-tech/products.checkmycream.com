      <li>So, now I am researching the smelly Splash product on line and see that more ladies think also like me</li>

      <li>I enjoy the scent.  </li>
      <li>It was a light fragrance that I would splash on after a shower.</li>
      <li>In fact, I loved it so much that I purchased over 15 years worth and just ran out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Jean Nate I now use is NOT the same as the Jean  I grew up with.Mary Pistolesi</li>
    <li> I have used the Jean Nate After Bath Spray for years and have always loved it but the formula has changed! I used to love the fragrance a couple of hours after application . . it was wonderful . . not any more. When I spray it has a chemical odor, just not the same.  Please bring the old formula back!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for decades. Then one day, the flagrance lost its lightness,  becoming a tad muskier as one reviewer puts it... I use it now very sparingly, but mostly on guests&#x27;finger towels when I serve a dish requiring their use use. Disappointing, yes... however for first-time users, if they like the flagrance, they would not know the difference. Why can Revlon leave something good ALONE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jean Nate After Bath Splash my entire life, and have loved it and introduced it to friends and family, but my recent purchase smelled completely different. REVLON, DON&#x27;T MESS WITH A CLASSIC!!! I will never buy this product again unless they change the formula back to the original. What would possess them to make this change? Either create a new product with a new name, or leave the original as is. Did you think we wouldn&#x27;t NOTICE???</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, came fast and was well packed.  Good value.  will re-order.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since high school and that was many years ago</li>
    <li> like a previous poster said, they have destroyed the original  scent of jean nate. I&#x27;m using it to clean up where my pup messes, SHAME ON YOU. the original was the best. There&#x27;s almost a pepperey after fragrance, yikes!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Jean Nate after bath splash.  It&#x27;s so refreshing particularly in the summertime.  I had read some of the reviews saying the formula had changed, but couldn&#x27;t think of a good alternative so I went ahead and ordered some.  The other reviewers are absolutely right - the formula has changed!  I still had a little bit of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Jean Nate in a travel bottle and compared.  The new stuff doesn&#x27;t even smell remotely like the true original Jean Nate. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because there is one good quality that remains - when you splash it on it does feel cool (although I imagine rubbing alcohol, which smells as good as this stuff, would work as well and cost a lot less). I just can&#x27;t understand why Revlon would change what was once a fantastic product, but I do know I&#x27;m now on the hunt for an alternative that smells decent.</li>
    <li> I thought I was the only one out there who noticed the difference in the Jean Nate&#x27; until I started reading the other comments. I&#x27;m not alone! The new stuff is terrible compared to the old.  Plastic, it smells like plastic. I was told for years how nice I smelled. Not anymore. So I switched to Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace. The firming body lotion is wonderful. Clean and refreshing the way Jean Nate&#x27; use to be. I have written Revlon several times and they said they changed the formula 2 or 3 years ago with no explanation as to why. In the mean time I bought at least 3 large bottles of the after bath splash and pretty much had to waste them. Don\\&quot;t buy the new stuff. It&#x27;s not the same.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using jean nate after bath splash since i was about 10 years old.   i&#x27;m 59 yrs old now it&#x27;s refeshing after a bath or shower.  i love it.</li>
    <li> My mom used Jean Nate, I used Jean Nate. Every time I used it I felt my mom with me, she&#x27;s been gone since I was 21, I&#x27;m 55 now the last few years have been such a disappointment. Everything I&#x27;ve enjoyed about the lightness and freshness of the product is gone and the one thing that kept my mom near is now gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product got as a gift to my mom who is using it since 1970s. She has always asked all of us to look for it and finally found it here.Unfortunatelly is not available in the great country of Canada but SHe has enjoyed it so much now from Amazon. I can not believe how negative are some people&#x27;s comments!</li>
    <li> I concur with the comments of some of the other Jean Nate Splash customers who, like me, have detected a noticeable change in their experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used JEAN NATE splash for 25+ years and have always enjoyed the natural, light, fresh, long lasting scent.  Over the years, many coworkers have inquired as to what type of fragrance I was wearing... even several hours into an eight hour workday.  They described the scent as \\&quot;subtle and refreshing\\&quot;; not too overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I thought I detected a \\&quot;change\\&quot; in this product about 3 years ago.  The scent did not appear to be the original light, \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scent.  Additionally, I thought the aroma had become very short lived; wearing off rather quickly... which may have been to my advantage as over the course of the day it appeared to develop an \\&quot;off\\&quot; scent, something akin to \\&quot;vinegar\\&quot;.  (On one occasion while waiting in line at the bank, a lady standing behind me had to step aside as she was offended by the scent.)  Initially, I thought that perhaps my body chemistry had changed, making this product&#x27;s scent interact inappropriately, however after reading other user&#x27;s experiences, perhaps the problem lies with the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess my long love affair with Jean Nate Splash has come to an end.  Others may try and appreciate this product, however I will not invest any more money in something that I feel has become inferior in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did so enjoy another of Revlon&#x27;s offerings marketed several years ago... the Jean Nate (Blue) SEASCAPE scent.  Perhaps Revlon might consider re-introducing this scent... if they haven&#x27;t \\&quot;toyed with\\&quot; the ingredients of this product as well.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers I bought several bottles over time thinking that maybe I had purchased a bad batch of Jean Nate although in the 40 yrs I have used it it had never happened before.  No, Revlon had to go and add \\&quot;Moisture Replenishing Complex of Vitamins E, A and ALOE VERA\\&quot; (&amp; who knows what else?) and that killed the fragrance.  I wonder if anyone at Revlon reads these comments -- I hope somebody does and shows it to their president to change it back to the ORIGINAL ORIGINAL. It just dawned on me to check the AMAZON comments (thank you, Amazon) and I am so glad I&#x27;m not alone but there&#x27;s not a lot of consolation in being right about this -- how are we going to fix something that was not broken?  Or will Revlon just kill it.</li>
    <li> Item has very nice fragrance and is my favorite.</li>
    <li> As the others, I&#x27;ve used this daily since the early &#x27;70&#x27;s.  I love the scent, especially since you can smell it on your skin hours, I mean 8-10 hours later.  Wish other products would do the same.  When I get too warm, it releases the scent again and it&#x27;s something I really enjoy!  I only wish Revlon would step up it&#x27;s game with this product and add some other things to the line - scented candles, oils, etc.  The one thing I hate is the smell of the lotion, it really needs to be worked on.     As for the person who gave it a one star - come on, really?  Keeping cats off furniture?  What-ever.</li>
    <li> Good price and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> Revlon changed this classic, timeless scent (NOT \\&quot;ORIGINAL\\&quot; as bottle says), and it didn&#x27;t work!!  I had seen the many comments on this and other sites, and decided to test it out for myself.  I bought a new bottle, and splashed a handful of it on one arm, then splashed a handful from my old bottle on the other arm.  I was amazed to find such a change - the new formula is awful!  The fresh, spicy scent with the almost musky accent is completely gone.  I could blend rancid lemon juice and some 50-year-old old talcum powder and produce something similar to this new scent.  YUCK!!  BAD JOB, REVLON!  Maybe I&#x27;ll come back to try it again in a year or so, though I doubt they&#x27;ll listen to us and go back to the REAL ORIGINAL.  I&#x27;m really going to miss my old Jean Nate!</li>
    <li> REVLON what have you done??????????? to the Jean Nate Body Splash.  This Jean Nate splash is nothing, I repeat nothing like the Product I have used since the 60&#x27;s. It smells like bug spray now.  I use to get compliments from complete strangers asking what I was wearing every single time I wore it.  I was asked what perfume did I wear? The Old Jean nate Splash that I used lasted all day and into the AM I could still smell traces of it on my wrists.&lt;br /&gt;The new Splash is offensive, it acutally made my stomach turn after I had it on awhile. Please, please, please bring back the old frangrance.  I will buy several. I bought 3 bottles on sale and will be returning the two bottle I didnt open to Walgreens... because of the way it smells now ughhhhhhh.... Why did you try to fix something that wasnt broken. :(</li>
    <li> I love Jean Nate but this came unsealed and not filled to the top.  Seems like it was used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jean Nate After Bath Splash for years now but was unable to find it in my home town so looked on amazon.com and, of course, there it was and for a good price! Thanks amazon! Jean Nate smells good and feels wonderful splashed on - it also has aloe in it so it is kind to my skin. On a hot day, I like the way it emanates from me. It is not overpowering.[[ASIN:B000W0VITK JEAN NATE AFTER BATH SPLASH 30 OZ for Women by Revlon]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over our local stores for this old-time favorite and finally found it! Shipping was quick...will definitely use site again! C</li>
    <li> used product for many years. it hasn&#x27;t changed and its great</li>
    <li> If my wife could..... she&#x27;d take a bath in it.  She&#x27;s happy and that means I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Jean Nate years ago.  Loved, loved it.  It was a light fragrance that I would splash on after a shower. I consider myself a Jean Nate expert.&lt;br /&gt;  I was so happy to see it being sold again and ordered it.  Oh my, big mistake.  The scent is much harsher, and my eyes burned all day from the smell.  I am very disappointed that Revlon has changed my old friend. I now am stuck with a 30-ounce bottle of this stinky stuff.  Please, please bring back the original scent.</li>
    <li> Just like the original.  Fantastic as usual.</li>
    <li> I have used this subtle fragrance daily since I was about 15 years old.  Over the years I have sometimes added another perfume in spare amounts but now use only Jean Nate.  It is fresh and lite.</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate for over 30 years. My grandmother and mother both used it. None of us has ever cared for any cologne or perfume. This is all we use (along with deoderant - ha!).  I have received more complimentary remarks over the years than I can count. It is a somewhat musky, citrus scent. Very pleasing and fresh. No over powering obnoxious scents to bowl people over as you walk by. I loathe most perfumes and colognes for this reason. Most give me raging headaches. This is absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it just seems to be rather strong for a body splash. It is strong like perfume. I was hoping to use it to really splash on me but now I have to limit it to just a dap. I am getting older and my skin is so dry so I wanted something I could splash on me after the shower for moisture. Got to find something else.</li>
    <li> What a waste of my money! I&#x27;ve been using Jean Nate for many, many years that I care to count and it has been the only perfume/fragrance I use.  I could not find it in the stores and I was happy when I saw it online and ordered.  I was disappointing when I opened the bottle; the smell is horrible.  I remember when it sprayed on body or clothes, it used to last all day, even when the clothes were put in the hamper. Now, it is nothing but alcohol and it evaporates quickly.  I sure miss my old good Jean Nate!</li>
    <li> Love the clean scent. Can wear anywhere and won&#x27;t affect those allergic or sensitive to scents. Makes the shower smell so good the next morning. Use this as the filler for the mist sprayer.</li>
    <li> An old favorite and just as wonderful as ever.  Great summer refresher.</li>
    <li> Tip.  Use it as the foundation of your perfumes.  It works as a booster for those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with the splash, lotion then powder.  After 5 minutes; apply the perfume of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get nothing but compliments particular when I use COCO chanel as my perfume of choice.</li>
    <li> This is a staple for me, especially in warmer weather.  I love to splash it on right out of the shower, then rub in some Neutrogena body oil that seals in both moisture and scent - and the combination of scents is fresh and light and, I&#x27;m told, intoxicating (!)</li>
    <li> Have &amp;#34;Slashed &amp;#34; for many years! Very refreshing after being outside in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Then a shower or bath! After toweling &amp;#34;Splash&amp;#34;! You will feel totally refreshed!</li>
    <li> Works great has a really nice smell to it. And its really big. Has a nice weight to it too!</li>
    <li> Does not have a srong scent nor last long.&lt;br /&gt;DanI don&#x27;t know what mote I should say.&lt;br /&gt;okay what hurts</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Jean Nate for something like 45 years or so (I know its been a long time) Then I ran into it at Walgreens and bought a bottle of the Splash. I tried it and it STUNK! What happened???? I tried it again, same stink as before. Then tried it on my daughter and mom to see if perhaps my body chemistry changed and made it smell bad on me. But it stunk on my mom and daoughter too! So, now I am researching the smelly Splash product on line and see that more ladies think also like me: the new Jean Nate Splash STINKS. I have used it 2 days now and gotta take it back for a refund or return it to Revlon. All I know is that i cannot wear the new scent. Please bring back the ORIGINAL Jean Nate Splash...please!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> use it all the time very happy</li>
    <li> Amazon, thanks for stocking this splash.  It smells great and is in a great size.  It lasts a good while.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff in the summer after a shower.  I work in the garden and any flowery scent attracts bees and other insects but this is just fine.  Very soothing to skin and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;d hoped for - just like the original product -  refreshing in warm weather.  Other than its pleasant fragrance it is one of the very few fragrances that does not make me sneeze.</li>
    <li> Rate:  5 STARS&lt;br /&gt;Have used Revlon&#x27;s Jean Nate for years and I&#x27;m always pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment came on time and well packaged.  Will order this again.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great price on a great product.  I live in Houston, with the horrible heat &amp; humidity, so I use this all the time.  Received it quickly and intact.  Will continue to order from you!</li>
    <li> Jean Nate After Bath Splash doe not smell the same as it smelled in the 60&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s &amp; early 80&#x27;s. I used to wear Jean Nate all the time. A light, fresh scent. In the 80&#x27;s I wanted to try other scents and bought other colognes instead. A few years ago I saw Jean Nate on a store shelf and bought a bottle. When I sprayed it, it smelled like it had sat on the shelf for many years and \\&quot;gone bad\\&quot; or, as someone else&#x27;s comment describes it, \\&quot;rancid\\&quot;. I had to try to wash the scent off. Very disappointing. I forgot about that incident and when I saw it in a store yesterday decided to give it a try again (8 oz. After Bath Splash Mist). As soon as the scent reached my nose I remembered the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; bottle. Yesterday&#x27;s purchase had the same unpleasant, stinky, \\&quot;bad\\&quot; undertones. I know it&#x27;s just an inexpensive body splash, but there&#x27;s a big difference between \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. This smells \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. Jean Nate was introduced in the mid 1930&#x27;s and was originally made by Charles of the Ritz whose products were sold in salons and upper-end department stores. Charles of the Ritz subsequently acquired or merged with Lanvin and Yves St Laurent. In 1987, Charles of the Ritz (including the Jean Nate line)was sold to Revlon. Under Revlon, the Charles of the Ritz brand began to slip in image and prestige. Revlon tried to revive the image of, and then unsuccessfully sell, the Charles of the Ritz brand. They finally shut the brand down and started selling some of the Charles of the Ritz fragrances, including Jean Nate, under the Revlon name.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jean Nate for years and have always loved the refreshing feel and scent.  It is nice to find such a good price on the larger bottle and free shipping with Prime.</li>
    <li> I remember buying this years ago and it smelled very lemony and feminine.  This bottle of Jean Nate had a very masculine scent.  Even my husband said so and he doesn&#x27;t know anything about the product!  Not only masculine but it just stunk! I gave it to my friend to sell in her 3-day yard sale and no one bought it! Priced at $2.  I will never buy another Jean Nate product again!</li>
    <li> I concur with all the disappointed long-time, loyal fans. The new formulation is simply awful. I&#x27;ve given it several tries, and end up scrubbing it off each time, so bad is it. I loved the classic. It was an amazing product - fresh, uplifting, with a truly urbane, sophisticated lemony note that belied its affordable cost. I knew I could always go into a drug store, and find this wonderful staple. I&#x27;ve had many compliments wearing this. I would always get an appreciative reaction on smelling it in my hair. I&#x27;m so disappointed in the new &#x27;Original&#x27; formulation. It&#x27;s actually kind of nauseating - a sort of cinnamon note mixed in with the lemon verbena. How in the world did Revlon come up with something so bad? &#x27;Banal&#x27; would have been a better formula option than this.</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate for 55 years. It is as good as ever. I have problems finding the large bottle in stores and therefore I order it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> The new formula is TERRIBLE!!!!!  ALL YOU CAN SMELL is the ALCOHOL.  A saleslady said my perfume smelled \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; because it was so offensive a smell.  REVLON, are you listening?  Revlon, do you really care about the comments of your most loyal female customers? No woman wants to smell like she has been out in the woods for weeks with your \\&quot;new formula\\&quot;!!!!  Enough said and written!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love Jean Nate and it is hard to find locally</li>
    <li> excellent water tualet my grandmother likes is fanatic and is always the same bad packaged by the seller</li>
    <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Great service&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more value based products.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied as a consumer and user of the product</li>
    <li> very good, shipper is outstanding</li>
    <li> I love the clean fresh sent of This product and have used it for years. I was down to my last bottle and was having a problem finding it. It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have used Jean Nate for the last 30 years; it is part of my evening and morning ritual.  It&#x27;s refreshing and light enough not to collide with your favorite perfume.  I am just sad it is not at my local drug store any longer.&lt;br /&gt;JT in Hawaii</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Jean Nate for about 30 years as I loved to splash it on after a shower.  In fact, I loved it so much that I purchased over 15 years worth and just ran out.  Well they changed the recipe and to me it&#x27;s absolutely horrible.  Jean Nate made this into a COMPLETELY FOUL FRAGRANCE. I purchased this a few months ago and just started to use this last night.  The fragrance smells like some horrible peppery spice and (thankfully) does not last more than a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD Ingredients list from my previous bottle (This list is also a different recipe but it was much better):&lt;br /&gt;SD Alcholoh 40-B&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Extract&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Acetate)&lt;br /&gt;Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;Benzophenone-2&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C Yellow #5&lt;br /&gt;D&amp;C Green #5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the NEW ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol Denat.&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water) EAU)&lt;br /&gt;Parfum (Fragrance)&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate&lt;br /&gt;Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;BHT&lt;br /&gt;Benzyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Cinnamal&lt;br /&gt;Citral&lt;br /&gt;Citronellol&lt;br /&gt;Coumarin&lt;br /&gt;Eugenol&lt;br /&gt;Geraniol&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxycitronellal&lt;br /&gt;Limonene&lt;br /&gt;Linalool&lt;br /&gt;Yellow 5 (CI 19140)&lt;br /&gt;Green 5 (CI 61570)&lt;br /&gt;22377 (I don&#x27;t believe this is an ingredient but it&#x27;s listed at the end of the last ingredient above and follows a period)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Oct. 27, 2014 - I finally found the empty bottle with the original ingredients list (see below). This is the Jean Nate from my grandmother&#x27;s years with a fragrance that was so fresh and intoxicating, I wanted to douse my body all day long. Unfortunately, this fragrance appears to no longer exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SD Alcholoh 40-B&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Benzophenone-2&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C Yellow #6&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C Blue #1</li>
    <li> When I went to get my parcel at the Post Office, the parcel was all wet, so I asked the clerk to return it.  I&#x27;m still waiting for another bottle to be sent to me.  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Tetreault</li>
    <li> Great blast from the past--- bought it for my mother.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the scent.  Not bad for men either.  This product can also be purchased at drug stores and other places.</li>
    <li> I love Jean Nate in Summer. It has a pleasant lemon scent and you do not need to use very much. It will last all season. I apply it on my neck, arms, and feet. It has camphor in it, so the bugs stay away. It is refreshing right after a bath or shower and at bedtime. It is also very good for any oily skin areas. It is cooling for the hot spots. It also comes as a powder which is nice for an added touch. It absolutely repels gnats and mosquitoes. August is the best time to purchase this product for next Spring/Summer. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> No contact with seller. Delivered as promised. Great product. Great Price.</li>
    <li> Everything done perfectly well</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It is timeless.  When I was a teenager, I developed an allergic skin reaction to deodorants and in desperation used this product under my arms.  Over the years -- perhaps it is the improvement of deodorants -- my allergic reaction went away, but I still love to use this product daily.  Have tried all the newer, trendy bath sprays and always come home to Jean Nate.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Jean Nate for years.  I was in the mood for an little indulgence, and I bought a bottle.  It smells like horse.  I am so disappointed that they changed the scent.  It used to be so elegant.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service!!!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and hope they won&#x27;t stop making it! It&#x27;s not always easy to find it in the stores, so I am glad I can get it online.</li>
    <li> Great I use it mixed with vegetable glycerin and placed in a spray bottle for after bath use.  Use on husband&#x27;s dry skin also</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have original scent. I have bought this many time at local store. I decided to get it through Amazon due to having it at a good price. But it was not worth it.</li>
    <li> Awful. Please bring back the original.</li>
    <li> i have loved this stuff for decades!</li>
    <li> I love the big bottle which lasts forever. Yes, it is not as freshlemmony  as it used to smell way back when, but I still love the tingly clean feeling! It came quickly.</li>
    <li> this is a great buy, its huge</li>
