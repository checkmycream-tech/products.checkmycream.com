    <li> Fun and cute hello kitty add-ons for nails~ love them~ Thank you~</li>
    <li> There cute but not what I expected the color is very off from the pic</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, takes up to much room on the nails. Definitley for long fake nails. Perfect for kids to play with, but for decorating shirts or some other craft.</li>
    <li> exactly as  advertised</li>
    <li> THE PINK HELLO KITTY AND BOWS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. CANNOT WAIT TO USE THEM!! I AM VERY SATISFIED&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T LOOK LIKE THE PICTURES, TOO SMALL. NOT SATISFY, NOT 3D, I THINK THIS IS A RIP OFF. NEEDS MORE DETAILS</li>
    <li> I received these today and was thrilled with them.. love love...  the details of these small pieces was above what I expected. the shop owner very helpful and responded quickly to each contact.. I will order from this shop again.</li>
    <li> Cute but cheap looking ive seen better ones but they will do..... wish they look more like the picture but ok</li>
    <li> These are cute.  My daughter and her friends love Hello Kitty so these will be great for my craft projects.</li>
    <li> These are cute, but the pink on hello kitty is very light you can&#x27;t hardly see her face. On the picture the pink is a lot brighter, but it still looks cute.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these.  She will be very glad to use them on the new cell phone she is getting for christmas.  So adorable.</li>
    <li> Very cute and well made.</li>
    <li> omg I love these nail arts so much. They are a perfect fit on my nail. Be careful because they are easily to come off if you glue them. I use either cyrstal or ayrciic because it stays on and last longer. I also got them super early.</li>
    <li> HELLO KITTY, my daughter loves loves Hello Kitty, and I can&#x27;t wait to do her nails with them or let her use some for scrapbooking, or on her cell phone. They are very cute. I&#x27;m happy, because she is happy.</li>
    <li> Great product..shipping longer then expected but loved the hello kitty and bows. my niece loved them to. pretty big size and bouldky</li>
    <li> there cute but i feel a little big for the nails and i would not get them again for that</li>
    <li> Product was just as stated in the ad. I would purchase again if needed. The items met my expectations completely</li>
    <li> I put these on my and I LOVE My nails. simple art, that anyone can do and I don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg to a salon.... I love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use theses on my nails.  I&#x27;m also going to use them for making cards and scrap booking.</li>
    <li> Good for nail art, but more Hello Kitties would have been nice. Lots of cute bow. Will order again in the future!</li>
    <li> I was really expecting them to be a lot smaller then the picture but to my surprise they are as big as they look. As a new nail artist I really enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and I love hello kitty everything.  You will like these. I would buy these again.  So cute</li>
    <li> I haven;t tried this yet but they look adorable.</li>
    <li> Good arrival time and pretty pieces just wish it came in a wheel or something better than a bag... but cute..</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> ordered this a while ago to put on my nails. many of the hello kitties have messed up faces. usually hello kitty has a yellow nose. these do not. just so you know they are not rounded to fit your nails. but they are still very cute. came with a bunch of hello kittys and bows.</li>
    <li> These are the cutest Hello Kitty 3D nail art! I love the kitties and the pink bows are the perfect combo! Very fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> The pieces are the perfect size and are very good quality. Flat back for easy application on nail I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
    <li> fair price cute for nails and decorating</li>
    <li> These are far too big to place on nails and they have flat backs.  I bought to use on nails and when they arrived there was no way I was going to use on my nails.  I have large nails and long so if you have small hands don&#x27;t buy for nails.  Would be great on cell phones or scrap booking.</li>
    <li> Oh these are the cutest little things and they actually look like little kitty i love the fact that yes it takes a while to come it still doesnt feel like forever to get here! very worth the price</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. I can use these on other projects too, not just for nails. Such as a cell phone cover.</li>
    <li> Thanks for these, and my customers love these, I&#x27;m a manicurist and my clients love these, I need to order more and will early next week.  Thanks for the great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carma, Orlando, FL</li>
    <li> the decals were too big to even fit on to the nail.. not too happy</li>
    <li> Out of 40 pcs. Only 1 was not up to par, but it was a bow and not a hello kitty, so not to sad about it.</li>
    <li> The Hello Kitty is not as pink as the pics. But for the price it was ok...</li>
    <li> ﻿the Kitty is not like it is in there pic hello Kitty nose is yellow mine are black and ﻿the kitty is wearing pink in there pic mine is just a plain white cat. Otherwise ﻿the price was good and it came before ﻿the estimated arrival so I gave it five stars just for that but if you want hello kitty that looks like hello kitty these might not be for you good service though just would&#x27;ve been happier with a better description of them item I was really going to get.</li>
    <li> I love hello kitty but I did not like how these turned out. They don&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
    <li> Its okay, I guess. Its too big for us people with smaller hands and nails. It won&#x27;t fit 100% of the way so it gets caught up by the corners and comes off. I mean, it looks pretty its just not really functional for long wear unless you apply on fake nails or have wider nails. It only works if you apply directly to the middle of the nail, in my case. I might repurchase this products for clients, but definitely not for me. Besides, I though it would be 20/20. 20 Hello Kitty pieces and 20 bows, but nope.</li>
    <li> very cute items, great price. the bows are perfect size and the kittys are really nice. i would recommend this item</li>
    <li> Received the product within 4 days, the bows and hello kitty are adorable and exactly as described. Although they might be a little big to be used for nail art, but overall I am very satisfied and would order again.</li>
    <li> They arrived before the date I was told to expect them. They are exactly what  the photo shows and my granddaughter can not wait to use them when she does nails again.</li>
    <li> my niece loved the hello kitty and can&#x27;t wait to get them on</li>
    <li> They r so cute. Omg so in love lol!  But they are perfect and the e&#x27;er right amount. So there&#x27;s no worries 💅💅💅💅💅</li>
    <li> So much fun with my daughter. We get crafty.</li>
    <li> It came quickly in the mail. It looks just like the picture! Hello kitty and the bows are so cute! I will definitely be ordering again from them!!!</li>
    <li> hello kittys are great and bows to all of them where in good shape and none where chipped or missing parts love them i will buy more</li>
    <li> Very pretty and love the pink color.  The Hello Kitty faces are cute but it is missing a detail in the face.</li>
    <li> My clients  loved them</li>
    <li> Granddaughter and her mom are tickled pink with the product.  It arrived quickly and at a reasonable price.  Business doesn&#x27;t get amy better than that!</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with size, quality, colors over all awesome product</li>
    <li> The material and qualities are so poor and cheap looking!&lt;br /&gt;Better with more different size than one! Too big to put on nails</li>
    <li> satisfied..not bad but not great.. i wish it would contour to the nail bed more so it easier to glued to the nail</li>
    <li> Totally cute! They fit my nails, but if you have small nail beds, it may not fit on your nails.</li>
    <li> I love my Hello Kitty :)</li>
    <li> Love these they look great highly recommend this !!!!!!</li>
    <li> i recommend this product to everybody ilove this product look amazing in the nails i rate this with 5 start im very happy with the seller came on time</li>
    <li> GOT THESE TO PUT ON MY DAUGHTERS NAILS, BUT THEY TURNED OUT TO BE TO BIG. MAY BE GOOD FOR OTHER PROJECTS</li>
    <li> These were awesome! The were the perfect fit. They looked so cute on my nailes and they were painted perfectly</li>
    <li> I love them&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> These look and work as described.  They are great products for a great price.  I would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Happy customer. Can&#x27;t wait to try them</li>
