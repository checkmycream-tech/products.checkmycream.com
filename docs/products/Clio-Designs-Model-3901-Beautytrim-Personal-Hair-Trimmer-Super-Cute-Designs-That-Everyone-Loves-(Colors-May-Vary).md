      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job - but it&#x27;s better than nothing (which is where I was at the time I purchased it).</li>

<li> The down side, I dropped mine and it came completely apart.</li>
<li> Unless you plan on being really careful don&#x27;t bother buying the Clio.</li>
<li> I bought this, took it home, trimmed 2 hairs, and it jammed up and stopped working.</li>
<li> I left it switched to on and just held it a few minutes.</li>
<li> It is very irritating to the skin, has a head so small that not much ground is covered, and it breaks and breaks down easily.</li>
<li> The Clio trimmer is cute and compact but it feels like it is pulling the hair instead of cutting it!</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s so hard to put back together again.</li>
<li> I found that the motor was indeed properly working, but the notch made in the head to attach the little plastic vibrating stem thingy to it, was made to small.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really worth the hassle.</li>
<li> It came completely apart and was very difficult to put back</li>
<li> I had never used a trimmer before, bought this little guy and thought it was a miracle worker!</li>
<li> Seriously the biggest waste of money.</li>
<li> its not good</li>
<li> Not happy at all.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about, because this product is a piece of crap.</li>
<li> It would work thenshut off then work poorly then shut off again!</li>
<li> I am so disappointed.</li>
<li> I can get it to work at for maybe 30 seconds if I turn it on an wiggle the head around fairly violently.</li>
<li> iws mad it broke !!!</li>
<li> These are the worst I have ever used.</li>

    <li> I bought it to trim my mustache and line my goatee, but it wouldn&#x27;t work. Next, I tested it on the hair on an unnoticeable part of my arm, and it wouldn&#x27;t even cut that. I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about, because this product is a piece of crap.</li>
    <li> works great for thinning my eyebrows, shaving my fingers, toes, and tops of my feet. this is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> Just something you can&#x27;t do without. Good for men and women.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I use it for my eyebrows and it works really well.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent tool for quickly and painlessly removing upper lip and facial hair. Battery life is long, the trimmer is compact, and very effective. Cleaning the blade takes some effort, but it is the best hair removal purchase i have ever made!</li>
    <li> it works and works well if you can keep the head of it on, you cant use the lid , it will knock the head of the trimmers off, and you are forever putting it back on, its junk...</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> For the price this was a great deal! Works really well, have not had a problem with it and it trims my eyebrow hairs very well!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was removing any hair and as I was looking at it and the directions,&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped it.  It came completely apart and was very difficult to put back together.&lt;br /&gt;It still didn&#x27;t work well enough for the time it took.  If I hadn&#x27;t thrown away my receipt I would most certainly return it to Walmart.</li>
    <li> The tweezer was designed very pretty and girly. However, it did not do the job for me.</li>
    <li> iws mad it broke !!!its not good so dont buy this its cheap!!!Never buying this agian ever as i i live</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this off amazon but I felt I could write a review on it anyway. I had never used a trimmer before, bought this little guy and thought it was a miracle worker! It swept hairs away and left my skin feeling great after I used it. But then it started chirping on me. It would work thenshut off then work poorly then shut off again! So i replaced the battery. Well in doing so it worked great for the next five minutes then once again died. So I began to experiment. I left it switched to on and just held it a few minutes. It began to get very hot. Then I took the head off to investigate. I found that the motor was indeed properly working, but the notch made in the head to attach the little plastic vibrating stem thingy to it, was made to small. So you have to pound it to make it work. I just threw mine away.:)</li>
    <li> My daughter likes it.  It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her pocket. I hope it will serve the purpose for which I bought it.</li>
    <li> If it worked it would be totally ok as a product. Really simple, On, off, one battery, great. But it stopped working after I had used it about 3 times. I can get it to work at for maybe 30 seconds if I turn it on an wiggle the head around fairly violently. It&#x27;s not really worth the hassle. Wish that this cheap option would&#x27;ve been an easy solution but I guess it&#x27;s going to end up in the trash.</li>
    <li> It works well and is inexpensive to replace when necessary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does a good job to</li>
    <li> Although others complained about the low quality of this item, I still thought it would be perfect for travel. Yes, sometimes when you turn it on it doesn&#x27;t always come on but if you knock it a bit it works. I was okay with it since it&#x27;s very small in size and light weight. The down side, I dropped mine and it came completely apart. I would have still been okay with it since I&#x27;m handy but it&#x27;s so hard to put back together again. You have to line things up perfectly from the top and the bottom and it&#x27;s just not that easy. I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth any more time and finally threw it away. When I travel I&#x27;ll be taking the Panasonic Pivoting Head Trimmer that I bought to replace this one. It is larger and heavier but still light enough for travel. The best thing -- it&#x27;s sturdy too and always works when I turn it on. Unless you plan on being really careful don&#x27;t bother buying the Clio. It&#x27;s a shadow of what a good trimmer should be.</li>
    <li> I bought this, took it home, trimmed 2 hairs, and it jammed up and stopped working. Seriously the biggest waste of money. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> After 3 uses it quit working I was very disappointe. Worked great tho first few times. I didnt&#x27;t get a cute design like they show but I guess that doesn&#x27;t matter if it quits</li>
    <li> I bought the Clio Personal Hair Trimmer to replace my no-longer-working Igia one.  The Clio trimmer is cute and compact but it feels like it is pulling the hair instead of cutting it! OUCH!!!</li>
    <li> i purchase this first for myself after trying it on my eyebrow pyrchase about 10 more as gifts and one more for my self for my bikin line it is great a must try</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter she loves it.</li>
    <li> This Cleo trimmer is basically a tiny, tiny notch above store-brand trimmers. It is very irritating to the skin, has a head so small that not much ground is covered, and it breaks and breaks down easily. The blades lose sharpness fairly quickly. Replacement blades cost as much as a whole new trimmer. The good news? It trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and learned that while it is okay, I wanted a better trimmer. I found that in the [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer]].</li>
    <li> These are the worst I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job - but it&#x27;s better than nothing (which is where I was at the time I purchased it).</li>
