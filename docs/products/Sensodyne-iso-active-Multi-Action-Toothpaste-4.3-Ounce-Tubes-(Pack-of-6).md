    <li> Love this product  - they have now changed it so I bought a supply of the original because I do not like the new paste.</li>
    <li> Started using it because it helps my sensitive gums. I kept buying it cause I love the container. One of the few that doesn&#x27;t leave toothpaste on the counter!</li>
    <li> I think the propellant they&#x27;re using is the same stuff that shaving cream companies use...it has that distinctive wierd smell/taste that made me double check the can to make sure I hadn&#x27;t grabbed the wrong stuff off the shelf.    It may clean my teeth better, but I can&#x27;t get over this taste that lingers long after I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this flavor again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it, It&#x27;s all I use, good for those sensitive areas, cleans well &amp; leaves your mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and I think they may have stopped making I because it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I buy and use for sensitivity.  The blue cap.  Didn&#x27;t like the green cap.  My local Walgreens or Duane Reade don&#x27;t even carry these anymore.  So happy I was able to get it on Amazon.  5-star would have applied had it been Amazon Prime.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Best around for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> its a very good product five star</li>
    <li> Just sorry to see these are NO longer being sold anywhere. Wish the maker would consider making this available again. Love the foaming action and easy pump style top.</li>
    <li> Hardens teeth with fluoride and sodium nitrate. If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients - Potassium Nitrate 5% - Purpose - Antihypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride 0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion - Anticavity.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients Water, Sorbitol, Hydrated Silica, Glycerin, Flavor, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Saccharin, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I have sjorn syndrome and all other toothpastes burn my mouth. Sensodyne makes other formulas but this one tastes good and is wonderful. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the teeth whitener one or the pro enamel either. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothpaste. Oh yeah my teenagers love it too.</li>
    <li> Nice non-abrasive gel. I like the pump. Too bad the tip accumulates crusty dried toothpaste. Not difficult to scrape off though.</li>
    <li> I have used the Iso-Active Foaming Sensodyne in the can for about five  years and was heartbroken recently when I could not find this particular one at any store.  I tried the Sensodyne in a tube as close to this one as I could find, and it tasted awful.....like chalk.  I always try to avoid fluoride if possible, although this one has 15% fluoride.  But  it is so good in every other way that I stay with it.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like the taste of Sensodyne toothpaste, but since I have sensitive teeth I have to use it.  This one is great. Love the \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; action.  You feel like you have brushed your teeth when you have used this one.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores.  Am grateful that I can still get it here.</li>
    <li> PLEASE BRING THIS BACK! IT SAVED MY LIFE!</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste everyday.  Since I began, I have had excellent dental check ups.  I highly recommend this particular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product for my needs.  This works as it says  it would. This is a great product for the price</li>
    <li> The delivery method for this toothpaste is easy on weak hands. Sensodyne has been my preferred brand for years; the iso-active version leaves your teeth feeling even cleaner.</li>
    <li> Alcove this version of Sensodyne!  No whitening agents, good flavor, foams fantastically for a clean mouth feel.</li>
    <li> i luv the way it cleans my teeth!!</li>
    <li> wonderful foaming toothpaste.  can&#x27;t find it locally anymore.  not the same as in the tubes.  thanks&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time no problems</li>
