      <li>My eyes are flawless from these ..better than other brands on here..</li>
      <li>These are easy to use</li>
      <li>The DermaGen Anti-Wrinke Patches are pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I have to wash my face after using these, whereas I&#x27;d be able to use Smoothies as a quick touch up before leaving for an event</li>
      <li>These are very comfortable and they really do work!!  </li>
      <li>They really are amazing.</li>
      <li>It is important not to stretch you skin when placing the patches.  </li>
      <li>When applying, use your finger tips to push up the cheek a bit it would help to smooth the line.</li>
      <li>They smooth out lines around my eyes and mouth</li>
      <li>still love them because they prevent laugh lines get deeper while I am a sleep.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never had something that works so well on my smile lines!</li>
      <li>Takes them right away!</li>

      <li>but they lose their stickiness fast, so these are much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good deal after all because one set (crescent) should last me 40 days.</li>
      <li>iw was suprised, I ordered more, fast shipping.</li>

      <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about them..</li>
      <li>iam getting there my wrinkle not bad now</li>
      <li>A loyal user will see a difference.</li>
      <li>I cannot live without these!!!!</li>
      <li>They can be a bit drying, first two uses I apply light serum.</li>
      <li>Sticks well to your face overnight and pretty comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, and I am so happy that the manufacturer is finally started to sell the different patches separately as since everybody has different types of wrinkle issues and not everybody need all the patch types.</li>
      <li>I bought a package the first time and it was excellent, but the last buy not satisfy me, are very fragile and once damaged</li>

      <li>I got these for my laugh lines around my eyes and wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
      <li>Though I cannot say that the patches are effective enough to erase wrinkles totaly (</li>
      <li>I tried frownies and smoothies, these are my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>These patches are really great and can be used more than once if careful, so they last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I think the active ingredient starts reacting with your skin, or perhaps they just warm up, and do stick securely to the skin, stay on overnight and don&#x27;t shift while you sleep.</li>
      <li>The didn&#x27;t stick well, and looked like they were going to fall off right away, they were just sort of laying on my face, yeah,</li>
      <li>I like these very much for my smile lines.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are more expensive, but more effective.</li>
      <li>And I would think of the patches more of a physical effect to protect me from pushing/squeezing against the pillow.</li>
      <li>they work better on younger people??</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> YUP!! Love these.  I even received a free sheet with my third order.  A noticeable difference in the morning.  The lines and wrinkles are not so prominent!</li>
    <li> Such a simple idea that really works.  Put on my eye cream and allow to sink in for about an hour then place these stickers under my eyes and wake up with NO PUFFY bags.  It&#x27;s perfect if I have a big meeting, presentation or a date and want to look my best.  So much better than surgery and a temporary fix to a long term problem.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase several more to have with me at all times.</li>
    <li> These were very effective with the gel !!  Have ordered more.</li>
    <li> I like the way they seem to lift my slightly sunken under eye area each morning when dampened with my moisturizing toner.</li>
    <li> great product....thanx*****</li>
    <li> ordered several times.  Meets my approval. I see improvement</li>
    <li> have not seen a change yet and been 2 weeks.  I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and I am so happy that the manufacturer is finally started to sell the different patches separately as since everybody has different types of wrinkle issues and not everybody need all the patch types. I have been using this product for a year now, and I can tell the difference between the ay after of using it versus the day after not using it. I recommend to everybody including men!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely addicted to these beauty patches as I have seen time and again that they soften lines and creases after a night sleep.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  I&#x27;m a side sleeper and a little over a year ago I noticed that the creases on my face from sleeping were starting to stick, especially around my eyes.  I use these crescent shapes overnight and they prevent new lines and relax existing ones.  I can usually use them 4 or 5 nights but less if my skin is oilier or I use a heavier moisturizer. It also helps to firmly adhere them back to the plastic sheet after use, it helps them retain their stickiness.  Their not really sticky, just enough to stay on your face, then they soften up with the heat of your skin and stay on very well, fairly comfortable.  They are not moisturizing so I usually take a break for a night before I use a new set and moisturize up really well.  The company is really great to work with also.  I received the wrong assortment of sizes once and I received the correct set within 2 days of contacting them, and got to keep the other pack.  Otherwise I always get my deliveries promptly.  Definitely recommend these and I&#x27;ll be continuing to use them... I&#x27;m not getting any younger :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, not only do the patches help with under eye wrinkles but best of all if left on for 15 to 30 minutes each morning  they reduce under eye puffiness. The best I have used !!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference, maybe it works better on people with hardly any evidence of wrinkles.  I have wrinkles under my eyes that I was hoping these patches would help.  They did not, I left these on for a couple of hours and didn&#x27;t see a difference. I want give up though, may sleep with them through the night to see how that goes.  They are not very comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> see same rating above for same patches I bought these too with those I reviewed and are the saem results and by the same company</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, It doesn&#x27;t add additional lines from using it unlike others, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, SKC.</li>
    <li> I like it for night wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a side sleeper and my bone structure is such that, if it weren&#x27;t for these, I&#x27;d walk around half the day with a wrinkle under one or both of my eyes.  I wear them overnight and they come off easily in the morning if you gently press against your skin while removing them slowly.  They&#x27;re reusable and a sheet of these lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using these for nearly three years now.  I put some paraben-free moisturizer on (often just some dabs of grapeseed oil) and let it absorb before applying these.  It may shorten their lifespan, but I figure that helps counteract any negatives there might be to wearing them overnight.  After three years, all I&#x27;ve noticed is that the deep sleep lines that were forming under my eyes are not there.  Now, I&#x27;m still seeing the crow&#x27;s feet and other light wrinkles slowly forming (I&#x27;m almost 39), but these have worked wonders for keeping the deep sleep lines off my face.  It was clear to me three years ago that if I didn&#x27;t do something, they would soon be there all day (I just can&#x27;t sleep on my back).  Now they are gone.  Great company.  I&#x27;ll be buying these as long as they make them.</li>
    <li> These are very comfortable and they really do work!!  I have tried others but these are the best!!</li>
    <li> These patches help relax facial wrinkles.  If you wear them overnight, or a few hours before you go out, you will find that if you have some deep set wrinkles, they actually will be less noticeable.  This is not a forever fix for wrinkles. but used consistantly over time, they do help lessen the look of them.</li>
    <li> They are strong , thick and stay on....if your a side sleeper it will stop wrinkles from forming.It will also make  them much better if you have them already...they help my dark circles too. They can be reused maybe 3 times each..you can cut them to make em smaller..My eyes are flawless from these ..better than other brands on here..I buy them every few months..can&#x27;t say enough good things about them..</li>
    <li> I have been using these patches non-stop religiously for more than three years, and it works wonder as long as you have got the right method and the right attitude. I normally apply my night moisturizer PLUS the eye cream along the laugh lines, let them sit in for at least 15 minutes before I put on these patches. When applying, use your finger tips to push up the cheek a bit it would help to smooth the line. Gently pat on the patches to make sure they stay put. You don&#x27;t want to laugh or kiss or even speak a lot when wearing these patches. They won&#x27;t technically &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; your lines, and unless you go for plastic surgery nothing would. And I would think of the patches more of a physical effect to protect me from pushing/squeezing against the pillow. That s why I use it every night and never missed once---it is the sort of product that definitely slows down the aging process with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a 30+ side-sleeper who laughs a lot I show no laugh lines at all during the day time. Have tried other brands but this one is by far the only one that does not leave dents in my skin because of its soft material. Much better than those over-hyped retinol derivatives, not to mention cheaper. I appreciate the attitude of the seller to focus on result, simple methods, and affordable price.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and I think I can see a difference after using them.  Although the directions say that they can be reused several times I found this very difficult.  They do not seem to stick well after the second use.  I would recommend these and will buy more myself.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try these to see if they would help the puffy bags under my eyes.  First off, these don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; at all.  In fact, they feel quite dry.  It just feels like you&#x27;re putting tape on your face, and they don&#x27;t stick very well after the first night.  I saw no difference.  The only plus is that they are pretty comfortable to sleep in</li>
    <li> These really are great when used correctly. You must apply a serum or cream ahead of time and allow it to absorb a bit before applying the patches otherwise the patches themselves are fairly worthless. The patches can be used twice before throwing out. The patches hold in the moisture from the serum/cream and prevent the skin underneath from wrinkling while you sleep.</li>
    <li> These did reduce the appearance of the lines by my mouth, at least temporarily.  I do not know if the effects are cumulative and/or long lasting, though.  I was able to reuse the strips several times.</li>
    <li> Bought these as an alternative to &amp;#34;frownines&amp;#34; since I can&#x27;t stand licking them to make them stick, and even then, they don&#x27;t fully stick. I&#x27;m sure if I wore them more often I&#x27;d see more results, but when I do wear them lines definitely look reduced. I cut them up to put in my frown line area as well as other areas on my face such as under my eyes and around my mouth.</li>
    <li> Love these things!! I got these for my laugh lines around my eyes and wrinkles around my mouth. I recently lost weight and it certainly shows in my face. These patches work great... Use them every night. They smooth out lines around my eyes and mouth and I&#x27;m impressed. I will continue to buy them!</li>
    <li> It does seem to minimize the deep wrinkles if you keep them on awhile, and then remove before you have to go out somewhere you want to look your best. It&#x27;s not lasting, but helps for situations like I just mentioned.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without these. As soon as I start to feel a pimple I apply one of these to keep myself from picking it and leave on over night. In the morning the pimple is almost gone!!! I repeat this until it is gone completely. It keeps small cuts, pimples, and burns from scarring. I know that it is for wrinkles and that does help with that. But, for me my cystic occasional acne etc is where it is at for me!!!!! I cannot live without these!!!! Put on dry skin patches and zap!!!! By morning it is sooo much better.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product...wish I would have found it years ago....noticed a difference after 1st use.</li>
    <li> Oh, my goodness!  They work!  I am nearly 70 years old, so some of my wrinkles are decades old.  After the first night, there was a dramatic difference, and it gets better each morning.  It is important not to stretch you skin when placing the patches.  I have oily skin, so I can only re-use them three times.  I have tried other patches and creams--nothing even came close.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve had a facelift over night!!! Love them!!</li>
    <li> The product delivered wasn&#x27;t packed as asvertised. Two sheets of plastic paper with patched attached on it was directly- without any wraping- put into the mail envelop. I have no way to figure our whether it is authentic or not since there is no original package.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible experience.</li>
    <li> I tried frownies and smoothies, these are my favorite so far. Patches can not provide the permanent solution unless you start using them early, before deep wrinkles develop, as a preventative measure, and frequently, because effects are cumulative. If you have lines, the patches will help keep them from getting worse or even more, if you patient and stick to your schedule, they can make them less prominent, you will see an improvement. Please be realistic, they will not erase anything completely, especially after one time,  it would be a dream come true for 10-20 dollars, right???&lt;br /&gt;With all being said, this is a great product. I wish I started using something like this years ago. I find that I need to use them every night. I sleep on the side of my face, and frown while I sleep, so if I miss a day, my nasolabial and 11 lines/between brows get more visible again. If you miss putting them on at night, then try wearing them for an hour or two next morning (if you have time), it works too, and you will not mess up your results.&lt;br /&gt;OK, why do I prefer these to other two brands? The results last longer  with these patches, perhaps because they are hydro-colloidal?? I don&#x27;t really know. If you think you are going to get slimy, moist patches covered in some kind of gel, you will be disappointed, they are dry. I am glad they are not gooey, they work better this way though they can be drying! I noticed another thing, they eliminate pimples overnight. I did research after I noticed this &amp;#34;side effect&amp;#34;, hydrocolloid patches are used for acne... I didn&#x27;t know. Well, this is what description says, and they are not being tricky by saying that.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed the minute I put them on for the first time (I bought crescent shapes). The didn&#x27;t stick well, and looked like they were going to fall off right away, they were just sort of laying on my face, yeah, definitely no frownies... I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was supposed to sleep with these. Phew, they adhere pretty good after all, just press them for a few seconds, they will stay on. I think the active ingredient starts reacting with your skin, or perhaps they just warm up, and do stick securely to the skin, stay on overnight and don&#x27;t shift while you sleep. I was even more surprised when I was able to reuse one strip (a pair of strips) 4 times!! So far I used 4 sets, 4 times each. So at the beginning I thought I would give them a try thinking 9-10 dollars for 20 strips (10 days of use) is very expensive. It&#x27;s a good deal after all because one set (crescent) should last me 40 days. I have reordered more crescent and also purchased triangular shapes (unfortunately triangles do not work as well as frownies for 11 lines between the eyebrows, they are too pliable and soft).&lt;br /&gt;They are not hydrating as description says. I use cream before putting them on, especially when I reuse them for the third and forth time. They can be a bit drying, first two uses I apply light serum. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. I don&#x27;t have to wait two hours as instructed, a few minutes is plenty. The patches will stay even with moisturizer on. Frownies and smoothies will not stick to creams and lotions. You can make frownies to adhere if you wait long enough, but they edges will start peeling off, and the patch can easily fall off. Smoothies will come off entirely even without the lotion, depends on your skin condition.  I woke up a couple of times and found a smoothies patch stuck to one of my brows...&lt;br /&gt;The crescent shapes are generously sized and a bit too long, I cut 2-3 mm off the edges. I highly recommend these, try them. I was hesitant after reading reviews that they do not stick very well, don&#x27;t give up. They are much easier to use than frownies. They are thicker but way softer than frownies, smoothies or the regular tape (I wish they were thinner, but people complained they were too thin and had to double them up, so they were probably redesigned), semi transparent, so you can see you are not covering a folded wrinkle, and also don&#x27;t need to stretch your skin way too much like with frownies while you are waiting for them to adhere, which is not good,  are very easy and painless to remove, don&#x27;t cause any rash, and have an active ingredient that can be beneficial to your skin, not just craft, vegetable glue or whichever adhesive everyone else is using.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nothing fancy comparing to frownies and smoothies, just a plastic bag, probably need an improvement. Overall I am satisfied with this product. I don&#x27;t use package on my face hence not going to lower my rating.ded wrinkle, and also don&#x27;t need to stretch your skin way too much like with frownies while you are waiting for them to adhere, which is not good,  are very easy and painless to remove, don&#x27;t cause any rash, and have an active ingredient that can be beneficial to your skin, not just craft, vegetable glue or whichever adhesive everyone else is using.

    <li> iam getting there my wrinkle not bad now</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t work at all,like putting box tape on your face before going to sleep,and ripping it off in the morning- I have a tiny little line,was hoping it would diminish- having used it for a month it is still there- no change. I will continue to use this product just to see and change my review if anything happens.</li>
    <li> It did the job however the patches are not reusable as a state is entirely too expensive for the small number received. For ten dollars a month plus shipping, cloth medical tape does has the same effect much cheaper.</li>
    <li> i think it is useless product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a repeat buyer of these for several years and cannot live without them. I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in lines and creases from being a side-sleeper since consistently using these. I highly recommend them! Plus, the seller has maintained a perfect record of fast shipping that&#x27;s easy and prompt.</li>
    <li> I swear by these things. They&#x27;re a great,  non- invasive way to deal with creases. My kids call them wrinkle stickers,  I call them great!</li>
    <li> Tho it says h can reuse them once or twice, u can Really only use them one time for any effect at all. Effects only temporary like an hour or so, wasnt impressed at all &amp; def not worth buying to evn try out. Im 40 and i hve no crows feet but i used for nasal labial fold around mouth &amp; like i said what little effect there was,only lasted about an hr. also it causes a line on outside of tape. mayb they work better on younger people??</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  I love these anti-wrinkle patches. Since I sleep on my side, I see less wrinkles because of the patches.  Thank you so much for this product!</li>
    <li> These really helped my under eye area when I sleep from creasing. Just wish there were more in a package.</li>
    <li> I have tried Furlese, &amp; Frownies prior to Dermagen. Imo, these are the best. They contain a skin cellular ingredient that helps treat while smoothing.  They are also reusable. I&#x27;m only on day 3, but I&#x27;ve been able to wash w/ dial soap &amp; reuse. I&#x27;m treating a slight, yet noticeable,  worry line between my brows. So far, the results are excellent.  It&#x27;s visibly gone the next day. I will def reorder these. Price is fair as well.  Thank you to Dermagen</li>
    <li> I have used these for awhile.  I have not found anything better to use.</li>
    <li> These seriously work! I have never had something that works so well on my smile lines! I will keep buying for sure!</li>
    <li> The DermaGen Anti-Wrinke Patches are pretty nice. I usually buy banana shaped, so still getting used to using them on clients.</li>
    <li> These are a bit large for my purposes.  It is my fault because I usually get the set with assorted sizes and shapes.  They do help with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I bought a package the first time and it was excellent, but the last buy not satisfy me, are very fragile and once damaged</li>
    <li> I like these very much for my smile lines.I use them every night and would buy again.Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a couple years now and they do work very well on under eye puffiness because they are durable and stick very well so fluid at night, when laying down, cannot settle under the eye. You can also use them more than once. I actually use them several times until the stickiness wears off. I will continue to buy and use these patches - they work the best compared to other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I liked the patches. As a male I thought the patches really helped due to excess exposure to the sun. This is the first time trying this product and I will recommend to my friends because of the convenience.</li>
    <li> Since I sleep on my side and have been so far unable to train myself to sleep on my back, I smush my face into the pillow and have been waking up with &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines that I&#x27;m just not old enough for yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered both these and &amp;#34;Smoothies.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are more expensive, but more effective. They are softer and cover more area than the Smoothies that are intended for the same part of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the &amp;#34;Smoothies&amp;#34; have a greater variety of shapes if you want to use them on other areas of the face. They also provide a greater number of patches per box. And they leave less residue on the face. I have to wash my face after using these, whereas I&#x27;d be able to use Smoothies as a quick touch up before leaving for an event should I need to someday in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve chosen to alternate the two products. I do not know what this hydrocolloid gel is made of (though I do believe hydrocolloid is nonbreathable), and therefore I don&#x27;t want to have it on my face every single night for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, I&#x27;ve noticed nothing but positive effects. I wake up with very little &amp;#34;smile line&amp;#34; dent on my face after using these. If I was only going to purchase one product, these patches would have the slight edge over the Smoothies.</li>
    <li> I decide to try these for self.. Notice a wrinkled around my mouth,, they work, really like them ..I learned form other users to use them a few times as they can get costly</li>
    <li> Galbut toks pat poveikis butu su paprastu pleistru...</li>
    <li> These are a nice addition to CosmeSearch&#x27;s Neck, Face &amp; Eye Lifts(See 5* My Review on that product).  I apply these Anti-Wrinkle Patches several hours before using the Secret Lifts to give my skin a smooth appearance.  Have yet to try their firming gel, but it&#x27;s on the way.  I&#x27;ll let you know what I think after using it.</li>
    <li> wow. iw was suprised, I ordered more, fast shipping. i was very suprised at the results,, WOW you gotta try them, I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> These are great to sleep in and work to reduce wrinkles</li>
    <li> Sticks well to your face overnight and pretty comfortable to wear. Not sure how effective these types of products are overall (derma-gen, frownies etc.) but these particular patches appear to do what they advertise.</li>
    <li> I like these. They are effective (if even on temporarily) and they can be reused several times before needing to replace with a new one.</li>
    <li> Addicted to these! Hope they never stop making them. You can stack books over the used ones and they re-activate. Have been ordering for years now with good results. Awesome for zits too! Have tried using blister hydrocolloid band aids but they lose their stickiness fast, so these are much better. In my opinion I like the stickiness and extra moisturizing and skin calming qualities of these over their &#x27;expressions&#x27; line, if you&#x27;re having trouble deciding which to buy. I wish they would include an extra sheet of the reuse glossy paper, as sometimes I misplace mine and nothing else works for keeping the patches usable.</li>
    <li> A loyal user will see a difference. The fact they&#x27;re transparent is a change/nice. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation. Great for someone that&#x27;s sleeps on there side. Smooths existing creases &amp; prevents future wrinkles.</li>
    <li> No results after few months of use, if you have sensitive skin you will breakout with glue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tham for about a week.  They really work for wrinkles, especially shallow ones. They are really good.&lt;br /&gt;But I understand why other reviewer says that  the end of the patch is the begining of a new wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;When I peel them off in the morning, I see very shallow lines because of the edges.  However, they&#x27;ll go away within 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;So I think they are still not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I wanted to find a solution for unwanted new shallow lines, and I think I found it.&lt;br /&gt;I put tiny piece of Klenex on the edge of the patch where is likely to cause a line. I tried that last night and I found it helpful when I peeled them off in this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/13/2015&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for abour 3 months. Though I cannot say that the patches are effective enough to erase wrinkles totaly (especially deep lines),&lt;br /&gt;I still love them because they prevent laugh lines get deeper while I am a sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Before I found the patches, I needed to try to sleep on my back in order not to have my laugh lines deeper.  Since I started to use them, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I also learned that they needed to be put in a proper manner, for example, when you put the crescent patches for laugh lines, make sure to shut your mouth, otherwise patches become a little wavy on your skin (that make you have shallow dents in the morning even though they disapper after a little while).&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about them is that I can reuse them 5 to 7 times.&lt;br /&gt;And also, the last time I ordered, there was one more bonus sheet of patches in the envelope which I never expected.  That was very nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;How generous DermaGen is...</li>
    <li> These stay put and you don&#x27;t feel them if you wear them to bed. They seem to help on the Nasolabial folds around the mouth, (the Parenthesis). I would recommend them as a cheaper alternative and less evasive than fillers.</li>
    <li> These patches are really great and can be used more than once if careful, so they last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping and service is also terrific and I will continue using their products in the future.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and I use then nightly!  Great way to keep lines from being reinforced while you sleep!</li>
    <li> It works rather well-but you need to be constant with use.</li>
    <li> It is magic!!!! But it doesnt last all day! But I can see changes immediately after I remove it!</li>
    <li> Works great to help flatten raised scars...fast delivery...neatly packaged....ordered before and no problems ...will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Frownies for a few years and I hoped this would be similar. I didn&#x27;t find it seemed to have much effect though. Rather a disappointment,</li>
    <li> These are my fave. Stay in place (even with night cream or oils on face) and peel off in the morning either dry, or when I wet my face to wash it. perfect for pressing out skin in between the eyes (I cut them in 1/2).  Wish they had sheets of the little dots for delicate area spots under eyes.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these crescent shaped patches multiple times and use them almost every night under my eyes.  They stay in place while I sleep and they do flatten out wrinkles but do not erase them completely.  The best benefit is that they keep &amp;#34;sleep wrinkles&amp;#34; from forming...the ones that happen from having your face scrunched against a pillow.  They stick over heavy eye creams.  I&#x27;ve even placed them over vaseline that I smear around my eyes.  I have sensitive skin and these do not cause any irritation for me. I&#x27;ve tried the triangle shaped ones for between my eyes, but I find that frownies work best for that area.</li>
    <li> I love this and hope to continue using it</li>
    <li> Love these! Circles under my eyes look  so much better!  Fine lines are much less noticeable.</li>
    <li> They work but you have to keep using them.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I buy them every month or so to take away the lines from sleeping on my side.  The results are incredible. Sometimes I wear them through the night, other times I&#x27;ll put them on in the morning to get rid of the lines.</li>
    <li> Cannot live without these! I use them every night as I am a side sleeper and I get &amp;#34;sleep-lines&amp;#34;. If I wear them I don&#x27;t get any creases under my eyes, if I skip a night my eyes are all smooshed and creased again. They really are amazing. Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I only used one once although it says you can reuse them.  They work wonders on problem spots like under my eye where every morning there&#x27;s a wrinkle from sleeping on my cheek.  Takes them right away!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the side sleeper to use on the nasolabial folds. Comfortable to wear while sleeping, and can use them several times. Keeps me looking young and fresh faced!</li>
