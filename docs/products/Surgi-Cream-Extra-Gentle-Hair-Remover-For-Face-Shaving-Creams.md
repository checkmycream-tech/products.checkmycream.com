      <li>/&gt;It was more gentle.</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY one that works to remove all of the hairs and leave my skin in good condition after i&#x27;m done.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that this isn&#x27;t any more gentle than what&#x27;s already on the market.</li>
      <li>I just used it and it is still the same good product that I bought in the drugstore for years.  </li>
      <li>there is no bad reaction to the removal</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so old fashion but so easy. :)</li>
      <li>This remover is gentle enough for my seriously sensitive skin, works great, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s had a layer peeled off!  </li>
      <li>Have been using this for many years now...can&#x27;t live without it.</li>

      <li>Needless to say------I love it!!!!!</li>
      <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it&#x27;s tolerable -- a great improvement over the creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past! ...</li>
      <li>It gently removes all of my lip hair easily and doesn&#x27;t come back fuller or darker like some people say happens when you shave or wax.</li>
      <li>Excellent-does the job well, very pleased with the product as I was in the past.,</li>
      <li>My upper lip is fuzz free and healed now but for 2 days it looked like I had road rash on my face.</li>
      <li>If you have very sensitve skin do not use.</li>
      <li>It is gentle as it doesn&#x27;t burn but it didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is gentle.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the improvement.</li>
      <li>but my upper lip was bright red and bumpy and ultra sensitive to the touch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than Olay or any of the other known brands.  </li>
      <li>I have used surgi cream for many years and neber lets me down.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure that you don&#x27;t have a blemish or so much as a scratch on your face when you apply it, it will turn into a raw sore that takes quite a bit of time to heal.</li>
      <li>It removed the hair just fine, but it started coming back after only a couple days, not a couple weeks as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores these past few years and am thrilled to have it available online.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts.</li>

      <li>Cannot say enough positive comments about this product.</li>
      <li>I have tried many ways to remove my little blond hairs on my upper lip.</li>
      <li>It was clear the box had been opened.  </li>
      <li>I am 25 years old and have been using it since 6th grade.</li>
      <li>and it works very well to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>The only plus side to this hair remover is that over a decade ago I had some wicked facial windburn from a bad winter which left a discolored ring around my mouth, this product managed to completely erase that from my upper lip along with most, if not all hair and some healthy skin as well.</li>
      <li>Also, it burned my skin, leaving it red and sensitive to touch.  </li>
      <li>I am a red head and frequently have reactions to the cream.  </li>
      <li>so I needed a quick fix for a  little upper lip fuzz.</li>
      <li>I used to purchase in drug stores but other more expensive products have taken ober and do not work as fast or as well...</li>
      <li>I find 4 minutes is not long enough for me</li>

<li> I find 4 minutes is not long enough for me</li>
<li> It removes the hair from my upper lip very well-the hair needs to be dry, and I do find a few strays that need tweezed.</li>
<li> It wouldn&#x27;t remove the hair no matter how long I left it on.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin but less than 2 minutes in and my skin was ON FIRE.</li>
<li> or I wouldn&#x27;t have used it for so long.  </li>
<li> I have pale sensitive skin, so I decided to leave it on the minimum amount of time for hair removal.  </li>
<li> The burnt marks were very obvious and every one&#x27;s first words are &amp;#34; what&#x27;s wrong with your upper lip?&amp;#34; The mark is still there after 5 days...</li>
<li> And now my skin is dry and flaky, and no amount of face mosturizer helps.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not new to me.  </li>
<li> The only saving grace to the cream was the soothing cream included which combined with generous icing lessened the burn slightly.</li>
<li> The cream tube was empty.  </li>

<li> I couldn&#x27;t find this remover at any of my local drug stores or Walmart, so I checked Amazon (like I do for everything hard to find).  </li>
<li> My upper lip hair is brown but not too thick.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I do have a little trick that I think you all should try...</li>
<li> My upper lip was painful to touch  4 minutes after applying the cream and even though I rinsed a long time, my upper lip still got burnt.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve burned my skin a few times with this regardless of the time I leave it on my face.</li>
<li> I had just used retinol and glycolic lotion on my face for a few days in a row--</li>
<li> I had bumps on my face and had to put on aloe vera everyday .</li>
<li> A few survived.  </li>
<li> The first time I used it I did feel a burning sensation but it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
<li> I have never had that problem, but the directions instruct removing a small amount of the hair removal after a few minutes to see if 1)</li>
<li> I was afraid to try a cream hair remover for my face as my skin is sensitive, and so is my sense of smell!</li>
<li> Follow the directions and it works like none other!!!</li>
<li> I ordered it online because the store I usually buy it at was out of it.  </li>
<li> but everything from waxing to threading to all other hair remover creams make me break out bad.</li>
<li> Never thought that this product would burn my upper lip so badly !!  </li>
<li> tried it again for 6 minutes and still didn&#x27;t do the job. :(</li>

    <li> It works like it says it does.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she likes it. It was a decent price and came quickly.</li>
    <li> It is gentle as it doesn&#x27;t burn but it didn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I tried doing it the 4 minutes like it said to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again for 6 minutes and still didn&#x27;t do the job. :(</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  I have bought from you before &amp; will continue to do so.  Please keep the product quality the same &amp; the price the same</li>
    <li> I read some reviews about this product and people liked it. I need to tell you that it does not work.My upper lip has burn marks and no hair came off. Please do not use this hair remover.</li>
    <li> I have used SurgiCream with the Surgi-Soothe Cream for years. Cannot say enough positive comments about this product. It removes the hair from my upper lip very well-the hair needs to be dry, and I do find a few strays that need tweezed. I find 4 minutes is not long enough for me-I leave it on 7 minutes-I am fair and freckled.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, fair skin. I had just used retinol and glycolic lotion on my face for a few days in a row--normally, I wouldn&#x27;t use a hair removal cream after this--but had unexpected plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, no burning or irritation on my upper lip (5 minutes). The smell is quite tolerable and the after-cream has a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this comes back in the three pack, subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have used Surgi-Cream Hair Remover for Face for about 30 yrs. This last time I ordered it ,&lt;br /&gt;It was more gentle. Thanks for the improvement. My skin burns easily &amp; this time did not.&lt;br /&gt;Joan Wyatt</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and it works like none other!!! I have used surgi cream for many years and neber lets me down. I used to purchase in drug stores but other more expensive products have taken ober and do not work as fast or as well...shipping was fast and I will continue to order !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years so it&#x27;s not new to me.  Obviously I like it or I wouldn&#x27;t have used it for so long.  I ordered it online because the store I usually buy it at was out of it.  I&#x27;ve never had any problem with this product.  It removes all the hair very quickly and easily and provides a cream to put on your face after removing hair. The scent is very mild.  I have many allergies and that scent has never bothered me.  It&#x27;s very creamy and is good to moisture the skin after hair removal.  I have recommended this facial hair removal to friends and they have liked it except one person did have some breakout after using it.  I have never had that problem, but the directions instruct removing a small amount of the hair removal after a few minutes to see if 1) some hair has been removed and 2) there is no bad reaction to the removal cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order came very quickly and there was no damage to the carton  at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If necessary, I won&#x27;t hesitate to order this again from Amazon if my store is out of it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this remover at any of my local drug stores or Walmart, so I checked Amazon (like I do for everything hard to find).  This remover is gentle enough for my seriously sensitive skin, works great, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s had a layer peeled off!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for many years now...can&#x27;t live without it. I am very sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product is what the Transplant team recommended I use after having surgery. It is gentle. I was elated when I found it online because it is no longer sold in stores. Needless to say------I love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Igot this for my mom,she loves it because of her facial hairs she say it makes her skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER STOP SELLING IT.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to try a cream hair remover for my face as my skin is sensitive, and so is my sense of smell! This product had the best reviews, so I bought it. It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it&#x27;s tolerable -- a great improvement over the creams I&#x27;ve tried in the past! ... and it works very well to remove unwanted facial hair. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Seller was great and items arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so old fashion but so easy. :)</li>
    <li> Following the directions carefully is crucial.  If you do that, you won&#x27;t find another product at this price that works as well.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores these past few years and am thrilled to have it available online.</li>
    <li> I bought the cream after seeing the good reviews saying that this is gentle. Never thought that this product would burn my upper lip so badly !!  My upper lip was painful to touch  4 minutes after applying the cream and even though I rinsed a long time, my upper lip still got burnt. The burnt marks were very obvious and every one&#x27;s first words are &amp;#34; what&#x27;s wrong with your upper lip?&amp;#34; The mark is still there after 5 days...wish they could go away sooner</li>
    <li> Works well for me.  I am a red head and frequently have reactions to the cream.  This product does not cause reactions for me.  Most of the hair came off easily.  A few survived.  Works well overall.</li>
    <li> Wow. If there was a rating lower than 1 star, this product would get that. I use Veet&#x27;s gel cream for depilation but I was on a trip so I needed a quick fix for a  little upper lip fuzz. Seeing the price and reading rave reviews for other Surgi products, I purchased it. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin but less than 2 minutes in and my skin was ON FIRE. There was no reaction on the patch I tested on my arm beforehand but my upper lip was bright red and bumpy and ultra sensitive to the touch. The only saving grace to the cream was the soothing cream included which combined with generous icing lessened the burn slightly. My upper lip is fuzz free and healed now but for 2 days it looked like I had road rash on my face. The only plus side to this hair remover is that over a decade ago I had some wicked facial windburn from a bad winter which left a discolored ring around my mouth, this product managed to completely erase that from my upper lip along with most, if not all hair and some healthy skin as well. Could not return soon enough.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t burn me and did the job! It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, and lasts a long time. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> I have tried many ways to remove my little blond hairs on my upper lip. but everything from waxing to threading to all other hair remover creams make me break out bad. This is the ONLY one that works to remove all of the hairs and leave my skin in good condition after i&#x27;m done. I do have a little trick that I think you all should try...after you remove the cream and wash your face try putting coconut oil on the spot you just put the remover on. It instantly cools my skin and makes the burn go away much better then the cream they give and coconut oil does not make your skin break out. I have been using it as my moisturizer for years now with no breakouts. I buy the virgin organic coconut oil. They sell it at most grocery stores now and here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have pale sensitive skin, so I decided to leave it on the minimum amount of time for hair removal.  It removed the hair just fine, but it started coming back after only a couple days, not a couple weeks as advertised.  Also, it burned my skin, leaving it red and sensitive to touch.  And now my skin is dry and flaky, and no amount of face mosturizer helps.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order through amazon, but I have to review surgi cream because I think it deserves a better rating.  I am 25 years old and have been using it since 6th grade. I use it for my upper lip hair only. It gently removes all of my lip hair easily and doesn&#x27;t come back fuller or darker like some people say happens when you shave or wax. My upper lip hair is brown but not too thick. The first time I used it I did feel a burning sensation but it wasn&#x27;t bad and I didn&#x27;t have any marks from it. I honestly love it and I almost had a heart attack when Walmart stopped selling it. I thought it was discontinued so I started using the one Walmart was selling which was Sally Hansen I believe. Omg it sucked. It wouldn&#x27;t remove the hair no matter how long I left it on. Luckily I later found it at a beauty supply store. The price is great also, my bottle always lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years.  It does a good job, although some stubble may remain and then you need to wax or tweeze.  I find using the stop grow that comes with it daily helps contain growth.  Also I use progesterone cream, take Estroven,  MACA powder,  and age appropriate vitamins  to help with hormone balance issues and  proper sustenance issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve burned my skin a few times with this regardless of the time I leave it on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this isn&#x27;t any more gentle than what&#x27;s already on the market. Also, make sure that you don&#x27;t have a blemish or so much as a scratch on your face when you apply it, it will turn into a raw sore that takes quite a bit of time to heal. It does remove the hair though.</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitve skin do not use. I used this and almost cried. I had bumps on my face and had to put on aloe vera everyday . CHEMICAL BURN. Yep so if you are sensitve like me do not use. PS the hairs were still there . BLAH!</li>
    <li> Excellent-does the job well, very pleased with the product as I was in the past.,</li>
    <li> I just used it and it is still the same good product that I bought in the drugstore for years.  Removed all the facial hair in 6 minutes without burning or redness.  It&#x27;s much better than Olay or any of the other known brands.  I am very pleased to be able to order it thru amazon.com.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t remove any facial hair and it burned my skin. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> When I received this product.  It was clear the box had been opened.  The cream tube was empty.  You could just tell it had been used and returned by someone.  On the plus side,  I bought this same product @ Rite-Aide.  And it works great.</li>
