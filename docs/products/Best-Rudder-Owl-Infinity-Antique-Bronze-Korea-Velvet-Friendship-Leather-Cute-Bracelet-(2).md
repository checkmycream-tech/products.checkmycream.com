      <li>her dad fixed it once</li>
      <li>Cute bracelet, big for my wrist and not easily modified.</li>
      <li>but the picture made the bracelet look so fit and the charms look bigger when in reality it was too big and the charms were super small and not so flashy and cute</li>
      <li>but the second time it broke it could not be fixed.</li>
      <li>Only issue is that it sit crooked on my wrist, so i have to move it back to the center of my wrist pretty often.</li>

    <li> The bracelet looks really cool, I was expected it to hook together magnetically, but it didn&#x27;t and it was really difficult to put on by myself. Also one of the bands broke a week after I got it. Have someone else put it on for you</li>

    <li> This is a stunning beautiful piece.  I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!  Nice quality, much prettier in person!</li>
    <li> Should have a picture of the clasp &amp; chain because I thought it was a wrap bracelet &amp; it wasn&#x27;t.</li>

    <li> Item arrived as described but broke within minutes.  Luckily I know how to repair jewelry.  Not surprised by the quality.</li>
    <li> I understand that these are cheap but they are very cheap made. After waiting forevvvver to receive it in the mail (over a month). IT WAS ALREADY BROKEN! Therefore, I cant even wear it. Waste of time. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This bracelet I think is much more cuter in person than in this picture. I absolutely Love love love it!</li>
