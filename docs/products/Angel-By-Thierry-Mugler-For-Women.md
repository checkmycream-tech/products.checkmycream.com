<li> Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>

<li> Smell was not strong at all.</li>
<li> I have purchased this product in the past thru a retail store and wanted to try the product thru Amazon.</li>
<li> It is thick and creamy.</li>
<li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  </li>
<li> Maybe we just got a bad batch of cream here.</li>

    <li> Angel body cream is without doubt the finest skin care cream on the market. Not only is it non-greasy, it absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it soft and smooth. The scent is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff for my mom and she loves it.  She also says that it will probably last her forever.  I feel like it was one of the better gifts i have given.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mom for Christmas, and I had to try a little after she unwrapped it. This has a very creamy texture and the scent is heavenly.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift.  It is her &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; fragrance, and this is such a nice product to use plus the benefit of layering the Angel fragrance.</li>
    <li> been an angel fan since 1996...this cream is awesome...it will last forever, highly recommend to all...it is the best..i love it</li>
    <li> Angel is everything the reviews said it would be. I love the fragrance and I get so many compliments on it. The body cream is a light blue color which is an added treat for my eyes as well. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my sister, her favourite fragrance. Love the pricing!  She hasn&#x27;t been able to buy it where she lives.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the Angel products and did not have the body cream. When she opened this present at Christmas, she was thrilled to see her thoughtful husband had surprised her with body cream. I was pleased with the price and fast shipping plus everything arrived in tact. I also love the scent the cream leaves on my spouse!</li>
    <li> Angel is elderly &amp; invasive w/its powders &amp; patchouli driving caustic sugary mud.  Try something fresher &amp; lighter that reveals your personality rather than acting as an olfactory bullhorn forewarning your arrival a half mile in advance.</li>
    <li> For anyone who loves Angel purchasing through Amazon is the only way to go. There was no tracking info available so I worried for a few days, however when it finally arrived it was in perfect condition. This fragrance makes me smile. I always get compliments when I wear this classic fragrance. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is thick and creamy. It makes my skin smooth and soft. I5 makes my skin smell divine.</li>
    <li> Product appeared to be old. Smell was not strong at all. I have been wearing Angel since 1995. And it could not be returned!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product in the past thru a retail store and wanted to try the product thru Amazon. Much to my surprise my wife asked my why I purchased this product on line. The product does not have the same smell as Angel purchased locally. Maybe we just got a bad batch of cream here. I will continue to use Amazon to purchase items as online is the only way to shop.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used Angel for years and I absolutely love it. .  This body cream is so fragrant and contains so much shea butter you can  actually use it on your face if you choose.  I used to buy it at Bloomingdales, but I never will again.  I saved so much money on this product I intend to purchase another as a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday.  Great deal on an amazingly skin softening and fragrant cream!</li>
    <li> From the first day I used Angel, I knew it was a fragrance I would wear for many years.  I continue to get so many compliments.  The price was fabulous at amazon.  The picture shown is the old container.  The body cream comes in a prettier jar now.  It is truly a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and she really enjoyed it.  She usually uses just the spray bottle, but is thoroughly enjoying the cream as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it myself, but the person that I gave it to was very pleased and happy to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and would not change a thing.  I am truly an Angel Lover!</li>
