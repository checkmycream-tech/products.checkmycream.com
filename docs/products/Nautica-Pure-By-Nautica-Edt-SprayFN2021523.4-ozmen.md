    <li> Good cologne, cheap price, fast shipping.</li>

    <li> Just recently found this scent and i love it. It stays on my clothes for mostly the whole day. It&#x27;s also a plus that my wife loves it ;)</li>
    <li> Just be careful who you buy it from! If you get a \\&quot;tester\\&quot; bottle, send it back! As for people mentioning it doesn&#x27;t last long are incorrect. It gets better through out the day. Lots of \\&quot;stores\\&quot; on here are selling knock offs. Mine had the same scent as at the counter of Macy&#x27;s and last allllll niiiiight long and the women love it! :)</li>
    <li> Great value for the money. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> not the best fragance..</li>
    <li> Name says it all. This is very clean and not overpowering, especially good at night. Lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent deal, the quality goes beyond expectations. I use it for everyday, if you&#x27;re in your 30&#x27;s this is the right one.</li>

    <li> great price. Unopened package.</li>
    <li> Bought yo replace my dwindling supply. Recommended buy if you&#x27;re looking for a simple and pleasant everyday scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nautica Voyage for some time now and looking for something a little different. I always got compliments while wearing Voyage and I hope it works out even better with Pure.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it but ordered anyways. GLAD I DID.. Great scent &amp; last all day with only 2 sprays. Ordered another one just to keep as backup. Female coworkers love the scent and are always complimentary.</li>
    <li> It last all day. Only needed a few sprays. Its a light scent that is not to over bearing. The ladies at work like it...</li>
    <li> Should have taken advice of reviews. No scent! Scent last for a whopping 10 minutes! Watered down! In case this is the real thing, Nautica should give it a decent burial. Quit selling the stuff.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. I will buy this product again in future for myself and also as a gift. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got it love will order again</li>

    <li> This can&#x27;t be the real Nautica Pure.  Unless it smells better in magazine ads?  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again!  It&#x27;s not very good smelling.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the &amp;#34;worst&amp;#34; scent I have ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like any kind of fragrance , more like rubbing alcohol with a nasty kind of perfume mixed in it. Only lasts about 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to send this back and exchange it for Pure Nautica Discovery* at least I know and trust that scent!</li>
    <li> Great cologne! thanks</li>
    <li> CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL</li>
    <li> Very unusual fragrance I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This cologne is not bad, the smell is pretty good, but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m a big nautica fan and i purchase this cologne to use it as my everyday cologne. The smell was pretty good, but the smell did not last long.</li>
