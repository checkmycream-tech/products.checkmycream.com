### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great item!</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>Gave this as a gift and my friend loved it!  </li>
      <li>Had them before, they wear out after about 6 years, had to get more!</li>
      <li>These brushes have a VERY STRONG rubber smell.  </li>
      <li>It also has a very strong chemical smell that got in my hair and in my purse.  </li>
      <li>You would be very justified to wonder what the manufacturer has used for materials, and whether or not they are harmful to your health.</li>
      <li>Also as many ave saying they stink something fierce.</li>
      <li>Would buy again :)</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>Work as designed but there&#x27;s a strong chemical odor that emanates from them</li>
      <li>Strong chemical smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of -</li>
      <li>Brushes have a strong rubber odor.  </li>
      <li>The rubber that is used to hold the bristles in place has a strong odor like that of an automobile tire.</li>
      <li>These brushes work very well and fold up nicely.  </li>
      <li>They look like they&#x27;re made of cheap plastic, and they probably are, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect how well they can brush through even tangled hair.</li>
      <li>bad.&lt;br /&gt;A very useful travelling brush.</li>
      <li>Compact and good enough.</li>
      <li>mirrors are okay for a quick touch up but don&#x27;t expect to put on your whole face with them.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;and need a quick brushing.</li>
      <li>I expect this will wear out the cheap hinge very soon</li>
      <li>The brushes have a distinct petroleum order that cannot be diffused.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was pictured.</li>
      <li>Really a bunch of junk!</li>
      <li>These brushes absolutely stink of rubber!</li>
      <li>Will shop for one where I can smell them first</li>
      <li>At first I was puzzled.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty overpowering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad because they  are otherwise a good brush and fold up nicely.</li>
      <li>Smell is still just too much to deal with.</li>
      <li>However, like other reviews on this product, the smell is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptic at first, especially when you look at these hair brushes at first glance.</li>
      <li>Seems cheaply made otherwise which I expected for the price and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>small enough for my purse, large enough to do a great job on wind blown hair, especially in winter when I wear a hat</li>
      <li>The brush broke the first time I used it, and although it snapped back together it breaks every time.  </li>
      <li>These brushes are cheaply made - the brush part takes effort to collapse, and the frame around it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>The smell is wearing off now that they aren&#x27;t in the packaging and have aired them out.</li>
      <li>I put them outside on the porch for two days in hopes of reducing the smell and so far, it has not worked.  </li>

<li> Shame on the seller to pushing such crap, that&#x27;s going to be packaged in boxes, driven around in trucks, ending up in a landfill somewhere, killing an animal or two.</li>
<li> These brushes have a TERRIBLE chemical-rubber smell that can be smelled from several feet away.</li>
<li> These brushes have such a horrible smell in the plastic that they are unuseable if the smell does not go away.</li>
<li> Not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them though.</li>
<li> They are disgusting.  </li>
<li> Nasty.</li>
<li> But the worst part is horrible smell.</li>
<li> Worst smelling product I have ever not used.  </li>

    <li> Compact and good enough.</li>
    <li> These brushes have a TERRIBLE chemical-rubber smell that can be smelled from several feet away. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m carrying that in my purse or travel bag!</li>
    <li> The plastic hinge slips apart every time the brush is closed.  I expect this will wear out the cheap hinge very soon but time will tell.  Also, and this may be a little picky but these brushes reek of moth balls.  Even after dousing them in perfume they are audaciously pungent.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> These were recommended to me by a forum that deals with traveling to conventions. I was skeptic at first, especially when you look at these hair brushes at first glance. They look like they&#x27;re made of cheap plastic, and they probably are, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect how well they can brush through even tangled hair. As a woman with long hair, I was worried that these just wouldn&#x27;t get the job done, and they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirrors are okay for a quick touch up but don&#x27;t expect to put on your whole face with them.</li>
    <li> Not the quality that I had expected.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and the room began to smell like a tire shop. At first I was puzzled. &amp;#34;Where is that smell coming from?&amp;#34; I thought as I ran the tines through my geezer hair. It was that tiny, convenient foldable brush that smells of burning rubber. I had visions of recycled Mexican Haraches serving as the unlimited source of raw material for these quite inexpensive items. Nasty. The one star is for prompt delivery of this recycled pollution.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 and seem to be just what I ordered HOWEVER, they both smelled like they were just removed from an asphalt pit.&lt;br /&gt;Even after two days soaking in soapy water and air dried for a week the order remains.&lt;br /&gt;Not something I want to use with an odor like that.</li>
    <li> The brushes have a distinct petroleum order that cannot be diffused.</li>
    <li> Ewww this smells like some toxic fuel dump when you open the package! I&#x27;m airing them out, outside hoping the smell goes away. Seems cheaply made otherwise which I expected for the price and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Over two weeks out on my balcony to air out and have exposure to sun. Smell is still just too much to deal with. $10 down the drain. Will shop for one where I can smell them first</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest possible item.  The brush broke the first time I used it, and although it snapped back together it breaks every time.  It also has a very strong chemical smell that got in my hair and in my purse.  Really a bunch of junk!</li>
    <li> Flimsy. Handle broke immediately. SMELLED!</li>
    <li> Smell terriblly like rubber!  How can anyone put this to their hair?  I kept wash it many time, still have that bad smell. I ended up have to throw them to trash can!!!!!</li>
    <li> the brush is fine but they have a terrible smell</li>
    <li> Worst smelling product I have ever not used.  Left them outside for over a week, ran them through my dishwasher, nothing is helping to get rid of the smell.  They are headed for the trash.  They get one star because a star is required to submit this review.</li>
    <li> Brushes have a strong rubber odor.  Unusable.</li>
    <li> I have owned these types of brushes in the past, and have found them to be very convenient. I used to keep one in my briefcase. These, though, are not like ones that you may have owned before. They are heavily cost-reduced, and are made out of the chintziest plastic. So chintzy, in fact, that the hinges come apart when you try to fold them. The rubber that is used to hold the bristles in place has a strong odor like that of an automobile tire. You would be very justified to wonder what the manufacturer has used for materials, and whether or not they are harmful to your health. Shame on Amazon for allowing this substandard garbage on their website.</li>
    <li> OK. There are cheaper ones that may be the same product. It does have a bit of a smell, but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;A very useful travelling brush.</li>
    <li> I have bought brushes like these before. These stink!! Literally!! I had to throw them away. They had the smell of burning tar. I didn&#x27;t bother returning. I didn&#x27;t want the postal service to suffer again. Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Love these. Had them before, they wear out after about 6 years, had to get more!</li>
    <li> These brushes are cheaply made - the brush part takes effort to collapse, and the frame around it won&#x27;t last long. One brush I received appeared to have been used. But the worst part is horrible smell. This product should not have been made, and should not be sold. Shame on the seller to pushing such crap, that&#x27;s going to be packaged in boxes, driven around in trucks, ending up in a landfill somewhere, killing an animal or two.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. One for me and one for my wife!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Work as designed but there&#x27;s a strong chemical odor that emanates from them and it&#x27;s pretty overpowering. I&#x27;ve had these for quite a few months now and they still smell up my purse.</li>
    <li> These brushes absolutely stink of rubber! I soaked them in dishwashing soap for two days and they still stink.&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away. Don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and my friend loved it!  Especially getting two!!  Would buy again :)</li>
    <li> These brushes have such a horrible smell in the plastic that they are unuseable if the smell does not go away.</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well and fold up nicely.  However, like other reviews on this product, the smell is overwhelming.  I left them upstairs over night in hopes that they would air out; however, the next morning, I could smell them from downstairs!  I put them outside on the porch for two days in hopes of reducing the smell and so far, it has not worked.  I&#x27;m going to leave them outside for a week and maybe spray them with a room freshener or something but if the smell continues, they will go in the trash.  I&#x27;d look for something else that is compact and doesn&#x27;t smell.  It&#x27;s too bad because they  are otherwise a good brush and fold up nicely.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Durable enough for my purposes.  Strong chemical smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of - I soaked in vinegar water and washed with soap and water, but they still smell slightly. Not so bad that I won&#x27;t use them though.</li>
    <li> I wish i had read the reviews.  these brushes smell like tar.  forget it.</li>
    <li> These brushes have a VERY STRONG rubber smell.  They are disgusting.  I even tried soaking them in dishwashing detergent for a few days and they still smell. DO NOT BUY THESE BRUSHES.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was pictured. Both came together and packaged well. Only downside is the plastic they are made of smells like gasoline. The smell is wearing off now that they aren&#x27;t in the packaging and have aired them out.</li>
    <li> Mine seem to have been assembled backwards as they do not fold up fully - the mirror just hits the brush. Also as many ave saying they stink something fierce.</li>
    <li> Great item! small enough for my purse, large enough to do a great job on wind blown hair, especially in winter when I wear a hat&lt;br /&gt;and need a quick brushing. And as a stocking stuffer for daughter.</li>
