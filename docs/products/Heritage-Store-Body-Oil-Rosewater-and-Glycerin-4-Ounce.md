<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for my skin regimen!!!</li>
    <li> The product is quite satisfactory.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to use in a natural hair care recipe for curly hair. It leaves my sons curly hair looking and smelling fabulous. In a spray bottle mix equal parts of this and water with a small amount of witch hazel. Spray down those curls, tame with fingers, and let air dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It leaves a sticky residue-like feeling after application, but it does cleanse well as a toner.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have troublesome skin (acne, but very dry) and this stuff works wonders! I have been trying to go the more natural route to see if there is any difference in my skin. I originally purchased it because I read somewhere that rose water/oil has antiseptic properties that can help skin. I put this stuff in a little spray bottle and spray it on my face right after I wash it; I don&#x27;t even need to apply moisturizer anymore. I swear it has helped my acne subside. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> liked this product. worked great with my natural hair care products.</li>
    <li> I like it. It has a strong scent of roses,  It feels like water, nothing oily about it. After a good face wash I like to pat my face with this rosewater and it smells and feels so refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, third time I&#x27;ve bought this!</li>
    <li> The product smells heavenly.  Very nice service, packaging was not the best. It is not a mister top and comes with tape across the lid that pulled the label off.  It arrived only partially full, but service was polite and refunded in full without me requesting or expecting that. A good company to deal with and that will win another chance at my business.</li>
    <li> Smell was too strong had to put into trash.</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in my local stores. Love to put a little on linens...bring back childhood memories.</li>
    <li> Good value, very nice product.  Be careful, bottle may leak...from cap.</li>
    <li> Love this product to use as a toner. It has mild rose scent that leaves your skin feeling refreshed when used as a toner.</li>
    <li> i thought this was going to be oily, but it came and it is like water! not a bad thing, but i was suprised.  feels great to splash on my face and neck and arms whenever im feeling meh.</li>
    <li> Feels really smooth on the skin. Very light. I used it after a shower and in my hair, and in my kids hair and skin as well. Smells very light and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> love this product. keeps my skin clean and smooth</li>
    <li> There are a lot of rosewaters out there and this one is my favorite.  It smells heavenly and really hydrates your skin.  Perfect for the summer when your skin is exposed to the sun and excellent in the winter when your skin is parched from frigid climates.  It works great for setting your makeup also.  I spray it all over my body!</li>
    <li> I used this for two types of DIY conconctions. Once DIY hair and DIY skin lotions. The DIY hair had a mix of cayenne pepper and Dr. Adorable Peppermint Castor oil. I yielded 2.5&#x27; of new growth within 3 weeks doing the greenhouse method. For the DIY lotion, I used several oils, lotions with this rosewater and glycerin water and added epsom salt and have had the best exfoliating lotion ever. I have no dry skin on my body. My skin is smooth and the glycerin has allowed the lotions to enter into the skin wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is. Smells like Roses, made of glycerin water. I use it to cut lotions.</li>
    <li> i bought this because someone told me that glycerine and rosewater helps eliminate acne, but his did not works for me.&lt;br /&gt;on the plus side it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent of this oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell like pure essential rose oil was used.</li>
    <li> The very very best product ever. A perfect hint rose water. A must have !!</li>
    <li> This is high quality rose water-- made with actual roses and not just rose scent. I mix it with vitamin C powder to make my own C serum treatment, and my skin has been looking really great. You can also use this ros&amp;eacute; water as a toner or a light moisturizer. Really fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders in helping soften my feet. I was skeptical at first but this really works.</li>
    <li> always love this product</li>
    <li> I put this in a small spray bottle and spritz my face with it.  It is so refreshing.  I plan to buy some more.  I do recommend that you empty this bottle into a spray bottle to use.  At first I just splashed some in my hand and face, but that seemed wasteful as the rosewater ending up in the floor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as a facial toner per my 85 year old grandmother&#x27;s beautiful skin. She swears by this and Glycerin is the main ingredient in so many expensive products these days. It&#x27;s too heavy for me to use on it&#x27;s own, and I like the the smell of these two mixed together. I couldn&#x27;t find it for a while at my health store, and I would make my own mixture then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use on a cotton ball or directly on my face before moisturizer and makeup. Works great for dry winter skin and getting a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Natural ingredients and skin feels soft when used as a toner after washing the face. Have been using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Natural and effective. Very lightweight. Does not cause acne. I&#x27;ll never use regular moisturizer again.</li>
    <li> Love rose water!  Great smell!  Great price.  You cant go wrong with this item.</li>
    <li> I used to enjoy the delightful scent as my grandmother used rose water and glycerin. As I have very sensitive skin, finding facial products can be a challenge. This winter as I searched for a protector for dry,harsh weather I found Hertiages Rosewater and Glycerin. Very shortly after twice a day use my face was showing the benefits of toning ,moisture, and a healthy glow. Now I use it as a base under my tinted moisturizer for an even application . I have purchased products from Heritage before and the quality as always is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the summer to use in place of lotion, which gets sticky in the humidity. I&#x27;ve continued to use it as a face toner in the winter, because it conditions my skin so well. I have acne prone skin, and my acne medications often dry it out. This product soothes my face without causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> Good for your skin, works great in my lotions :)</li>
    <li> I probably made a mistake by ordering this product--but that isn&#x27;t the fault of the product.  I was looking for glycerin to add to some shaving soap that isn&#x27;t quite lubricating enough for my taste.  As I use mostly unscented products, I thought the rosewater might be a nice addition.  Clearly I was taking a risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the scent isn&#x27;t my cup-o-tea, but mostly I found this isn&#x27;t really a glycerin you would add to a lather.  It really is a post-shave product.  So with that in mind, it is probably OK--maybe better.  But it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I love this subtle fragrance. It feels wonderful as a body splash to refresh and revive. Can be used in place of lotion.</li>
    <li> great product works great...</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner.  I mix it in a separate bottle and use half of it and half Bragg apple cider vinegar.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell of the vinegar and it does disappear quickly.  My face is clean, fresh and my pores have gotten smaller.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer to use after face washes. My routine in Clearasil Sensative Daily Wash, Epsom salt mask, and then Rosewater and Glycerin. It keeps the skin blemish free and soft!  It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. It does not cause breakouts. It give that extra glow and it has a fresh and natural smell.</li>
    <li> Glycerin is wonderful. The scent is lovely and heavenly. This was my first time to buy glycerin, and I will buy this scent again! It has multiple uses; and I am a novice right now. It was wonderful to apply to skin. Moisturized really well and smelled divine. I even used it on my face. I have heard it is a wonderful base for making lotions and other home made products. I loved this glycerin. It came fast in wonderful packaging. Totally a great experience.</li>
    <li> Just like I expected.  A good product.</li>
    <li> Love this rosewater and glycerin. I highly recommend this as a toner during the harsh winter months</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this version of rosewater and glycerin! The rose smell is authentic (i use it as aromatherapy and as a body mist) but the glycerin really soothes itchy, dry and irritated skin. A must for before you put on makeup. Great for when the air is really really dry and you want to moisten up you face for a dewey appearance.  If you want more LOVE in your life keep yourself misted &amp; this does the trick.  Rose is a great attractant for more love. People always seem to lighten up &amp; chill out when I wear this. The smell does evaporate but if you mist your hair and clothes it lingers longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this smells.  Will not but again.</li>
    <li> I use as toner and also as facial mist.. It is great for dry skin.. I have very dry and sensitive skin but this does not irritate my skin</li>
    <li> I love rosewater and glycerin! Use to use it years ago........beautifully delicate rose fragrance which I use on my face, mix with lotion and face cream and have even used it on my hair when I want a touch of moisture in order to braid my hair for waves.</li>
    <li> it is very good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product I am going to have this product sent to my house monthly.. The smell is so refreshing</li>
    <li> This work good as a face toner if u mix half rosewater and glycerin and half apple cider vinegar ..Its smells great and it keep your face even toned ..Been using for about 2 years now</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own toner. I have oily skin at the age of 40. I used the homemade toner for 2 weeks and my face broke out more. The recipe was equal part rosewater glycerine and apple cider vinegar. The rose scent helps cover the vinegar smell but my face broke out more. I may try again since it was a season change and there could be other factors causing the breakout. Not sure it will work for me and I have no other need for this item.</li>
