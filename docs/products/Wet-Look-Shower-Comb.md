      <li>i love it!</li>

      <li>These combs are handy and are being used in a &amp;#34;Cosmetology&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love this comb and it&#x27;s by far the best detangling comb that I have used.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>as soon as i received it I automatically decided to test it out and as reported it didnt stress my hair whatsoever. :)</li>
      <li>I am sure I will be buying more as the class goes on.</li>
      <li>i love this comb.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more than that.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Ok, it&#x27;s just a comb</li>
      <li>I love the curved handle which makes it easy for me to use while detangling in the shower.</li>
      <li>Its oh so gentle and does a good job of getting my knots untangled without tugging and ripping my hair.  </li>
      <li>last rule is great.</li>
      <li>fantastic idea...</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve discovered that I can use this comb to loosen up my style after my hair has dried, and I don&#x27;t get the frizzies and (best of all</li>
      <li>Handy and quite reasonably priced</li>
      <li>I was hoping that after using a couple of weeks, it will eventually smooth out.  </li>
      <li>So far so good....  </li>
      <li>I bought this one to replace one I lost, then found the original, but I like this one a lot.</li>
      <li>There is another seller that is selling the exact comb in 3-pack for about a dollar more.  </li>
      <li>Works great in my long curly hair for detangling without pulling a bunch out.</li>
      <li>i love this comb so much i  bought three.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell that it&#x27;s a lot more gentle on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Oh and even better its very affordable</li>
      <li>and I just might buy another, just in case I loose it (how many combs have we lost in our own house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I went to my local drugstore and got another one for a dollar more and a lot better quality plastic.</li>
      <li>I specifically asked for a certain color (which should have indicated to the seller to contact me if it wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
      <li>comb was worth every penny</li>
      <li>/curly and this glides right on through with conditioner in the shower.  </li>
      <li>right.  </li>
      <li>I already hair this comb and love how easily it glides through my coily wet hair.</li>
      <li>I thought the little balls at the end would make it less effective with detangling at the root, but it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>There is a also a pretty strict rule that you don&#x27;t brush your hair once it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>They are great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
      <li>its so much work.  </li>
      <li>It really detangled my hair and it lasted even when I got out of the shower and comb through my damp hair, it was so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sure that that is what the description stated, So much that I even put in the details to ensure I get a pink.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know what more to say about a comb, other than, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, wavy, colored (henna), and about shoulder length long.</li>
      <li>Ironically, it is exactly the same one that I have in my shower right now.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>While I was in the shower washing my hair I reached for my normal waide tooth comb and remembered, &amp;#34;wait</li>
      <li>really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is what held me back at first</li>
      <li>I am not satisfied as I find this too pricey for ONE comb and the service could have been better..</li>
      <li>great comb for long wet hair !!!!!!</li>
      <li>(Hint, I&#x27;m too old to play Gretel, and I&#x27;m not a boy, so I can&#x27;t play</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and my hair is getting thicker and if it keeps growing I can see where this comb will become obsolete for me because the teeth are not that far apart</li>
      <li>I am natural</li>
      <li>Use on my shoulder-length naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have long wavy hair that gets very tangled</li>
      <li>I use this comb before I shampoo to clear all the knots and then again when I deep condition.  </li>
      <li>definitely recommend this comb for all my fellow natural ladies.  </li>
      <li>I recently decided to wear my hari natural.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far and felt compelled to write a review after just one use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible but not great either.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s not terrible but not great either.  </li>
<li> So far they seem durable, the handle could be a little longer.  </li>
<li> My hair is very course and hard.  </li>
<li> Overall money well spent.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this style of comb ever since a hairdresser told me they are less likely to contribute to split ends vs. a regular brush.</li>
<li> Any time I brush my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it turns frizzy and looks like I&#x27;m seeking a part in Hansel and Gretel.</li>
<li> , b/c I can go to my local bss and buy a comb for less than $2.  </li>
<li> The comb has a small cut in the top prong which I&#x27;m afraid will damage my fragile hair</li>
<li> so I guess it does the trick of detangling with minimal breakage.  </li>
<li> I use this on my daughter, and we no longer go to war when coming her wet hair.</li>
<li> Part of the CG method involves combing through you hair in the shower (think Wen) with a wide tooth comb.</li>
<li> I just spent $6 on a comb that&#x27;s supposed to work&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other wide tooth combs (in the shower)</li>
<li> I have what is categorized as tpe 4c hair, if not higher.  </li>
<li> So even if this was the price for one and the details weren&#x27;t amended (questionable) as this would not be the first time this happened.</li>
<li> Very rough edges, they hurt.  </li>
<li> My hair is past the middle of my back and thick</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t end up with half my hair on the comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (My fault for not reading it all, but deceiving none the less.)</li>
<li> A little flimsier than I was hoping for.  </li>
<li> A few months ago, I started noticing that I was losing a lot of hair, and switched to the Curly Girl method to see if that would help.</li>
<li> Quality sucks.</li>
<li> No longer do I feel as if my hair is being ripped or broken off.</li>
<li> In addition to the poor quality, I was expecting to get 2 as pictured.  </li>
<li> *Way to expensive for just one comb!</li>
<li> and I HATE combing, detangling, brushing, etc my hair.  </li>

    <li> i love this comb so much i  bought three.  i have one upstairs, one downstairs, one in my purse.  i have red hair and it is course.  this comb no breakage, no damage.  i love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s just a comb right.  NO it&#x27;s more than that.  I am natural my hair texture is a 4b/4c and I HATE combing, detangling, brushing, etc my hair.  its so much work.  I&#x27;ve used other wide tooth combs (in the shower) but this one really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is what held me back at first, b/c I can go to my local bss and buy a comb for less than $2.  But when I read the good reviews I figured I try it but I was still skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my comb arrived I still had my protective style in.  While I was in the shower washing my hair I reached for my normal waide tooth comb and remembered, &amp;#34;wait I just spent $6 on a comb that&#x27;s supposed to work&amp;#34;  I jumped out of the shower grabbed my comb from my purse ( I hide a lot of my amazon purchases from my husband) jumped back in the shower and started to comb and detangle my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy oh boy, this comb worked GREAT.  I could not believe it.  It really detangled my hair and it lasted even when I got out of the shower and comb through my damp hair, it was so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb was worth every penny and I just might buy another, just in case I loose it (how many combs have we lost in our own house).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this comb for all my fellow natural ladies.  It works.</li>
    <li> The description says \\&quot;ships in assorted colors\\&quot; but mine arrived the same color as in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this style of comb ever since a hairdresser told me they are less likely to contribute to split ends vs. a regular brush.</li>
    <li> great comb for long wet hair !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter!</li>
    <li> I love this comb! I have relaxed hair and after a wash and adding in my leave ins my hair detangles so effortlessly with this comb. I even use it throughout the week when combing through my hair. No longer do I feel as if my hair is being ripped or broken off.</li>

    <li> When I ordered this I thought i was getting two combs. I am sure that that is what the description stated, So much that I even put in the details to ensure I get a pink. But I not only was it One comb i got it was purple. So even if this was the price for one and the details weren&#x27;t amended (questionable) as this would not be the first time this happened. I specifically asked for a certain color (which should have indicated to the seller to contact me if it wasn&#x27;t available. I am not satisfied as I find this too pricey for ONE comb and the service could have been better..</li>
    <li> Good comb for shower. You only get ONE, picture makes it seem like you are getting two.....</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  Works great when combing tangled hair out in the shower!  Fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> Quality sucks. Very rough edges, they hurt.  I was hoping that after using a couple of weeks, it will eventually smooth out.  NOPE! In addition to the poor quality, I was expecting to get 2 as pictured.  I guess it was just as well that I got just one since it&#x27;s like using a nail comb.</li>
    <li> What a great comb!  The paint on the tips feel like fingers, not scratchy in any way at all.  My hair is past the middle of my back and thick/curly and this glides right on through with conditioner in the shower.  I run my fingers through my hair before showering just to get some initial knots out.  I have only used it once so far and felt compelled to write a review after just one use.  That&#x27;s how good it is.  :)</li>
    <li> Handy and quite reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I recently decided to wear my hari natural.  I have what is categorized as tpe 4c hair, if not higher.  My hair is very course and hard.  I use this comb before I shampoo to clear all the knots and then again when I deep condition.  Its oh so gentle and does a good job of getting my knots untangled without tugging and ripping my hair.  I know some of my caucasian friends use this too so I guess it does the trick of detangling with minimal breakage.  the best part of this comb is I no longer have to worry about trying to find a spot for this in the shower.  the hook on the end allow me to hook the comb either on the shower curtain pole or on the shower head; fantastic idea...Oh and even better its very affordable</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The hook seems to get in the way of combing depending on the angle that I need to use, but it can be worked around.  I&#x27;m natural and my hair is getting thicker and if it keeps growing I can see where this comb will become obsolete for me because the teeth are not that far apart --it&#x27;s already a struggle sometimes, but it&#x27;ll do for now.</li>
    <li> I probably have a dozen of these, spread all over the house. They are great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> These combs are handy and are being used in a &amp;#34;Cosmetology&amp;#34; class.  So far they seem durable, the handle could be a little longer.  Overall money well spent.  I am sure I will be buying more as the class goes on.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace one I lost, then found the original, but I like this one a lot. It&#x27;s perfect for the shower.</li>
    <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY! I just received this comb.  It is not the one pictured.  Ironically, it is exactly the same one that I have in my shower right now.  I purchased that one for $2.49.  I got ripped off!  Very disappointed!!!  Would never purchase from this buyer again!</li>
    <li> So... the comb works. :)  it does what it is supposed to do and it hangs nicely in the shower.  So far so good....  I don&#x27;t really know what more to say about a comb, other than, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> A little flimsier than I was hoping for.  I have long wavy hair that gets very tangled and I need a comb that can take a lot if pulling without bending.  It&#x27;s not terrible but not great either.  I went to my local drugstore and got another one for a dollar more and a lot better quality plastic.</li>
    <li> I already hair this comb and love how easily it glides through my coily wet hair. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like it! I am African American and I have 3c/4a hair and it helps me detangle and distribute product. I thought the little balls at the end would make it less effective with detangling at the root, but it&#x27;s great and I can tell that it&#x27;s a lot more gentle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression I was getting two combs but only one came.  The comb has a small cut in the top prong which I&#x27;m afraid will damage my fragile hair so I haven&#x27;t used it!</li>
    <li> Awesome for curly hair. I use this on my daughter, and we no longer go to war when coming her wet hair.</li>
    <li> I love this comb and it&#x27;s by far the best detangling comb that I have used. I love the curved handle which makes it easy for me to use while detangling in the shower.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It looks like it&#x27;s been used for like 5 years.</li>
    <li> Great for the shower. Use on my shoulder-length naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that I was purchasing two combs - per the picture and subsequent cost. You only get one comb. There is another seller that is selling the exact comb in 3-pack for about a dollar more.  *Way to expensive for just one comb!</li>
    <li> The comb itself deserves five stars. Works great in my long curly hair for detangling without pulling a bunch out. I thought, however, because of the picture and the price, I would be receiving two combs. (My fault for not reading it all, but deceiving none the less.)</li>
    <li> i love this comb. as soon as i received it I automatically decided to test it out and as reported it didnt stress my hair whatsoever. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the shipping!! And the product works great</li>
    <li> Love this comb! I have curly hair so it works well. It is similar to one I used to have from Avon.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb. I use it every morning in the shower to brush out conditioner. Highly recommend this product</li>
