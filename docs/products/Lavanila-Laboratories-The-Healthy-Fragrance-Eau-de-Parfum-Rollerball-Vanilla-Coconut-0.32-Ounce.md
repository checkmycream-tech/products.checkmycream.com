      <li>this perfume is the best, would recommend it to anyone that loves the smokey roma...</li>
      <li>If you are not into smelling  like something edible, or your partner is not a fan, then this may not be the best purchase for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>It is very nicely made and fits well in my purse for on the go application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, IT SMELLS EVEN BETTER, FOR REAL, I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a nice smelling perfume and good for on the go.</li>
      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>and now i have to say i&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
      <li>Always has been my favorite summer scent!</li>
      <li>but I would advise that you try these fragrances in person to make sure they smell good to you, with your body chemistry.</li>
      <li>It does make you smell like a nice cake.  </li>
      <li>Fits nicely in my purse and in my desk at work.  </li>
      <li>the packaging is cute, and the price is good -</li>
      <li>you like that kind of edible smell, go for it.  </li>
      <li>It smells warm and tropical.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells nice though.</li>
      <li>Love the price and the rollerball perfume concept.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of Vanilla</li>
      <li>This is the one I thought I would LOVE -</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what this one was --- neither vanilla nor coconut.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Beach vaca in a bottle :)</li>
      <li>I love the smell of vanilla and the smell of coconut.  </li>
      <li>Nice coconut-y scent without being too sweet.</li>
      <li>This is a nice fragrance that is sweet, but not cloying or syrupy.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy this fragrance however the coconut overpowers the vanilla more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>and it is easy for traveling.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Smells like cheap vanilla drug store perfume.</li>
      <li>I smelled like I used a cheap body splash; it was also too</li>
      <li>Lasts a long time and effervesces beautifully.  </li>
      <li>Not only is this perfume completely natural and good for you, it also smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It smells very nice but didn&#x27;t last as long as I would of liked.</li>
      <li>If you do decide to order, do it through Dermstore, who is way more professional!!</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST SMELL, AND IT LAST SO LONG ON ME, THE LONGER IT STAYS ON</li>
      <li>It smells nice immediately and mellows with wear into more vanilla and less coconut.  </li>
      <li>in theory, it&#x27;s right up</li>
      <li>I have to admit i didn&#x27;t like it when i first smelled it.</li>
      <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
      <li>As for the perfume itself, it has a very beachy scent to it</li>
      <li>The Pure Vanilla is way too sweet for me, so this is a step down from the sweet factor, but still simple and easy to wear.</li>
      <li>only caution would be that not everyone likes that sweet vanilla smell.  </li>
      <li>I liked that it was small and could be carried with you!</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long so bring it with you for reapplication.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really rate the actual product from LAVANILA, as I never got the perfume from THEM!!</li>
      <li>do think of all the fragrances, this one smells the most &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34; - the two other fragrances have other notes that make them not-so-vanilla.</li>
      <li>I emailed them TWICE and never got a response back either time, so I ended up canceling directly through Amazon.</li>
      <li>As it dried down, it became very sweet smelling</li>

    <li> Not only is this perfume completely natural and good for you, it also smells amazing. I have to admit i didn&#x27;t like it when i first smelled it. I was actually disappointed. But since i didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste i used it and now i have to say i&#x27;m in love with it! It smells warm and tropical. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite perfume! LOVE!</li>
    <li> when ever I wore it, someone would say &amp;#34;  I smell chocolate&amp;#34;  it was wierd, and that was men!!  I wanted to smell like coconut, so this was very very disappointing</li>
    <li> I enjoy this fragrance however the coconut overpowers the vanilla more than I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d prefer it to be the other way around. It&#x27;s smells nice though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice fragrance that is sweet, but not cloying or syrupy.  It smells nice immediately and mellows with wear into more vanilla and less coconut.  The Pure Vanilla is way too sweet for me, so this is a step down from the sweet factor, but still simple and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice but didn&#x27;t last as long as I would of liked. I liked that it was small and could be carried with you!</li>
    <li> For all the hype and hoopla with the extra ingredients used for marketing I did not care for it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so heavy and hurts my head after a moment. I don&#x27;t know who could wear this. I like some of the other scents but this one is too nauseous smelling for me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Vanilla this perfume is the best, would recommend it to anyone that loves the smokey roma...</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling perfume and good for on the go. It has a light scent, but it doesn&#x27;t last long so bring it with you for reapplication. Has a bit of a nutty smell to it.</li>
    <li> Nice coconut-y scent without being too sweet. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because the scent does not last. I wish it did because it reminds me of a beach vacation.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic.  Lasts a long time and effervesces beautifully.  I am smelling myself for as long as it takes for me to go nose blind and I love it.  It is very nicely made and fits well in my purse for on the go application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caution would be that not everyone likes that sweet vanilla smell.

This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Not overpowering like some vanilla perfumes. Like the roller application and it is easy for traveling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate the actual product from LAVANILA, as I never got the perfume from THEM!! I kept checking on the status of the product and one week after they said it was supposed to have been delivered, I STILL had not received it. I emailed them TWICE and never got a response back either time, so I ended up canceling directly through Amazon. I then went and ordered it on Amazon through Dermstore and they were GREAT about prompt delivery! The truly sad thing to this whole rant is that LaVanila laboratories is the ACTUAL company that makes this product!! But I had to go elsewhere to actually get it - pretty pathetic!! As for the perfume itself, it has a very beachy scent to it and I really like the smell. If you do decide to order, do it through Dermstore, who is way more professional!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SMELL, AND IT LAST SO LONG ON ME, THE LONGER IT STAYS ON, IT SMELLS EVEN BETTER, FOR REAL, I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a softer scent. Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Always has been my favorite summer scent!</li>
    <li> Beach vaca in a bottle :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of vanilla and the smell of coconut.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what this one was --- neither vanilla nor coconut.  As it dried down, it became very sweet smelling and I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Love the price and the rollerball perfume concept.  Fits nicely in my purse and in my desk at work.  Just not for me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance in a trio set with Vanilla and Grapefruit Vanilla. This is the one I thought I would LOVE - in theory, it&#x27;s right up my alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think of all the fragrances, this one smells the most &amp;#34;accurate&amp;#34; - the two other fragrances have other notes that make them not-so-vanilla. BUT - the coconut here somehow smells synthetic, even though I believe this brand is all-natural. I smelled like I used a cheap body splash; it was also too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t recommend this - the packaging is cute, and the price is good - but I would advise that you try these fragrances in person to make sure they smell good to you, with your body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Smells like cheap vanilla drug store perfume. Not impressed which is particularly disappointing because I usually LOVE the brand (amazing deodorant).</li>
    <li> I bought this without trying it out. I like it but wish it was a little stronger.  Perfumes mellow after applying and since this is mellow at application it seems to just disappear. Maybe it&#x27;s stronger in the spray form.</li>
