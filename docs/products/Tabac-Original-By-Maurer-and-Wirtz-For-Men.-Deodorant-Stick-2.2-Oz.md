      <li>/&gt;Seriously, this is my all time favorite fragrance that my husband&#x27;s ever worn (I buy him the aftershave here, too  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not terribly fond of this deodorant.  </li>

      <li>Another great product and very affordable indeed.</li>
      <li>I love the bath and shower gel and the after shave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Tabac fan using many Tabac products (shave soap, EdC, EdT, after shave, shower gel)</li>
      <li>Anyway, this deodorant offers a good amount of protection throughout the day when I need it most.</li>
      <li>The formulation must be too strong, alcohol-wise?  </li>
      <li>Great sandlewood scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower especially after an hour or two.  </li>
      <li>It reminds me of a mahogany-shelved library filled with leather books.  </li>
      <li>This deodorant stick doesn&#x27;t have the same great scent.</li>

      <li>I love this stick, keeps u dry all day, I use this for years.</li>
      <li>In any event I would only recommend this item as a car scent in the summer time; the smell is fantastic but it should be relegated to \\&quot;under the passenger seat\\&quot; to dissipate any residual Taco Bell smell, not be applied to your armpits.</li>
      <li>I am very please that I don&#x27;t have to send to Europe for it.</li>

      <li>If I apply it lightly, I&#x27;m alright, but then it wont keep the odor at bay as well as other deodorants for me</li>
      <li>I have been using Tabac shaving soap for the past couple months and I have grown to love the scent.</li>
      <li>they sent me one that must of been years old!  </li>

    <li> I love Tabac scent - absolutely love it.  But when I bought this product thinking I&#x27;d have a great gym bag item I found that it seemed to burn my armpits.  The formulation must be too strong, alcohol-wise?  In any event I would only recommend this item as a car scent in the summer time; the smell is fantastic but it should be relegated to \\&quot;under the passenger seat\\&quot; to dissipate any residual Taco Bell smell, not be applied to your armpits.</li>
    <li> I have use Tabac for more than forty years, and think it the best toiletries there are. I am very please that I don&#x27;t have to send to Europe for it.</li>
    <li> I love the bath and shower gel and the after shave.  This deodorant stick doesn&#x27;t have the same great scent.</li>
    <li> Have been using Tabac products since 1966. Never used any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;This says it all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tabac shaving soap for the past couple months and I have grown to love the scent. When I found out that Tabac also sells deodorant, I put in an order to give it a go. I am not disappointed that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this scent and it is not overpowering. The deodorant itself holds up pretty well. However, this is not like the newer 24 hour deodorants. In fact, I don&#x27;t really need deodorant protection while I am asleep at night! So what&#x27;s the point with 24 hour protection? Anyway, this deodorant offers a good amount of protection throughout the day when I need it most. It doesn&#x27;t stain my t-shirts and it has the great scent of Tabac that I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is because it does contain alcohol of which I am sensitive to and it causes a little tingling when applied, but which eventually goes away. If you have allergic reactions to alcohol products on the skin, then you might reconsider purchasing this particular product. Other than that, I think this is an excellent deodorant and will use it for  a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant with great sweat protection even though it is not an antiperspirant. The fragrance has that Tabac signature to it just like I like it. If you like other Tabac products then you should enjoy this product as well. I used Brut the other day just for comparison and hated it...it didn&#x27;t cool and protect anything like the Tabac. Worth it.</li>
    <li> Tabac Original is one of the best line for men; it is design for the well groomed men in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;I have sever allergic reaction to all deodorants&#x27; chemicals&lt;br /&gt;I have no reaction at all to Tabac, and I used it every day</li>
    <li> Love the feeling and smell, but is pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> i have been using this deodorant for 40 years cannot compare to any american made product, ladies adore the smell</li>
    <li> I love this stick, keeps u dry all day, I use this for years.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Tabac.  It is not over-powering.  It&#x27;s hard to find it in retail stores so buying it through Amazon works great!</li>
    <li> My husband loves Tabac products especially the deodorant.  I like it too because it makes him smell good.</li>
    <li> they sent me one that must of been years old!  All dried up.I got stuck,and not worth my ordeal to send back. I threw it away. PLEASE don,t get taken like me.</li>
    <li> This is a solid performing product!  I actually doubted its \\&quot;effectivity\\&quot; under the very hot (and tedious!) Texas sun.  But, after letting it \\&quot;out\\&quot; into the sun and weather, I was just plain wrong.  It works and it works good!  I stay dry and I smell good.  End of story.</li>
    <li> Another great product and very affordable indeed.I love this old sensation of using an old product such as TABAC.Thank u</li>
    <li> A masculine odor that perks me up every morning. In my work I cannot afford to smell like a working lady of the night in Paris so this is a subtle, masculine smelling smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: was a little disappointed that the stick broke off well before it was used up. Not as well anchored to the screw device as I would have hoped. Ordered the spray deodorant for that reason.</li>
    <li> Received this product in a damaged container.  The price sticker was scratched off and the top of the deodorant stick appeared to be tampered with. It looked like it was used, gross!  It did smell really good, though.  To bad, I was looking forward to using my $16.00 deodorant.</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint with this deodorant is a faint smell that can scream (I&#x27;m wearing an under arm deodorant!) if over applied.  I&#x27;m a huge Tabac fan using many Tabac products (shave soap, EdC, EdT, after shave, shower gel) but I&#x27;m not terribly fond of this deodorant.  That said, others do not get the residual deodorant smell (to their nose) when using it.  If I apply it lightly, I&#x27;m alright, but then it wont keep the odor at bay as well as other deodorants for me so I use it only occasionally</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other deodorant now. Great sandlewood scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower especially after an hour or two.  Wish they&#x27;re after shave smelled like the deodorant.</li>
    <li> I started using Tabac a few months back and I really like the scent, so does my wife.  Good value as well.</li>
    <li> Started using back around 1970 when stationed in Germany.  Best of the best.  Long lasting &#x27;flavor&#x27; - but not overpowering.  But buyer beware - on one occasion I bought six sticks on Amazon for about $7.00/stick (typically $19.00/stick).  I now see prices ranging from about $13 to $40 a stick.  So don’t get stuck with an expensive stick - look around.  (Yes, same size sticks).  Enhances the golden splendor of my Greek god-like physical magnificence. :-)</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This is well worth its premium price.  It&#x27;s an effective deodorant for men with a deliciously MANLY fragrance (Tabac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is my all time favorite fragrance that my husband&#x27;s ever worn (I buy him the aftershave here, too  [[ASIN:B000C1VZX8 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men. Aftershave 10.1 Oz.]]); Tabac&#x27;s an old-fashioned, delightfully masculine fragrance.  It reminds me of a mahogany-shelved library filled with leather books.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but I&#x27;m not the only woman who nearly faints with delight when my husband walks by wearing this scent; it&#x27;s really a pleasant fragrance that women love to smell on the men they love.  Try it for yourself or for your loved one; I think you&#x27;ll be favorably impressed!</li>
    <li> That is what I was looking for!</li>
