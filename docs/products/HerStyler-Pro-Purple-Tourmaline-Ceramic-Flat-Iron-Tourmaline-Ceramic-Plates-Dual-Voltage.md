      <li>Ceramic plates are very smooth, no area on the iron can snag on your hair   3.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a box falling apart and the straightening iron was scratched and very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>The product arrived on time in secure packaging and was more than I could have hoped for!</li>
      <li>I would think something worth $150-$220 would have PURE ceramic plates and perfectly aligned.</li>
      <li>I was able to achieve with the Herstyler</li>
      <li>I also love that I saved $75.00 by purchasing this item via internet as opposed to the mall.</li>
      <li>Provides my hair with a sleek, shiny look and a healthy feel.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
      <li>I love how it curls,</li>
      <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it :)  </li>
      <li>It seels for much more in the malls.</li>
      <li>I though, okay, I did purchase it awhile ago, things change...</li>
      <li>My girls love this straightner for both straightening and curling their hair.  </li>
      <li>I already have straight hair and it still doesnt work great at all.</li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t do any better shopping in stores than online.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and works great.</li>

      <li>I love the purple color</li>
      <li>Love herstyler products.</li>

      <li>how it straitened Thank you!!!!! :-)</li>
      <li>and I was in love with it</li>
      <li>I have paid much more for the brand name straighteners, and this one is much better.  </li>
      <li>It was ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of a \\&quot;ponytail and go\\&quot; type of girl</li>
      <li>I love her styler .</li>
      <li>The herstlyler flat irons are great!</li>
      <li>I decided to give it a shot anyway--not too excited about frying my hair--and lo!</li>
      <li>okay fine.</li>
      <li>But for a cheap straightening iron, it does a pretty good job.</li>
      <li>and I try, my hair is really smooth and look so shine, I love this product.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and reasonable straightening iron.</li>
      <li>Now I knew before I ordered it it wasn&#x27;t saving 227, but thought it implied it was a very good grade flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, perfect.</li>
      <li>and this just does not glide through my hair easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Given my hair type, it&#x27;s relatively easy to straighten ...</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
      <li>and it is fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my Tourmaline ceramic flat iron; it gives my hair such a &#x27;stylish&#x27; look--and my hair is ALREADY straight!!!  I know there are flat irons out there which cost much, MUCH more--but this product provides the VERY SAME results for a fraction of the cost!!!  Thank you so much for being able to provide such quality merchandise for those of us who are on a budget; you are awsome! :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron from the direct source was about 300 and something and I received this at 39.99! Also, the results are amazing. Me being African American, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it did. Left my hair soft, bouncy and with shine. &amp; I also got it in my favorite color!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but since they seem to help me I figure mine may help someone else.  I am an African American with pretty thick, mid-length hair.  My Chi that I used for 5 years finally gave out on me so I decided to try another brand.  While reading reviews and deciding which one to try, a friend let me borrow her H2Pro flat iron.  This was by far the best flat iron that I have ever used (better than my Chi and better that the Herstyler).  It was a little above my price range so I decided to try the Hairstyler.      I must say that the Herstyler does the job.  I live in the south and the humidity is horrible.  My hair does not always hold up in the humidity but I am overall satisfied.  It curls well also but you have to be a little experienced with using a flat iron for curls.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I would like but as stated before I am overall satisfied.  If you are looking for a good product on a budget I would recommend the Herstyler!</li>
    <li> This is a very good straightener.  We bought our first one at the mall for WAY more money.  This is the second one we bought from Amazon and they both work just fine.  Do yourself a favor and buy it cheap here.</li>
    <li> My girls love this straightner for both straightening and curling their hair.  My sister paid over $140 for this same straightner, the $39.95 we paid was a steal!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Satisfied. Glad I got it here for less then getting at the mall!</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected and frankly, a waste of money.  My sister has the pink HERSTYLER and hers works great.  For some reason, I got the purple one and it&#x27;s TERRIBLE! DO NOT GET IT!!! It gets really hot, but does not straighten my hair and make it feel silky like the one my sister has.</li>
    <li> I have been using the herstyler flatirons for several years now and my hair has never felt softer. I always do a deep condition before applying heat and my hair isn&#x27;t fried or breaking off. I&#x27;ve used products that were 3 x&#x27;s as expensive and haven&#x27;t gotten better results. My only problem is it started to lose effectiveness after about a year and I had to replace it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it (especially the color!)  I wish it had a temperature control switch, but otherwise, it&#x27;s great.  Her hair is very thick and naturally wavy/curly and this iron works great to straighten it.</li>
    <li> I love that the HerStyler Flat Iron does not burn my hair but leaves it smooth and silky.  I also love that I saved $75.00 by purchasing this item via internet as opposed to the mall.</li>
    <li> sucks! did not work well I had to go to sallys and buy another one</li>
    <li> We got this flat iron for both myself and 15 year old daughter.  We were very surprised how nice it was for the price.  It heats up very fast and does the job.  I would recommend to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend $100+.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced dual voltage flat iron that would work both in USA and Asia.I found it at Amazon.The reviews helped me a lot in deciding to choose Herstyler. Some of us who have used the Chi tend to compare. Herstyler performs well,no doubt about that and has universal voltage.The Chi is a little better , but does not work outside the USA. I was able to purchase Herstyler at an amazing discounted price at Amazon. I would highly recommend this flat iron. Great service Amazon and Dead Sea Beauty. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this hair straightener based on all of the great reviews! Unfortunately, once it arrived, I opened the box to find a flat iron with no temperature control--it automatically heats to 450 degrees (supposedly). I decided to give it a shot anyway--not too excited about frying my hair--and lo! my hair was still incredibly wavy (I have naturally curly hair). I gave it another minute to warm up expecting a different outcome with the next section, but the same thing happened. I had to go over each section at least 4 or 5 times for it to resemble anything straight-ish. I ended up returning this straightener. The only really redeeming quality is the swivel cord, plus the free return shipping. I would keep looking if I were you!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flattening iron after my friend made fun of my hair. I knew it was time, as I cut my hair to layered shoulder-length hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to style it. Boy, was I wrong. It sticks out in every direction!     Amazon said MSRP is a whopping $150+, so I went with this iron. However, I must admit I have seen it at many other places for under $40 as well.     This review is for hair of average to thinner than average thickness that is naturally wavy - my hair is in decent health, though it can get dried out extremely easily by hair irons.    HerStyler Iron Pros:     1. Heats very quickly - ready in about 30 seconds   2. Ceramic plates are very smooth, no area on the iron can snag on your hair   3. Heat doesn&#x27;t penetrate deep into the follicles. Rather, flattens it while sealing it shut. Leaves hair shiny and untangled for the rest of the night. After washing hair, hair still has not lost original shine and bounce.   4. Even when used on damp hair, it is still able to straighten it without doing too much damage. Do NOT iron your hair when wet! It strips your hair of water, along with its natural moisture, heavily damaging it.  5. Very lightweight   6. Fabulous look - and price.     (A Plus): Comes in beautiful, padded, matching satin bag     Cons:     1. No temperature control or indicator - there is only one on/off button. We need about 400 degrees F for regular, good styling. But damaged hair needs about 300 degrees.   2. Perhaps due to its small size, you must run the iron through hair very slowly, many times before it becomes perfectly straight. Larger plates tend to need fewer runs.  3. I would think something worth $150-$220 would have PURE ceramic plates and perfectly aligned. Again, this is why I find it hard to believe this really is worth that much.    Overall though, this price is good, the iron looks great, and if you don&#x27;t need temperature control this is a great iron.</li>
    <li> I thought this is a great price for a great product.  It seels for much more in the malls.</li>
    <li> This styler did not work well. It pulled the ends of my hair instead of smoothing.  Did not work as well as my current Herstyler.</li>
    <li> I bought this in April of 2013 and I haven&#x27;t used it much because I find it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it takes a long time to do my hair. So I have finally started to use it (now December 2014) cause curly puffy hair is not too cool right? Well it has started to peel  the first layer of the &amp;#34;ceramic&amp;#34; to reveal that there is metal under there. Is it not supposed to be solid ceramic? I swear this thing is a knock off and should be advertised at a knock off. It&#x27;s in the trash and I am not getting this thing from Amazon again. No thank you.</li>
    <li> My hair is really soft after I straightened it. I am still learning on how to curl using the herstyler.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It heats up fast and works great. It definitely straightens my thick wavy hair faster than any other straightener I&#x27;ve had. It also keeps it straight for a couple days. I love the purple color and I also bought the purple curling wand. Love herstyler products. They are amazing! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of purchasing this because it did not have heat control. It heats up to 450 and thats it. I used it this morning for the first time and was amazed at how easily it moved through my hair. I have very fine, very thin hair that is naturally curly....and not the good kind of curl. Its the frizzy, messy, ugly kind of curly. I hate my hair. This is the second flat iron I have purchased. My first flat iron lasted about 7 years and just died which is why I went looking for a replacement. I do use a heat protector on my hair so it does not fry, and this flat iron made my hair much smoother than my old flat iron. I ordered the purple color and it feels good in my hands. Its not awkward to hold or position. I will say that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch is in between the flat iron right by one of the plates. Not the best place for an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch, but its not a deal breaker. I thought I wouldnt like not having heat control but I usually use the max anyway, so I thought why not give this a try. I think that if you had very thick unruly hair that this flat iron would not be the best choice for you......but if you have fine, curly, frizzy hair its perfect. Good luck!!!!</li>
    <li> The product as well as the price and service were incredible. I paid about one-fifth of what this product was selling for at the kiosk in the mall.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd straightener I have purchased from Amazon, and I love them.  The kiosks in the mall are a super rip off, I highly recommend this purchase!</li>
    <li> I had a herstyler flatiron for about seven years, and absolutely loved it. It worked perfectly. We had a long run, but it&#x27;s time came. Without hesitation, I decided to get another herstyler. Couldn&#x27;t find the same pink one I had, but that&#x27;s okay! Got this lovely purple one, and paid way less than I did at the mall. You should know, I have relatively straight, healthy, and decently thick hair. I use a flatiron to make it pin straight, smooth, silky, and take the puffiness out. When I received this (the pictures indicated it was the exact one I had, but purple), it looked different and cheap. I still had my old one to compare side  by side. It honestly looked like a knock off, the outside material was different, the markings on it didn&#x27;t look as professional. I though, okay, I did purchase it awhile ago, things change...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my hair type, it&#x27;s relatively easy to straighten ...not with is. I had to go over my hair a million times, and I never ended up getting the same end result. It never fully straightened, and didn&#x27;t feel like it heated up that great, and what little straightness I got, disappeared after an hour. This was extremely frustrating for me, as I have easy-to-maintain hair and this was clearly not doing the job. I was frustrated as I absolutely loved my first herstyler. I thought maybe I got a defective one, as most of the reviews on this are good, but I can&#x27;t help compare the asthetics and materials to my previous herstyler with a notable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the chance and bought it as it&#x27;s a cheap price, but I will not buy another herstyler. I have recently bought and found another company that is performing beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot so far. Still have to learn how to use it correctly for creating wavy curls. I think the ceramic plating is great, and the only thing I would suggest improving would be allowing for temperature control. It can get pretty hot, and sometimes that concerns me since I have fine, thin hair. Anyway, overall 4 out of 5 stars!</li>
    <li> My roommate has used this often!. I only bought it because of the company and im obsessed with the color purple. Hopefully I will like it as much as she does. However I do not like that you cant control the temperature. Ill keep you posted.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing :)&lt;br /&gt;Best I have ever bought .&lt;br /&gt;Works better than every other one that I have had .</li>
    <li> i wouldnt recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control also it didnt heat up when i plugged it in</li>
    <li> This is the third flat iron I&#x27;ve bought from this seller.  The first one I bought for myself.  I let my roommate try it and had her buy one a week later.  This one was for my mom.  Both my roommate and my mom were planning on buying a Chi for 150 plus $.  They both tried my Herstyler and had me order them each one ASAP.  Not only does the flat iron work just as well if not better but it was 1/4 of the cost and came in the mail less than a week later!  Product and seller get 5 stars and two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t flat iron daily and it doesn&#x27;t have an adjustable temperature but we like it. It does the job, heats up fast, and stays a consistent temperature. We have had it 6+ months and it is fine. However, we don&#x27;t use it daily or even weekly so I cannot attest to daily use longevity.</li>
    <li> Had HerStyler that broke and liked it so much I bought another. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good and reasonable straightening iron.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this.  Got it to replace one just like it that she wore out.  Warms up quick and does the job.</li>
    <li> I have relatively straight, fine, rather thin hair and the volume and shine I was able to achieve with the Herstyler was amazing.  This device has cut the amount of time it takes to do my hair in the morning from 20-25 minutes to less than 10 minutes. It heats up quickly and is easy to maneuver.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever using a regular curling iron again.    The product arrived on time in secure packaging and was more than I could have hoped for!</li>
    <li> I got what I expected except for the fact that it does not come with different heat settings. it works well with my african hair</li>
    <li> Not the same as the straighteners that they try on you in the mall. It works decent but definitely not really good! Glad I didnt spend full amount on it.</li>
    <li> Sorry to break this to you but this product is NOT the quality product you&#x27;re looking for. I bought one of the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; HerStyler flat irons in the mall 7 years ago for about $200 and it was superb! DON&#x27;T SETTLE FOR THIS IMITATION!!! Unlike my original HerStyler, this one left my hair feeling and looking dry and damaged just after 2 uses. I really wanted to like this product considering it was half the cost of the ones sold in the mall, but it was just a waste of time and money (money spent on return shipping). In the end, I bought the more expensive but far better quality product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> After one of those mall demo ambushes where they leave you with one piece of silky straight hair and a nagging desire to replicate the look but NOT for $200, I purchased this for 1/10th the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, thick, wavy hair. Day one I thought it was great. It&#x27;s hot, your hair smokes when using it, okay fine. By day 3 I realized that if I didn&#x27;t use it my hair looked WORSE than ever. I was using the HerStyler serum (smells wonderful btw) but the heat was just too much. I still have it in a drawer but haven&#x27;t used it since. I think I will keep it for the rare straightening ocassions (I&#x27;m not a regular straightener). Just be aware if you use a straightener frequently that this one will get the job done but may be too much for your hair.</li>
    <li> I am not nearly as thrilled with this item as others have been. I would have been extremely angry had I paid retail on this. I have very thick hair and this just does not glide through my hair easily. I may be spoiled from using a friends Rusk but this is going to be given away more than likely. It stated in the description that it has a temperature control which is not the case. It is a pretty straightener but thats about the only praise I can give it..</li>
    <li> Dont bother buying this product. I already have straight hair and it still doesnt work great at all. It barely heats up and it takes me forever to do my hair...And when I am finally done it still doesnt look to what I want my hair to look. Its terrible at the heat temperature.</li>
    <li> This flat iron has no gauge and burns your hair.  I hate it.  I tried using it twice and got the same result.</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener! Works the same as the one I bought a few years ago at the mall for $200+</li>
    <li> Probably the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is coily and sometimes frizzy but it stayed flat all day with this straightener. It even held up in the chilly wind. My hair would never do that with some of the other straighteners I&#x27;ve used. So, I love this product.</li>
    <li> bought one before it was great this one didn&#x27;t work at all like the last one I bought its awful doesn&#x27;t even feel like its made the same doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a one inch wide, but much shorter than my previous herstyler.  Must be a travel flat iron.  No temperature adjustment and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Chintzy compared to the one I own and have had for several years.  Very disappointed.  The advertisement says &amp;#34;Save 227.00&amp;#34;  Now I knew before I ordered it it wasn&#x27;t saving 227, but thought it implied it was a very good grade flat iron.  Wrong!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this same flat iron and I like how my hair looks after using it.  That&#x27;s why I ordered one for me.  However, it does not have a temperature knob, neither did it come with a case.  They need to correct the description of this item as it is misleading.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best straightening irons that I have purchased and also one of the least inexpensive ones.  I have paid much more for the brand name straighteners, and this one is much better.  This is a must have for the price and quality, and if you already have a straightening iron buy this one just for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product . I love her styler . Would recommend to others .</li>
    <li> After a year of owning it, I felt like it snagged on my hair and I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have temperature settings. But for a cheap straightening iron, it does a pretty good job. I would purchase ION straightening irons from Sally Beauty Supply any day over this one but I&#x27;m glad I found out that it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more of a \\&quot;ponytail and go\\&quot; type of girl but my co-worker suggested I buy the herstyler to tame my thick wavy hair. At first I was skeptical but I knew I needed some really good and reliable flat irons instead of the cheap ones I had been wasting my money on. As soon as they came in the mail I decided to test them out and to my suprise they worked REALLY well! The herstyler takes absolutely no time to heat up and it was able to straighten my hair with no problem! Plus it was originally $229 and I got them for $30 thanks to Amazon! I will most definitely be buying more Herstyler products!</li>
    <li> It leaves hair so silky and shiny.  It lasts on your hair for 2 or 3 days without losing it&#x27;s  shine.</li>
    <li> I got my flat iron yesterday and I try, my hair is really smooth and look so shine, I love this product. Thank you herStyler.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  Held up for a year now and still working to its performance.  Still gets hot and haven&#x27;t had any problems or hot spots eventhough a little hot at the end but still a wonderful iron.  Recommend this iron to all the ones that I knew.</li>
    <li> A Good value and a good product.  Our previous one died - but had lasted for quite a few years.</li>
    <li> So, after wasting like almost a hundred bucks on one of these at the mall, I decided to return the item. I saw that they sold this on Amazon, and thought I&#x27;d buy this one for like 1/4 of the price. Of course I was given the run around when trying to return, but I got my way. First off, I would like to say, that there is no heat setting. You don&#x27;t exactly know what heat it&#x27;s at. You can&#x27;t lower the heat, or increase the heat. It didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. I have very thick kinda course hair. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this. I still have it but don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a salon quality like product for a budget, I would suggest buying the Remington straightner. http://www.amazon.com/Remington-S-9951-Humidity-Resistant-Hairstyling/dp/B002LIXTFC/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_3 It works wonders on my hair, and I have thick frizz proned hair! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned that there was no heat level choice, but it turns out that the level is just right for my hair. I am able to get very close to the scalp to straighten the entire length of my hair. It heats up very quickly. I find it hard to believe anyone ever paid $250 for it, as the sticker on the box says. But for what I paid, it is a very good iron.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron. Great price and great quality. I just have stubborn hair so it isn&#x27;t always straight at the end of the day but for the price I paid and how quickly I received it it&#x27;s not really a complaint! Only down fall is there is no way to adjust the heat. It is one temp and that is it. Other than that, perfect.</li>
    <li> It works good on me n my daughter hair. I love how it curls, n how it straitened Thank you!!!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I brought these flatirons for my sis since I broke hers... she said they work excellent the only problem is it doesnt have a temperature setting. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would have given the flatirons a 5... we also got them in like 3 days so that was a plus also</li>
    <li> The herstlyler flat irons are great! They heat up well and are very easy to use and they style my hair just like I want. This is the second one I have purchased. (Had to replace the first ones because I keep dropping them and they finally broke). I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who loves it so far.  She has thick, wavy hair.  Pretty purple color too!</li>
    <li> this hair straightener is amazing!!! it doesn&#x27;t pull or snag on my hair and I get a nice shine after using it</li>
    <li> We absolutely love this straightener! It is very nice that it has an extra long cord too! My daughter steals it from me all the time!</li>
    <li> I thought this was an amazing deal..it works good but is cheaply made. Came on time as well. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> It was ok. It was thin and did not heat up as well as the others. It worked well for short hair though.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me one of these a few years ago at the mall for my Birthday and I was in love with it, the one he bought me was pink and now thanks Amazon I have the purple and what a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at the local mall and paid $109 for it. Then I came home and found this one which is the exact same one. I have bought 5 of them as gifts because all my friends and family loved mine. And bought a spare for at home too. They are really great irons.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I received the best deal in the world! Unfortunately I was disappointed when I found that this straightening iron does not have a temperature control option like it says ON THE BOX. This can get really really hot and there&#x27;s no way you can adjust the temperature to make it less hot.</li>
    <li> This was not a genuine HerStyler.  It arrived in a box falling apart and the straightening iron was scratched and very cheaply made.  I went to a store in my town that sells the real thing and compared them and there was no comparison.  I returned this one and went and bought the real thing.  Was very disapointed and still had to pay shipping to and from.</li>
    <li> amazon came through with another order for a flat iron for my hair. can&#x27;t do any better shopping in stores than online.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I got this b/c the price was right and it worked great!! But after about 9 months, I started to really hate my hair...it was always frizzy and my roots would always be really wavy the next day. When I used to be able to straighten my hair once right after washing it, I was now having to do it everyday until I washed it again...and with only minimal results. I was debating putting a relaxer in my hair, when it dawned on me that this flat iron wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it used to (I could tell b/c my hair used to be hot to the touch after I would straighten a section and this was no longer the case). So...it fizzled out after less than a year.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this flat iron from Small Bill.  Great price and amazingly the best flat iron I have ever had aside from the Chi flat iron I used to have but the original chi&#x27;s are not sold any longer and are not top quality anymore as they used to be.  For this price I couldn&#x27;t believe how great the iron was.  I saw them being sold at the mall and the girl said they are $200 but on sale for $100.  You know how the mal l is I probably could have made her come down even more on the price but I told her that was too much for me and she gave me some free samples that I loved of the hair mask.  Well, overall I am above and beyond happy with this item and go with Small Bill for the seller.  I literally got the flat iron in 2 days!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it :)  Best buying experience I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have owned expensive straighteners in the past (two in fact) but when my second one stopped working, I knew I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money again.  I stumbled upon the great deal for this one and opted for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say...I absolutely love this straightener!  I have fine, long hair and this works well to straighten it.  Provides my hair with a sleek, shiny look and a healthy feel.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron because my daughter had one that I used and really liked it. When mine came, I was expecting the same performance and was very disappointed. My hair did not slide through like it did with my daughter&#x27;s. That was the main reason for my purchase. Also, I don&#x27;t like the fact that there is not a temperature control .... the temp being much higher than I like.</li>
    <li> I ordered this straighter to replace the straighter I purchase 6 years ago at a kiosk in the mall.  The cord started to separate and you could begin to see the wires within the cord.  After reading the some reviews, I was hesitant about buying it.  I looked at the manufacturer&#x27;s website and they were charging $300+ for the straightener that I bought for $125 6 years ago.  So I decided to buy this one on amazon.  I used it for the first time, and it was awesome!  Just like I remembered when I bought this straightener 6 years ago.  It works beautifully.  The iron doesn&#x27;t get terribly hot and it didn&#x27;t burn or split my hair.  It&#x27;s smooth and totally worth saving $270 something dollars.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. :-)</li>
