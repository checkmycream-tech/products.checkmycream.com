    <li> Well made and holds a bunch of clothes.  I used it as an overnight bag for our son as his backpack can&#x27;t hold all of his stuff for sleepovers.  Also works great for lugging towels and suits for pool parties.</li>
    <li> strong, sturdy and cute tote. Great as a gift back, so they can keep the bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this in lieu of a gift bag for my one year old nephew&#x27;s birthday gift. Added a few sheets of red tissue paper, and I think he liked it more than the gift! I like the fact that it&#x27;s something he can use to store things in later and it won&#x27;t get thrown away like a gift bag would. It&#x27;s a nice material that I feel like will be durable enough to last as long as he&#x27;s still interested in Spider-Man!</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these .. great for birthday gifts, or for the kids to carry their stuff around in</li>

    <li> Everyone loves Spidey...&lt;br /&gt;I use this item to carry my lunch to work.&lt;br /&gt;People loved it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered several and given them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I like this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size bag. I bought it to wrap my cousins childrens presents in. It holds a lot of items. I also have a Tinkerbell one just like it for the sister of the one that gets this bag. They seem heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I bough the bag as a way to save on plastic bags at the store. But instead I use it as a work bag. It holds all my stuff and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Used this as a &amp;#34;gift bag&amp;#34; to put my nephew&#x27;s birthday present in. It was roomy and sturdy and worked well.</li>
