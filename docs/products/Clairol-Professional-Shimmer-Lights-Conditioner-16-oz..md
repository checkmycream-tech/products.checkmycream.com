<ol>
      <li>This conditioner is perfect and my hair looked and felt wonderful</li>
      <li>always an excellent toning conditioner</li>
      <li>Product is excellent.  </li>
      <li>a conditioner, I am not that impressed, it does not condition as well as</li>
      <li>I am very happy having silver hair and plan to keep using this shampoo and conditioner to keep it at its best.  </li>
      <li>If you use the shampoo, this is great with it - or alone!  </li>

      <li>It conditions and tones my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great product for the price!!!!</li>
      <li>I believe you are best off using a solution of violet hair dye and conditioner as a conditioning toner, not to mention it would be cheaper too.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that it works nicely; best if, after shampooing, I work the product through my hair, then leave it on for two to five minutes before rinsing out.  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>The best product to counter brassiness!</li>
      <li>but this is the best product out there for blondes.</li>

      <li>Shimmering Lights Conditioner paired with Shimmering Lights Shampoo is a perfect combination for&lt;br /&gt;gray &amp; silver hair, much better the Pantene alternative.  </li>
      <li>On the plus side I kept the incorrect product and tried and actually liked it!</li>
      <li>I either use this with a good moisturizing shampoo, or Shimmer Lights shampoo with a good moisturizing conditioner, all the time.</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>Good price at Amazon too, as Walgreens and CVS no longer carry Grey/Silver Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>yellow-orange-brassy color go away for good..</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo either.</li>
      <li>someone needs to remake this with a good aroma to it.</li>
      <li>this is really good for blondes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen/heard really good things about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I use the shampoo which is great and then use my own conditioner that smells nicer.</li>
      <li>Very pleased and will by it again.</li>
      <li>Works better than the shampoo for &amp;#34;toning&amp;#34;... but it isn&#x27;t a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>but it also makes it very healthy.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this conditioner!</li>
      <li>Love this purple shampoo!</li>
      <li>(do a google image search for designer Katie Gallager - that&#x27;s what I go for when I do my hair) love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The conditioning was okay, but the smell repulsed me!  </li>
      <li>I have silver hair and love this product!</li>
      <li>and I have been very pleased with the results on my own locks.</li>
      <li>Putting the conditioner in my hair for awhile works better than virgin snow by manic panic!</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and love it!  </li>
      <li>This is amazing for getting rid of brassy tones in hair.  </li>
      <li>I GOT THIS AND TELL YOU THE HONEST FACT .</li>
      <li>gives me kind of</li>
      <li>Does have a nice shine.</li>
      <li>While on your head, it&#x27;s bright lavender, but when you rinse out, it&#x27;s a perfect white.</li>
      <li>THe professional shimmer lights shampoo and conditioner are the best at counteracting the yellows in gray hair.  </li>
      <li>Although this is a nice conditioner, I sometimes have to use a bit more than I would like.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, plentiful hair that LOVES to tangle and knot.</li>
      <li>To me, the conditioner has a reasonably pleasant aroma, and does a good job of picking up the blond highlights and lowlights, particularly, of course, when used with its companion shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for one that suits me better.</li>
      <li>They love,</li>
      <li>The scent is more chemical smelling than I prefer.</li>
      <li>note of caution though, do not leave on for more than 30 seconds or use more than 1 day in a row as you will have too many purple tones deposited in your hair.</li>
      <li>this works ok</li>
      <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll run it through then put conditioner on over it, which is ok, but I do get better results if I let it sit on by itself, rinse, and condition separately (just like to save time sometimes)</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I used this product last year and it worked great, however this year for some reason doesn&#x27;t work as well!</li>
      <li>I have ash colored hair but after many shampoos it starts to get brassy</li>
      <li>But as a toner I love it.</li>
      <li>Wash &amp; rinse every day until you get your desired color, do not leave it in for more than the recommended time.</li>
      <li>and I have really enjoyed gradually watching the brass tones leave my hair</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this brand&#x27;s shampoo.</li>
      <li>hey, I LOVE, the silver of my hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not concerned about the smell though, because this is the best blonde shampoo I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Works better than I thought -- also cheaper than in stores.  </li>
      <li>I Love this Product......</li>
      <li>MORE ORANGY!!Get</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars if it had a better smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the conditioner just once, and it significantly reduced the yellowing in my silver hair without making me look like a blue-haired lady.  The product also moisturized my hair and added volume. The only drawback is the smell, rather strong ,floral/chemical, and lingering. Next time I use it, I&#x27;ll try finishing with a second shampoo to reduce the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is very good at getting rid of brassiness after using blonde hair lightener for highlights! I can&#x27;t be without a product that takes away the brassy look because no matter what hair lightener I use, I end up with some brassiness. This really works!</li>
    <li> I personally like the shampoo a little better, but this probably comes down to personal taste. My hairdresser prefers the conditioner. Might be a good idea to try both and then buy a big bottle of your favorite, since I don&#x27;t think you would really need both products.</li>
    <li> this works ok but it stinks bad. I like my hair to smell awesome. someone needs to remake this with a good aroma to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as my blond (colored) hair quickly starts to take on brassy tones and I really love the almost white, silver color that you have when you walk out the salon door. I use the conditioner every other wash and I have really enjoyed gradually watching the brass tones leave my hair completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner, I am not that impressed, it does not condition as well as my pantene conditioner does, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling worse either. I do need more de-tangler when I use this product- I have very fine, plentiful hair that LOVES to tangle and knot. THis product also has  a very strong smell, not unpleasant, but noticeable. It sticks around a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, be careful not to overuse the product as it can literally turn your hair blue. Learned that the hard way...</li>
    <li> As far as a conditioner this is just ok, not a bad one, not a great one. The smell though is AWFUL. It smells like old lady perfume x100.  I used it only once at night and the following morning washed my hair with a different shampoo... I can still smell the horrible scent, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the Shimmer Lighys shampoo and conditioner on the recommendation of my stylist.  Neither my husband nor I can stand the fragrance of either product, and the conditioner leaves my rather short hair tangled.  I&#x27;ve had to resort to using one of those post-shampoo \\&quot;no more tangles\\&quot; type products which, even when I had hair that reached halfway down my back, I never had to use before.  I will not buy these products again, and am off on another search for hair product made especially for gray hair.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair purplezzz!</li>
    <li> I have medium weight thin hair that I&#x27;ve bleached to a white blonde. I read a lot of places that you should buy a purple shampoo to help keep the brassy color away. I usually only shampoo my hair once a week, but because my hair is bleached I&#x27;ve really needed a conditioner so I went in search of a purple one. I&#x27;ve tried other purple conditioners but found I really do like this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels nice &amp; smooth after use.&lt;br /&gt;There is a strong smell, but honestly I enjoy it. Almost reminds me of vinegar &amp; cloves. My boyfriend &amp; roommate have also commented they like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely adds color to my hair. None of the other &#x27;purple&#x27; products I&#x27;ve tried have had any noticeable effect on my hair but this obviously tints my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Runny so I end up using a lot more than I would with other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;WILL turn your hair purple if you over do it. Wash &amp; rinse every day until you get your desired color, do not leave it in for more than the recommended time. Walked around for a full day with pastel purple hair which (while cool) was not the look I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told it is a conditioner meant to remove yellow tint in blonde (or bleached blonde) hair. It does it&#x27;s job &amp; I&#x27;ll probably be using it until I get sick of the blonde &amp; dye my hair a different color.</li>
    <li> Just be ware that this company delivers their stuff really slowly... I ordered other items from other vendors and this vendor took 4 extra days to deliver their stuff.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for over a year. I am constantly asked what color I use to dye the hair because the color is so great. The shampoo cleans great and makes it manageable too!</li>
    <li> Smell:  very chemical and stays even after rinsing a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Condition: not a single hair&lt;br /&gt;Color stays in my blonde.</li>
    <li> I dye my own hair a very blonde color and have an issue with it looking very yellow in color when I&#x27;m done.  My hair dresser recommended this product to me.  She obviously would prefer that I not dye my own hair but understands the cost for keeping my dark hair blonde, so she recommended this product to get out the yellow and brassiness.  This product works at getting out that yellow/brassy color.  It usually takes about two uses to get out the yellow after dying my hair.  I usually leave it in the full 3 minutes and have never had an issue with my hair turning purple like others say.  I will also use this sporadically to keep the blonde color looking fresh.</li>
    <li> I have tried three brands of shampoo and conditioners for silver hair.  THe professional shimmer lights shampoo and conditioner are the best at counteracting the yellows in gray hair.  The color purple is the complimentary color for yellow. Opposites on the color wheel, so if your hair has a touch of yellowing, this conditioner helps to make the silver POP!  Be careful, this stuff is effective. If you use it everyday, you will have a light purple tint to your gray.  Some celebrities are paying for this color!  I find that using the shampoo or conditioner every few days is perfect.  I like the smell  for both shampoo and conditioner.  Not really floral, Not cloying. Just light and fresh.  I have tried Aveeda shampoo and it smells like a certain cough medicine, but I happen to love that smell. Their shampoo is much weaker, and I can not see the difference.  Maybe if I used it everyday, but for the high cost of Aveeda I prefer to use something that works like clairol...  The aveeda conditioner that goes with the shampoo is not very intense either and is minty, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling conditioned. I won&#x27;t get that again... Jermack (?) doesen&#x27;t work either. The worst of the bunch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years but not too much. It keeps my blonde nice and light, no yellowing. However it is drying. Sometimes I use another conditioner right after to remoisten my hair. Definitely need a second conditioner or a leave-in when you use the Shimmer Lights shampoo and conditioner together. They do the job though, my hair is BLONDE with noooo yellow or gold at all. Love it!</li>
    <li> I feel like I have to leave a review because almost all the bad reviews have been left by people the product is not intended for.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer Lights shampoo and conditioner are meant for the upkeep of light blonde/white/gray hair. It prevents hair that has already been colored/bleached to the desired shade, stay bright and clear and reduces brassiness. It is not a hair color. If your hair is orange from bleaching then this product will not work miracles. You cannot fix a color issue with a shampoo/conditioner. Seek a colorist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had bleached white hair for years and this is by far the best purple shampoo/conditioner out there. Best value and works extremely well. I tend to use it every time I wash my hair, but as a person with bleached hair, I wash my hair once/twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those with white/gray hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works fine and prevents yellowing for Grey or Silver hair.  Good price at Amazon too, as Walgreens and CVS no longer carry Grey/Silver Shampoo and Conditioner.  Discrimmination against \\&quot;Mature Individuals.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty liquidy and the smell is gross, but it really takes down the brass and pumps up the highlights.</li>
    <li> Works very well for removing brassy tones. Also ships very fast!</li>
    <li> I used this on my freshly dyed hair for about a month hoping it would preserve the ashy color, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help.  Also the lather is very poor in the shampoo version and the conditioner is very thin - would not re purchase.  will look for other purple shampoos.  Smelled good though!</li>
    <li> Messy in the shower, but worth it.</li>
    <li> always an excellent toning conditioner</li>
    <li> I recently decided to cut off my hair to see how grey my hair actually is, and I found out my hair is more salt and pepper than what I expected. Furthermore, I have snow white crown that looks becoming. So I decided to try Shimmer lights and what a great idea. I am really enjoy the produce and how it leaves my hair managable.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Good stuff, does the job as advertised, recommend for you folks with that gray hair that we of the older bunch get.</li>
    <li> Works great when paired with Clairol Shimmer lights shampoo. I use it to keep my hair completely white and it does the job. It also gives my hair a purple undertone which I really enjoy but others may not. I also love the smell! Overall great product.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s bleached hair turns a brassy red and this conditioner cut down on the brass. Looks good and very soft. She is Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I gave it 1 star because it did take some of the brassyness out but it also took most of my blonde out and darkened my hair!! I have ultra light blonde highlights on top of medium brown hair and root.... It actually darkend my blonde highlights and put MORE brass in my darker hair!!! If you don&#x27;t have white, silver or platinum blonde hair then this isn&#x27;t for you!!</li>
    <li> I find it to be an odd consistency and to be honest I believe you are best off using a solution of violet hair dye and conditioner as a conditioning toner, not to mention it would be cheaper too. This conditioner is just very odd and doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> It left my hair coarse and did not seem to tone down the brassy tones. It doesn&#x27;t condition at all! I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> After using this product for one week it turned my silver hair a bluish-purple color.  I should have been suspicious when I saw the color of the conditioner was purple.  No where in the advertisement or promotion of this product does it state \\&quot;use will turn your hair a bluish-purple color\\&quot;.  I remember when this was a fad with older women years ago.  Obviously Clairol still has a lot of shampoo and conditioner left from those days they want to get rid of.  If you have blonde or silver hair, beware!  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Be prepared to smell like an old lady if you use this (no offense). Smell is so bad I am probably throwing the rest away.</li>
    <li> This works great on my ends. I have ombre hair and the ends are the lightest part. I usually just put this on my ends to keep the platinum blonde fresh and bright. It does leave some purple tint behind on day one, or if you leave it on for too long. But to be honest, that is only something I notice because I know I used it :) Other people just see very light blonde. The only complaint I have is that it does not really condition. It feels different, almost like a jelly or something.. It does not really feel like it is adding any moisture to my hair which sometimes causes me to condition first and then put this in.</li>
    <li> This is really just a so-so product.  I MUCH prefer the conditioning effect of Jhirmack.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing this product. Very pleased and will by it again. Where I used to purchase&lt;br /&gt;my Clairol Shimmer products they did not offer this item. Keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Great Product: My hair is very long, below the middle of my back, my hair dresser was not able to provide this conditioner, at this price and I said to her your conditioner is the last thing to go on your hair.    Thank you very much  Mary</li>
    <li> I have gray hair with a bit darker hair in the back, over the last few years I have tried 3 different brands of shampoo and conditioner for gray hair, one quite a bit more expensive and one a tad less but I think Shimmer Lights is the best I have used.  I use this with the shimmer lights shampoo once or twice a week, never more than that and use regular shampoo and conditioner the rest of the days.  I often get comments on my silver hair and I think using shimmer lights is the reason why.  Even my husband has mentioned how often strangers comment on my hair color and gets a kick out of it. I can see a difference in the brightness and shine and really like what this does to my hair.  I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all and I like the way my hair feels as well as looks.  I am very happy having silver hair and plan to keep using this shampoo and conditioner to keep it at its best.  I received my order from Amazon very, very quickly using the free shipping option too.</li>
    <li> I recently bleached my entire head after growing tired of my natural hair color. I now have extremely light blonde hair. While I initially loved the results, I became a little worried about how to keep my hair that consistent color. I had bleached my hair several years ago as a teen, and remembered the color changing after a while. So that&#x27;s why I bought this. After reading the other reviews for this product, I was a little weary of my hair turning purple or gray, so I mixed it into my normal shampoo and did not leave it in for long.   I was automatically stunned by the results. My hair almost looks a little better than it did right after I bleached it, as there aren&#x27;t as many yellow tones. The one and only downfall however, is the smell. Shampooing it isn&#x27;t that bad, but blowdrying is a whole other story. It smelled like my dogs farts. I&#x27;m not concerned about the smell though, because this is the best blonde shampoo I have ever used. I learned to breathe through my mouth while blowdrying my hair so I don&#x27;t have to suffocate on that god awful smell.   I have struggled for several years trying to find the right hair product for me, as I have extremely thin hair (I&#x27;m only 24!!!). This not only helps the color, but makes my hair look beautiful after a blow dry. I am extremely grateful for finding this!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent.  Leaves the hair managable and with super shine.  Grey hair can be course and difficult.  This product covers all that plus.</li>
    <li> I agree with a previous reviewer, this product may have worked as described but I could not get over the horrible chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away!  I tried to ignore it but at the end of the day I had to wash my hair numerous times to get the smell out.</li>
    <li> If interested in this product move on to another type or brand. Heavily changes white hair to gray and blue...will not rinse out and I attempted it 3x (foolishly) thinking it might improve, and now look like a permanent Halloween wigged experiement..doe snot perform as label states it will, and my caution is serious, do not use if you have lovely white hair.....people now ask me why I turned my white (very) to gray...I wash attempting to remove slight yellowing and it did not even do that....&lt;br /&gt;answer friends.....is NO NONONONONONONONONO</li>
    <li> seems to take the color out faster</li>
    <li> After just one use I could see a difference and using it a few times a week has brought my hair back to the way it looked the second I left the salon. I know some people said this left their hair a bit purple, but I have very thick and wavy hair and didn&#x27;t have this problem at all. As a conditioner it&#x27;s definitely not the greatest, but as a toner I love it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great. The conditioner caused terrible tangles</li>
    <li> I have gray hair and this product keeps it looking silver, not yellow. I used to find it at our local chain drug store, but it became increasingly difficult to locate. It dawned on me to look for it on Amazon, especially since there are no shipping costs with Amazon Prime....now Amazon is my go to source for this and other drug store necessities.</li>
    <li> The conditioning was okay, but the smell repulsed me!  I would prefer something that either has no scent, or something fresh and appealing...instead of smelling so much like other common hair chemicals.  Sorry, Revlon, but I used it once and threw away almost the whole bottle.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for one that suits me better.</li>
    <li> This conditioner maybe a little too light, yet when used regularly, the hair hue turns into a nice color.  I use it regularly, but a couple of days/week use a heavier conditioner.</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS AND TELL YOU THE HONEST FACT . IN THE SOME AREA&#x27;S IT TURNED MY HAIR PURPLE.. iT MAKES IT MORE ORANGY!!Get the nice in easy light ash blonde and you will loose yellow-orange-brassy color go away for good.. I did!! I am shocked how that hair color works. Made my hair soft too. you will thank me if you do this.. We all want to be blonde not a lemon head right!! or oh my your hair is orange.. I will never use anything else diffrent. great beautiful blonde!!!!good luck all.</li>
    <li> this works rly well. turned my brassy blonde hair platinum w/ one wash. gives me kind of a hipster/edgy look bc its a hint of greyish purple. wears off in a few days but u can just wash again DUH! i only wish it didnt smell like old ladiez</li>
    <li> When you are old and have white hair some times it takes on a little yellow color, this looks terrible...makes me look like a smoker (I have never smoked in my life) I was in Walmart a couple months ago and met a person I had not seen in a long time and they said, wow, if I didn&#x27;t know you better I would think you are a smoker.  That is when I knew I needed to start using Shimmer Lights more regularly. I use it every day now and it not only keeps my hair white but it also makes it very healthy. For an old guy with white hair this product helps keep it white and very soft...I love it...</li>
    <li> I have ash colored hair but after many shampoos it starts to get brassy and I hate it !&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this shampoo AND conditioner and now I love my ash blonde hair again :))</li>
    <li> Purple conditioner will not give you the results you want.  Shampoo is what opens up the hair strand; purple shampoo will make a bigger change than the conditioner.  Plus this doesn&#x27;t condition your hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out either...it just makes no difference</li>
    <li> This product really works.  Use it with the shampoo and you will get rid of the yellow in your hair.  It makes your hair shimmer in the light.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner often to keep my hair a very white blonde (more white than blonde) I actually use the conditioner as a toner a few times a week. I put it all throughout my hair, leave it on for about 20-30 minutes, shower and rinse. While on your head, it&#x27;s bright lavender, but when you rinse out, it&#x27;s a perfect white. If you leave on too long like I do, you get bluish purple tint to the white (almost a grayish hue) I actually go for that look myself. (do a google image search for designer Katie Gallager - that&#x27;s what I go for when I do my hair) love it! Putting the conditioner in my hair for awhile works better than virgin snow by manic panic!</li>
    <li> I know of several places locally to get the Shimmer Lights Shampoo, but I was thrilled to find the conditioner to go with it.  Shimmer Lights really does make my grey hair stand out, plus leaves it really soft and managable.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;However, the conditioner leaves hair a little bit dry.</li>
    <li> this is really great shampoo, takes the dingy yellow out of hair &amp; makes it really shine.</li>
    <li> Okay so far, not very conditioning as a conditioner, but it is helping my color stay blonde. I would recommend mixing it in with a higher quality conditioner (I love the DermOrganic hair masque) and you will have both soft healthy hair along with a nice bright color.</li>
    <li> This stuff is thin, purple, and completely without apparent function.  Conditioners usually leave hair silky and smooth.  Rinse this stuff out of your hair and you can&#x27;t tell it was ever there.  Except for the purple drips all over the shower.  At least it doesn&#x27;t stain things purple, color washes off/out.</li>
    <li> I was recently introduced to this product by a you-tuber who uses it to eliminate brass in platinum blonde hair and I have been very pleased with the results on my own locks. I&#x27;ve heard from several sources that is works better than more expensive products on the market. I haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo yet but I&#x27;ve heard that it is great also. I&#x27;ve read complaints about the smell but I actually like the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution though, do not leave on for more than 30 seconds or use more than 1 day in a row as you will have too many purple tones deposited in your hair. The purple tones will wash away after a day or so but as my hairdresser cautioned, you should not use it every day or you will have purple hair. She also advised me to mix a little with a normal conditioner or shampoo to minimize the purple tones but it&#x27;s one of the best things you can do to keep your blonde platinum without the yellow or orange brassiness.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works very well with the shimmer lights shampoo. It tones down the grey and gives the hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> I have silver hair and love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this only this time and it seems to work well.  My  hair is white so this is the product for me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shampoo hoping it would help my highlights stay bright &amp; last longer. Unfortunately this shampoo &amp; conditioner has literally turned my blonde highlights silver/grey. Sometimes my hair even looks purple. My husband even told me that my hair looks weird &amp; grey. Another drawback to this shampoo/conditioner is that the purple gets everywhere &amp; stains if you don&#x27;t wash it. It goes all over our shower &amp; makes a mess. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Drying and i did not see any difference. Wont buy again</li>
    <li> I have white hair that I am trying to prevent from that yellow as it gets longer and exposed to pollutants. I thought this product would help prevent it and it may be, but it turned my hair from white to bluish gray. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that each bottle was individually wrapped because one of the bottles opened and about a quarter of it spilled into the plastic wrap and didn&#x27;t get onto the rest of the bottle  I am sad that I lost so much of the crème rinse because it is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I used is on my nearly white hair, but the purple showed through. I won&#x27;t use it again. Good luck.</li>
    <li> It definitely toned down the brassines in my hair. I put it on wet hair and sat under my hair steamer for 5 minutes and voila, perfect!</li>
    <li> Does a great job on the gray, but does not moisturize. I have to augment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since my hair turned gray and it&#x27;s better than most expensive &amp;#34;blue shampoos&amp;#34;. My hair is not very porous so I don&#x27;t have to be worried about being a &amp;#34;blue haired old lady&amp;#34;, but when my husband uses it too often, his hair does turn blue. I don&#x27;t think customers can use it every day -- I do use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Helps to get rid of brassiness associated with white and gray hair.  Doesn&#x27;t have much odor, but it has to be rinsed thoroughly or your hair or scalp will be purple.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this conditioner! I use it with TIGI Dumb Blonde violet shampoo. I have bleached hair that tends to go brassy. Usually I put Manic Panic colors on it, but in the summer I spend a lot of time at the beach and pool so I don&#x27;t put color in, since it would just wash out. I let it just be blonde. This really helps take out the brassy tones left from the color I use and the chlorine in the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some parts of my hair are lighter than others and this turns the lightest parts WHITE and the rest is light blonde to dirty blonde. It definitely gets out the yellow tones but the reddish and orange-y tones are harder to get out. You can&#x27;t really tell how much its helped until your hair is dry. The first time I tried it and my hair was still wet I thought it hadn&#x27;t done anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely makes grey look shiny and pretty. I have a little bit of grey in my roots and it looks so shiny and pretty. I hate to have to cover it up! I&#x27;m too young to have grey now but I hope they are still making this when I can go grey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really that conditioning. It softens but not as much as other formulas I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s kinda runny. I alternate with this and a conditioning mask to make sure my hair gets enough moisture. I leave it on for 10-30 mins each time and it hasn&#x27;t turned my hair purple or anything else in my bathroom, or my skin.</li>
    <li> Great exactly what was expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crazy good. I use it almost every time I wash, which is 2-3 times a week. I am always in the water / sun so my color gets brassy quick. After 5 minutes of this, I come out with (almost) salon fresh cool tones. I&#x27;ve used other purple / toning products and this is by far the best. Careful tho, it&#x27;ll stain your tiles so wash away quickly. As others say, it&#x27;s not actually conditioning so plan to use your regular conditioner after. Sometimes I&#x27;ll run it through then put conditioner on over it, which is ok, but I do get better results if I let it sit on by itself, rinse, and condition separately (just like to save time sometimes)</li>
    <li> Great product gives hair a great sheen and softness.  Makes your gray or white hair pop with color. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product delivers what it says, notice the first use, dose have a horrible smell, but leaves after a hour or so, will keep using to see full results, for now love it!!! will alternate shampoos due to this smell, or wash hair 3 hours before going out in public. very happy with my purchase fast delivery, thanks</li>
    <li> However, I DO NOT want my hair purple. Oddly enough I did not notice the purple until someone at work asked me if I had meant to color my hair purple...I was shocked. I have long gray hair and often receive many compliments on it, but I want to keep the gray, not go to purple.  It took quite a few washings to have the color out of my hair. The shampoo seems fine and I did not leave this product in for a long time. I am looking for another conditioner for my hair.</li>
    <li> Works better than the shampoo for &amp;#34;toning&amp;#34;... but it isn&#x27;t a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> It smells!! Yuck! The smell is so weird that I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it. So I threw it away. Never even got to see whether it works or not.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! Its not as rich as I would like it to be, rather runny for a conditioner but it does take the brassiness out of my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging &amp; outstanding product!</li>
    <li> Shampoo was dispensed in the box during shipping. Note to self don&#x27;t order go to local store instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost to return and hastle is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this a couple of times a week to keep my silver hair shiny.  Silver hair has a tendency to yellow.  Shimmer Lights keeps the yellow away.  As a conditioner it&#x27;s not very good. I will usually put the Shimmer Lights on my hair after shampooing and then add some regular conditioner to my hair.  Works great!</li>
    <li> works so well i sometimes have to lay off for a couple washes or i get a blue tint.. which sometimes is what i&#x27;m going for!</li>
    <li> Very nice conditioner for men or women.</li>
    <li> Works well to deposit color but the smell is pretty strong and chemically.  Not pleasant at all. I also find that it makes the texture of your hair a bit wirey, resulting in frizz where frizz doesn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> Very good and nice, only I prefer a large zise.  Same job, same product but smaller size, I recomend it</li>
    <li> Bottle was not it box and it was broke so it left purple shimmer all over the box and other products how do I get a replacement</li>
    <li> I purchased this trying to make my blonde highlights a little brighter.  Well after one use it turned them purple!!!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  The purple washed out after a few washes with another shampoo I use, but I will NEVER use this again.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells like really strong baby powder if you can imagine that. And the smell sticks with you. It&#x27;s very fragrant almost like perfume so even after the shower people can smell it. It&#x27;s very noticeable and I didnt like it! How ever if your trying to make you golden hair more Ashly blonde it does work well! Obviously it takes washing it a handful of times to get that effect though and more the time I didn&#x27;t wanna use it because of the baby powder smell. Also this conditioner doesn&#x27;t make ur hair feel soft like normal conditioner FYI</li>
    <li> If you use the shampoo, this is great with it - or alone!  Does have a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful for getting the brassiness out of color treated blonde hair!! Love it!!! Only use it a couple of times a week though. It will brighten your hair.</li>
    <li> I used this product last year and it worked great, however this year for some reason doesn&#x27;t work as well! It could be my hair color. It also depends on how long you keep it in your hair; sometimes only 8 seconds can make a difference.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, accurate description, quick delivery. A+</li>
    <li> I Love this Product......combined w/ the shampoo this product is great for gray hair. I have very dry &amp; thick hair most all conditioners leave my hair weighted down &amp; flat. ( I have long hair. just a dab will do ya)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Great product for the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find many reviews written on how this conditioner works on dark hair, which makes sense because it&#x27;s not made to be used on dark hair, so I decided to write one myself in case others with dark hair were wondering if this will work for them. I have pitch black hair which I dyed a light ash brown color at home, so naturally, it came out with a red-orange tint; if you use a box dye on black hair, even if the color is cool, your hair will usually come out with a red-orange brassy tint which is especially visible in sunlight. This looks particularly bad if you have warm-toned skin like me. I know Clairol makes a conditioner for brunettes as well, but that one is meant to enhance the red and golden tones, which I want to get rid of. I think the best way to review it would be to break it down into pros and cons, as I have very mixed feelings after using it for a little over a week now.     CONS:  1) The results aren&#x27;t exactly noticeable. My hair still appears orangey. It&#x27;s possible that there has been a slight improvement, but I can&#x27;t really tell. In the conditioner&#x27;s defense though, it is meant for blonde hair, so I imagine, considering the fact that the conditioner is a bright purple color, it would do the job when it comes to blonde hair.   2) Now I have noticed a lot of comments about the conditioner having a horrible smell. And sadly, this is true. But some people may like it; while I hate it, my mother actually likes it. The best way I can describe it is that it sort of smells like one of those potpourri things people put in their bathrooms or perhaps like a heavy perfume that some elderly women are known to wear. In any case, it is a heavy powdery-perfumey smell that strongly lingers in your hair even after it&#x27;s dry; usually I have noticed that a lot of scents fade after I blow dry and straighten my hair, but not this one. My solution to this problem has been to use a better smelling conditioner or simply re-shampooing it (I don&#x27;t use the Shimmerlights shampoo) after washing this one out. But even then, I can still smell it a bit.  3) This is not exactly a con, but just something that seems a bit inconvenient. While most conditioners are thick and more viscous, this one has a more shampoo-like consistency and is drippy, which makes it messy to use, especially since it&#x27;s also such a dark color.    PROS:  1) It does leave my hair feeling very smooth and clean. Seeing the color and consistency, I had initially thought that it would leave some sort of weird residue, but there&#x27;s none of that. It washes out quite easily.     I don&#x27;t think this is a bad conditioner, but seeing that it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect on removing brassiness from dark hair (perhaps it will work better for blondes) AND has a smell that I find unpleasant, I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I have heard raves and raves about this product but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was trying to stop coloring and allow my existing grey to shine as white instead of yellow and OMGoodness, I had six colors going on in my head (because I wasn&#x27;t dying) and the white never did shine white, so I resumed coloring.  On the otherhand, my mother-n-law uses this and has the most beautiful, white hair that you ever want to see so &amp;#34;it works for her!&amp;#34;  Her hair is noticably whte witih a silver shine and she says that you can&#x27;t leave this on but for 60 -70 seconds or so otherwise will give blue tint (which eventually wears off).  She loves it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner (and shampoo sold separate) has been great for my gray hair that was showing ugly yellow due to our hard water. I use it about once a week, using a different shampoo the rest of the time. I can&#x27;t use it more than that because it dries my scalp too much. I like the way my hair looks using this product.</li>
    <li> this is really good for blondes and i used it with the shampo as long as the grey stayed away</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner along with the Clairol Shimmer Lights Shampoo and it seems to work well on helping to minimize the yellow and brassy tones associates with highlights.  Although this is a nice conditioner, I sometimes have to use a bit more than I would like.</li>
    <li> Love this purple shampoo! The best product to counter brassiness! I received my order faster then the projected delivery date!</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this for her hair color</li>
    <li> Love it! I have dark hair with  blonde highlights and this product takes the orange yellowish  tons out leaving a nice honey sandy blond. The only reason i don give 5 starts is because it lets my hair a little dry. I mix with  better conditioning and leave it in for 15 minutes for better results.</li>
    <li> If you have silver hair this will make it look like it is a drab dark gray. It is not good in the least!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it!  The older I get and the more silver I have, the more comments I get about my hair \\&quot;color\\&quot;.  Never does anyone tell me they like my \\&quot;grey hair\\&quot;!  They love, hey, I LOVE, the silver of my hair and it&#x27;s down to the middle of my back!  I only use the conditioner because using the shampoo also, makes my silver show up more blueish and I&#x27;m not in that group yet! I love the yellow tinge out of my silver &amp; white, salt and pepper hair (on the verge of all out PLATINUM) and this conditioner does it! One minute works!</li>
    <li> Use this product once a month and you will have&lt;br /&gt;the prettiest silver hair.  It takes the dullness out&lt;br /&gt;and leaves you with pretty silver highlights.  Don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;over use, more is not better, if you use it every day&lt;br /&gt;or more often that once a month you may have purple&lt;br /&gt;hair which is not usually desirable unless you are&lt;br /&gt;a rock star. ha ha</li>
    <li> Favorite toning shampoo. I like to mix it with a bit of my regular conditioner to ensure I don&#x27;t get any violet tips on my hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny and whiter, but it really dries out your hair. Use with a moisturizing conditioner or use deep conditioning treatments 2x a week.</li>
    <li> Makes gray hair look much deeper. I would give it 5 stars if it had a better smell. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years.</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought -- also cheaper than in stores.  (Not sure why I need to enter sooo many words).</li>
    <li> Is very work on my hair, I very love it . Is just only two day that I been use it but my hair change it a lot .</li>
    <li> I either use this with a good moisturizing shampoo, or Shimmer Lights shampoo with a good moisturizing conditioner, all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Clairol Shimmer Lights Shampoo for years to keep my platinum blonde hair bright &amp; shiny. I&#x27;m glad Clairol has created the perfect companion with their Shimmer Lights Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Clairol Shimmer Lights Products to keep platinum, white, greying, or any light shade of hair sparkling!</li>
    <li> I have complained to hair dressers in the past that I hate that my blonde turns yellow-y...No one ever told me about purple shampoo/conditioner. I was told to use this once per week. I use 1-2 times per week. Mostly once per week..if I go too long and start seeing my hair go golden, I use it and it&#x27;s GONE!</li>
    <li> Horrible soapy smell heavy waxy feel.  I wish I had sent it back but too much was going on at the time.  This product is horrible!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my new highlights are a bit brassy. It DID actually tone down my highlights and it smells nice, but I wasn&#x27;t happy with other aspects of it. This conditioner does NOT detangle hair at all! And it stained my cuticles lavender. I felt like I needed to use another conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> I loved the shampoo and thought that the conditioner would be awesome too! But it left my hair feeling weird and stiff. (My hair texture is fine and in between thin and average.) It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the shampoo either. I would not purchase this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> It works for taking the brassiness out of your hair, however it kind of feels like your going to get cancer right after using it. It definitely does not condition. I gave it to my neighbor.</li>
    <li> Great product for bleached/dyed blondes. Not what I needed to brighten my natural blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for blonde hair!~! Does exactly what it says it will, leaving beautiful blonde behind :) I would recommend not using this as a daily product however as it can be harsh. Well worth the price, will definately be purchasing again. :) XOXO</li>
    <li> I have white hair - not blonde, but white.  Sometimes it gets a yellow tinge from either hot iron or water, I am not certain.  One application of this conditioner knocks it right out.  CAUTION: this is not to be used everyday, your hair will turn blue! I have tried shampoo and conditioners for blonde hair and they have only a tiny bit of bluing in them and they do not work.  This is the very best product.  I used once every two weeks or so.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Conditioner is a widely available popularly priced hair treatment product. Its manufacturer states it has a protein enriched formula for blonde and gray hair that will refresh faded highlights and grey toned hair, remove dull yellow in gray and  restore moisture and manageability to the hair without leaving residue.  The makers add that it contains a blend of emollients, moisturizers and color refreshers for gray, white, highlighted and light blond tinted hair. And that it will soften and smooth coarse gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, of course, a mature product, as the marketers say, and there are newer, presumably better formulations out there.  But I&#x27;ve found that it works nicely; best if, after shampooing, I work the product through my hair, then leave it on for two to five minutes before rinsing out.  To me, the conditioner has a reasonably pleasant aroma, and does a good job of picking up the blond highlights and lowlights, particularly, of course, when used with its companion shampoo.</li>
    <li> Works well keeping my husband&#x27;s white hair beautiful with no yellow and no blue tint!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for getting rid of brassy tones in hair.  I have brown hair with blonde highlights and it works wonders!!</li>
    <li> The scent is more chemical smelling than I prefer.</li>
    <li> Just what my poor sun drenched, yellowed, crying for help hair needed.  Even though I use the special shampoo for silver hair, when I put on just any conditioner the hair looses the help it got from the shampoo.  This conditioner is perfect and my hair looked and felt wonderful</li>
    <li> Is an ok conditioner - not sure it helps keep hair white</li>
    <li> Gives hair a cool purple tint if not washed out completely</li>
    <li> This conditioner keeps my hair looking salon quality in between visits.  Do not leave it for too long or your hair may  have a slight purple color IF your hair is damaged and thin.  I like that it takes out the gold out of my hair and makes it soft. I&#x27;ve tried rustic products which are pretty expensive but this is the best product out there for blondes.</li>
    <li> I love this brand&#x27;s shampoo. I use the shampoo to cool my high lights. The conditioner is a big disappointment because it doesn&#x27;t really condition. I add a little to my regular conditioner to cool the high lights but it is ineffective when it comes to moisturizing and smoothing hair.</li>
    <li> Takes out the bronze tones and you don&#x27;t have to leave it in for too long. Be careful if you do, it can turn hair slightly purple.</li>
    <li> The yellow stayed yellow &amp; my hair turned purple.  I&#x27;ve seen/heard really good things about this shampoo. Must work differently for different people. It didn&#x27;t take away the yellow/brassy color either, just added purple.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo but not the conditioner.  It does leave a rather unpleasant smell.  I use the shampoo which is great and then use my own conditioner that smells nicer.</li>
    <li> What was advertised, was delivered - 100%.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works great. It conditions and tones my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t condition at all.  I purchased a product by John Freida that promised to do the same and it really delivered. But this one, not at all.</li>
    <li> this product stinks, literally. It smells like overly perfumed hair dye and leaves my hair dry and brittle. I would not recommend buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did not notice any difference in my hair color after a week straight of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old enough to get social security but my strawberry blond hair as remained relatively untouched by time until recently. It started to look brassy. Don&#x27;t like the idea of dyeing it but I saw this product online and thought it sounded like it might be worth a try.  Out of the bottle the origin of the name &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34; became immediately apparent.  But it took only one use for the brassy look to disappear. My strawberry blond is back!  I&#x27;m impressed!  The fact that it doesn&#x27;t require a &amp;#34;patch test&amp;#34; is reassuring also.</li>
    <li> Really weird! I got a completely different product from what I ordered. The product I wanted was in a purple bottle and the product I got was in a white bottle. Upon closer inspection I noticed a scanning sticker on the bottle and saw that the product was mislabeled. Even so, obviously no one thought to double check the order. On the plus side I kept the incorrect product and tried and actually liked it! But still double check to make sure everything matches up and make sure your customers end up with the right products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the blonde scene, and was using a quite pricey product before this one. I love this stuff. The smell is almost a powdery clean scent  and it&#x27;s thick rather than watery. The shampoo and conditioner are the same texture just about, and have the same ultra violet coloring.</li>
    <li> Works to bring out shine!</li>
    <li> As a conditioner it sucks, it&#x27;s so liquid and doesn&#x27;t feel like a conditioner at all. But as a toner I love it. I feel that there&#x27;s a huge difference when I use both clairol shampoo and conditioner that when I just use the shampoo. The shampoo alone just isn&#x27;t enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make my hair a little bit softer a combine this conditioner with aussie 3 minute deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Shimmering Lights Conditioner paired with Shimmering Lights Shampoo is a perfect combination for&lt;br /&gt;gray &amp; silver hair, much better the Pantene alternative.  I suggest some experimentation with the length&lt;br /&gt;of time the products are left on the hair before rinsing; no one wants to look like a grandma with blue hair!!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as a toning treatment only, not as a conditioner. I use the conditioner instead of the shampoo because it&#x27;s gentler (although it will still dry/strip your hair-- just not nearly as severely). I use Wen, and I love it but it does seem to increase the brassiness in my blonde hair over time. So when I notice it, I do a toning treatment with this by saturating my dry hair with it, leaving it on for 15 minutes, and rinsing. Then I follow with my Wen (follow with your conditioner) or do a deep conditioning treatment. It removes a LOT of brassiness.&lt;br /&gt;My highlights are a pretty wheat blonde now, and my natural dark blonde is brighter and glassier. I used to use Aveda blue malva, and I like that it seems to have slightly fewer chemicals in it, and the smell is much better, but the concentration of violet color is less and so it is less effective for a single use. It&#x27;s also more expensive. The smell of the Clairol isn&#x27;t good, but it&#x27;s not too far off most chemical shampoo/conditioners. Most people won&#x27;t be using this daily, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I would be careful if you have platinum or very light blonde hair as far as how much of this you use and how often. I had very brassy medium blonde tips, and this took ALL the brassiness out in a single treatment and almost lent TOO much of an ashen, violet tint. If I had platinum hair, I&#x27;m pretty sure it would be light violet tinted. But if you were to use a dilluted amount for a single rinse through, I think you&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely recommend this for any blonde who has noticed brassiness in their color, as well as anyone who came back from the salon with a color too brassy for their liking.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove yellow tinge in gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works and there was a savings in price.</li>
