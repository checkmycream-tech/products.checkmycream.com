      <li>and I have tried more cream than I can remember.</li>

      <li>it seems helped ,I don&#x27;t grow more now ,don&#x27;t know</li>

      <li>I love this stuff for my eczema baby, it isn&#x27;t perfect but works well and can be applied several times a day without him feeling yucky.</li>
      <li>i found out that this cream contains lanolin and MCI which are potent allergens to most individuals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great for my son&#x27;s very sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thicker than most lotions and the smell is not too strong.</li>
      <li>Perfect for this really really dry patches.</li>
      <li>I have dry, scaly and itchy skin in the winter and find eczema moisturizing creams work the best to both fight the dryness and the itchiness.</li>
      <li>wouldnt recommend this to a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;cetaphil cream works great though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It moisturizes my baby&#x27;s skin very well.</li>
    <li> This works surprisingly well on my 2 year old&#x27;s eczema. It doesn&#x27;t cure it, but does help keep it under control so I don&#x27;t have to break out the steroid cream very often. Best product I have found, and I have tried a lot.</li>
    <li> This creme is amazing! My 4 month old daughter had eczema spots on her legs and a really big, rough spot on her arm that were bothering her. I put this on her 3 times the first day and it took most of the roughness away, but there was still some redness on her arm. I did 2 times the second day and the spots were completely cleared up by that night. The creme is thick and very moisturizing, but absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t smell great (or even good, really) but it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that will clear up my toddler&#x27;s rough patches of dry skin. He doesn&#x27;t have full blown eczema, so I can&#x27;t attest to its use on that. However, for severe dry skin, this lotion will clear it up literally overnight!</li>
    <li> Works great on my baby&#x27;s dry sky. She hasn&#x27;t been diagnosed with eczema yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure she has it. I apply this morning and night and give her a little massage and she loves it. Her skin has been restored to baby soft skin like it should be.</li>
    <li> it helps with my little ones dry skin</li>
    <li> Great for my son&#x27;s very sensitive skin! This lotion works wonders :)</li>
    <li> Very thick yet not very absorbent.  Worse, it didn&#x27;t help with my baby&#x27;s eczema at all and left her skin just greasy.  I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> prepare for my baby girl , cheap with great quality .</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this!  It hasn&#x27;t cleared up baby&#x27;s eczema completely but it has helped.  Best we&#x27;ve found so far...</li>
    <li> Love it! Good for infant/toddler/kids with dry skin or infant acne.</li>
    <li> Got this fro son froms my local store.. Boy it was a big mistake!&lt;br /&gt;My son broke out with small itchy dots, i can tell its was itchy because my keep on scratching it and started to cry out loud..&lt;br /&gt;upon further research i found out that this cream contains lanolin and MCI which are potent allergens to most individuals.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using my son&#x27;s Rx 1% HC that worked like a magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldnt recommend this to a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;cetaphil cream works great though. my son never had reaction from it.</li>
    <li> This works great for the body but I used it on my 7 month olds face because he had really bad patches of eczema and it didn&#x27;t help him at all.  So if you need cream for the face I wouldn&#x27;t try this.  Yes I know the description says body cream, I was just hoping it would also work for face. I like that it is not greasy at all. It absorbs well.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to help dry skin.  Excellent price!</li>
    <li> Did not like this as much, the relief from Eczema was not as fast and better as i would expect.</li>
    <li> Nice product. About the same prove as at the drug store, but saves us a trip to the store. My wife loves the product.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on my baby&#x27;s skin it turned splotchy and bright red. I washed it off soon after but she cried and scratched at the patches for a long time afterwards.  We&#x27;ll have to try something else.</li>
    <li> great product in general</li>
    <li> My one month old developed eczema and I purchased this. In less than 3 days I noticed a complete difference! This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Requires multiple treatments, and sometimes it still doesn&#x27;t go away completely,  but my skin looks and feels *so* much better than it was before my Dr. told me what that rash was and how to treat it!  I thought I was allergic to everything.</li>
    <li> My baby had terrible eczema on her cheeks. I tried Aveeno Baby and Cetaphil which both did nothing. Eucerin baby started improving it straight away and after a week there is hardly a spot left.</li>
    <li> This creme is very thick and creamy and has no noticeable smell, which is just what my pediatrician said to use on my son&#x27;s eczema.  It appears to be effective.  I do have one concern, though--the back of the bottle says to &amp;#34;stop use and ask a doctor if symptoms last more than 7 days or clear up and occur again within a few days&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not sure why this warning is there--since it is steroid free, I would assume I could use it all the time like most other lotions.  The star off is because of this limitation that does not exist on other thick, creamy lotions that I can use whenever needed, without limitation.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I have eczema, and I hate lots of the creams I have tried.  Many are heavy and hard to rub into the skin totally, they tend to leave an oily layer on top, or a sticky one.  I received this item to review from vine, hoping against hope that it would not leave a residue, either on the skin or the fingers used to apply it.  Hurray!  No nasty residue of any kind, and it works great.  The price through amazon beats the local retail price by quite a bit.  Will keep buying this, for sure.</li>
    <li> Visible results for dry, itchy skin with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.</li>
    <li> Best for eczema(I also try aveeno)...thanks for this product.after apply for four days,my 40 days baby recovered from the heavily eczema...</li>
    <li> Works great! If you use this product daily and have a child with eczema it is worth every penny! Adults too!</li>
    <li> I bought this since my baby does well with other Eucerin products. Well, this broke him out in a rash so bad I had to take him to his doctor immediately. If your baby has sensitive skin, I would skip this and just stick with Aquaphor. On the other hand, it didn&#x27;t go to waste because to use it as a hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Best babies eczema care lotion period.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on adult eczema, not baby eczema, but it it seems to be just as effective.  It soothes the skin almost immediately, and it does not leave behind an oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that only a small amount spreads well over a fairly large patch of skin, so I will not go through the tube as quickly as I initially thought.</li>
    <li> This cream has worked wonders on my son&#x27;s skin.  He never had dry skin from birth, but all of a sudden, at about a year old, he developed a little runny-nose virus that came with a red patchy rash that looked like eczema (but that the pediatrician says isn&#x27;t eczema...), and at 13 months old, he still gets it off and on.  This Eucerin Baby lotion has been the ONLY thing that has worked. I swear by Burt&#x27;s Bees Multipurpose Ointment (their more natural take on Aquaphor), but in this case that didn&#x27;t work either.  Neither did Aquaphor, Petroleum Jelly, Johnson&amp;Johnson&#x27;s, Bag Balm, Hydrocortisone cream, etc.  The only thing that has returned my son&#x27;s skin to baby soft is this lotion.  It&#x27;s got a great, thick consistency that rubs in well and isn&#x27;t oily-feeling.  It moisturizes better than anything else!  Yay, Eucerin Baby!!  :)</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 6 month old son. He has dry, sensitive skin. It really helps with his skin. I do wish it came in a bigger bottle. I also find that towards the end the lotion is hard to get out. About every 3rd bottle I break the lid off as well---that might be user error. I can own that. Overall, we are very glad that they offer this baby formula and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Ok...I am not a baby.  I LOVE THIS product and will be using it on a regular basis. Its what I call a &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; product, not a bunch of stuff added to it to make it pretty colored or pretty scented...its simple enough its made for babies,&lt;br /&gt;and to me that means its good for ME to use too.  I have very sensitive skin and I have used this head to toe, my feet felt great after a couple of nights of using this, honestly I really am so pleased with this product...I am sure it works for babies and children too...just letting you know it works on &amp;#34;people of a certain age&amp;#34; too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my 5 month old as moisturized as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> We have a couple of people with eczema in our household.  We agree with our physicians that Eucerin and similar products are the gold standard for effective control of eczema.  This Baby version is a nice improvement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;- Thinner than classic Eucerin (which is the thickest).  Just a bit thinner, but it goes on easily, especially on very delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Adds colloidal oatmeal (1%) to the standard formulation.&lt;br /&gt;- No added fragrance, but I smell a slight sweetness from the oats.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;- 5 oz size: big enough to last, but still portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes?&lt;br /&gt;None.  A good tweak on the standard thick eucerin.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the eucerin baby eczema instant relief creme but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make it worse. I would recommend using the instant relief instead.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best cream I&#x27;ve used so far for SEVERE excess and dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a non-greasy greasy lotion that works fast and last long on dry skin, babies and adults alike. Eucerin makes a great product most of the time anyways. I highly recommend this for babies and adults.</li>
    <li> My daughter has battled with eczema since she was an infant.  We are very limited to the types of soaps, shampoos, and lotions she can use.  In fact, several other brands of eczema lotions and cremes cause her eczema to flair up.  Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Creme actually works for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this creme, as it goes on thick and lasts for the entire day.  However, it does not clog the skin. It is one of the few products for babies and small children that prevents dry, itchy skin.  It has a very light, pleasant scent, and my daughter&#x27;s skin looks and feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Eucerin Creme, we have used her prescription cream on very few occasions.  I highly recommend this product for babies, children, and adults with eczema.  Even if it seems like you&#x27;ve tried every product and seen little results, give this one a chance--it really works!</li>
    <li> Works great on eczema! I had tried everything out there and this product is the cheapest and most effective! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> My son has eczema on his legs, his lower back and his elbows.  After using this for a week his dry spots felt soft. He also has very sensitive skin and had no reaction to this cream.  The other thing I like is that it did not leave a greasy feeling after application.  I highly recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> Eucerin is the ONLY cream that relieves my infant nephew&#x27;s extremely itchy dry skin due to Eczema.  A calmer and happy infant keeps the entire family calm and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that this body crème works well on adult skin as well.  I&#x27;ve suffered from Eczema since infancy.  During the winter, the Eczema seems to be worse.  Luckily, my dermatologist recommended Eucerin and I&#x27;ve used this product (along with a prescription drug if necessary) for the past 20 years.  Other than it being expensive, Eucerin products rule!  It&#x27;s truly worth the money!</li>
    <li> I use this cream on some area&#x27;s of eczema and very dry scaly skin.  This works wonderfully! No fragrances dye&#x27;s to cause any extra irritations.  Stops the itching immediately and brings relief when I feel like without it I would itch it raw.  It&#x27;s a true cream, I like how it goes on without that feeling of paste that some products have that are petroleum based.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I wrote an extensive review of the Eczema Relief Therapy Creme in the 2oz bottle and how well it worked for us.  I&#x27;ve not noticed much of a difference between the Body Creme and the Therapy Creme, only that it comes in a larger size.  The ingredients and instructions are the same, and the product inside looks, smells and feels the same.  So I&#x27;ll attempt to summarize:  our baby had very bad eczema and still suffers from flare ups.  This was not a cure, but it moisturized him like nothing else we tried (and we tried a very long list of things: elimination diet, detergents elimination, natural moisturizers, botanicals, adult moisturizers, wet wraps, baking soda baths, oatmeal baths - if someone suggested it we gave it a shot.) It keeps him moisturized all day so we can slather him in it in the morning and his skin is soft until bath time when we slather him in it again.  This didn&#x27;t sting him like some of the other creams we tried, and we noticed he was less fidgety after we put this on his itchy areas. Ultimately a prescription from the pediatric dermatologist was what we needed to get things totally under control, but now we can use this alone for maintenance with great success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned in my other review, I&#x27;m pretty sure there is no difference between the baby version and the non-baby version of this lotion. Like the baby Aquaphor/adult Aquaphor bottles, it&#x27;s simply branded differently so it can be easier to find in the baby section of stores.  The ingredients are identical and the description and active ingredients are identical.  Both say they can be used on babies, children, and adults.  My only complaint is that I wish this stuff came in a giant tub the way other Eucerin creams and Aquaphor creams do since I go through this stuff so quickly.</li>
    <li> I love that this is lotion is thick and works well on my two little ones skin. Their doctor gave me some samples of this and I liked it so I had to get a bigger one.</li>
    <li> I like the cream however the container it comes in makes it ver hard to get it out when it is getting low. I finally ended up taking out scissors and cutting the bottom off so I could get the rest out.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream for adults.  It works on itchy, dry skin and gives relief.  It&#x27;s not too greasy-feeling and has a very light scent that goes away quickly.  BUT it is full of ingredients that need exploring before putting on your baby.  My feeling is, if I can&#x27;t pronounce a word, and have never heard of it, I need to look it up and check on safety first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good cream for adults.  I like it very much.  But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d put it on baby without a lot of research.</li>
    <li> My son has the tendency to develop small patches of eczema on his body.  After applying a coating of original Eucerin cream that comes in the big tubs for a week or so the patches start to go away.  However, the old cream even though it is effective it is annoying to rub it into a wiggly little toddler.  This new baby eczema relief creme rubs in easily and absorbs quickly.  After only a couple of days his little patches are almost gone.  It is the same lovely quality as the original cream but in a much more convenient form.  I am really impressed with this Body Creme.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old son had very very itchy dry skin on his legs and I&#x27;ve used every product out there, including oils that people have recommended. This creme worked like magic just in one day. It&#x27;s thicker than most lotions and the smell is not too strong. I don&#x27;t mind it at all. My son&#x27;s legs dry patches disappeared overnight. He does not have eczema so I can&#x27;t review for eczema relief, however, it cures dry skin like magic. Obsessed!</li>
    <li> This was tried on a toddler with very delicate skin. Though he did not currently have an eczema outbreak, the creme was very soothing and softened his dry, dry skin well. It took a few more seconds of rubbing the creme into his skin than some products, but there was no greasy residue feel as soon as it was absorbed. The lack of any strong aroma was a positive, and this is something we will plan on using when he has signs of significant skin problems.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is thick and creamy and provides an excellent protective barrier to the application area. The only drawback is that the area remains a little sticky for a while, but I think that is to be expected from anything that continues to protect the surface. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of harsh ingredients, which makes it perfect for babies and anyone with sensitive skin. The 5 oz tube is not very big, but since this is more for spot treatment than all-over treatment, a little goes a long ways.</li>
    <li> Eucerin products are amazing and this creme is no exception. This product is marketed towards babies but I actually use it on my own dry, cracked skin and it has been very effective. The creme is thick and rich, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious fragrance. This is one of those products that is pricier than the competition but you are absolutely getting what you pay for here and this creme to me personally is worth every penny. I have no complaints about this product!</li>
    <li> My little granddaughter had a little patch of eczema on her arm. You could hardly see it, but you could certainly feel it. I think it&#x27;s something we caught early. We started using this cream on it after every bath and started noticing improvement within a few days. Within a week, we could neither see nor feel any roughness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is not only effective, but it absorbs quickly and hardly has a scent. She made no complaint when we rubbed it in, so it obviously didn&#x27;t bother her. (She&#x27;s pretty effective at letting us know when something bothers her!) Even though the problem seems resolved, we continue to use it almost every day as protection because, for some reason, that has been a problem area in which dryness seems to come and go.</li>
    <li> The product so far has not helped with the rash on back of my neck, but I still think that it is a very good product.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> best baby lotion for the little one&#x27;s face and can use it everywhere else too</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.  We used Aveeno on my son, but with my daughter it dried out her skin.  The Eucerin is amazing and keeps her skin baby soft!</li>
    <li> too thick but really works</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, and the effect is significant, no stimulation to the skin, the baby is also very safe!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my eczema baby, it isn&#x27;t perfect but works well and can be applied several times a day without him feeling yucky. I will note that it is a dollar more at our local Brookshires, but they often have it buy one get one for a penny!</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleared up my infant&#x27;s facial eczema in 2 days of once daily use. Keeps it away when used nightly.</li>
    <li> Baby has eczema and this is the only non-prescription solution we&#x27;ve found. It works better than Aveeno baby and has no strong fragrance. We&#x27;ll keep buying Eucerine.</li>
    <li> Nice to have this for the children.  It goes on easily and smoothly.  Eczema is not fun for anyone and especially the little ones in our lives.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this creme as our post-bath lotion for over 9 months, and we still love it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for dry itchy skin, baby or adult.  It really helps with my eczema and my children.  Works as well as most prescriptions and seems better for the skin then using steroid creams.  The lotion is a bit on the greasy side, but perfectly reasonable.  I wipe the palms of my hands off on a rag (or my pant lags) after applying.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and it makes my cuticles and fingertips very dry. I use this one my hands in the morning after a shower and it really helps with the dryness. It is initially a little greasy feeling, but does absorb in after a few minutes. Best of all it has no fragrance, unlike most adult formulations!</li>
    <li> My kid has developed very dry, itchy skin this winter.  He doesn&#x27;t really like having raw shea butter on him, so this lotion has really been wonderful-- he can rub it in himself (raw shea butter is a bit difficult to work with even when warmed a bit), and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent that bothers him.  This lotion also seems to promote quick healing-- a real plus when the skin has been scratched raw.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this cream-- will purchase more!</li>
    <li> My daughter has horrible eczema &amp; is on a prescription for oil but you can only put that on once a day &amp; I use this for the rest of the day &amp; it works great!</li>
    <li> Made my son&#x27;s eczema worse</li>
    <li> we have tried all the lotions, babygannics, cetaphil, welda, aquaphor.  This one i found to work the best.  its nice thick creme.    Update:  So my son is 1yr now and eczema has been issue whole time and we tried every lotion out there with little success.  BUT we just found the solution.  Probiotics!  son was sick and had to go on antiobiotics so i went to purchase some probiotics to help with stomach and while researching i saw reviews people claiming help with eczema it wasn&#x27;t why i was looking for but i just remembered that.    anyways winter is here and we noticed excemza starting flare up more but we started probotics and in a week i couldn&#x27;t believe how he cleared up.  still has a little behind knees that&#x27;s usually the worst spot for it.  but its about 90% clear better than any lotion.</li>
    <li> Baby had mild eczema.  Bought this and the first bottle only lasted like 10 days.  Baby&#x27;s skin just sucked it up.  Eczema didn&#x27;t clear until second bottle and that one lasted much longer.  Cons: I don&#x27;t like how difficult it is to get out the lotion at the end.  Also, the silver labeling on the bottle comes off on your hands and I don&#x27;t like that.  I worry I&#x27;m getting it on my baby.</li>
    <li> Love it.. Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, stop looking for another lotion. This is awesome!</li>
    <li> My infant daughter was having reactions to J&amp;J pink baby lotion and her doctor recommended Eucerin.  I like this product because it covers her skin well and is a thick lotion, not petroleum jelly like vaseline or aquaphor.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews for products, but I felt I had to after using this on my baby last night.  My baby was recently diagnosed with eczema and I had been using Aveeno baby lotion and it had been helping her.  I decided to try this product out since it was specifically for eczema and I regret it!  Immediately after applying it my baby started screaming and her skin turned bright red.  I had to rebathe her in order to get the cream off.  I am really disappointed as it states dermatologist and pediatrician recommended but I would never recommend this considering the reaction she had.  I am contacting the company as well to inform them of my experience.  I am going back to baby Aveeno and will try their eczema line instead.</li>
    <li> My son has severe eczema.  I feel like he&#x27;s tried everything there is.  This creme is really rich, which is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on him.  But out of everything we&#x27;ve tried, I think this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> I brought this stuff for my son and it is truly useful.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve just signed up for a subscription I have been using this on my 6month olds severe weeping eczema on his cheeks. Omg best I&#x27;ve used hands down. I&#x27;ve tried aveeno. Did nothing. Natural baby spa and healing naturals. I still use healing naturals eczema wash (this is the absolute best wash).coconut oil baths, olive oil rub downs. Wet treatments. Aquaphor when we are out every half hour. Constant application of ointments and creams. steroids, which kinda curbed the severity of the eczema but never fully got it to go away and another breakout would come before first fully healed.But for creme I&#x27;ve done them all. This has cleared his skin literally far better then the steroid cream I&#x27;ve been given. His entire cheek area was weeping so I spent a whole day and night doing wet compresses and gently patting him dry in between compresses until it began to dry out. I then put a tiny bit of steroid cream on his cheeks while he slept with this eczema cream ontop and the instant relief version because he was tearing at his face and neck. (this also works wonders my son will be itching and I apply instant relief and he stops) With the first use his skin was far smoother than it had been and stayed smooth and hydrated! Yay. Steroid cream with aquaphor hadn&#x27;t even done this. I continued to use cream every few hours and the crust that formed had began to peel back, after one day had completely peeled and healed. His skin is so smooth and feels softer than it has ever felt. Like after 2hours it still feels soft deep into the skin.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with my baby&#x27;s skin for almost 6months. This has worked the best. It has truly been a blessing and to watch it work and transform my sons skin is AMAZING! DEF A MUST FOR SEVERE ECZEMA</li>
    <li> This is what I use when my daughters eczema flares up. This is a cream and not a lotion, this is thick</li>
    <li> I give this a 3, because it was a 1 &amp; a 5. When my son was smaller it worked wonders with every little breakout. His eczema is horrible now. His skin stayed clear up until about 15 months. The doctor recommended mixing it with the hydrocortisone cream and applying it to the spots. It does absolutely nothing. Skin still looks the same. Which is horrible, some spots I could even say got worse. But everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I guess I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s good for the younger babies.</li>
    <li> Works best on mild eczema and for eczema control. For tougher spots, I highly recommend Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy. I use the body creme on my son, and it works great on his arms and legs. His cheeks tend to get dry and red, and the Instant Relief formula works better for those spots.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter that suffers from very dry skin, although it is not eczema.  We are always on the hunt for lotion that really treats and heals the dryness. After using this lotion for only a few days we noticed a very marked improvement. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It does stick to the skin and is thick and creamy. I don&#x27;t like that it feels tacky for so long on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t have any real smell so that is good especially for skin that is sensitive to perfumes and scents. I tried this on myself and it didn&#x27;t really help my dry skin much, it seems to lay on top and doesn&#x27;t get fully absorbed. But it is gentle and it seems to provide a protective layer.</li>
    <li> works really well on my baby&#x27;s exzema. Better than any other brand</li>
    <li> This has been the best for excema on my small children. It clears everything up in about 2 days!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I have a 2 month old who started having &amp;#34;baby acne&amp;#34; about 3 weeks ago and it was getting so bad!! I felt so awful for her I took her to her doctor and they prescribed hydrocortisone but didn&#x27;t work. Then I bought aveeno baby eczema cream, didn&#x27;t work. Finally I tried thus magnificent eucerin and after the first time I applied it to her face about 2 hours later I saw dramatic results no redness. After the second time I applied it finally the roughness and bumpy look was vanishing. It&#x27;s like a miracle cream and I will keep purchasing.😃😃</li>
    <li> Super greasy!!! I think plain Vaseline is less greasy and works better</li>
    <li> I have severely dry, cracked heels and soles. Nothing worked. Everytime I have a pedicure, the pedicurist would give me all kinds of unsolicited advice from Vaseline to olive oil. She said I had severely dry feet. One day, a friend gave ne this to try for my feet. I felt the difference the following day. My feet were so soft and smooth that it got my husband&#x27;s attention. He always teased me about how dry my feet were and how it reminded him of velcro. I rub this on my feet liberally every other night and it maintains the smoothness. I could probably do it every night but I&#x27;m conserving. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great for Eczema and very dry skin relief for my kids. No perfumes, etc.</li>
    <li> My son has very bad eczema.  I was using the Aveeno brand on him for awhile but he had a very bad outbreak and it wasn&#x27;t helping at all. I tried this and it started working the next day.  I also like the feel of this lotion better.</li>
    <li> Works great for my two year olds eczema.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> Works great on my kiddo&#x27;s itchy skin</li>
    <li> I use this as hands creams  ,I grow eczema on hands after touched some cleanser in kitchen  or if I use office&#x27;s hand soap....it seems helped ,I don&#x27;t grow more now ,don&#x27;t know if its good to use  everyday so I only do 1 time per day .</li>
    <li> My wife has been using various Eucerin products for years and recently I have joined her. As I have gotten older I have more and more of a problem with dry skin and mild eczema. This is sort of nasty stuff to treat even in its milder form. I must say that this Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Cr&amp;egrave;me does all it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;It is practically odorless which is a big plus as far as I am concerned and when applied it almost instantly soaks into the skin bring relief rather quickly. Unlike some other product; different brands, I have had no allergic reactions to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is a bit more costly than some I have used but as far as I am concerned it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> Over the past 14 months, my husband and I have been in a consistent uphill battle with our baby daughter&#x27;s skin having had move to this high elevation region for his work. Her skin was dry and void of any moisture. On top of it, she turned out to have so many allergies pertaining to her skin so we were truly limited with what we could use on her. It seemed as though that regardless of what &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; solution we were using on her, would make her break out in hives. On top of that, through an elimination diet, we found out she was allergic to casein which would make her eczema significantly worse while giving her hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to now, she&#x27;s just gotten over three allergic reactions this past month  to either soap or a brand of cereal that didn&#x27;t note milk in its ingredient list. As a last chance before we saw the dermatologist for the 5th time, we decided to try Eucerin Baby Eczema products since she does well with Aquaphor (same company). Although its been one day, the results are amazing! No hives! No outbreaks! Soft, baby soft, skin! We put the itch therapy cream on first after her bath to soak in and then the lotion. Her skin is SO moisturized this morning, her eczema patches that I would have to place Aquaphor on are healing faster and she&#x27;s scratching less on her patches. I don&#x27;t think anyone, except mothers and father who have gone through a similar situation, can understand the joy this brings to my soul to not see my child in discomfort everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Eucerin! I&#x27;ll be buying this until the end of time!</li>
    <li> maybe a little allergy,and I do not like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!! Works wonders on my baby&#x27;s skin and I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and already my sons skin has improved!! Perfect for this really really dry patches.</li>
    <li> Item price is very reasonable, use effect is very good also, the most important thing is that it does not let a person for some people who are allergic allergies, that is the key</li>
    <li> Very sweet, mother with a good, the next need can also buy.</li>
    <li> Only lotion that helps my allergy excema baby</li>
    <li> A little thicker than Aveeno so it lasts longer. I use this at night for my baby&#x27;s eczema and itchiness.</li>
    <li> I usually use Eucerin Original Healing Lotion for my dry skin. It works well and seems to keep my eczema at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this cream on a baby, just on myself. I&#x27;m not sure why this is being marketed for babies as this lotion works well for adults. It is fragrance, dye, and steroid free. It felt slightly greasy but it absorbed quickly and felt lighter in comparison to the Original Healing formula. And it helped to clear up my slight patches of eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, seems like a great lotion if you&#x27;re looking for something to help with dry skin and eczema.</li>
    <li> The creme comes in a 5.0 oz easy to squeeze tube and it&#x27;s size makes it portable. I liked that it&#x27;s fragrance free and seemed to have a somewhat thick consistency. The creme has calming oatmeal, ceramides to strengthen the skin&#x27;s barrier and Licochalcone (licorice root) improves appearance of irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured anyone could use it since it&#x27;s dye, fragrance and steroid free, not just for babies. My hands have been particularly raw, chapped and uncomfortable this winter. I also use a lot of strong chemicals to clean with and that could be another reason for my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it multiple times a day and it never seemed to help with the dryness or chapped skin. I didn&#x27;t feel that the application of the creme would soften the skin or feel like it was protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My girlfriend has eczema and I thought she might benefit from trying it. She said it felt like applying water to her skin. It wasn&#x27;t thick enough or have enough of an emollient base. She prefers natural products and uses shea butter, which works wonders for her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on a babies skin. It might work well since their skin is not as chapped or dry. It would be hard to recommend because it&#x27;s a small tube and about $7.00 and it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough.  I think if you&#x27;re a mom that&#x27;s concerned about putting a natural product on your baby than this wouldn&#x27;t be the creme for you.</li>
    <li> I have dry, scaly and itchy skin in the winter and find eczema moisturizing creams work the best to both fight the dryness and the itchiness. So I was very interested to try this out. It does a great job locking in the moisture and calming down the itchiness. I used it both on my body and as a hand cream. The only qualm I have about this is it is a little greasy/sticky.  I have been using Aveeno&#x27;s Eczema Therapy for awhile and still prefer that as it seems to leave a slightly less greasy residue, yet still does a great job moisturizing the skin and calming itchiness. But the Eucerin product is a good one, especially if used right before bedtime at night.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, and I tend to stick with products that are formulated for babies -- not because I am a big baby, but because those products tend to be less harsh on everyone&#x27;s skin. This is a very nice cream that makes my skin feel soft and smooth while greatly reducing the flakes and dryness I have come to lament. Recommended.</li>
    <li> With three kids under 10, and all of them with various skin (mostly eczema) problems, I think we have probably tried everything on the market with the words &amp;#34;treats eczema&amp;#34; in the marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best ones we have used to date, as it 1. has not dyes or fragrance (a must for us, and considering it&#x27;s relatively easy to find now, a no brainer) 2. does not leave a greasy feel like many other expensive eczema lotions.  3.  Actually works...unlike the Aveeno equivalent, for instance, which seems to almost be a placebo it was so ineffective (for us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, and of course not just for baby...we use this on our kids aged from 3 up to 10.</li>
    <li> First stuff to really help my toddlers excema</li>
    <li> This cream goes on thick, but does not leave a greasy film that can be left behind with other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. This is the main selling point for me on any lotion. Next is smell. Even the ones that are \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; usually smell like the inside of my grandmother&#x27;s medicine cabinet and I end up not using them ($$$). This lotion is legitimately unscented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for keeping rough, scaly skin soft and moisturized to prevent itching before it starts. If I had a hot-spot, this didn&#x27;t do much to quell the itching in the short term, but I feel like it helps my problem areas before they flared up.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews on it so I decided to try this instead of Aveeno baby Eczema. It didn&#x27;t work for baby&#x27;s eczema. He had small patches on his back so I purchased this and used it a few times a day for about a week and didn&#x27;t notice a big change. The week before I had purchased this though, I was just using Aveeno baby lotion and that seemed to clear it up more. I am curious to know if Aveeno Baby Eczema would have worked. It is a nice cream in the sense that it isn&#x27;t greasy and oily. It is though, a little more of a cream than lotion. Wanted to love it but didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference/change.</li>
    <li> I am an adult that has had eczema for many years.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of stuff from OTC, Rx, various cortisone treatments.  Although most do work to curb the itchiness to some extent most eczema sufferers will tell you that treatment is a LONG TERM process which means you are using lots of this stuff for a long time.  This becomes somewhat concerning especially when one is using the cortisone treatments over long periods of time.  I used various cortisone treatments off and on for years and my skin would really start to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff uses natural oatmeal to curb the itching combined with a number of moisturizers and skin protectants.  It stops the itch and feels good going on.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness or residue behind.  It has worked as well if not better than anything else I have tried including Rx and I haven&#x27;t felt any adverse side affects with using it.  This isn&#x27;t going to magically make ones eczema disappear but it has helped a great deal with the itching at the least.&lt;br /&gt;This is marketed for babies but as an adult eczema suffer I would highly recommend this to anyone at any age to try.  The percent concentration of colloidal oatmeal is the same as other OTC products with colloidal oatmeal marketed to adults and others (1%).&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of these products available.  One is a &amp;#34;Body Creme&amp;#34; and another &amp;#34;Instant Therapy Creme&amp;#34;.  The Instant one is supposed to have a cooling affect to help with flare ups but I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference.  It isn&#x27;t clear what produces the pro ported &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;.  Stick with the Body Creme as it is cheaper per ounce.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a 5oz Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Creme and a 2oz Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Instant Therapy for review over the last month. Since the two products are very similar, I am writing this as a joint review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an infant. I have been an ezcema patient for over thirty years and I have tried more cream than I can remember. I am familiar with the Eucerin brand, but I think these are their newer offerings since in the past Eucerin is more of a competition to Cerave. However, these two Eucerin offerings are in fact more of a direct competitor to Aveeno because their active ingredient is Colloidal Oatmeal 1%, which is a skin protectant that is also used in many Aveeno creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they have the same active ingredient, there is really no significant difference in their performance in my experience with them over the last month. I don&#x27;t think there is any surprise here. The two Eucerin offerings have reasonable smell (in fact the body cream smells quite like Aveeno), which is important: there is no fragrance since fragrance can potentially cause unnecessary skin irritation. Honestly, if you are already seeking out for ezcema treatment, that is the last thing you want. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between the two Eucerin offerings here is their thickness but NOT their concentration (both list the active ingredient at 1%). The body cream is thinner, while the “instant therapy” is thicker. In other words, the body cream creates a thinner moisture barrier, whereas the latter creates a thicker barrier. Personally I prefer the body cream since I don&#x27;t like thick creams, but it is true that the body cream wears off faster since it is thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the overall effect, well, I have to say that they are ok for everyday use. Honestly, I have already accepted my “fate” and I don&#x27;t expect there is any cure to my ezcema. In this regard, these Eucerin products do not disappoint. Theyare good at keeping the skin protected, but they do not stop the itch or helps with the condition in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were in the market to look for moisturizers and if I want to use a colloidal oatmeal product, I would essentially price-compare between these and Aveeno and just buy the more affordable one. For what they are, I happily give them 5/5.</li>
    <li> Did wonders on my babies... love it</li>
    <li> great lotion for babies with eczema.  contains oatmeal, which is what i wanted.  i go through enough of this stuff to feed a small army if that army ate lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick, goes on thick, and smells only slightly funky, but i keep buying it because it works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy which is great. But didn&#x27;t work for our baby</li>
    <li> Our daughter has the most sensitive skin ever. On top of occasional exzma patches, the tiniest irritants give her bumps or rash like patches on her skin. This is the only cream that will immediately clear up any exzma and irritation and give her silky soft skin. But, you have to keep using it daily. If we go even 2 days without this cream, her patches will come back. The cream is nice and thick and has no overpowering scent like some aveeno products. My only gripe, is it&#x27;s very expensive for such a small amount.</li>
    <li> One of the only creams to work for my sons eczema. He&#x27;s two and we&#x27;ve tried so many other brands with all different price tags. I love that even though it&#x27;s cream, it doesn&#x27;t stay greasy once applied. It keeps my sons skin looking clear I just wish they made it in a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Has really helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s mild eczema!  I apply this twice a day on my daughter&#x27;s skin- behind her knees, elbows and behind her ears.  And within a couple of days the redness and dryness has gone away!  It has a nice thick consistency and isn&#x27;t heavily scented.</li>
    <li> Feel puckery on the skin.</li>
    <li> My 9 month old has mild eczema, his skin was starting to get rough, rash-y, and irritated after a couple weeks of only using Burts Bees lotion + dry, cold, southern California weather. Tried the healing ointment from Aquaphor and it didn&#x27;t make a difference. Within 1 day of using this Eucerin creme, the roughness went away, and within 3 days even the redness/irritation went away! I apply at least twice a day and it is now a must-have until summer!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I use this on my 7 month old&#x27;s face. He doesn&#x27;t have eczema but it keeps his complexion pristine! Many have complemented how clear his skin is and this is why. Any minor bumps, irritation and even baby acne are cleared up shortly after applying! Thick and odorless. I use it on his face even near his eyes with no problems.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent! Rich and creamy, it cleared up eczema and redness quickly on my 8 month old&#x27;s sensitive skin. We use it twice a day. The cream gets a five star review but the bottle gets a one star review. It is really hard to get the lotion out of the tube when it is less than half full and I have broken two caps trying to squeeze out the contents. Eucerin, please sell this cream in a pump bottle, then it would be so much easier to use ever bit of the fabulous cream inside.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff great on baby&#x27;s skin, seems like everything else she is sensitive to, but this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Only lotion that will work on my toddler&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  It helped clear my son skin up.  No more dry patches.</li>
    <li> Better than coconut oil, olive oil and any other lotion. This repaired my daughter&#x27;s sand paper skin.</li>
