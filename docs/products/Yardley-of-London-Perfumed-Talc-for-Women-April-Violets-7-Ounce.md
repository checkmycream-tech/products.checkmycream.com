      <li>I had gotten some violets cologne from london many years ago as a gift and could not find it after that.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent of Violet.</li>
      <li>I love the scent of Violet, except this smelled like the Violet flavored candy I got at Plimoth Plantation</li>
      <li>I have bought this talc before and knew it is a lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>Yardley of London should do better than this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a lovely product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to find the violets in the talc.</li>
      <li>I might have loved it if I hadn&#x27;t had the candy first.  </li>
      <li>The tin container is very pretty and looks nice on my dresser.</li>
      <li>The talc itself is very nice and soft.</li>
      <li>they will smell fabulous all day</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fragrance is light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Very spicy and warm.</li>
      <li>I am a nut for scents and this is one an older friend liked</li>
      <li>Useful too!</li>
      <li>Powder is great as it lasts so long and never goes rancid!  </li>
      <li>Clean can, no rust spots, no dents, no paint scratched off.</li>
      <li>She loves violets and loves this powder because it smells of sweet violets.</li>
      <li>But not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>This powder is lovely and soft and fresh!</li>
      <li>This talc is nice if only the sweet smell lasted longer.</li>
      <li>But hopefully my young friend will enjoy it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like standing in a cood forest with the scent of fresh violets, all around.</li>
      <li>The scent is light enough as a talc so will use it, but may have to combine the toilette water with another scent to get something I like better.</li>
      <li>Viloet is hard to find - so I was delighted to find this!</li>
      <li>It does not smell good and it is not like other yardley flavours.</li>
      <li>Its nice, but I find the perfume a little strong for me.</li>
      <li>Nice, soft powder for the hot, humid climate I live in, and</li>
      <li>Looks like it came off the shelf brand new and clean.</li>
      <li>But, once it is lightly dusted on it smells soft and just like violets.  </li>
      <li>and so it wasn&#x27;t exactly the scent I was looking for myself.  </li>
      <li>I made many trips from the nearby Ozark woods to our home in Arkansas using a long piece of tin roofing to carry beautiful tiny fragrant wild violets and planted them under my bedroom window only to have the chickens scratch and rip them up looking for what was underneath when I went into the house.</li>
      <li>good for first thing in the mourning to layer with a few other light fragrances.</li>
      <li>the parfum is very discret too.</li>
      <li>I hope this scent is available in the future.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, a light dusting of the powder smells differently!  </li>
      <li>I WILL be buying more of them, but in other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stuck with it because of the &#x27;no return&#x27; policy on this.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t smelled such a delicate and lovely spring-like scent since childhood!</li>
      <li>Yardley powders ARE silky soft on the skin.</li>
      <li>A lovely, delicate fragrance.</li>
      <li>I even applied some to my skin hoping it would &#x27;change&#x27; chemically and become more subtle.</li>
      <li>It makes it hard to apply smoothly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this powder, and was delighted to find it again, as it had been discontinued. I used it years ago. It&#x27;s fragrance is light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Florida humid climate.....the parfum is very discret too. Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The powder is a nice texture, and the scent is lovely.  Have bought an extra one for when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the Yardley perfume of the same name, again, just wish the scent would last longer.  Feels nice too!</li>
    <li> But, once it is lightly dusted on it smells soft and just like violets.  I happened to have the Choward&#x27;s violet candy on hand when the powder came in, did a comparison sniff test, and they do smell the same.  Fortunately, a light dusting of the powder smells differently!  Nice, soft powder for the hot, humid climate I live in, and I do not smell like a candy factory when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this scent. I absolutely love the scent of Violet. This just plain stinks. Yardley of London should do better than this.</li>
    <li> I am a nut for scents and this is one an older friend liked so I bought the toilette water and talc.  The scent is light enough as a talc so will use it, but may have to combine the toilette water with another scent to get something I like better.</li>
    <li> It does not smell good and it is not like other yardley flavours. I would not recommend it for a buy</li>
    <li> smells delightful. good for first thing in the mourning to layer with a few other light fragrances. Very happy to have it and will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Viloet is hard to find - so I was delighted to find this!</li>
    <li> product arrived unsealed and opened</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t smelled such a delicate and lovely spring-like scent since childhood! It&#x27;s so hard to find Yardley and I had given up until Amazon. I hope this scent is available in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law.  It came the day after Christmas, but it came all the way from England.  She didn&#x27;t mind getting it a tiny bit late.  She loves violets and loves this powder because it smells of sweet violets.</li>
    <li> I had gotten some violets cologne from london many years ago as a gift and could not find it after that.  I&#x27;m glad to find the violets in the talc.</li>
    <li> A very nice gift for a friend.  I have bought this talc before and knew it is a lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> This powder is lovely and soft and fresh! It&#x27;s like standing in a cood forest with the scent of fresh violets, all around. It&#x27;s just a lovely product.</li>
    <li> This made a nice gift.  I love the scent of Violet, except this smelled like the Violet flavored candy I got at Plimoth Plantation and so it wasn&#x27;t exactly the scent I was looking for myself.  I might have loved it if I hadn&#x27;t had the candy first.  But hopefully my young friend will enjoy it!  Powder is great as it lasts so long and never goes rancid!  Useful too!</li>
    <li> Its nice, but I find the perfume a little strong for me. The talc itself is very nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I get this every year with my anticipated gift card for my birthday.  It is a treat and it lasts about a year because I use it sparingly</li>
    <li> I love the smell of violets. When I was about 12 I made many trips from the nearby Ozark woods to our home in Arkansas using a long piece of tin roofing to carry beautiful tiny fragrant wild violets and planted them under my bedroom window only to have the chickens scratch and rip them up looking for what was underneath when I went into the house. This talc is nice if only the sweet smell lasted longer. It goes away in a very short while without any chickens involved. The tin container is very pretty and looks nice on my dresser. I give it four stars for the hint of violet and the container.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this violet talc its like floating in violet aroma all day you can sprinkle some on your clothes too they will smell fabulous all day its a happy, joyful, sweet and innocent fragrance I love it !!</li>
    <li> But not too sweet.  Perfect if you adore the smell of Parma violets and I do. Of course the quality of the powder is excellent too</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of it. Felt weird.</li>
    <li> Came bubble wrapped in a nice size box. Clean can, no rust spots, no dents, no paint scratched off. Looks like it came off the shelf brand new and clean. Gift ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect, having never smelled this Yardley scent before, but purchased it based on other reviews. Let me add that I have other Yardley Talc scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought upon opening the tin was \\&quot;Venetian Violet\\&quot; Candy! It smells exactly like that small purple square pack of those candy&#x27;s you can smell standing 10 feet from the store counter. Very strong. I find it very VERY strong. Not &#x27;light&#x27; at all, and very nauseating. Overpowering. I consider \\&quot;English Rose\\&quot; delicate. I consider \\&quot;Iris\\&quot; or Lily of the Valley\\&quot; springlike. I especially love Sandalwood. Very spicy and warm. Rather like Opium perfume. THIS is horrible. I even applied some to my skin hoping it would &#x27;change&#x27; chemically and become more subtle. It just took on a strange undersmell. Like -rotting- flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But kudo&#x27;s to those who found it here for purchase, and who love it. I respect everyone&#x27;s personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Yardley powders ARE silky soft on the skin. I WILL be buying more of them, but in other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stuck with it because of the &#x27;no return&#x27; policy on this. So I will probably use it after my bath, when I am staying home and going to sleep. If I CAN sleep...smelling this stuff.</li>
    <li> A beautiful product.  Quality talc - no fillers.  A lovely, delicate fragrance.</li>
    <li> The smell of this talc matches that of the perfume, but the talc seems rather coarse to me.  Not nearly as fine as some I&#x27;ve used.  It makes it hard to apply smoothly.</li>
