<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is an excellent hair dryer.  Works even better than we expected.</li>
    <li> Been through so many hair dryers and with waist length thick hair I honestly can say this is the BEST one yet!!&lt;br /&gt;My good friend recommended it to me and I&#x27;m so pleased I listened to her. Just yesterday we got together for a shopping trip and she said my hair was so straight and shiny with no frizz...I said, &amp;#34; Its my new Sedu dryer &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it &amp;#34; ...my dry time in the morning has been reduced to 15 min&#x27;s as opposed to 45 min&#x27;s...and also I&#x27;ve been getting lots of compliments on my hair at the office.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE LOVE this hair dryer!!!</li>
    <li> It dries my hair with speed and leaves it with shine.  It is fairly compact and quieter than most dryers.</li>
    <li> I purchased a very expensive set of Sedu Products for my wife for Christmas. I purchased the sedu flat iron as well as a Sedu Hairdryer. Purchased on Folica.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month of using the products the hair dryer proceeded to burn a large chunk of my wife&#x27;s hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called customer service and they put me in contact with the manufacturer, who just so happened to be the owner of Folica.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to John Wergeles the owner of the company who informed me that they didnt believe me but that they would accept their products back for a refund. I asked who was going to be responsible for fixing my wifes hair! They told me to visit a salon and asked me to submit receipt. I also spoke to John on the phone after returning the products and he said he would send me a check for the cost of fixing my wifes hair. He denied his product was to blame and that my wife had thin hair. My wife is Hispanic and so therefore that argument is false!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have asked John to honor his claim that he would pay for my wife&#x27;s hair to be fixed. He now refuses to do so and denies ever saying such a thing.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer. I have so much hair and it is really thick and this blow dryer dries my hair so fast! It really is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Great and very less frizz when compared to other dryers that I used.</li>
    <li> This dryer may be expensive, but I don&#x27;t regret spending a penny.  It works incredible. It leaves my normally curly, frizzy hair - straight and frizz free.  I also cut my drying time in half in comparison with my old hair dryer.  I own a chi rocket, I loved it, but it was too heavy on the hand, you won&#x27;t have that problem with this hair dryer.  Trust me, you will love it...lightweight, effective, and compact; perfect for traveling or for use at home.</li>
    <li> I use a blow dryer daily, and after months of debating on buying this (because of the cost) I went for it. I normally use a $20 drug store blow dryer. they are loud, and make you sweat like crazy afterward and take forever to dry my hair. I used this just this morning and HUGE difference. I will say it&#x27;s heavier than the drug store dryers that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but for me I can live with that. It&#x27;s a lot quieter than the other dryers, other dryers have a loud high pitch sound to them like an airplane engine. This there is no high picth sound, it just sounds like high force air being blown out, no super loud noise, in fact both my young kids slept through it while I dried my hair. This doesn&#x27;t get super hot so you aren&#x27;t sweating like crazy just from drying your hair. I have long thick hair and normally I have to let my hair air dry for 30 min or so then blow it in sections then straighten it. This usually takes me at least 30 minutes for this process. Today I got out of the shower and towell dried my hair just a bit and started drying it. Seriously all it took me was 10 min to go from wet hair to dry, and straightgened! I was shocked! I didn&#x27;t even have to use my straightener all that much either because it was dried so straight on it&#x27;s own. I can see my hair will  be getting healthier from less straightening and less heat from the blow dryer. This is an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, its small and powerful, exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to have as much &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; as my old Solano did, but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized how quickly my hair dried using the Sedu.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> It was more than I expected, package was deluxe and product quality is super.  I am in love with my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I purchased this for my wife, so I&#x27;m relaying some information.  I&#x27;ve long since lost any need for hair products.  The weight is surprisingly light for the power of the unit.  The heat does not fry her hair as previous units have.  On a note to other potential gift-buyers, this is markedly quieter than others I have heard which helps since she gets ready while I am still asleep close by.  I sleep through her use rather than being consistently woken up by her last one.  Everything else is exactly as advertised and I won&#x27;t duplicate.  I will add that there is a small loop near the base on the power cord designed to loop onto a hook for storage.  This may be standard fare but was new to me and surprisingly useful.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware: Top rated hair dryer on Folica, is made by Folica.  This begs the question: are the reviews fair/unbaised.</li>
    <li> Beware of this dryer, it burned my hair in several spots causing it to completely damage and break off. A lot of money for something that can malfunction so easily.</li>
    <li> The dryer sat in my closet waiting for a trip, and when I did open it, hoping to take it to the Philippines, the entire dryer fell apart in pieces when I opened it. Too much time had passed for me to return it; but I was very bummed and had to run out and get an inferior dryer quickly for my trip.</li>
    <li> Is it the best?  I don&#x27;t know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.  But I am very happy with the Sedu.</li>
    <li> This dryer is professional quality and, it does work very well if you have the muscles to operate.  It is too heavy to travel with.</li>
    <li> This is the first hairdryer that I have ever owned that&lt;br /&gt;1) had a longer cord so you don&#x27;t feel restricted&lt;br /&gt;2) is quiet but VERY powerful&lt;br /&gt;3) really smooths the hair without making it flat&lt;br /&gt;4) dries my hair fast but not too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST BUY IN MY OPINION!</li>
    <li> My old dryer broke and I was not sure what kind of product I wanted to get. It turned out the Sedu Revolution Pro is the answer.  It feels like a real professional dryer! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many cheap dryers ($30-40) and a few pricier ones ($60-80).  I took a leap and paid more for what I hoped would be the perfect dryer.  It does the job, has a nice, compact size, great cord length, but the dryer is so loud!  I still use the dryer, but after my 5 year old complained, I stopped using it on her hair.  It is simply too loud...actually look forward to it breaking so I can feel justified to purchase a quieter replacement.</li>
    <li> I am in hair school and his dryer is perfect! Works perfectly, the best dryer out there for sure. I love it.</li>
    <li> I was incredibly wary about purchasing this blowdryer, being too skeptical about how effective and true-to-claim it was. I love this blow-dryer. For a point of reference, I am Asian with fine, straight, and shoulder-length hair (and a fair amount of it).      First, the distributor: This ships from folica.com, an excellent distributor/vendor. They are quick to ship. I ordered this item on Friday, and it came in on Monday. It came in perfect condition--even the nice box that the dryer comes in was not dented/scratched.    Now, the dryer: It is compact with a solid feel. (I am not of the opinion that it&#x27;s heavy at all.) The cord is very long--unnecessary, but convenient. It normally takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair with a Remington dryer from Target. This cuts my drying time to 6 minutes. The highest heat setting is a little too hot for me, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I don&#x27;t think that this dryer is loud. I like the two attachments. I would highly recommend buying this blowdryer!</li>
    <li> I never ever write reviews for products, but with this I had to!! It&#x27;s that amazing. My hair is very thick, and blowdrying my hair with this dryer is faster and easier than I ever could have imagined. You know that amazing feeling you get when you&#x27;ve just gone to a salon? That&#x27;s what your hair is like every time you use this dryer. 100% worth the money.</li>
    <li> Too heavy and it did not dry as well as my lower price point dryer did.  It cost too much so I sent it back.  The return was very easy.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for this hairdryer for Christmas and swears that it doesn&#x27;t fry her hair as other hairdryers are apt to do.  It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, but I did see my daughter&#x27;s long fine hair look very smooth and shiny after she used it without using any other hair-smoothing products.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, coarse, or frizzy hair, this hair dryer compares to no other.  I bought a different professional hair dryer a year ago for half the cost, but was never really satisfied.  This one literally cut my drying time in half, (30 minutes to 15 minutes) while leaving my hair shiny and smooth. I don&#x27;t find it to be any heavier or noisier than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I purchased the black one via Amazon and I am very pleased with the product so far. I&#x27;ve always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I&#x27;ve always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don&#x27;t find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it&#x27;s actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving it so far!</li>
    <li> anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn&#x27;t quite follow .... 😉&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.</li>
    <li> Sedu 4000i is compact and wind is very powerful.  But, when I started to use this, the air filter portion was suddenly broken.  Package is nice, product design, size is good.  But, I doubt its quality.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and she LOVES it, says its the best hair dryer out there.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Super Solano for 10+ years. The thermostat is just now beginning to go, so I finally had to buy a new dryer. I researched for a week before I bought the &#x27;newest and greatest&#x27; T3 Evolution hair dryer due to alllll the rave reviews. However, upon opening the box I quickly noticed how cheaply made it was...even the cord was of such poor quality. Really? For $195? Then on the FIRST USE it *sparked* whenever I moved any switch - that was it. I boxed it up and returned the awful T3 the next day (I don&#x27;t need my hair or my house catching on fire!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I purchased the Sedu Revolution Pro Tourmaline Ionic 4000i (from Neiman Marcus, not Amazon.) Unfortunately I am returning that one today too. The Sedu LOOKS cool (it&#x27;s really small) and it is actually made nicely (the quality is good, the cord and body are great quality), but it only had 2 settings for heat and 2 settings for power (low &amp; high). The low was WAY too low, and the high was FULL BLAST. Also, it just didn&#x27;t get as hot on the high heat setting as my previous Solano. It dried my hair quickly(!), but it was so quick that it was hard to style it with a round or paddle brush due to the high velocity of wind/power. It dries your hair WAY before you can even begin styling it. Then on the low speed, it took forever to dry. Having said that, I returned the Sedu and have just purchased the Super Solano 3200 from Folica. Great reviews, many more temperature and speed options. Also, Solano is such a solid brand and I know it&#x27;ll last me another 5-10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2016 Update: Still using my Super Solano 3200. It&#x27;s been 5 years and it&#x27;s still like new. Love Super Solano hair dryers!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Replaced a $25.00 store hairdryer that died in less than a year. I asked our hair stylist what model number she use. She said this Sedu Revolution 4000i. When she blow dries my hair, things are blowing at another chair 12 feet away. It blows 80 miles an hour. My wife has medium length hair that has a lot of cures. This is the first hair dryer that dried her hair in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, I mean really thick curly and yes frizzy hair. I usually buy the $30 off the shelf blow dryer but decided finally I would take a chance and buy a better one. I am so glad I did! Not only did it cut my usual dry time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes but my hair is sooooo much smoother. It is worth every penny...I am so excited about this, should have bought something like this years ago!</li>
    <li> After my second T3 died, this dryer was recommended by a friend. I read the reviews and it sounded great! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Unfortunately, I hate it. I have long, thick, color treated, wavy hair. It takes forever to dry normally. I will say, with this dryer on high, it will dry rapidly...but I look like I went through a wind tunnel ! On low, it takes so long my arm gets tired with the weight of the dryer. My hair is not smooth at all, it looks broken and split. I admit I&#x27;m not talented with hair, but I&#x27;ve moved this dryer to the guest room and I&#x27;ve purchased another that is working great. I wanted to like this one, I really did! The pros-it does dry your hair fast, it is pretty quiet, although heavy it feels well made and solid and it has a nice long cord.</li>
    <li> For the price (and based on other reviewers), I was expecting a lot more.  I have very long, thick hair and the Sedu Revolution does dry my hair faster (cut about 10 minutes off drying time); however, it actually makes my hair more frizzy!  Not good!!  The hair dryer is also heavy and loud!!!  Based on the packaging, it looks like I received a previously used blow dryer that someone else returned.  I would never recommend this blow dryer to anyone!</li>
    <li> When I saw the package, it was amazing.  It looks very expensive and cool design.  But, when I opened, I found there are lots of black dust on the product and my hand became dirty.  Looks like China made cheap tray.  And operating instruction is too simple compared to package.  Regarding product itself, good point is&lt;br /&gt;1) Cord is long&lt;br /&gt;2) Weight is light&lt;br /&gt;3) Compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,&lt;br /&gt;1) I could not feel any Tourmaline&lt;br /&gt;2) Not so different compared to $29 dryer for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think $159 is too expensive for this product.</li>
    <li> BEST thing ever! two of my friends have also purchased this after using mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- almost 2 years later, still going strong!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> love love love this hair dryer makes my hair blow out nicely without the frizz nice finishing touch. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this blower has power, without being too hot where you feel like you&#x27;re in an oven.  It&#x27;s great to have the two heat settings and low and high power.  It has a strong blowing power and works very wel.  Yes, a little heavy for its size, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Since this is the dryer used at my salon, I thought it would dry my hair faster and better than my $30 Clairol dryer at home. In fact, it was equivalent to my Clairol in both heat and power. Despite the $170 price point, the Sedu was neither hotter than my cheap dryer, nor did it have the jet-engine-strength power I was hoping it would. I sent it back and kept my cheapo dryer. No idea why this costs so much.</li>
    <li> It is fast, compact, powerful, sturdy, filter can be cleaned, and does not make a grating high pitched motor noise like many dryers.  This is my second one (I got this for my guest  bathroom) and it is the only dryer I will ever buy as long as it is made.  The first one is now several years old and looks and works like new.  It is expensive, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drys my very thick hair in less than half the time of any other dryer.  It did take some practice to manage the drying process so quickly, but once mastered, is easy.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blow dryer - gets my hair straight, shiny and voluminous in minutes.  The ionic option dries my hair without making it feel coarse and brittle.  My hair feels lightweight and healthy after having used this dryer for months.  Its a bit heavy so not great for travel but definitely recommended if using at home only.</li>
    <li> Good power. Light weight. Nice long cord. Only drawback is cool shot button is sensitive and in awkward place. Otherwise great dryer!!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Nice size with power!</li>
    <li> 18 year veteran HAIRSTYLIST review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight. It fits in a salon sized dryer cut out with the nozzle attached Yahoo. I t is reallly powerful and dries thick hair in a flash. It has options for low and high settings, as well as a cool shot. It has a really great cord length, I can walk completely around my chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This is the reason for the 1 star drop.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is LOUD. I mean, huh?? What? I cannot even hear my clients.&lt;br /&gt;It just doesnt get really hot.  sometimes I need just hat extra touch of heat to shine and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this dryer again.  I am looking forward to seeing how long it lasts.  I hope to remember to update this review when it gives out.  That will be the real test.</li>
    <li> I have bought twice this product. Both of them stopped working just after 3 months of use. They are not good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, but it am downgrading it for not being brand new. The item we received was an open item, with signs of usage. The package was not sealed and the manual was missing.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer exceeded my expectations.  Although it&#x27;s a bit on the heavy side, its compact frame and powerful air flow fully compensate that one drawback.  One of the best hairdryers I have owned.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair that I blow out every few days. This blow dryer has cut my drying time in half! The air force is STRONG with this one. Put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying. But it gets the job done, and incredibly well. My hair is *less* dry from this dryer, despite the high heat, and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is lightweight and powerful.  I have thick Keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully.  It gets very hot - which I need - and the airflow is strong.  There is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Sedu dries my medium length hair in half the time!  Light weight, quiet, varible speeds, variable heat settings, fabulous!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn&#x27;t justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)…so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I&#x27;ve loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But…I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)&lt;br /&gt;I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it&#x27;s the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.&lt;br /&gt;Now I admit, I don&#x27;t know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry&#x27;s new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &amp;#34;favorite dryer.&amp;#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It&#x27;s also color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it&#x27;s expensive it&#x27;s totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I&#x27;m thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

    <li> Have this dryer a few weeks now and I love it . Great at Styling my frizzy hair! It&#x27;s pretty small too which is nice for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have always been tough on hair dryers, and was hesitant to spend this much for a dryer thinking I would have to replace it in 6 months (like every other dryer I&#x27;ve owned).  What a surprise!  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than my old dryers, but it dries my hair in half the time with NO FRIZZ.  I used to dry my hair, use my flat iron, apply tons of product, and know that some days my hair would look great, others, well... the curl, and worse yet, frizz would be back in no time.  Now I spend about half the time on my hair, and it is in SO much better condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the other ionic dryers I&#x27;ve used, this has a switch to turn the ion feature on and off.  When I want the extra volume (the ionic drying tends to flatten my hair) I just hit the switch and I have TONS of volume.  No wonder this came so highly recommended by the spa I go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the real cost of the dryer, this is my 14th month with the dryer and it still runs like it did when it was new.  Considering I usually spent 40-50 dollars on my old dryers (which I replaced every six months), I think this is actually turning out to be a great bargain as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer, it dried my thick curly hair straight in 10 mins and it came out smooth and shiny however, I was surprised at how heavy this little dryer is! The weight of this dryer was just a bit too much for me and it bothered me in only 10 mins of use and I&#x27;m not exactly a weakling. The Sedu Revolution Green 3600 hair dryer actually dried my hair in close to half the time(6 mins!) as this one even though the watts are a little lower, it seems just as powerful if not more and it looked just as good! Also, the Sedu Green dryer seems MUCH lighter to me and slightly less loud which made it much more enjoyable to use. The 4000 is a great powerful little dryer but I am IN LOVE with the Sedu Green 3600 dryer and recommend that dryer over this one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a waste of money!  Purchase a Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler - $34.99  OR  Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer - $39.99  Works better and saves you a heap of money.  This dryer is NOT worth $139.99!!!</li>
    <li> Love this dryer. I bought one for my daughter because she wanted mine!</li>
    <li> I have long thick coarse hair -- it has always been my pride and joy!  As I have aged... my beautiful hair has become temperamental.  It&#x27;s curly in some spots, wavy in others -- and air dries to look nothing but atrocious!  I was close to chopping it all off.  When I kept thinking... It looks great when I come out of the salon.  What is different?  I am not a bad hair styler - can work a round brush like a pro!  So... I gave in and purchased a professional grade hair dryer.  THANK GOODNESS I DID!  I can go to bed with my head sopping wet - wake up to that atrocious mess, blow it out with this dryer and a round brush and it looks FABULOUS!  Soft, shiny, smooth... ahhhhh.  When I blow dry right after washing -- dry time in cut in half, maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER!  Was well-worth the money spent.  Will never go back to the lesser versions again - EVER!</li>
    <li> After a bunch of reviews well read, i choose this hair dryer, i have to say its TOO powerful! that is a good thing i guess, for me it was kind of crazy to manage, i have short and thin hair, it dries my hair so fast and powerful that i have no time to make a style on it.&lt;br /&gt;it is dry already with no shape.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe for a professional  with better manage of a drier will be Perfect, i am still working on it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is an excellent dryer, but it&#x27;s the EXACT SAME dryer as the $50 - $60 cheaper Velecta TGR 4000I sold here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056H3LDA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you see a similarity in the names? There&#x27;s a reason for that. As other reviewers have commented here, it&#x27;s also the same dryer as the Harry Josh 2000 everyone is freaking out about. The only difference with these 3 dryers is cost and color (and cord length. It looks like the dryer above has an even longer cord, which I know is an issue for some people, but when the cost is $50-$60 less, I wrap a freaking plastic tie around the extra cord and move on with life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy all three of these dryers, so if you don&#x27;t want to believe me and would rather spend the extra money to be safe, go for it. If not, then I&#x27;ll show you the proof. (If you don&#x27;t want to read my long-winded rant, skip to the link at the end of the next paragraph.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been blow drying my hair my entire life. I&#x27;m willing to shell out a fair amount of cash if it means I can dry my hair faster, with less energy, and better looking hair. My previously good but not great dryer died, and I was looking for a replacement. Let&#x27;s just make a long story short and say I went down a rabbit hole of internet research trying to find the right one.  I was just about to bite the bullet and buy the Harry Josh (even though $300 for a hair dryer made me vomit in my mouth), when I started stumbling on the reviews of the Sedu dryer claiming it was exactly the same as the Harry Josh. More research... I find an article on Elle, saying the Sedu TGR 4000i is Harry Josh&#x27;s favorite dryer. Hmmm??? Now I&#x27;m about to buy the Sedu and save $100, when Amazon kindly informs me that other people looking at this dryer have bought the Velecta TGR 4000I, which looks as much like the Harry Josh as the Sedu does. Another interweb search leads me to this: http://www.velecta-paramount.com/blowdryers/custom-projects.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Velecta is freaking advertising on their page that they produce the Harry Josh for him.

    <li> OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is I don&#x27;t know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn&#x27;t have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I&#x27;m even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.  That process has gone from fast to lightening fast thanks to this Sedu.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews for products, but I had to comment on this blow dryer. I bought it for my wife who has very frizzy, curly, thick and unruly hair. She raved about this blow dryer from the first use. Not only it did it dry her hair in half the time from about 40 minutes to 20, it made it straighter, flatter, and noticeably less frizzy. Absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! It seriouskl y dried my hair half the time made it feel silky smooth its quiet compared to my drug store ones. Omg it&#x27;s awesome. Buy it</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending so much on a hair dryer. I normally just buy the ones at the drug store. This one was recommended to me since my hair is fluffy. It has an extra long cord and a cold shot too. It dries my hair without burning it, and keeps the frizz down without having to use a ton of silicone oil finishing product. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ive been a professional hairdresser for a long time. Ive used many high end blow dryers in the past 12 years. This hair dryer by far excels in every way. Its light, quiet, powerful, and provides silky smooth results without damaging the hair. It also has the ion setting to protect the hair....I dont use it much, but its nice to have it there if i need it. I will only use Sedu dryers from now on, this is my second one, my first one lasted 7 years! They&#x27;re amazing.</li>
    <li> I like the dryer, BUT Buyer Beware. If you,order from any other supplier on Amazon than Folica- Sedu voids the warranty and claims the product is counterfeit.  I called Exceon after I read that issue &amp; the girl was pretty caddy- said if it is not from one of our authorized retailers it is counterfeit.  Not sure I believe her, but decided not to take any chances &amp; ordered one to be fulfilled by Folica &amp; not worry about warranty or counterfeit issues or the fact that some have caught fire. (Yikes)</li>
    <li> A bit heavy, but dries very well.  Can get very hot which is good if you need that.  But if you have sensitive hair, keep it at a distance or use the low setting.</li>
    <li> Just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran, yes--ran, to write this review.  I cannot believe this is my hair!  I have shoulder-length, course, thick, curly hair which I blow dry and iron.  I have always used high-end hair dryers, but this is the best ever.  Worth twice the price!  Not only did my hair dry faster, but it dried frizz-free.  I did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry.  First time ever not having to flat iron.  My hair looks like it does when I come from the hair dresser.  I can&#x27;t believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference, but I can assure you, it does.  Thank you Sedu.  I am a believer.</li>
    <li> Okay, so heres the thing: Im a product junkie, and the fact that I have fine, thin, wavy hair makes me possibly one of the biggest hair product junkies there ever must be. Yes, that is pretty sad.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 4000i from Folica.com. First off, TERRIBLE customer service. I really dont get how in the world so many people rave about their customer service. I initially purchased it w/o knowing about their $40 recycle your old dryer discount.  So I purchased with a promo $25 coupon.  My co-worker tells me about the $40 discount. I call customer service, and the first lady hangs up the phone. I call back, 2nd lady tells me theres no way she can adjust the discount amount even though I filled out the online form, got the code, and told her she will be getting the old dryer in the mail. Plus, I used another discount. Requested she pls see if she can void the other discount and add this one or just give a credit for the additional $15 to make up the $40. She said no, I need to &#x27;refuse delivery on the initial, place 2nd order with the new discount&#x27; and then she says &#x27;you do know you have to return your old dryer right?&#x27;, I say \\&quot;yes\\&quot;, she says \\&quot;the $25 coupon might be better b/c you have to pay shipping for your old dryer to be sent to us\\&quot; I had to tell her \\&quot;thank you, I am aware I have to pay postage, but I still save an extra $10 after paying postage\\&quot;, she finally says \\&quot;okay\\&quot;. I told her the delivery is due on the next day, and I had a function that saturday to attend (this was on a monday). she said she couldnt do anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;Fine, I do as she says, order another one, get my old dryer ready to be shipped off, refuse delivery on the first order, get the credit, and, in the end actually get my discount of $40 (I ended up paying about $119+ taxes).&lt;br /&gt;So I got it this morning---super excited to finally get a &#x27;professional grade&#x27; dryer. Best part I got it right after I got out the shower (YIPPEE!)&lt;br /&gt;I use it...and what do you know..it was a TOTAL FAIL.&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT GET THE HYPE. My hair was in the perfect moment to be blow dried, I was ready to be blown out of my mind. Did that happen? NO. The butons are crappy, I can&#x27;t ever see myself getting used to them (no matter how longer I keep it, and remember Im a junkie with these things- the things I love, I dont mind going through pain to utilize). The cold shot button SUCKS b/c its a heavy little dryer and you have to keep the button pressed to use. it did NOT straighten my hair ANY BETTER than my $30 remington target dryer (that was sad). I will try it out one more time before returning it to Folica because it does not do its job AT ALL. I had to end up using my flatiorn to make the hair presentable b/c it made my hair look so wispy (something the cheap dryer didnt even do). The point of the purchase was to attempt to get rid of the flatiron. Why would I pay $119 to have to use the dryer AND the flatiron? Makes no sense- I can do that with any decent priced dryer that has the ion option. I am giving it one star b/c I got my initial purchases refund within a day. otherwise, this dryer is no different than any other decent dryer.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: This dryer is DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. I will attempt to use it one more day to rule out if my hair just didnt feel like looking pretty today. I see myself returning it and requesting a refund. I have a feeling I will get even more crappy customer service with that one. Lets see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I initially ordered the Solano 3500. Though it look sturdy and well made, my Conair 207P Infinity Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer dries my hair way faster than the Solano 3500. I was going to exchange it with the Solano 3700 but it wasn&#x27;t on sale and I don&#x27;t want to pay $200 dollars for a hair dryer. I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord. Hair dryer&#x27;s length is 5 3/4 inches ( without the concentrator ) , depth 2 3/4 inches, height ( from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle ) 7 3/4 inches. Solano 3500 though much bigger than Sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound. First time I used the Sedu 4000i I was so impressed. It dried my hair way faster ( took only 10 minutes ) than my 4 yr old Conair that burns my hair sometimes. I have long ( mid back ) hair. Medium thickness with some wave and I don&#x27;t like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair. ( except shampoo and conditioner ). Sedu is also quieter than my old Conair and Solano 3500. With Sedu 4000i my hair looks so shiny, straight and frizz-free. I keep the ion switch off on my hair dryer because I want some body/volume on my hair. I so love my hair dryer that I am always looking forward to use it. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer every day for about a week now and I am AMAZED!! It really does cut drying time in HALF!  From 30mins down to just 15!  My hair feels smoother and looks shinier with less frizz in half the time.  I was also very surprised at how small it really is - and light weight (small enough that I didn&#x27;t mind bringing it along for a weekend trip).  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
    <li> I must have had this dryer over a year now, after upgrading from a cheap one that I bought in a drugstore.  I had wanted to splurge on a high quality dryer, especially since I use one almost every day and want my fine (but thick) hair to be healthy and strong (not frizzy).  Ultimately settled on this one from a friend&#x27;s recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between this one and the $30 Conair I was using is HUGE.  First of all, the Sedu is more compact.  Some reviewers mentioned that it&#x27;s still heavy, but the weight made no difference to me.  Actually, it just seemed solid, which attests to the quality.  It&#x27;s got all the basic speed settings, as well as the Cool Blast feature.  This dryer responded to changes in the settings amazing quickly, heating up and cooling down fast.  It takes me less time to dry my hair using this guy, and it&#x27;s quieter than my Conair had been.  All around, I have nothing but great things to say, which is exactly what I was expecting given the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: For $170 you will get no surprises, this is a solid, powerful dryer.  Mine is still in great condition and going strong, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasted several more years.  My hair is Frizz free except on rainy days.  And I won&#x27;t ever be going back to the cheap drugstore ones.</li>
    <li> Totally diggin my hair dryer.  Gift from hubby!  Needed something quiet that didn&#x27;t wake up the kids.  2 levels of speed (low works as well as high, just more quiet), 2 heat levels, ions can be on/off, cool blast button, small, light, love!!!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes the size.</li>
    <li> This was my first small dyer! It was uncomfortable to hold, but the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it was because it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. It also made my hair look flat and limp.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was amazing- for about 5 months. Then it died. I&#x27;m a stylist so it was very lightweight, which is important, and it got through the toughest hair. Until the day it died. I have gone back to using my twin turbo- which is heavier, but the lifespan is way better.</li>
    <li> i am a hair dresser in NYC. i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so. usually i buy this one. when i haven&#x27;t and i have tried other driers (and there have been many!) they are never as good as this one. if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever. it is very light, its fast, its hot. you can turn the ionic function off (which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway). it is also pretty hardy. my tools get dropped all the time. other driers crack and stop working quickly, but not this one.   you can&#x27;t go wrong here, and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too.  enjoy!</li>
    <li> If you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you&#x27;re looking for. It gets very hot and I LOVE IT! It is good for my hair (I have very thick curly and frizzy).</li>
    <li> this is a great dryer for my curly frizzy long hair. makes it smoothe</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great--it&#x27;s lightweight and dries my hair in half the time of all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a present, but i think i use it more than she does.  I use the lowest fan speed and the lowest heat setting and it dries my hair really quick (though that&#x27;s not saying much as i have relatively short hair), leaves it nice and shiny too.  I know my wife loves its performance but did mention that she wished it were a little bit lighter.  It&#x27;s hard for me to notice when actually using it, but when compared side by side to another hair dryer in the house it does have a noticeable heft to it.  It&#x27;s hard for me to dock it a star since it&#x27;s only noticeable as a comparative.</li>
    <li> I ordered this immediately after dropping mine and braking it &amp;#62; : ( Uhhggg&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is well worth every penny! I have a short hairstyle that I blow dry straight daily and this hairdryer does not damage,dry out or burn my hair. My hair is shiny and healthy and the cool shot actually blows &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; air! Most hair dryers I have had in the past , the &amp;#34;Cool Shot&amp;#34; was warm at best. The different temps and speeds are very nice to have too</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I spent this much on a hairdryer, but I do really like it much better than the one I got at the large chain store. Wish it cost less, but would probably buy it again... ( :</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for many years. I just bought a second one. It is small, extremely powerful and it dries my hair super fast. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT dryer.  I have very long hair, and it used to take about 20 minutes to get it dry.  This dryer gets me out of the bathroom in about half that time.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.  Replaced my old Sedu one that finally bit the dust.  Leaves hair shiny and silky.  Dries in half the time.  Use on my pet on low setting.  They love it.</li>
    <li> My stylist uses and recommended this hair dryer to me.  I have very thick hair that can take forever to blow out.  But with the Sedu Revolution it has literally cut my time in half.  I read other reviews before buying it and there were a lot of issues with the fact it only had two speeds but with hair like mine you only need high!  And a good brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reviewing every review of every hairdryer online to replace a Sharper Image hairdryer that had literally split at the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine $20 cheaper on sale at Folica.com with a 2 year warranty.--On their site they rate it as the best hair dryer of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is smaller than the online video reviews make it seem (youtube) and is nearly the same size as my previous travel size dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 2 diffuser heads and a case. It seems very sturdy and yes, it has dried my hair in half the time of my previous ionic dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the ionic setting emits less heat so if you need to style your hair you&#x27;ll need to switch to the other position for more heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have round, straight hair, fine but thick and this dryer takes less than 5 minutes to fully dry vs. my other hair dryer I would dry for 5 minutes and walk out the door with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, worth noting that since my last haircut I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it to look as good as when I walked out of the salon until I used this hair dryer! So now I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s all about the hairdryer, forget everything else. Totally worth your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t already purchased this hairdryer I might have gone for the Solano since my hairdresser recommended that one (he also reminded me that the department store/box store dryers are not the same quality ionic dryers and you need at least 1875 watts...) but this one is nearly half the weight of the Solano and pretty darn great.</li>
    <li> RIGHT SIZE, NOT NOISY, REDUCE MY DRYING TIME FROM14 MIN (REVLON) TO 8 MIN. MY HAIRSTYLIST USES IT AND I JUST COPIED HIM. :)</li>
    <li> Only two heat settings, high setting burned my hair, low setting do not dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously I was drying my hair and a big piece just fell down after the smell of burn hair was present all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;After drying it leaves hair with too much frizz that is just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> As a professional makeup artist and hair stylist I invest in a lot of products. This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I&#x27;m drying a client&#x27;s hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I&#x27;m touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it&#x27;s the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it&#x27;s travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s a powerful driver, but this seems more like it&#x27;s aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this to traveling stylists, but maybe it works better if you have your own station.</li>
    <li> Powerful blowdryer, super light. My mom took this from me (I bought this dryer in 2009- she took it in 2011) and it&#x27;s still going strong! My mom uses it along with my sister, my niece and 2 of my cousins and they all love it. One thing though, it is so strong you need to make sure to not burn your hair by leaving it on one strand for too long! It&#x27;s not like a conventional dryer, it will cut your drying time, so use it with that knowledge. If I didn&#x27;t love my current dryer I&#x27;d definitely buy this one when/if it dies.</li>
    <li> I have long hair.  Used to take me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair.  This dryer has cut down the time to 20 minutes TOTAL.  It&#x27;s a time saver.</li>
    <li> Best dryer ever.&lt;br /&gt;I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I&#x27;m on my 2nd one of these in 3 years… I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best. Lightweight, powerful and it makes my hair so smooth.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this blow dryer gets the job done in half the time my other dryer did.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was advertised as quiet - it is not.  It also blows my hair all over even with the covers.  For such and expensive dryer I expected less noise and more controlled heating.  Now my hair comes out frizzy</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this hairdryer based on what my hair stylist said. I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &amp;#34;game changer&amp;#34;. Definitely, helped me get ready for my day a lot faster.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in half the time it took with other dryers.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been shiner and instantly silkier! I was honestly shocked. I used to blow dry my hair with an ionic hair dryer but Sedu&#x27;s ionizer is DRASTICLY different. I use #2 setting (hot) first to get rid of excess moisture and then finish with #1 (warm) while using a boars bristle brush. I used to spend a long time drying, only to end up with large &amp; frizzy hair, and then spend even more time using a flat iron and my hair never even came near the smoothness &amp; utter silkiness that using the Sedu Revolution has afforded me. I have not once used my flat iron since the first use of this ionic dream of a hair dryer. My boyfriend literally was amazed as well when he saw me after less than 10 minutes of use - and he couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never written a review like this but I hope if that you are on the fence due to the price - give it a try and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who didn&#x27;t know any better and only used drugs store hair dryers. I have been getting the Japanese straight perm for many years every 6 months on my long (below the shoulder blades), slightly curly and thick Asian hair. I tried the top two best ones from Folica. I did not experience the significantly shiny hair that many people raved about at all unfortunately. My hair was less frizzy though. Here are the winners for the following categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weight: Sedu by far! The weight is the main reason I returned the Solia dryer. By the way, the cheapest return shipping fee through USPS with Delivery Confirmation Receipt is $12! Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;airflow: Sedu. Even at the lowest setting, my hair was getting tangled and knotted like crazy with Solia. I also lost A LOT of hair after each hair drying session (double the usual amount). I don&#x27;t want to go bald!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;temperature: Solia. The cooler setting on the Solia was perfect for me. The warmer setting wasn&#x27;t too hot. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use the hotter setting on the Sedu because the cooler setting was warm for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;drying time: Tie. The time difference between the two was only like 3 minutes apart. Solia&#x27;s 5 min vs. Sedu&#x27;s 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall winner: Sedu.</li>
    <li> By far the best hair blow dryer I have ever used! At first I was afraid to spend the money on it but I am so glad I did. I don&#x27;t even have to use a hair straightener anymore. This dries my hair within 5 minutes and I have pretty thick hair. I am very impressed! Worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  My hair usually holds water like a camel and takes forever to dry.  But now, it takes 15 minutes tops.</li>
    <li> Previously purchased the Harry Josh dryer.  While it worked well enough, not enough to justify the $300 price point.  Subsequently purchased the Sedu 4000i and it was virtually identical to the Harry Josh dryer in every way save for the price tag.  The Sedu 4000i and Harry Josh dryers are identical in body shape, size and weight.  The operation switches are identical down to the symbols used.  Even the placement and font of the serial numbers are virtually identical.  The only obvious difference is in the color with the Harry Josh unit being a cute green hue.  However, for the extra $100 it apparently costs for the green color - perhaps it is better to think &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; and keep your green.  With its accelerated drying time being its primary advantage, the Sedu 4000i was the clear choice but still pricey for what you get.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair nice and soft, glad I ordered it and would recommend it to anyone who has curly unruly hair. thanks Kathy</li>
    <li> I have been a stylist for over 10 years now and was also a auto mechanic too, so I do have knowledge on how things work. People blaming the dryer on damaging their wife&#x27;s hair are idiots. If the hair was breaking off its due to her stylist over processing her hair! I dryer isn&#x27;t going to break hair.........it melts/burns it and only if the user doesn&#x27;t properly know how to use it. Probably why the husband is writing the review cause he is the woman in the relationship since the woman probably has no clue how to cook since you can&#x27;t keep one area under constant heat for too long of a period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No for a real review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned the origanl version of the dryer by paramount velectra the. Which was a full size dryer with a long cord and worked great for the 7 yrs I owned it till it was stolen......I guarantee it is still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So 3 years ago a old girlfriend bought the sedu version since many of the top educators in the hair industry use it (even the new Sam villa dryer is very similar).  It may be heavy for some people, but it is well balanced. Has a long cord like the old the, controls are never in the way....so it not changing the settings in the middle of a blow dry like you would with all the chi&#x27;s. I&#x27;m a perfectionist when it comes to blow drying.........haven&#x27;t even owned a flat iron in the last 5 years since most my clients like volume and movement. The sedu gets the job done faster than any dryer on the market......makes the t3 look like a Helen of troy dryer. I got lucky and was able to pick up the tgr 4000i (same dryer) from a beauty supply store for $37........these dryers were once priced at $280 6-7 years ago. Btw.......I finally picked up a flat iron this week........GHD is the only way to go........I used to own a chi and a digital chi wet to dry and there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer. I had really liked using the dryer - fast results! But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND! Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited. Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire (it did burn my hand a bit). Furthermore, even though I had a 2-yr warranty, the company refused to issue me a refund. It&#x27;s been horrible. I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
    <li> shiny hair less frizz... same drying time.</li>
    <li> light, convenient and powerful</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dryer for 3 years not. I noticed that people started complimenting me hair more (I have not change anything in my hair products). Even my hairdresser asked me about how I keep my hair looking so healthy. I always used to have hair shoulder length, but since I started using this hair dryer, I notices less split ends, no frizz, and no dryness&#x3D; less trimming. Three years forward, and my blond colored hair is to my waistline! Again, I haven’t changed or added any hair product to my routine. I strongly believe that it is all depend on how you dry your hair. In addition, I used to spend at list 25 min to dry my hair, now it takes 10 min!!!Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this dryer saves about 10 minutes off drying time. My hair looks smoother, as if I&#x27;ve had a salon blowout. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was time to replace my trusted Chi which I had used for the last 10 years when it burned my hair.  I prefer to spend money upfront for good products that last for a long time, so I spend a great deal of time researching products and reviews.  So I started the journey to buy a new hair dryer.  I have thick long straight hair which can look rather frizzy as we live in Atlanta, GA, where the humidity is high, especially  in the summer.  Typically, I use a hair straightener when I have a special occasion and I blow dry my hair with a small amount of balm to de-frizz the ends a bit....I am a working mother, so I don&#x27;t have hours to spend beautifying my mane every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dried my hair for the first time and WHOOOOOA! it came out shiny, straight, soft and PERFECT in 5-6 minutes of drying.  I hate to say it - I was BLOWN away.  no product, no straightener, just  a comb and this amazing gadget and I am ready to leave the house with beautiful, groomed, shiny hair. I could not believe how great it looked, I thought this must be a fluke.....so I tried it again, and low and behold, same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, it is small and compact, light and has a long cord.  The design is good, no issues there.  I am in love with this product and would not rave about these things unless they absolutely WOWED me.  It is absolutely worth the extra few $$s and I will be recommending this to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Amazon delivers as usual, on time, perfectly, amazingly.</li>
    <li> Loooooved this dryer. About a year and a half in and it&#x27;s no longer working. Not an awful timeline but disappointing for the price.</li>
    <li> Heavy, my expectation was much too high. The $ cost was high too.</li>
    <li> Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently found out my best friend is the same &amp; she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there&#x27;s probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren&#x27;t stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture &amp; it&#x27;s naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair b/c you don&#x27;t want to deal with the drying time &amp; tired arms (...and I&#x27;m strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that pile of awesome, it&#x27;s very light &amp; evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive &amp; don&#x27;t get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s an easy travel companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get scared off by this dryer&#x27;s price - it&#x27;s a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, &amp; Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer &amp; a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort &amp; leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles &amp; taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu&#x27;s White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You&#x27;ll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands &amp; pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster &amp; it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don&#x27;t.  PS - The brush &amp; Shu isn&#x27;t a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was ecstatic to find this - I&#x27;d always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original &amp; also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend&#x27;s now a convert &amp; begging for the name of my dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
