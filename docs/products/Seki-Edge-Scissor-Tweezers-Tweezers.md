      <li>I was heartbroken to find that they aren&#x27;t made any more.  </li>
      <li>The tip needs to be able to grasp and hold onto a hair in order to &amp;#34;pluck&amp;#34; it out.</li>

      <li>The Seki Edge Scissors Edge Tweezer is ingenious.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find and I couldn&#x27;t tell what the end was like in the package.</li>

      <li>Easy to use and very precise.  </li>
      <li>Well, these got pretty good reviews</li>
      <li>and  more  comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>The grabbing edges hang on to pesky hairs &amp; make it easy to pluck them.</li>
      <li>They work well, and are easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>I am left-handed and the Seki Edge made it easy to trim.  </li>
      <li>Extremely accurate and easy to use.</li>
      <li>You need a finer tip to get those fine hairs that men have to deal with.</li>
      <li>This is like the equivalent of a fine tip pen.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and work really well at removing hair with a nice grip.</li>
      <li>I went through a bunch of drug store tweezers, looking for something similar but never was happy with them.</li>

      <li>I was worried about the finger wing at first but quickly got used to it and find these very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The seller was very fast and I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Takes some practice, but so worth it!</li>
      <li>This pair of tweezers is exactly what I was looking for and needed - the rounded edge which these have, but they are much more than that.</li>
      <li>The tips don&#x27;t line up, and they don&#x27;t grip very fine hairs very well.</li>
      <li>My fingers fit in the handle so well that I have much more control and the actual pulling is gentle, accurate, and feels safe!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for decent tweezers for decades - hallelujah! :)</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t grasp the very finest hairs, but then, none of the many I have tried seem to do well in that regard.</li>
      <li>I had a stubby pair when I was a teen and loved them.  </li>
      <li>After trying many different tweezers from drugstores, some more pricey than others, I found these tweezers on Amazon.</li>

      <li>After a long search for Scissor tweezers I decided to try these out based on the good reviews.</li>
      <li>Hardly useful.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>stumbled across these Seki Edge scissor tweezers on eBay and decided they were worth a try.  </li>
      <li>They are very easy to use,  similar  to  what I was used to.  </li>
      <li>I ordered these Seki tweezers on a whim trying to find a suitable back up in case</li>
      <li>I use these to pull hair out of my small dogs ears and they work great for that.</li>
      <li>Fantastic, much better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for a better gripping tip, which should be the major feature of such an item</li>
      <li>I love these tweenzers, just what I was looking for something that actually WORKS!!</li>
      <li>But after 1 week, I suddenly wasn&#x27;t able to grasp any hairs and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  </li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>With multiple uses, you&#x27;ll get a better idea of how to use these well.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are excellent for pulling those small facial hairs!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and would highly recommend to anyone that doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable with traditional tweezers!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely accurate and easy to use. Great for brows Cause you can see what your grabbing. Would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> For the price, it is not worth it.  It is of average functionality, design and quality.  Was hoping for a better gripping tip, which should be the major feature of such an item</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out</li>
    <li> I started searching for some mini tweezers a few months ago.  I had two, lost one, I like the scissor type, but the tiny ones.  I found these, and although not sure I&#x27;d like the extra plastic part, with the &#x27;&#x27;wing&#x27;&#x27; I ordered two of them.  I love them.  Again, another product that seemingly had fallen through the cracks and couldn&#x27;t be found, appeared!  Similar enough to make this gal happy:-)</li>
    <li> My husband and I have shared a pair of tweezers similar to these for 42 years. I felt is was about time I had my own. So ordered these and I LOVE them. The seller was very fast and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy and safe set of tweezers.  The Seki mechanism is smooth and precise and makes for an excellent experience.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> After trying many different tweezers from drugstores, some more pricey than others, I found these tweezers on Amazon. I have Parkinson&#x27;s disease and trying to maintain eyebrow shape was frustrating if not downright dangerous! The Seki Edge Scissors Edge Tweezer is ingenious. My fingers fit in the handle so well that I have much more control and the actual pulling is gentle, accurate, and feels safe! I wish they could make utensils as well. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another  to have handy, worth the cost and more!</li>
    <li> I thought the edge of it was thinner but it&#x27;s not- it is well made and precise just not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers. I was worried about the finger wing at first but quickly got used to it and find these very easy to use. Good grip and accuracy.</li>
    <li> Although some of my hairs are admittedly difficult these scissors tweezers are comfortable in my hand and seem to do better than others I&#x27;ve tried. These are almost deserving 5 stars and would if any tweezer could match up to my difficult hairs. I&#x27;d say these are 99.9% of 5 stars. I&#x27;ve got arthritic fingers so most tweezers are hard for my hands to use. The angle and shape of the scissors really do assist my hands.</li>
    <li> These tweezers were purchased as a gift for my wife. They are very well made and when closed easily pull eyebrow hair or eyelashes. The tips are machined to close tightly and they out perform most of the v-shaped tweezers on the market. With the scissor designed finger holds they are very easy to use and save time when removing unwanted hair or splinters.</li>
    <li> A regular tweezer, especially a tweezerman, can do what this does, but this does better. It provides the grip that a tweezer can&#x27;t (difference between pulling with a fist vs pulling with pinched fingers). Its great for plucking stray hairs on chin and around eyebrows. Takes some practice, but so worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a pair of &amp;#34;Twissors&amp;#34; that were made in the early 1970s, for over 40 years.  I guarded them and protected them and loved them.  But eventually the day came when they were worn out.  I was heartbroken to find that they aren&#x27;t made any more.  I went through a bunch of drug store tweezers, looking for something similar but never was happy with them. Either the tips didn&#x27;t line up properly, or they didn&#x27;t grip the hairs correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across these Seki Edge scissor tweezers on eBay and decided they were worth a try.  They look similar to my Twissors - short length, scissor handles, and blunt tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with these tweezers!  They take a little getting used to, to avoid breaking off hairs or pinching skin, but they are made of quality stainless steel and feel surgical-grade in their precision.  The coated handles make them easy on my fingers, and the pincer part is excellent.  I had to train myself to go slowly while using them, concentrating on one hair at a time while holding my skin taut.  But once I figured this out, they do a perfect job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still keep my old Twissors for sentimental reasons, but I&#x27;ve been using these for a week and really love them!</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed with these.  The reviews led me to believe these were high-quality, but the pair I got are not very impressive.  The tips don&#x27;t line up, and they don&#x27;t grip very fine hairs very well.</li>
    <li> At first I really liked these tweezers, especially how narrow they were.  Other tweezers are so wide that I often ended up plucking hairs that I wanted to keep.  But after 1 week, I suddenly wasn&#x27;t able to grasp any hairs and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  Then I looked at the tips - they were misaligned by 1 mm and each side wobbled back and forth as if the screw needed to be tightened.  A few months ago I had to discard a pair of Twissors that I had bought in the 70&#x27;s and have tried a few pairs recently.  I thought the Seki would be a good compromise between $40 Swiss tweezers (that I read were junk) and the cheapies at the drugstore.  But, alas, the search continues.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very easily held even by arthritic hands. The grabbing edges hang on to pesky hairs &amp; make it easy to pluck them. They are of a good size, small enough to store easily &amp; large enough to use effectively &amp; to wash easily. I&#x27;ve been waiting for decent tweezers for decades - hallelujah! :)</li>
    <li> Save your money! I think that if you used chopped sticks, or needle nosed pliers instead of these tweezers you would be much better off. ;)  They do not grasp hairs very well at all. The tip is too bulbous as far as I am concerned. You need a finer tip to get those fine hairs that men have to deal with. The tip needs to be able to grasp and hold onto a hair in order to &amp;#34;pluck&amp;#34; it out. I like the scissor style tweezers...but, not this one.</li>
    <li> I use these to pull hair out of my small dogs ears and they work great for that. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the worst scissor style tweezer I have ever bought.  It is very small Tweezer and it does not pluck any hair.  It is very hard to use it too because of the size of the plucker which is very small.  I hate it.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> the scissor pivot twists sideways making the tweezing end misaligned. not very effective for pulling on tiny hairs or stubble</li>
    <li> Fantastic, much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is the 1st Seki product I don&#x27;t like. I love their clippers, which is the reason I ordered this. Although the quality of stainless steel and precision are superb, as Seki products usually are (I own 5 other Seki products), I don&#x27;t even use this one because it is so narrow that it is difficult to catch a hair.</li>
    <li> I had used the same pair of Revlon  tweezers for years.  Finally decided that I needed a new pair and was very disappointed to  find that I could no longer purchase a pair that looked the same.  I looked at quite a few pair online  and finally decided to try the Seki Edge Tweezers.  They are very easy to use,  similar  to  what I was used to.  But, even better!  They allow you to tweeze using the side or the end gripping  edges.  The handles  have a little cushioning which makes them easier and  more  comfortable to use.  My 94  year old mother has  not been able to do  her own eyebrows for quite  some  time.  She  is very happy with my using my new  ones on her as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
    <li> This pair of tweezers is exactly what I was looking for and needed - the rounded edge which these have, but they are much more than that. They are also very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I bought these with high hopes of quality and precision.  After paying full price for them ($17), I was disappointed because the grabbing surface was too small for getting a good grip on hair and often slipping during the pull.  To top it off, after a year of use the metal chipped off a portion of that grabbing surface rendering it unable to grab anything at all!  Not worth the extra money, I would go with another product.  I gave it two stars, because the handle is nice and the hinge remained smooth, but without good grab, what good is a tweezer anyway?</li>
    <li> The edges are sharp; it is easy to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> These work so well, I bought 2 more pair and one for my mom.  They don&#x27;t grasp the very finest hairs, but then, none of the many I have tried seem to do well in that regard.</li>
    <li> I love these tweenzers, just what I was looking for something that actually WORKS!! Don&#x27;t waste your time buying cheap ones like I did. Great seller, fast delivery, great price would buy from again.  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Still have it....is amazing,I would recommend it to everybody..</li>
    <li> Eh.  I used to have a pair of scissor tweezers until my kids lost them so I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement.  These aren&#x27;t it.  But they work and will be ok while I search for what I used to have.  They were 20 years old so I have very little hope of finding them again.</li>
    <li> NOT MY FAVORITE TWEEZERS. THEY ARE OK. I WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS. THE TWEEZER ENDS, THAT GRIP THE HAIR, ARE TOO THICK. IT&#x27;S HARD TO GRIP THE SHORTER HAIRS.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers! Great for tweezing eyebrows.Very accurate tips.Easy to use and would highly recommend to anyone that doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable with traditional tweezers!!</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever purchased.  Easy to use and very precise.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The problem with most tweezers is that they cannot grip small hairs. I use this pull the hairs that grow on my eyelids that turn backwards and poke my eyes. When you get older then you get new crazy hair growing in places where it does not help but can even harm. This is the best tool I have found for plucking and pulling them out. It has nice rounded ends so is also safer.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work as designed. They are sturdy and work really well at removing hair with a nice grip.</li>
    <li> Hardly rounded. Hardly useful.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are excellent for pulling those small facial hairs! I have purchased much more expensive tweezers that will not grasp facial hair. I also prefer the scissor type tweezers for my older grip. I ordered 2 pair of these Seki tweezers and both work perfectly. I have one pair of Rubis tweezers that are good but when I have tried new Rubis scissor tweezers none of them will hold onto facial hair. I ordered these Seki tweezers on a whim trying to find a suitable back up in case I lose my Rubis tweezers and found a very acceptable tweezer to pack for travel.</li>
    <li> After a long search for Scissor tweezers I decided to try these out based on the good reviews. These are my new regulars. The handle feels great in your hand; very comfortable. They are built sold and built to last. Quality.   However, there is a bit of a learning curve.  These tweezers are very fine tip. The plates are small. This is like the equivalent of a fine tip pen. Perfect for the small details, but not so perfect if you&#x27;re trying to cover a large area. With multiple uses, you&#x27;ll get a better idea of how to use these well. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are better than any I have found at the pharmacy. Sometimes it is \\&quot;hit and miss\\&quot; when purchasing tweezers, but this product really works well. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> One hair at a time?  You have to be kidding....but that is all it will do....a waste of time and money....</li>
    <li> The gripping power of these tweezers is just phenomenal! They are able to extricate even embedded hairs. Strongly recommend! Plus the handle is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> As tweezers go this is well-made, comfortable, accurate, attractive, and does a good job. I recommend, would buy again, will update as needed, and hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> i kept buying tweezers. this one gets the hair and pulls it out. that&#x27;s all i want it to do. the head is a bit small so sometimes hard to aim but at least the hair doesnt slip through once you get it and doesn&#x27;t break off.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge tweezer is useless - I will try to get something better in a pharmacy or supermarket, having realized that in this case I need to see what I am buying.&lt;br /&gt;The little edge (that should grab the hair) is so narrow that it is extremely difficult to get hold of anything.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are the best eyebrow tweezers in the world.  They work well, and are easy to hold.  I much prefer the scissors style tweezers to the other squeeze style.</li>
    <li> Worthless.  Grip is very weak resulting in zero pressure on the tweezing part.  There is very, very poor contact at the tips so they do not tweeze at all.</li>
    <li> I really thought I was going to like these, but the grips are just too big and bulky and oddly shaped, such that after using the tweezers just twice for about 10 minutes each session, I now have no feeling in the tips of my pointer finger and thumb. Wow. I&#x27;ll take my old all-metal scissor tweezers over neuropathy any day. It&#x27;s been over 2 weeks since I stopped using them and the numbness remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t help the above situation that the business end of these tweezers is so short and the grip so big...it takes a larger range of motion and squeezing to do the job though not much pressure is required. The grabbing tips are TOO TINY; it&#x27;s very difficult to target a hair.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for these tweezers.  I had a stubby pair when I was a teen and loved them.  The size is right, the strength is right but the tweezing tip is too small.</li>
    <li> These are nice but I am looking for this type of tweezer with a pointed end. Haven&#x27;t been able to find and I couldn&#x27;t tell what the end was like in the package.</li>
    <li> Simply the best ladies scissor tweezers for taming facial or nose hairs. One hundred times better than the more common prong-type tweezers. I am left-handed and the Seki Edge made it easy to trim.  I also am happy to learn these tweezers were made in Japan.</li>
    <li> very cheep and don&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers ever made.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and your sensitive skin on any other substitute!</li>
    <li> Well, these got pretty good reviews so I took a chance.  I was tired of the cheapo ones (Revlon scissor tweezers with slant tip) that wear out really fast, so I was looking for something of an upgrade in quality.  They are difficult to make work &amp; it takes a whole lot of tries even to finally tweeze one hair.  The surface area for grabbing a hair is tiny for one thing.  Also, they are not &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;, so you can&#x27;t get under the hair with one side &amp; then clamp down on it to pull.... if that makes sense.  Guess it needs to come with an instructional vid or something.  Surely I am doing it wrong?  But I have given it awhile now, &amp; I&#x27;m not getting better, either that or they suck.  I&#x27;m not new to plucking, I guarantee you!  Good luck!</li>
    <li> The handles are too big, the tweezer length is too short and the metal points are too thick. Not great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my spouse, to pull hair from her face. I also use it to pull turn under hair from my face. We have nothing but outstanding remarks, nothing derogatory, about this product. I would highly recommend this product to both men and women.</li>
