<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the soapiest perfume I own but it&#x27;s just the initial smell. Once it&#x27;s on my skin and mixes with my own oils it definitely mellows.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pure class and elegance.&lt;br /&gt;A perfume that defies the ages. Definitely for a more mature woman.</li>
    <li> The product does not work. On second use, the sprinkler part stopped working while still moving fine, and it looks like there is no recourse. A $100 bottle of &amp;#34;eau de parfume&amp;#34;, and a gift too!</li>
    <li> I have used Chanel No 5 for over 50 years.  It is still the fragrance that can pick me up on a rainy day or give me a sense of romance on a Sat. night.  It brings back wonderful memories tool</li>
    <li> This is not the real product, they sent me a knock off. Do not buy this product. They advertise it as authentic but it is not.</li>
    <li> When my wife received my order, the product did not smell like Chanel #5 at all (She has been wearing this scent for 40 years).  The celephane packaging around the box was in tact, but you could see that there was moisture inside the celephane layer.  The cardboard box was soaked, but it did not smell like Chanel #5 at all. The company I purchased it from did work with me to refund my money, but I will never purchase perfume on line again.</li>
    <li> No. 5 perfume is sophisticated, beautiful, and complex.  It&#x27;s definitely my all-time favorite perfume, one that can be worn on very special occasions or just a touch for everyday.</li>
    <li> This is an ok cologne.  It is not bad at all, I quite like the scent.  It is almost identical in scent to Ralph Lauren on my body chemistry.  However, it&#x27;s not worth the price in my opinion.  You are just paying for the name.</li>
    <li> My friend purchased me Chanel No. 5 for a birthday gift and I was repulsed by it&#x27;s smell. After hearing great things about this specific fragrance for years, I was extremely disappointed when I actually got to use it for the first time. Where I expected Chanel&#x27;s \\&quot;No. 5\\&quot; to be delicate, classy, and feminine, I was repulsed when I found out that it smells like a cheap musk. Very overwhelming (enough to make you feel like you&#x27;re choking) and I&#x27;d even say masculine.  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again and will likely give away my bottle or sell it at a garage sale for $10.</li>
    <li> Exactly what she wanted, the real deal, arrived on time, excellent condition. She&#x27;s used it all her adult life and one of her favorite things  A lovely gift giving experience.</li>
    <li> I thought i can spare a few good lines on this amazing scent,hehe.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well i have bought this a gazzilion times for my mom. She loves it and some time she puts it and i smell like her(its never too much for her)... Its a good scent to gift to friends and family.</li>
    <li> This perfume was just for gift to my gf&#x27;s friend. And her feedback was \\&quot;it smelled sux.\\&quot; But she said thanks to me anyway. Not only her wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product, all of her crew include my gf didn&#x27;t like its smell. So I think overall it sux.</li>
    <li> Someone recently gave me a bottle of Chanel No. 5, which I&#x27;ve not worn for at least 20 years. After using it again, I won&#x27;t let another 20 years go by without a #5 spritz! This classic floral perfume is a very high quality perfume; definitely representative of the quality that the house of Chanel exudes. The perfume is long lasting and a plus for me is that it doesn&#x27;t react badly with my body chemistry which many perfumes seems to do. This perfume was developed in 1921 and it is easy to see why, almost a century later, why it is still popular.</li>
    <li> Chanel No. 5 is the only scent I can wear or tolerate smelling without an allergic reaction.  I was happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon with a monetary birthday gift from my son.  The site is very user-friendly and the product arrived perfectly in the time range quoted.  Thank you, Amazon.    I have purchased gifts through Amazon in the past, and am very pleased.    Toni T, Colorado</li>
    <li> FIRST OF ALL LET ME STATE THAT I LOVE BUYING THROUGH AMAZON.  I HAVE PROBABLY PURCHASED AT LEAST 50-75 PRODUCTS OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS OR SO AND THIS IS MY FIRST NEGATIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrive with about 1/8th of the bottle spilled within the packaging. Also, when I compared the product to my exact bottle of Chanel No. 5 bought at a high end department store, this product had a much pinker hue.  My bottle is closer to the gold color as shown on this review. To add to my concern the scent was clearly weaker then my original. I suspect this product is a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller immediately and relayed that I wanted a full refund includ. postage; and I wanted prepaid postage so I could return their product at no inconvenience to me since the product arrived in a damaged condition.  The product was not well secured with bubble wrap or any other material.  It was simply put inside a USPS flat rate box.  The seller did not contact me for 3 days.  When they did,  they told me  that I needed to return the product AND THEN they would refund my money!!!  My bank returned my funds but the issue is not resolved.  The company told me they would call me and tell me how to return the product on 9/30.  Here it is 10/5 and I have not heard a word.  Who know&#x27;s if they will ever contact me; and who knows if they may try and recharge my account sice they have my CC #.  I am extremely frustrated!!!!</li>
    <li> Not every woman will like Chanel No. 5. It&#x27;s a bold fragrance with notes of amber and jasmine that&#x27;s pretty intense when you first apply it, but it quickly tones down a bit. I first purchased this scent years ago and recently bought another bottle. I think I prefer Chanel&#x27;s Coco Mademoiselle and Chance fragrances more, as they&#x27;re slightly more understated and a bit more youthful. However, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with Chanel No. 5.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!! THE SO-CALLED CHANEL NO 5 FROM SELLER \\&quot;THE COMMON SCENTS!\\&quot; IS A FAKE AND THEY REFUSED TO REFUND!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it is light and floral but with a heavier, richer undertone. Great for a nice dinner out or a casual lunch. Not just for evening wear. I did not buy it through Amazon though wish I had. It was much more expensive in the store.I could wear this perfume everyday. Classic smell that will turn heads (without being overwhelming). It&#x27;s a great smell that could be worn for years and you can get it at a great price. This is the little black dress of perfumes.</li>
    <li> IS FAKE! My wife almost hit me! don&#x27;t buy it! it doesnt seems like photos! it is only a cheap and bad copy!</li>
    <li> It does not smell like the original and it does not last.  It goes away as soon as it dries. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> There was a time when Chanel No. 5 was like a little black dress. Most women had a bottle for special occasions, for when they were feeling particularly beautiful and felt like they deserved the best.&lt;br /&gt;In a way, I&#x27;m kind of glad it&#x27;s not quite that popular anymore, because now not everyone identifies it immediately and people ask what I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very sophisticated floral. The notes in it change subtly all day as you wear it but it stays wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it I feel very grown up and beautiful even if I&#x27;m wearing it with a teeshirt to the grocery store and I&#x27;ve NEVER smelled this one turning nasty on anyone I know who has worn it. Coco Chanel said \\&quot;A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous.\\&quot; This fragrance is both.</li>
    <li> The perfume came in a box that was very wet and saturated with that perfume; the bottle was about 2/3 full, and when I wrote the seller asking how to exchange the perfume for a complete bottle, the seller didn&#x27;t even respond to me.</li>
    <li> I love Chanel #5.  It has always been my most favorite perfume.  I even wear it around the house, not just for special occasions.  But I have learned a very costly lesson about the bottle.  Twice, I accidentaly knocked it over and didn&#x27;t realize it.  The stopper on this bottle isn&#x27;t worth the dynamite to blow it to h...  Most of it leaked out.  So when I ordered it from Amazon the other day, I bought an atomizer.  This stuff is just too expensive to waste.  And, this price is absolutely astoundingly cheap.  I paid over $100 for 1/2 ounce at a local upscale store (Macy&#x27;s).  You can&#x27;t find it at less expensive stores. Spoil yourself, and wear it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALLERT:  It took 3 weeks to get this so called perfume, and it came from pichoka in Bolgaria.  Of course I&#x27;m not returning it, as the postage would be astronomical.  It&#x27;s a complete fake..Just to make sure, I took it to the women at the Chanel counter in my local Macy&#x27;s, and they agreed with me.  I&#x27;m filing a claim for the $75 plus postage I paid.  Do not buy from this seller \\&quot;pichoka\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The seller did not give me in the original container that has the name engraved on the glass. Instead the name was written on a transparent sticker and was stuck at the bottom of the glass where the name should be engraved. It was diluted. Important thing be careful from whom you are purchasing.</li>
    <li> I loved it, one of my favorites</li>
    <li> I ordered Chanel No5 for my wife for Christmas, on Christmas day when she opened the gift box, we discoveded it to be the wrong perfume, wife is still happy that she got COCO MADEMOISELLE, instead, she loves it, but the morons here sent the wrong perfume, I will never do business with these idiots again, next time I will just go to DILLARDS or MACY&#x27;S and make sure to get the right thing. Stupid Stupid and Stupid, have a nice day you idiots. Eric R. Wright.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous if I was going to get the exact item I was looking for and it was!!!  Great seller, because she didn&#x27;t lie and gave me fast shipping!!!! I will buy from again!!!</li>
    <li> There are few luxuries my wife ever yearns for but Chanel #5 is something she has loved since 1970.  I buy the biggest bottle and keep her always stocked.  IT is such a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> such lovely scent for real woman that is sexy for you yes she wear just for you! buy please for woman of ur life</li>
    <li> good product,very good supplier</li>
    <li> The item received is not from Chanel, but send by Luxuri and it is not the real Chanel but a FAKE&lt;br /&gt;it only \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to be the real one. Be aware!</li>
    <li> For years now I have been promising to treat myself to one of the most popular and classical perfumes used by the most respected and best actresses in Hollywood since the dawn of time - Chanel No 5. As it is quite expensive to purchase from the normal retail stockists, I have always made a good excuse not to buy it. That was until someone introduced me to Amazon and on-line shopping. I was delighted to find this product nearly 50% cheaper through Amazon and as my birthday was coming up (7th October), I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase the product. Imagine my surprise when it arrived in perfect condition on the day of my birthday.  I am very impressed with the service and quality and will thoroughly recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday or whatever and was very disappointed with this item.  It had leaked in shipment.  Seemed like the stopper didn&#x27;t fit properly in the bottle.  I do not think this was the real \\&quot;McCoy\\&quot; as she then bought a new bottle from Macy&#x27;s.  I have issues with this company I bought this from.  I let Amazon know about this before and that&#x27;s where the ball was dropped.  I will not buy anymore fragrances or hair goo from Amazon or Ebay again.  I think I have been the victim of knockoff artists and dated merchandise on more than one occasion.  Again, buyer beware.  Sometimes you only get what you pay for.  As of 12-3-11 this item was never resolved.</li>
    <li> Of the major flaws with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - aromatic material is very light and volatile does not prove for a long time.(it is like Toilet spray not Parfum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - head compressor to spray often does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I have given you benefit and thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this product is sure to be from France only,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Parfum for more than 8 years and I did not find this change only when requested by the United States.</li>
    <li> I have always loved chanel produts when I can afford them ,it has been a favorite of mine for many years.i think it isno.1 in any perfume.</li>
    <li> This makes my wife very happy - she loves the smell and the product and I do also.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> This is not the product I ordered.  BEWARE!! It&#x27;s a scam! Fake label on a bottle with a fake box, and the perfume wasn&#x27;t at all close.</li>
    <li> yes the other review is correct, this is not the authentic product, but a knock-off ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too gave this product as a gift ... and the embarrassed gift recipient, after many months of staying silent about it, mustered up the courage to tell me that she didn&#x27;t think that the product was the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She brought it to a nearby store to verify her suspicions, and they were confirmed ... this is not the product that was described, but an imitation.  No wonder why they can provide the product at what seems like a good discount (but still is by no means an inexpensive price!).  Buyers be especially careful as apparently amazon prevents the return of cologne, making this basically a waste of a substantial amount of money.</li>
    <li> This product was water down. My advice is save your money and go physically to a Chanel store instead .</li>
    <li> The bottle of Chanel No 5 bottle I ordered from them was a knockoff, a fake. The label was a reprint and was crooked and off center. The perfume did not even smell like Chanel. Do not order from this seller, I paid 80 bucks for a fake bottle, what a rip off.</li>
    <li> Received this perfume in quick time, and was excited to pull it out of the package.  BUT, the bottle and perfume is quite obviously a fake.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The glass of the bottle is warped, the bottom edge isn&#x27;t straight and there are bubbles in the glass.  Not Chanel quality&lt;br /&gt;2.  The Front label is a cheap sticker.  Not only is it crooked on the bottle, and not centered, the edges were cut sloppy leaving a jagged edge. It is not even the right size or exact shape of my original Chanel.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The bottom label/info is not engraved into the glass.  It is printed on a poorly centered sticker again - Not Chanel&#x27;s Standard&lt;br /&gt;4. The label around the base of the cap is a poorly cut sticker, which overlaps int the back.  when removed from the box, the cap was actually on backwards.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The cap is plastic, not glass.  And cheap, scratched plastic, at that.  It has an obvious manufacturing flaw in the top.&lt;br /&gt;6. The colour is off, just a little, but still doesn&#x27;t match my original Chanel. More Pinkish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, we saved $6 by not buying it in store.  So this certainly wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Live and learn, we will not be trying to buy fragrances online in the future.  Too much risk for frauds - especially at this price!</li>
    <li> My favorite.  What can I say.  Love this perfume.</li>
    <li> My mother is 92 and has worn Chanel No 5 all of my life; it is expensive so I have not been able to buy the eau de perfume for many years.  This was such an awesome deal that I could buy her favorite and I know she will be thrilled. Shipped fast and was the deal of the year!!</li>
    <li> The label fell off and the product is sour. It really smells terrible. It&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for years if it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> My favorite Chanel. the only brand I use. Use sparingly. I add a touch to my  hair too. No.5  love it.</li>
    <li> Today i recieved a vital of Chanel No 5&lt;br /&gt;The holy grail of all perfumes&lt;br /&gt;the most covented sort after perfumes&lt;br /&gt;in the whole world. it&#x27;s inspiered by&lt;br /&gt;Artists Film Litature Actresses and Pop culture.&lt;br /&gt;the addicting scent of Aldehydes addes the powderly&lt;br /&gt; Element&lt;br /&gt;the mixure of neroli citruses Jasmine&lt;br /&gt;and it dries down to refined woods.&lt;br /&gt;I Love the golden Licqur of this perfume&lt;br /&gt;it reminds you walking though a Palace of Rare Gold.&lt;br /&gt; and i love the trade mark bottle very Simple not Gaudy Cheap&lt;br /&gt; loud Minimalistic&lt;br /&gt; Less is more&lt;br /&gt;I Will give this a 5!</li>
    <li> I paid over $100.00 for a gift for mom. She opened it recently and asked where I got this perfume. She stated it was not Chanel #5 and smelled worse then something you would buy as a knock off at a dollar store. So deeply disappointed. Want to report to my credit card company. Rip-off PLEASE BEWARE</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my mother in Mother&#x27;s Day. She is very happy with this gift. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disopointed as item is not original, label is fake, printed on regular printer, head of the spray is not fit properly, smell of the parfum is different than real one, glass of the bottle is poor quality</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a Christmas present for my mom in 2010. When I opened it, it seemed to me that it was fake, as it didn&#x27;t look like the one I saw in a Sephora shop.    After 6 months of using it, my mom says that it doesn&#x27;t stay on her skin and it evaporates really quickly. This is not what a real Chanel should do! Also, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly any more, it jiggles on the perfume bottle. It&#x27;s definitely a fake. I should have just bought the perfume from the Sephora shop, at least I know that they have real perfumes. I&#x27;m very upset about it not being an original! Shame on them!</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and well packed.  It is factory sealed though must be fairly old.  Perfume a little cloudy with some particulates. I&#x27;ve used Chanel #5 for 40+ years and can tell that the scent in this bottle is impaired somewhat though just about acceptable for the price.</li>
    <li> I may be the only person leaving positive feedback on this product, but I was satisfied with my order. I love Chanel no. 5, it&#x27;s the only perfume I have worn for the past five years. It came in the original packaging and the bottle was completely full. It smelled good. It wasn&#x27;t as strong as it is when bought from Chanel itself, but it was still the no. 5 I love.</li>
    <li> The product was diluted, and the packaging was somehow made to look original on the outside except for the actual seal on the EDP bottle top under the lid.</li>
    <li> Chanel 5 is my favorite fragrance, and I don&#x27;t feel dressed without a splash.  It is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> made a great gift for my wife she loves it</li>
    <li> Love it I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mom and she just loves it! Based on that I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> You can not go wrong with Chanel perfume.  Need a perfume for someone.  This is a classic!&lt;br /&gt;Received in perfect condition and much sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, she is happy, what else is there to say?  Oh seven more words, that should do it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I haven&#x27;t had any of this for a long time and I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
    <li> Chanel  No 5 for women is wonderful. I use it several times during the week, and i get compliments  everytime. I love the scent, not too strong, lasts a few hours. It is worth the price, to feel so elegant and special. A beautiful gift for any woman, any age group.</li>
    <li> It came as expected, with quickness. But however did not like the smell n I gave it away. So don&#x27;t shop for fragrance unless u can smell it</li>
    <li> I would say I got a great product for a good price, came packaged well and full!!! My mother-in-law loved opening it Christmas morning and now using it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> Always want to try this and this became a Xmas gift to me.  I like the fragrance .  Will want to get other related items in time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Chanel No. 5 since I was given it as a gift when I was 9 years old. It is my go to evening fragrance.</li>
    <li> I will never again buy fragrances on-line.  I have always have only praises for my purchasing experiences through Amazon.com, but on this one I didn&#x27;t get the product quality I&#x27;m used to receive...</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance it is really a classic.  I can wear it anytime and place.  It is always great and smells clean.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance for all times.  It has such a clean scent, especially after it wears off a little.  My grandson told everybody I smelled good.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and realize that has no fixation. I always had chanel 5 and it&#x27; the first time i had problem</li>
    <li> Great product, great scent, too bad it doesn&#x27;t last too long. one of my favorite scent in Woman&#x27;s perfume, try it and you will know what I mean...</li>
    <li> I like this product,but i was disappointed when i went to Bloomingdales and asked them their price and it was ten dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but if i can get it cheaper at bloomingdales i will buy it there.&lt;br /&gt;Just because you have a reputation for lower prices does not guarantee your customers that you have the best price&#x27;s avilable.&lt;br /&gt;From now on i will be looking for the best prices at stores and not automaticly think Amazon is giving me the lowest price avilable from now on.&lt;br /&gt;My advice to you is to return to your lower prices as you did in the beginning that made Amazon a great place to shop online.&lt;br /&gt; People could get a product at the best price anywhere,THAT was what made you such a hot company to shop at when someone wanted a great product at a lower price. Now i see your raising your prices and thinking peolpe will not check local stores and other avenues to compare prices.I highly recommend you return to your roots to continue a profitable and relieable&lt;br /&gt;business that people will not Question your prices.If you continue this journey down the road of greed,it will be your ondoing.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;A concerned customer*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Chanel No. 5 for many years and still love it; it&#x27;s soft and floral, not an in-your-face overpowering fragrance.</li>
    <li> It was not the same color and scent that I have been using for the past 10 years. They said it was a new formula.  I requested a refund.</li>
    <li> Wait about month, not see the product. bought 2 from Macy&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This is a vaguely pleasant and old fashioned floral ,not as clean and bright as today&#x27;s florals. Not as sweet. This is the stuff that was in my mom&#x27;s drawer, circa 1975, which she never wore, but I tried on several occasions. Honestly I found it boring, and wondered what the whoopla about perfume was about. After all, the musk and strawberry oil that we bought in little shops for 2 dollars really smelled good- why bother with this stuff? Many years later I can appreciate this perfume but personally, I still find it boring. Of course, I don&#x27;t like gardenia. Fast forward some 10 years later when we had a revolution in perfumes, many gorgeous and distinctive fragrances being introduced in the 80&#x27;s and ever since. Bottom line, this is an aquired taste and is not for everybody. The main consideration here is the price, which should deter most casual seekers.</li>
    <li> After reading previous reviews, may I suggest buying this wonderful scent only from the &#x27;Chanel&#x27; source here at Amazon. Beware of those lower priced knock-offs.&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the true perfume, I have to say there isn&#x27;t a more divine fragrance ever created for the female population. This scent is nothing short of \\&quot;bottled femininity.\\&quot; It is a beautiful, soft, playful, classy and mucho sexy scent that is perfect for any occasion, any time. Thankfully, even those ladies that appear to \\&quot;take a shower\\&quot; in perfume, this delicate fragrance never becomes over-bearing. It is such a liquid miracle, it seems to adjust itself for those who don&#x27;t know the proper amount to wear. There&#x27;s a reason that classic icon Marilyn Monroe made this the ONLY perfume that she wore, and after one smell, that reason becomes clear. It is truly a timeless and classy perfume. Sure, if you must, go ahead and wear those \\&quot;girly\\&quot; perfumes for variation, or those loud and powerful perfumes to prove your aggressiveness, but, when you are in the mood to be a lady, Chanel No. 5 is THE one to wear.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. However, I am not sure whether this product is original. Smell does not hold for a long time as it should.</li>
    <li> It was an anniversary present for my wife and she is in love with this perfume!!  This is also a very good price compared to the department stores</li>
    <li> I have used Chanel No. 5 for the last 20-years. This product that I purchased here is not genuine; it is a fake product. I took the bottle to a parfumerie and they tested it. Very disappointing. Do not buy this item from this seller. The smell is off and it does not keep on like the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Chanel No. 5 exclusively for at least 30 years.  It is the scent I identify as &amp;#34;me.&amp;#34;  I love it!</li>
    <li> It was a false product. Label was peeling off and fragrance wasn&#x27;t even close to the real Channel which I had used before. Color changed in a few weeks. Didn&#x27;t bother to return just because I felt I was the dumb one by buying a perfume online.</li>
    <li> Great just could not get more</li>
    <li> We bought this first for my Mom.  She was paranoid it was a knock-off.  So when she gave oit to my sister, we bought her one from Neimans.  What a waste of extra money.  The Amazon was identical in every way!</li>
    <li> I recieved this off my amazon wishlist&lt;br /&gt;This item is an obvious fake...It REAKS of alcohol and cheap fragrance...I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
    <li> The cap mechanism is not very smooth and I did not like the aroma, it does not stay too long.</li>
    <li> i just turned 27 and this scent is a little too mature/deep for me... i&#x27;m more of an escada signature, CK euphoria blossom, hanae mori, escada moon sparkle, armani code type of girl.. maybe i&#x27;ll grow into it!!! it&#x27;s not bad, just a little strong for me.</li>
    <li> I love it. Preferred. This item fits what I wanted. Excellent quality. Beautiful. Confortable. Perfect size. Good Color and well-made</li>
    <li> I usually purchase fragrances from Ulta, because I love the rewards...  However, this was an amazing buy, and a much better price!</li>
    <li> This is the one thing my wife gets every Xmas and if I don&#x27;t get it she really is disapointed. It is exactly the same as it was in 1966 when I got her the first one.</li>
    <li> i give to my wife and she love it thank you it the best of the best</li>
    <li> Smells like a nursing home. Not just because it&#x27;s a grandma fragrance, but because it smells like dirty adult diapers and cleaning products. I&#x27;m not alone in this either because one day at Sephora my boyfriend sniffed this stuff out of curiousity and said \\&quot;Smells like bathroom\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The parchment really was for my wife,  it&#x27;s her favotite and I. Love it on her. It came actually earlier than predicted.  Would get it again when needed.</li>
    <li> ATENDIMENTO PELO VENDEDOR MUITO BOM, ENTREGA EM PRAZO RAPIDO E SEGURO MERECEDOR&lt;br /&gt;DE ELOGIOS. .PERFUME DE QUALIDADE APROVADO PELA MINHA ESPOSA</li>
    <li> Good packaging, visually looked fancy, however I have not tasted its flavor as it was a gift and not sure about her thoughts on this.</li>
    <li> 4 years ago buy this perfume, pay more than $ 100 Dollars for this cheap copy, unfortunately I buy it to make a gift to my mother, which turned out to be a cheap copy and of very poor quality, I write because I think they should be taken care of From this seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected, it is suitable as thought, would recommend</li>
    <li> I like this Parfum Spray,but I did order the No. 5 by Chanel for Women.They sent me COCO Chanel. The COCO Chanel has more nice smell.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong on the best perfume around the world.  And it arrived on Valentines day!  Will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and would recommend to anyone who is looking for &amp;#34;Parfum&amp;#34;.  Men love the order.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent. Death would follow should I fail to keep track of when she needs another bottle, Happy Happy wife</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume as a gift for my wife. For a year, my wife said that she thought it wasn&#x27;t the real deal. Eventually, she bought herself a real bottle of Chanel #5 from a retailer, and the difference is obvious. The bottle is a fake. The color is off. The scent is off. It&#x27;s very disappointing to buy on a site as reputable as Amazon and to end up with a fake. Do not buy from this seller. You are not buying from Chanel.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell right.  I&#x27;m not sure this is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> wase of my money always get the real thing.</li>
    <li> Present for my wife.  I love the fragrance of Chanel No. 5.  She is happy that I appreciate and love her.</li>
    <li> We received the package in a timely manner.  However, when the package was opened and the perfume bottle seen, the label was on crooked (1st flag), the color was not a Chanel color, it was a orange tinted liquid(2nd flag), fragrance is NOT No#5(3rd flag), and last the diffuser(sprayer), doesn&#x27;t work (4th flag).</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a graduation gift for a young lady who was named after Chanel #5 - who upon discovering that she had never owned a bottle of it in her life, we decided it was about time to change that for her.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> I would greatly recommend gifting this to a woman in your life who likes Chanel No. 5!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using my account, Dad got it and a bottle of Chanel for my mom during her most recent stay in the hospital. A little bit of joy goes a long way in the hospital. My parents are my model for a good lasting, loving marriage...a romance between best friends.</li>
    <li> All my women have worn this or nothing at all. This is so subtle and powerful at the same time. My SO loves it as a gift and I love the fragrance</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me say that Chanel No. 5 is one of the loveliest, classiest, most sophisticated scents ever produced for a woman. Its reputation is richly deserved and it will never go out of style. My fiancee loves it and I love to smell it on her. That being said, I have to laugh at you folks who are outraged at getting fake No. 5 here. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?! Are you really that ignorant to think you&#x27;d get the real thing from some fly-by-night perfume company? Chanel No. 5 is the most counterfeited perfume in history people. C&#x27;mon! Would you expect to get a real Rolex watch here as well? I hope not. It&#x27;s very simple. If you want the real thing on-line go to the Chanel website. It&#x27;s well laid out, user-friendly, and you get free two-day shipping if you spend $125 or over. They&#x27;ll also give you complimentary small samples of some of their stuff with your order. Check &#x27;em out. The real Chanel No. 5 is too good to miss-out on.</li>
    <li> I have purchased parfum a few time lets say 3 and every time it never comes. plus it just as cheep to buy from macys and you know that is it the real stuff. don&#x27;t have any thing against amazon I love them they always return my mula fast but this is just one of the products that is to easy to hid fakes or counterfeits and you don&#x27;t really SAVE ANY MONEY bc in the department stores you usually get a free gift wrap and maybe a few samples</li>
    <li> Not much to say, its the original Chanel No. 5 perfume, that should be enough to purchase! Time tested product!</li>
    <li> Do not recommend purchasing from this vendor. The Product received looks like Chanel No. 5 eau de parfum, but does not smell the same and is much paler than my other bottles of the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a pleasant cologne, though would not risk spending the money for a product that is not as advertised.</li>
</ol>
