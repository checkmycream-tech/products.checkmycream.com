      <li>The Tresemme Naturals is a great line of products.</li>
      <li>Great buy, this shampoo is good for every type of hair.</li>
      <li>Good smell that does not clog the sinuses.</li>
      <li>For the size bottle you get, the price is good.</li>
      <li>I loved this shampoo because it used ammonium laureth sulfate, not the sodium version.  </li>
      <li>I love the lathering and scent of this product and the great price.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Really nice shampoo.</li>
      <li>Really liked this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and when paired with the Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner it is perfect!</li>
      <li>price was right, but best of all the shampoo was right too!</li>
      <li>but it did smell good, not over powering sort of clean.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what the sweet orange or the lemon grass is supposed to do, but I do know this stuff is good.</li>
      <li>This shampoo was much better than I had anticipated.</li>
      <li>When buying a shampoo I looked at so many options.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you bought it.</li>
      <li>It seems to be gentle but effective and a good value.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This stuff is much gentler, but still has the great TRESemme results.</li>
      <li>But now, Tresemmé has stepped up to the plate and given us the next best thing to POTS:</li>
      <li>I enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>25 fl oz (739 ml)]] worked better for my hair</li>
      <li>No build up, nice squeaky clean rinse out.</li>
      <li>just what okay well better than we expected, wonderful fragrance and rinses well.  </li>
      <li>When coupled with the Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner, it gives my hair the appearance of more volume and gives an absolutely brilliant shine that several people have commented on.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this shampoo, it&#x27;s very light and sweet.</li>
      <li>It had a very pleasant clean scent and left my hair with a lot of body.</li>
      <li>It made my hair smooth and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve tried no-sulfate shampoo and found it wanting, but this shampoo is, like POTS, gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>If you think about it, what shampoo you select to use is vitally important because beneath your hair and scalp is your brain</li>
      <li>It also has a light scent, so if you&#x27;re a guy you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hair smelling like a bordello.</li>
      <li>It was gentle but effective, it had a light, gender-neutral scent, and it did just what you would expect from a bottle labeled SHAMPOO: it got your hair clean.</li>
      <li>The original TRESemme is great, but the high sulfates really irritate my scalp.</li>
      <li>just leave my hair clean, pleasant smelling with no buildup from daily</li>
      <li>/&gt;Tresemee is the one that covered what I needed, clean hair and the plus side was lower sulfates.</li>
      <li>In sum, if you want a shampoo that does what a shampoo is supposed to do--get your hair clean, period--</li>
      <li>, there was more volume and a nice shine, it does work on short hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Tresemmé Naturals Radiant Volume with Sweet Orange and Lemon Grass.</li>
      <li>It came in the iconic black bottle, and it was good stuff.</li>
      <li>It is a shampoo is gentle and leaves my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>Very strong old lady perfume smell</li>
      <li>I avoid blow drying daily and use a tourmaline dryer if I do, get my hair trimmed regularly, take vitamins, eat healthy, always use conditioner, and using a good shampoo makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>My friends ask me all the time how my hair is so soft, healthy, and manageable.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product for my natural hair as well as my synthetic wigs.</li>
      <li>So I left the aisle in a slough of despond, wondering how many products I was going to have to go through to find just a good, basic shampoo.    </li>
      <li>Very much worth the price</li>
      <li>Styling was easy maybe easier than normal.</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t get passed it, I had to use something else right away to try and get the smell out.</li>
      <li>It may work better for someone with a different type of hair.</li>
      <li>First shampooing was the test.</li>
      <li>my hair feels clean and has more moisture to it then other shampoos do</li>
      <li>It smells great, is slightly thick and works so very well.</li>
      <li>It is worth noting as well that I didn&#x27;t experience any more volume with this shampoo than the other.</li>
      <li>This has been the only product that I have been able to use long term with continually fabulous results.</li>
      <li>, it lathers really well and cleans my hair.</li>
      <li>Well, now every company seems to think we need a whole bunch of sub-brands--</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried for thin fine hair.  </li>
      <li>and you really need to consider what chemicals are coming so very close to this vital organ.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Would use again and highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my hair a little more tangled.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for a few years and use to be able to purchase it in the stores.  </li>
      <li>However, when the bottle arrived I checked, and the first ingredient (after water) is actually sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
      <li>Mainly because it lacks most of the harsh chemicals in regular shampoo&#x27;s and acts on my hair much more delicately and accurately than other brands.</li>
      <li>I usually use Herbal Essences but bought this because it was on sale, and I think I like it even better as far as scent and effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Good concentration level so that a little goes a long way; especially for the repeat.</li>
      <li>It is not harsh and leaves my natural hair and wigs soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the hair products from the brands I mentioned before put my hair on the fritz and this shampoo fixed it up.</li>
      <li>Washing went on as usual and rinsing the shampoo out of my hair was easy.</li>
      <li>I air dry my hair and as it dried I noticed it felt like there was more hair, especially in the back.</li>

<li> must add that I am African American and do not have chemicals in my hair so it is hard to find a product that works well with my hair and does not dry it out.</li>

<li> No I don&#x27;t have oily hair, split ends, dandruff, dry hair, frizzy hair</li>
<li> No more, no less.    </li>
<li> and I probably bought the other bottle in July/August.  </li>

<li> Does not weigh down the hair.</li>
<li> I also use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my hair and I ordered it from Amazon as well.</li>
<li> So I started shampooing and within seconds I had a head of lather - note to self, use less.</li>
<li> &quot; you think it wouldnt be so heavily scented/perfumed.</li>
<li> I went to the store and there were bottles of Tresemmé that promised to make my hair shimmer, pump up my volume, cure my split ends, tame my frizz, and protect my hair color.</li>
<li> I put the usual amount of shampoo in my hand and smelled.</li>
<li> Also, this item can&#x27;t be returned at least purchased as an add-on from this seller.</li>
<li> I mean, there are what, fifteen kinds of Oreos</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t use products like Pantene, Finesse, Herbal Essence, Aussie, and Garnier because my hair just gets so terribly dried out!!</li>
<li> In the last year or so it has been very difficult to find.  </li>
<li> I use it with the Naturals Moisturizing Conditioner as the Volume Conditioner made my hair stiff and difficult to comb out.</li>

    <li> The ingredients listed on the page for this are incorrect. I purchased it specifically because none of the ingredients listed are comedogenic. However, when the bottle arrived I checked, and the first ingredient (after water) is actually sodium laureth sulfate. The info page for this product is incorrect. Also, this item can&#x27;t be returned at least purchased as an add-on from this seller. List the correct ingredients!</li>
    <li> The original TRESemme is great, but the high sulfates really irritate my scalp. This stuff is much gentler, but still has the great TRESemme results.</li>
    <li> The Tresemme Naturals is a great line of products. This one is a great shampoo but I gave it 4 stars because the [[ASIN:B003RSSBXK TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Shampoo, Aloe Vera and Avocado 25 fl oz (739 ml)]] worked better for my hair so I prefer it over the volumizing. It is worth noting as well that I didn&#x27;t experience any more volume with this shampoo than the other. It also makes my hair a little more tangled. It may work better for someone with a different type of hair. I see that they now have a smoothing shampoo out in the Naturals line so I may give that a try.</li>
    <li> Back in the day, when (if you&#x27;re a creationist) men rode dinosaurs and not motorcycles, there was Plain Old Tresemmé Shampoo (POTS for short). It came in the iconic black bottle, and it was good stuff. It was gentle but effective, it had a light, gender-neutral scent, and it did just what you would expect from a bottle labeled SHAMPOO: it got your hair clean. No more, no less.    Well, now every company seems to think we need a whole bunch of sub-brands--I mean, there are what, fifteen kinds of Oreos now?--and Tresemmé jumped on that bandwagon too. I went to the store and there were bottles of Tresemmé that promised to make my hair shimmer, pump up my volume, cure my split ends, tame my frizz, and protect my hair color. But I don&#x27;t have any of those issues, and there was no POTS anymore. So I left the aisle in a slough of despond, wondering how many products I was going to have to go through to find just a good, basic shampoo.    But now, Tresemmé has stepped up to the plate and given us the next best thing to POTS: Tresemmé Naturals Radiant Volume with Sweet Orange and Lemon Grass. I don&#x27;t know what the sweet orange or the lemon grass is supposed to do, but I do know this stuff is good. The bottle says it&#x27;s \\&quot;reduced sulfates.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried no-sulfate shampoo and found it wanting, but this shampoo is, like POTS, gentle but effective. It also has a light scent, so if you&#x27;re a guy you won&#x27;t have to worry about your hair smelling like a bordello. And it doesn&#x27;t leave buildup, so if you&#x27;re a gal you can use it every day and your hair will style up like a dream. And it&#x27;s inexpensive to boot, just like POTS was.    In sum, if you want a shampoo that does what a shampoo is supposed to do--get your hair clean, period--Tresemmé Naturals is the bottle to reach for. You&#x27;ll be glad you bought it. I know I am.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use products like Pantene, Finesse, Herbal Essence, Aussie, and Garnier because my hair just gets so terribly dried out!! This has been the only product that I have been able to use long term with continually fabulous results. My friends ask me all the time how my hair is so soft, healthy, and manageable. I think it&#x27;s a combination of things. I avoid blow drying daily and use a tourmaline dryer if I do, get my hair trimmed regularly, take vitamins, eat healthy, always use conditioner, and using a good shampoo makes a huge difference. All the hair products from the brands I mentioned before put my hair on the fritz and this shampoo fixed it up. I am a happy girl with happy hair!!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, it lathers really well and cleans my hair. I don&#x27;t feel like it necessarily does anything for my hair though, so I probably would not buy it again for a while.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this shampoo, it&#x27;s very light and sweet. For the size bottle you get, the price is good. It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling filmy. I usually use Herbal Essences but bought this because it was on sale, and I think I like it even better as far as scent and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo because it used ammonium laureth sulfate, not the sodium version.  Plus it also used ammonium chloride instead of sodium chloride.  All the sodium ingredients cause acne so I was very happy to use the ammonium version.  The bottle I recently bought shows this has changed in the last couple months.  It is October 2013 and I probably bought the other bottle in July/August.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried for thin fine hair.  I use it with the Naturals Moisturizing Conditioner as the Volume Conditioner made my hair stiff and difficult to comb out.</li>
    <li> Very strong old lady perfume smell, I can&#x27;t get passed it, I had to use something else right away to try and get the smell out. The smell is really bad and horribly strong. When sometime says \\&quot;natural\\&quot; you think it wouldnt be so heavily scented/perfumed. GRoss.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. My stylist uses this so I started using it. As with any shampoo, rotate shampoo types. It seems to be gentle but effective and a good value.</li>
    <li> Great buy, this shampoo is good for every type of hair.</li>
    <li> I love the lathering and scent of this product and the great price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo along with the Tresemme conditioner. It had a very pleasant clean scent and left my hair with a lot of body. Does not weigh down the hair. I will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> Really nice shampoo. No build up, nice squeaky clean rinse out. Good smell that does not clog the sinuses. Good concentration level so that a little goes a long way; especially for the repeat. Excellent price to boot.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and use to be able to purchase it in the stores.  In the last year or so it has been very difficult to find.  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  It is a shampoo is gentle and leaves my hair soft and smelling good. When coupled with the Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner, it gives my hair the appearance of more volume and gives an absolutely brilliant shine that several people have commented on.  I highly recommend this product and when paired with the Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product for my natural hair as well as my synthetic wigs. It is not harsh and leaves my natural hair and wigs soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must add that I am African American and do not have chemicals in my hair so it is hard to find a product that works well with my hair and does not dry it out. I also use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my hair and I ordered it from Amazon as well.Both products seem to work well together. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> my hair feels clean and has more moisture to it then other shampoos do</li>
    <li> just what okay well better than we expected, wonderful fragrance and rinses well.  my boys like it too which is great!</li>
    <li> Really liked this shampoo.  It made my hair smooth and moisturized.  Would use again and highly recommend.  I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was much better than I had anticipated. Mainly because it lacks most of the harsh chemicals in regular shampoo&#x27;s and acts on my hair much more delicately and accurately than other brands. It smells great, is slightly thick and works so very well. Very much worth the price and I look forward to using only this shampoo from now on. If you think about it, what shampoo you select to use is vitally important because beneath your hair and scalp is your brain and you really need to consider what chemicals are coming so very close to this vital organ.</li>
    <li> When buying a shampoo I looked at so many options. No I don&#x27;t have oily hair, split ends, dandruff, dry hair, frizzy hair ...... blah blah blah. What I do have is hair that needs to be shampooed, it is that simple. I don&#x27;t expect my shampoo to fix the worlds problems just leave my hair clean, pleasant smelling with no buildup from daily shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemee is the one that covered what I needed, clean hair and the plus side was lower sulfates. I have short hair so I picked the one that said volume. Not possible to add volume to short hair, so I thought. First shampooing was the test. I put the usual amount of shampoo in my hand and smelled. Was it oranges or lemons I smelled? I wasn&#x27;t sure but it did smell good, not over powering sort of clean. So I started shampooing and within seconds I had a head of lather - note to self, use less. Washing went on as usual and rinsing the shampoo out of my hair was easy. Styling was easy maybe easier than normal. I air dry my hair and as it dried I noticed it felt like there was more hair, especially in the back. After my hair was totally dry and I went to brush, there was more volume and a nice shine, it does work on short hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right, but best of all the shampoo was right too!</li>
