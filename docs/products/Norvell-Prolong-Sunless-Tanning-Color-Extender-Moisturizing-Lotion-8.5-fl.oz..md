      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>This one also dries fast and the smell is pleasant.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, looks natural.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I got a nice color -</li>
      <li>so color comes off on top of hands quickly.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic service.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was paraben free which is important</li>
      <li>I really couldnt be happier or more surprised at how much I loved this lotion.</li>
      <li>lotion is not real thick and has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Super product.</li>
      <li>Like, so mild I had to press my nose up to my skin to smell it.</li>
      <li>Even 8 hours later, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the result -</li>
      <li>I actually ended up leaving it on for almost 24 hours, and after that long, the color was GREAT!  </li>
      <li>It also smells amazing (very reminiscent of</li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle at a salon and paid full price.&lt;br /&gt;Loved</li>
      <li>Some definite pros to this lotion is its nice scent and it blends well.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, and prefer using gradual self tanners or &amp;#34;tan extenders&amp;#34; instead of the regular self tanners just because they usually look more natural on me.</li>
      <li>The color is so pretty</li>
      <li>When it finally did kick in, it was very very mild.</li>
      <li>Much easier on my spray tan.</li>
      <li>I have been using this post spray tan and it really prolonged my tan.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>No smell really at all either.</li>
      <li>Really helps blend and prolong the results of Norvell spray tan</li>
      <li>Norvell is more reasonably priced than other products and is consistant in performance.</li>
      <li>I love being tan a little obsessive with it</li>
      <li>the gradual tanner will show up a pale yellow on light clothes but it washes off easy.</li>
      <li>I had some of the real, salon-bought lotion left to compare, because what I got is NOTHING like the real stuff.</li>
      <li>It gave me a very natural tan that I could gradually work up to.</li>
      <li>Great color, did have the usual self tanner smell after a few hours.</li>
      <li>appearance - a more normal skin tone than my usual glow-in-the-dark white!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pics I&#x27;ve uploaded are of the product on my arms after 24 hours, then showering, compared to my super white legs, just to give you some idea of how pale I am with nothing on my skin at all.slow release micro capsules&amp;#34; are for real!</li>
      <li>I sometimes use different products on different areas of my body depending on how much color I need at that time.</li>

      <li>It barely did anything at all.....</li>
      <li>I have to wear medical gloves all day at work, and wash my hands frequently</li>

      <li>It left my skin looking so soft and supple while it was on (even a tiny bit shiny) as if I had just applied it, even hours later.</li>
      <li>(I get sprayed with the Venetian every two weeks), but not sure it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to look &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; so much as I want to cut down the glare.</li>
      <li>However, this product is darker on me than others I&#x27;ve used (especially when left on longer), and when it does start to fade, it&#x27;s pretty noticeable that my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is uneven.</li>

    <li> Smells great and helps build or extend your tan. Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Will buy this again and again!! Love this❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Horrible stuff.  I will stick with Hempzs from now on.  Much easier on my spray tan.</li>
    <li> A great tanning extender.  Wear gloves during application.  Be sure to wash hands after applying.  Norvell is more reasonably priced than other products and is consistant in performance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a week ago and I loved it ! It smells good and it&#x27;s not greasy and it feels good goin on but , one thing I&#x27;m still a little confused on ... When I apply a sunless tanner I can use the norvell as well and I should reapply once or twice a week?  The color is so pretty it&#x27;s bronzed , brown not orange I definitely recommend this I love being tan a little obsessive with it I tanned years ago about 4 days a week and now , I only sunless tan and it looks the same except no risk of canicer or aging .</li>
    <li> Great follow up to the mousse and as a stand alone gradual tanner.</li>
    <li> It gave me a very natural tan that I could gradually work up to.</li>
    <li> It actually helps retain my color and keeps skin moisturized as well as adds a little color where it is washed or worn off.  I have to wear medical gloves all day at work, and wash my hands frequently so color comes off on top of hands quickly.  This lotion keeps hands matched up with my arms.  Not sticky , smells nice.</li>
    <li> I use for a build a tan color. It gives me just enough color so I don&#x27;t have to get a spray tan for everyday. No smell really at all either. Love that.</li>
    <li> Great color, did have the usual self tanner smell after a few hours.</li>

    <li> I have very fair skin, and prefer using gradual self tanners or &amp;#34;tan extenders&amp;#34; instead of the regular self tanners just because they usually look more natural on me. I don&#x27;t want to look &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; so much as I want to cut down the glare. lol  Plus it&#x27;s also not as noticeable when they start to fade between applications. Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few gradual tan moisturizers, but none of them seemed to be &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; for me. Well, this one seems to be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;!  I&#x27;ll discuss some of things I noticed about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Smell - wasn&#x27;t exactly great, but it wasn&#x27;t bad either. I prefer my skin products to smell like the beach, or like coconuts, and this one DOES NOT. However, it didn&#x27;t smell too bad. I kept waiting for the &amp;#34;sunless tanner smell&amp;#34; to kick in, but it took quite a while before it did (like about 8 hours). When it finally did kick in, it was very very mild. Like, so mild I had to press my nose up to my skin to smell it. That smell also tends to linger with me, even after washing off the product, but that was not the case with this.&lt;br /&gt;2. The moisturizing - This is a GREAT lotion. It left my skin looking so soft and supple while it was on (even a tiny bit shiny) as if I had just applied it, even hours later. Even after washing it off the next day, the moisturizing effects stayed. My skin feels soooo soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;3. The color - I usually notice color development after a few hours, even with the gradual sunless tanners. I worried a little bit after I had this on for about 5 hours and was barely seeing any color change at all. Even 8 hours later, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the result - it just wasn&#x27;t as noticeable as I had hoped for. But after about 12 hours, I was quite happy. I actually ended up leaving it on for almost 24 hours, and after that long, the color was GREAT!  Unlike all the other tanners I&#x27;ve used before that seem to reach peak development after about 8 hours, this one kept getting gradually darker.  I guess the &amp;#34;slow release micro capsules&amp;#34; are for real!&lt;br /&gt;4. Fading - Definitely fades slower than other products. I sometimes use different products on different areas of my body depending on how much color I need at that time. I&#x27;ve noticed that the areas with this product on last a day or two longer than areas with other products on them. However, this product is darker on me than others I&#x27;ve used (especially when left on longer), and when it does start to fade, it&#x27;s pretty noticeable that my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; is uneven. I fix that by exfoliating a couple of times and then starting over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pics I&#x27;ve uploaded are of the product on my arms after 24 hours, then showering, compared to my super white legs, just to give you some idea of how pale I am with nothing on my skin at all.slow release micro capsules&amp;#34; are for real! 4.

    <li> Excellent product!  Better price than at the tanning salon...superfast shipping!</li>
    <li> Keeps my tan real and spray looking great.  Was recommended to me by a friend and I would recommend to others as well.</li>
    <li> I use this as a self tanner and I love it.The first time I used it I got a nice color - only one application!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not real thick and has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would give me a little color and this does&lt;br /&gt;the trick.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by this lotion. It feels luxurious, but not greasy. It also smells amazing (very reminiscent of Bath &amp; Body works Brown Sugar &amp; Fig scent). I usually put this lotion on at night before bed and take a shower in the morning. I did notice when I put it on in the morning one day the gradual tanner will show up a pale yellow on light clothes but it washes off easy. I really couldnt be happier or more surprised at how much I loved this lotion.</li>
    <li> Sorry, my mistake. I thought this was sunless tanning&lt;br /&gt;But discovered it enhances the tan you already&lt;br /&gt;Have.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Fantastic service. Thank you so much. The price of this product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Lori</li>
    <li> I was disappointed! It barely did anything at all.....boo!</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle at a salon and paid full price.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the product and its results of glowy skin without cancer, wanted to save money, so Amazon to the rescue. WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never buy unsealed lotions from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been warned at the salon that most of tanning lotions on Amazon are fake, but wanted to save money and figured salon ppl were just being snooty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just grateful I had some of the real, salon-bought lotion left to compare, because what I got is NOTHING like the real stuff. Who knows what&#x27;s in it?!?!&lt;br /&gt;The lotion I got differs in color (too white), scent is different and of course, it doesn&#x27;t tan at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIP OFF. Shameful.</li>
    <li> The cream works! Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. I have moonlight white legs that won&#x27;t tan - but my arms tan - so I get very uneven. This product didn&#x27;t make my legs look suntanned, instead it just gives them a nice &amp;#34;flesh colored&amp;#34; appearance - a more normal skin tone than my usual glow-in-the-dark white!!!! There is no streaking AND no build up of dark patches on your knees or ankles -- highly recommend for very pale folks who want some color</li>
    <li> Great Value Price at $17 compared to salon price $35!</li>
    <li> Super product. A+A+A+</li>
    <li> love this product line</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! I have been using this post spray tan and it really prolonged my tan. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The tan was too subtle.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Very disappointed with this product:(  It turned my legs orange and streaked terribly.  I bought this because it was paraben free which is important but it also needs to be a quality product.  I will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, looks natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for over a year now. I have very fair skin, and it has never worked as a gradual tanner on me. It gives me a little color to cover up my paleness for the day which is a plus, but it only lasts for the day. You have to apply it daily to maintain the color and it appears about the same tone each time, so it doesn&#x27;t get gradually darker.   I also use it when I get spray tans to help extend them and keep moisturized. I also use it as an every day lotion when I don&#x27;t have a spray tan because it&#x27;s not greasy and that&#x27;s why I love it! It&#x27;s hard to find lotions that are not greasy. This one also dries fast and the smell is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really helps blend and prolong the results of Norvell spray tan</li>
