      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>but I love how it curls and straightens out my hair!</li>
      <li>Amazing .</li>
      <li>I immediately got on here and purchased my own along with the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>excellent works very well</li>
      <li>and it still curls her hair just fine!</li>
      <li>Over all its just ok I shouldve gotten a baby liss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so awesome &amp; convenient to have all 3 features in one simple tool.</li>
      <li>the concept was ingenious.</li>
      <li>I love how you can lock it</li>
      <li>but they couldve put more effort and thought into making it.</li>
      <li>Its a litlle better than my CHI</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this multitasking tool.</li>
      <li>#love,love, love this iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
      <li>, this is best flat iron I have ever purchased.</li>
      <li>It has a smooth finish and glides very easy.</li>
      <li>Best mistake I made in a long time</li>
      <li>I love how when I&#x27;m styling my bangs I can bump them so easily as I&#x27;m straightening them.</li>
      <li>Heats Up Very Quickly</li>
      <li>It gets nice n hot.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t right for me, though it is a nice product for the right hair length.</li>
      <li>it heats up real fast!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
      <li>when I first spotted it I thought it looked interesting &amp;</li>
      <li>The iron had good glide to it but not enough grip to grab locks of hair.</li>
      <li>so I have to make sure to do big sections at a time because my hair is very fine.</li>
      <li>The curling wand is great except for the face that the black ends of the wand/iron pull your hair because your hair gets stuck to it.</li>
      <li>I wanted the unit to have various temp setting options and to grip the hair pretty good.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I was HOOKED!</li>
      <li>Laila thank you for designing this amazing product that actually WORKS!</li>
      <li>I love this unit because it can get close to the roots for those who a natural.  </li>
      <li>It gets hot quickly.</li>
      <li>My daughter bought hers first from Walmart, she used it to make nice, big curls.</li>
      <li>First of all I didn&#x27;t go looking for this.</li>
      <li>and I was hooked with the first section I straightened.</li>
      <li>so I always used many different tools.</li>
      <li>This assault-baton is blistering hot - even on the lowest setting - ALL THE WAY AROUND.  </li>
      <li>The iron heats up in seconds, great for when you are running late.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>At first, I thought it was my fault...</li>
      <li>I am in so much pain right now.  </li>
      <li>I love how you can create curls and flat iron with one tool.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>My hair is as straight as when I go to the Dominican&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Nor did I know Laila Ali had a whole line of hair styling tools.</li>
      <li>The way the plates/Barrels are designed I can get very close to my roots.  </li>
      <li>Definitely heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that the entire yellow area is heated — it&#x27;s designed so that longer hair (more than 6&amp;#34; or so) can be wrapped around it.</li>
      <li>ok I have natural curly hair that bushes up after getting wet #notcute&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As a woman with natural hair, it straightened my hair to the point where I thought I had gone to the salon.</li>
      <li>It has a safety setting to turn itself off when not in use, and it gives you the option to have curls vs a straight relaxed style by locking the flat iron.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get my hair quite as smooth as other flat irons.</li>
      <li>Soft Sheen use to have a similar unit ( made by Conair)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve searched high low for this all in one tool that would allow me to flat iron and/or curl my hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this flat iron simply because I needed a new one.</li>
      <li>However I choose to see that as a positive because I can straighten my hair in less time since I&#x27;m using thicker sections.  </li>

<li> Well my dog (pitbull) ate my flat irons (did not think that was possible)</li>
<li> I purchased this flat iron yesterday at Walmart</li>
<li> so I purchased the Laila Ali flat irons because of the 2 n 1 opton</li>
<li> I like the fact that its a flat iron and a curling iron.</li>

<li> I hope they keep it around for a long time.</li>
<li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t being careful enough.</li>
<li> Its a flat iron, curling iron, and when you lock it, it becomes a curling wand!!!!  </li>
<li> but as I sat at my computer and rubbed Neosporin on to the TWO BLISTERS and ONE POST-BLISTER SCAB that I currently have on my neck and face, I have decided that it is simply not worth it.  </li>
<li> HARDER TO WORK WITH</li>
<li> THAN I EXPECTED.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other replacement options and the hair</li>
<li> I agree w/ the other reviewers that there&#x27;s a gap between the plates.</li>
<li> My sister got very long and thick hair</li>
<li> Also it would have been helpful to include a heat protectant glove, I have burnt my fingers a few times now.</li>
<li> have managed not to get a relaxer for the past 5 months</li>
<li> Seriously, save yourself.</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> Not impressed at all.</li>
<li> Worst case, I could return it.</li>
<li> and you have a blister/wound so terrible</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> excellent works very well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I&#x27;ve EVER used.</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t have the stand as stated but I love how it curls and straightens out my hair! Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; is actually a radio of injuries per use.  If you love hickey-sized blisters all over your neck and face, this product is for you! DO NOT be fooled by its seemingly great, versatile concept.  This assault-baton is blistering hot - even on the lowest setting - ALL THE WAY AROUND.  All it takes is a millisecond of contact with your skin and you have a blister/wound so terrible, people will think you were in an accident.  At first, I thought it was my fault... Maybe I wasn&#x27;t being careful enough. But I&#x27;ve been using this devil-wand for a couple of months. I gave it a fair chance... but as I sat at my computer and rubbed Neosporin on to the TWO BLISTERS and ONE POST-BLISTER SCAB that I currently have on my neck and face, I have decided that it is simply not worth it.  I am in so much pain right now.  Seriously, save yourself.</li>
    <li> ok I have natural curly hair that bushes up after getting wet #notcute&lt;br /&gt;I have managed not to get a relaxer for the past 5 months, I normally flat iron my hair or wear a pony tail. Well my dog (pitbull) ate my flat irons (did not think that was possible) so I purchased the Laila Ali flat irons because of the 2 n 1 opton, this is best flat iron I have ever purchased. My hair is as straight as when I go to the Dominican&#x27;s. I absolutely love this flat iron. The iron heats up in seconds, great for when you are running late. It has a safety setting to turn itself off when not in use, and it gives you the option to have curls vs a straight relaxed style by locking the flat iron. #love,love, love this iron.</li>
    <li> These curling iron is one of the best on the market right now. It gets hot quickly. I like the fact that its a flat iron and a curling iron. My daughter bought hers first from Walmart, she used it to make nice, big curls. I immediately got on here and purchased my own along with the blow dryer. Best investment I made. Its a litlle better than my CHI</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It it heats up real fast! My sister got very long and thick hair and it still curls her hair just fine! I love how you can lock it so you don&#x27;t have to hold the thing when you curl your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing . Heats Up Very Quickly</li>
    <li> This tool is great. Its a flat iron, curling iron, and when you lock it, it becomes a curling wand!!!!  My only complaint is that for professional  purposes, the cord is too short. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Laila Ali 2-1 yesterday. I absolutely LOVE IT!! Laila thank you for designing this amazing product that actually WORKS!</li>
    <li> I like the versatility of this 2 in 1 styler. I like to change up my hair style a lot so I always used many different tools. Now with this it is the only one I need. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the plates do not fully press together so I have to make sure to do big sections at a time because my hair is very fine. Also it would have been helpful to include a heat protectant glove, I have burnt my fingers a few times now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get my hair quite as smooth as other flat irons. Curling is a bit tricky if you don&#x27;t eant burnt fingertips.</li>
    <li> The idea of this flatiron/curling wand was GENIUS but they couldve put more effort and thought into making it. The iron doesnt fully &amp;#34;clench&amp;#34; together which results in your hair not really getting flattened because its not a tight grasp on it. The curling wand is great except for the face that the black ends of the wand/iron pull your hair because your hair gets stuck to it. Over all its just ok I shouldve gotten a baby liss.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t right for me, though it is a nice product for the right hair length. I didn&#x27;t realize that the entire yellow area is heated — it&#x27;s designed so that longer hair (more than 6&amp;#34; or so) can be wrapped around it. But for those of us with short hair it&#x27;s too dangerous for your fingers and ears because it heats up quite nicely. I only used it once and realized it just wasn&#x27;t going to work out for me. I returned this unit and ordered the Laila Ali LAST2601 Ceramic Root Styler instead. I hope that 1/2&amp;#34; unit will work well for my short hair.</li>
    <li> HARDER TO WORK WITH THAN I EXPECTED.  WAS HOPING FOR A NICER SHAPED CURL THAN WHAT I ENDED UP WITH.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. Not enough grip to hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron simply because I needed a new one. The first time I used it, I was HOOKED! As a woman with natural hair, it straightened my hair to the point where I thought I had gone to the salon. I love this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> was a gift for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool.  Soft Sheen use to have a similar unit ( made by Conair) and it was my fav. It went out on me and they no longer make it so I&#x27;ve searched high low for this all in one tool that would allow me to flat iron and/or curl my hair. I wanted the unit to have various temp setting options and to grip the hair pretty good.  I&#x27;ve tried other replacement options and the hair just slides through. Not good. I love this unit because it can get close to the roots for those who a natural.  I like the design of the unit  and the ease of it. I hope they keep it around for a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron yesterday at Walmart and I was hooked with the first section I straightened. It has a smooth finish and glides very easy. I love how you can create curls and flat iron with one tool. Awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> The look of this iron was great. Purple and gold great combo. The iron had good glide to it but not enough grip to grab locks of hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this multitasking tool. First of all I didn&#x27;t go looking for this. Nor did I know Laila Ali had a whole line of hair styling tools. I actually bought this by mistake. Best mistake I made in a long time lol. I found it at Ollie&#x27;s (a close out bargain store) for only $6.99 !! when I first spotted it I thought it looked interesting &amp; the concept was ingenious. Figured what do I have to lose. Worst case, I could return it. It gets nice n hot. I have wavy &amp;#34;white ppl&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair. I use it on the highest setting. Definitely heats up quickly. I haven&#x27;t had any issues burning myself. I like that it has the auto shutoff feature. I agree w/ the other reviewers that there&#x27;s a gap between the plates. So u have to use a thicker section of hair in order for the plates to grip. However I choose to see that as a positive because I can straighten my hair in less time since I&#x27;m using thicker sections.  I love how when I&#x27;m styling my bangs I can bump them so easily as I&#x27;m straightening them. The way the plates/Barrels are designed I can get very close to my roots.  In a flash it transforms to a wand. I&#x27;ve never owned a wand before. But had been thinking about buying one for a while. It&#x27;s so awesome &amp; convenient to have all 3 features in one simple tool. It&#x27;s definitely a 3-in-1: flat iron, curling iron &amp; wand. Brilliant product!!</li>
