      <li>Hair is happy.</li>
      <li>While this may be great news for some, it&#x27;s not so great for others.  </li>
      <li>Great experience , will definitely buy it again when the two bottles are over :D</li>
      <li>Nice as promised, Yet to be tested with Dandruff and Moisturiser.</li>
      <li>I have always liked Head and Shoulders and I turn to them whenever I am having a dandruff problem....</li>
      <li>this is by far best!</li>
      <li>I was terrified of what I would look like after showering, but I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere that day, so I went ahead and conditioned lightly with my normal conditioner and hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>no flakes all day rinse and repeat morning and night for better effect.</li>
      <li>one shampoo top looked like someone took a knife to it and</li>
      <li>just works good, just remember to scrub your head while washing with warm or hot water for a while; my head is smooth and</li>
      <li>Used to be the best shampoo, left hair feeling clean and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I bought the head and shoulders online because it seemed like a great deal for such huge bottles.</li>
      <li>It seems to smooth out my split ends</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use any additional hair products to keep my hair smooth all day.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, my hair didn&#x27;t appear greasy after blow-drying.</li>
      <li>cheapies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I use shampoo and conditioner in this same kind!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 8 months in now, and for the first time in my life, my head is flake, itch and pain free!  </li>
      <li>Since the switch to the &amp;#34;fresh-scent technology&amp;#34; something has changed and leaves the scalp itchy and irritated, greasier as well, doesn&#x27;t feel clean</li>
      <li>I have a mildly dry and itchy scalp with some mild dandruff, so I thought the description sounded good.</li>
      <li>Not only does this product work really well, but it also smells Amazing!</li>
      <li>anyway, this stuff makes my hair feel very light and smooth, and has definitely helped with dryness.</li>
      <li>I used this for a couple of days and the key to good healthy hair is definitely starting at the scalp!</li>
      <li>greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: This is a super moisturizing shampoo, and it was a bit too much for me.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, if you have a very dry scalp and hair, this shampoo is probably perfect for you.</li>
      <li>: It left my hair feeling very, very smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This particular formula now contains Sweet Almond Oil.  </li>
      <li>I alternate using this with Garnier Dandruff Shampoo/conditioner, and my scalp is definitely in better shape than before I bought this.</li>
      <li>Maybe even a little better!</li>
      <li>It left my hair absolutely tangle free after showering.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>The smell is also very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I had to wash it twice with my normal shampoo to get it off!</li>
      <li>I have very long, straight, somewhat fine hair.</li>
      <li>so* smooth and soft that I could barely get hair clips or ponytail holders to grip my hair.</li>
      <li>and then the normal Pantene, herbal essence, exct....</li>
      <li>Have used other H&amp;S products in the past and they were great.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this \\&quot;Dry Scalp\\&quot; formula for years, but now Head &amp; Shoulders has changed the ingredients to include sweet almond oil.</li>
      <li>Just received a new shipment on 1/22/2011 and the bottles graphics and ingredients have changed.</li>
      <li>It makes my scalp itchy, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean for as long than other shampoos do.</li>
      <li>It took three washes by other shampoo to get my hair feeling like normal again.</li>

<li> this is for dry scalp--if your hair gets greasy, then you probably shouldnt buy shampoo meant for dryness.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s dry to begin with and</li>
<li> My hair is quite thick and somewhat dry, so I could use a dry shampoo and could normally go a while before needing a wet shampoo.  </li>
<li> I dye my hair a lot and my hair was sooo dry!</li>
<li> to Target to try their Up&amp;Up version as a replacement for the Dry Scalp care, all sold out!</li>
<li> I have very dry hair and dry skin!</li>
<li> It was fine at the ends but just the roots it was all greasy and just made my hair look dirty.  </li>
<li> I gave it a try for a few months to see if it continued to work, or if the dandruff would come back, as it always has with Nizoral.  </li>
<li> Also, I have long bangs, and I couldn&#x27;t wear them down without making my forehead abnormally</li>
<li> I will still stick with the other varieties, though...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m baffled that my hair could feel so greasy in the shower and not appear greasy after drying, despite leaving my forehead extra slick.</li>
<li> Now I need some more, but I am so scared to purchase another.  :(</li>
<li> : As I was shampooing, my hair felt extremely greasy.</li>
<li> and It solved my issue in less than a week.</li>
<li> i have hard water in my town, so this is helps to balance things out so my hair isnt a dry mess after showering.</li>
<li> I want to start by saying that regular Head &amp; Shoulders has always made my condition worse.  </li>
<li> Dandruff is dead.</li>
<li> Tried it for a few days in a row to give it a chance, but results only got worse.  </li>
<li> Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who feels the new version is terrible.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t care about what shampoo I use</li>
<li> No more flakes and my hair is softer than ever.</li>
<li> Im disabled and unable to go to the store for myself, and when I ordered this I was in a therapy facility.</li>
<li> I have hair that gets greasy in 24 hrs at baseline and this shampoo does not make that worse.</li>
<li> but recently I had a scalp issue that started getting annoying , and I bought this product</li>
<li> dandruff shampoos made it worse.</li>
<li> I never write reviews on shampoos but this was by far the WORST shampoo ever!!!!!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by salons in getting their name brand expensive stuff</li>
<li> No wonderful scent or anything if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
<li> and if you are unhappy with your dryness, don&#x27;t settle for</li>
<li> and he&#x27;s way weird about smells!</li>
<li> but this one is AWFUL!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> just works good, just remember to scrub your head while washing with warm or hot water for a while; my head is smooth and no flakes all day rinse and repeat morning and night for better effect.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying that regular Head &amp; Shoulders has always made my condition worse.  Throughout the years, I have tried it all; tar shampoos, Selsum, Nizoral (which worked, but only for a short time), T-Sal, etc.  I received a sample of this shampoo in the mail, which is the only reason I tried it.  It immediately cleared up my condition in one wash.  I gave it a try for a few months to see if it continued to work, or if the dandruff would come back, as it always has with Nizoral.  I&#x27;m 8 months in now, and for the first time in my life, my head is flake, itch and pain free!  I follow the shampoo with the Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp conditioner, which may make all the difference.</li>
    <li> I alternate using this with Garnier Dandruff Shampoo/conditioner, and my scalp is definitely in better shape than before I bought this.</li>
    <li> Have used other H&amp;S products in the past and they were great.  This one leaves hair looking and feeling greasy, despite repeated rinsing and wringing.  Tried it for a few days in a row to give it a chance, but results only got worse.  Will have to buy a clarifying shampoo to undo the damage.</li>
    <li> Just received a new shipment on 1/22/2011 and the bottles graphics and ingredients have changed. This particular formula now contains Sweet Almond Oil.  While this may be great news for some, it&#x27;s not so great for others.  I have been using this \\&quot;Dry Scalp\\&quot; formula for years, but now Head &amp; Shoulders has changed the ingredients to include sweet almond oil. I am allergic to tree nuts, including almonds, so I am going to have to do a skin test to see if I can still use this formula. It is low on the list of ingredients, so I hope I won&#x27;t get a reaction. Amazon needs to update the ingredients on this product page as the Dry Scalp Care from Head &amp; Shoulders has changed.  I would have purchased a different formula, had I known Amazon was sending something that didn&#x27;t match the ingredients stated on this page.   I thought I would be getting the version that was described on this page.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of my dandruff. I never write reviews on shampoos but this was by far the WORST shampoo ever!!!!! It kept leaving my hair greasy at the roots. It was fine at the ends but just the roots it was all greasy and just made my hair look dirty.  I will never EVER buy a head and shoulders product again.  I will stick with Suave and Herbal Essences.</li>
    <li> I have never had a problem with oily/greasy hair.  My hair is quite thick and somewhat dry, so I could use a dry shampoo and could normally go a while before needing a wet shampoo.  We started buying this recently because it is what is sold at Costco.  I wash my hair 3-4 times with shampoo each time I shower.  As soon as my hair dried I noticed it looked very greasy.  Just realized tonight that it is the Head &amp; Shoulders.  It may work well for some, but I will not be using this stuff again.</li>
    <li> this is for dry scalp--if your hair gets greasy, then you probably shouldnt buy shampoo meant for dryness. perhaps people arent washing it out properly as they shower. anyway, this stuff makes my hair feel very light and smooth, and has definitely helped with dryness. i have hard water in my town, so this is helps to balance things out so my hair isnt a dry mess after showering.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t care about what shampoo I use but recently I had a scalp issue that started getting annoying , and I bought this product and It solved my issue in less than a week. Great experience , will definitely buy it again when the two bottles are over :D</li>
    <li> I just moved from Washington DC to Salt Lake City Utah and had no idea the effect the dry climate would have on my hair and skin health. I wake up every morning dousing myself in lotions and oils to keep the itchiness at bay but after a month my scalp began suffering big time! I finally gave in and bought this product (still iffy from all the one-star reviews it received) and after using it for about a week along with the 2-minute mask my scalp health is almost back to the way it was before I moved!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like I said, if you&#x27;re looking for something to treat dandruff do not use this product!!! Dandruff is a waxy fungus and this will only add oil and discomfort!!!</li>
    <li> I picked this shampoo up at my local grocery store because it was on sale. I have a mildly dry and itchy scalp with some mild dandruff, so I thought the description sounded good. I wish I had read the reviews first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It left my hair feeling very, very smooth and moisturized. I have very long, straight, somewhat fine hair. It left my hair absolutely tangle free after showering. It seems to smooth out my split ends and there&#x27;s no frizz to speak of. I didn&#x27;t need to use any additional hair products to keep my hair smooth all day. The smell is also very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: As I was shampooing, my hair felt extremely greasy. I had to do a double take to confirm that I hadn&#x27;t accidentally purchased a conditioner instead of a shampoo. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed, and this shampoo didn&#x27;t seem to rinse out fully. I was terrified of what I would look like after showering, but I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere that day, so I went ahead and conditioned lightly with my normal conditioner and hoped for the best. Fortunately, my hair didn&#x27;t appear greasy after blow-drying. However, my hair was *so* smooth and soft that I could barely get hair clips or ponytail holders to grip my hair. Also, I have long bangs, and I couldn&#x27;t wear them down without making my forehead abnormally greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: This is a super moisturizing shampoo, and it was a bit too much for me. I&#x27;m baffled that my hair could feel so greasy in the shower and not appear greasy after drying, despite leaving my forehead extra slick. I will continue to use it occasionally as a sort of deep conditioning shampoo treatment, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it daily. Stay away from it if you tend to have oily hair. On the other hand, if you have a very dry scalp and hair, this shampoo is probably perfect for you. I give it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t work as a daily shampoo for me, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> I received this order months ago, and I couldn&#x27;t review it then. Im disabled and unable to go to the store for myself, and when I ordered this I was in a therapy facility. I took pictures of how it arrived, but in words all I can say is wth? one shampoo top looked like someone took a knife to it and half the bottle leaked into the box and the top was also broken off. TOTALLY freaked me out and I was upset but took the loss of one bottle . Now I need some more, but I am so scared to purchase another.  :(</li>
    <li> Not only does this product work really well, but it also smells Amazing! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It makes my scalp itchy, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean for as long than other shampoos do.</li>
    <li> I suffered from dry scalp for a long time. I have very curly hair that&#x27;s dry to begin with and dandruff shampoos made it worse. This stuff is great at moisturizing my hair and scalp. No more flakes and my hair is softer than ever.</li>
    <li> I bought the head and shoulders online because it seemed like a great deal for such huge bottles. I will never do that again! It left my hair greasy and grimey. After I showered I felt like I forgot to wash my hair. I tried it three times hoping for different results and got nothing. It took three washes by other shampoo to get my hair feeling like normal again.</li>
    <li> This does what it says. Dandruff is dead. Hair is happy. No problem with the almond oil making this greasy. I have hair that gets greasy in 24 hrs at baseline and this shampoo does not make that worse. Maybe even a little better! Definitely not drying. No wonderful scent or anything if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Head and Shoulders and I turn to them whenever I am having a dandruff problem....but this one is AWFUL! It left my hair greasy and sticky feeling. I had to wash it twice with my normal shampoo to get it off! I will NEVER use this again! I will still stick with the other varieties, though...I don&#x27;t know what it is about this one, but it is a no go!</li>
    <li> Used to be the best shampoo, left hair feeling clean and non-greasy. Since the switch to the &amp;#34;fresh-scent technology&amp;#34; something has changed and leaves the scalp itchy and irritated, greasier as well, doesn&#x27;t feel clean anymore.&lt;br /&gt;A shame.&lt;br /&gt;Gone to Target to try their Up&amp;Up version as a replacement for the Dry Scalp care, all sold out! Apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who feels the new version is terrible.</li>
    <li> Nice as promised, Yet to be tested with Dandruff and Moisturiser.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and dry skin! I have tried numerous expensive stuff and it was okay and then the normal Pantene, herbal essence, exct....this is by far best! I dye my hair a lot and my hair was sooo dry! I used this for a couple of days and the key to good healthy hair is definitely starting at the scalp! Don&#x27;t be fooled by salons in getting their name brand expensive stuff and if you are unhappy with your dryness, don&#x27;t settle for cheapies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I use shampoo and conditioner in this same kind! Ps my husband loves the smell of my hair after I use this and he&#x27;s way weird about smells!</li>
