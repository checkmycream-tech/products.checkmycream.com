      <li>What i like the most is my breath smells like i just chew on some apple flavor gum</li>
      <li>It is part of a healthy routine to brush, floss and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my mouth tingle.</li>

      <li>Finally, a mouthwash that&#x27;s not just tolerable but actually tastes great.</li>
      <li>This is almost exactly the same result as the Crest pro-health rinse (mostly 1-star reviews on that because of the staining) which I used over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>When he first started using it he described it as being spicy</li>
      <li>It arrived very fast and the packaging was easy to open.</li>
      <li>Really livens up my AM.</li>
      <li>Mouthwash is just what we wanted but the shipping was way too much.</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>The taste is not disagreeable but, contrary to other reviews, there&#x27;s more \\&quot;mint\\&quot; than \\&quot;cinna\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Especially if you&#x27;re a cinnamon lover, either Closeup or Lavoris will make you much happier, the latter having a better aftertaste.</li>
      <li>The flavor itself is less like cinnamon and more along the lines of cough medicine.</li>
      <li>I had never seen this particular flavor before, so I thought I would try it out.  </li>
      <li>Unlike the kids mouthwash his breath actually smells fresh afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Those that come with alcohol are definitely stronger, and with rare exceptions I have to rinse with water after using those.</li>
      <li>I first began using this product when it was on sale at the local drug store.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve used Listerine for years, and I cannot really comment on anything but the taste of this one, because I have no way of judging the \\&quot;Total Care\\&quot; features.</li>
      <li>I have a new found appreciation for mouth wash in general.</li>
      <li>Just to be clear, this product is very much like their other mouthwashes, so if you have a problem with that Listerine</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as some of the other reviewers make it out to take, though it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as the more traditional mint flavors to me either.</li>
      <li>I also tried the light green variant of the Listerine total-care, and the same effect.</li>
      <li>This one did not seem to have any alcohol, and if it did, its barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>Their isn&#x27;t much burn with this as compared to other Listerine flavors.</li>
      <li>It does not taste bad and does not taste good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Finally, a mouthwash that&#x27;s not just tolerable but actually tastes great. Mint flavors almost always make me gag ... not this one. Just to be clear, this product is very much like their other mouthwashes, so if you have a problem with that Listerine \\&quot;burn,\\&quot; you might want to stay away. To tell you the truth, I don&#x27;t even taste the mint part. It tastes more like an interesting version of cinnamon to me.</li>
    <li> I had never seen this particular flavor before, so I thought I would try it out.  It tasted great, not as cinnamon as I would have liked; however, it was still delicious.  Cleans the mouth as well as any other Listerine I have had.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re searching for cinnamon, this is not the place. The taste is not disagreeable but, contrary to other reviews, there&#x27;s more \\&quot;mint\\&quot; than \\&quot;cinna\\&quot;. Especially if you&#x27;re a cinnamon lover, either Closeup or Lavoris will make you much happier, the latter having a better aftertaste.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite mouthwash and I love the way it makes my mouth tingle. I love that the flavor is Cinamint and even my 9 year old doesn&#x27;t mind using it. When he first started using it he described it as being spicy but now he doesn&#x27;t have any problems with it. Unlike the kids mouthwash his breath actually smells fresh afterwards.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Mouthwash is just what we wanted but the shipping was way too much.</li>
    <li> What i like the most is my breath smells like i just chew on some apple flavor gum, my breath stays smelling good.</li>
    <li> the product taste is okay the price is outrageous</li>
    <li> To bad they took this stuff off the shelf so now all I can do is buy it online. Keep selling it!!</li>
    <li> great stuff- helps to rinse away stuff before brushing, and can be used as a general mouth wash- my dental appointments have improved since using it.</li>
    <li> Their isn&#x27;t much burn with this as compared to other Listerine flavors. The flavor itself is less like cinnamon and more along the lines of cough medicine. The price was $4 when I picked it up. You can&#x27;t beat that for a liter of Listerine.</li>
    <li> I have a new found appreciation for mouth wash in general. Even though I have to say not all mouthwash are of the same quality. Those that come with alcohol are definitely stronger, and with rare exceptions I have to rinse with water after using those. This one did not seem to have any alcohol, and if it did, its barely noticeable. Like the Cinnamint taste, the price was so so, and the size was not all that big. I do like the clean fresh taste it leaves after using. 4 Stars!</li>
    <li> In my local area it has been very hard to find the \\&quot;Cinnamint\\&quot; flavor. It is my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I found it on Amazon with no problem. The best part is the price. Where I shop, the price I pay for two is equal to the price I purchased these three for.&lt;br /&gt;Very good value. It arrived very fast and the packaging was easy to open. I know I am going to purchase this many times over in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> I like to rinse my mouth often with mouthwash which freshens my breath and helps to reduce cavities. This mouthwash not only kills germs and freshens your breath but it also has fluoride to strengthen your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just feel better when I use a good mouthwash and I like the flavor of the Cinnamint brand better than most. It is part of a healthy routine to brush, floss and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and you will too!</li>
    <li> After ACT Restoring discontinued cinnamon flavor, I was very happy to learn that Listerine offered this product in this flavor, which pairs very well with my Crest cinnamon toothpaste.  Really livens up my AM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 62 year old female who has always hated Listerine since I was a little girl.  Hated brushing my teeth.  Mouthwash always tasted like nasty medicine.  Never could get the hang of flossing...always felt like I was pulling my teeth out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found cinnamon (Cinnamint) Listerine at the store.  I love anything cinnamon!  Then I saw (Crest) cinnamon toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in Heaven!  Sometimes I go to bed at night, then realize that I haven&#x27;t brushed my teeth.  I get up and brush and rinse with this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist has noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that everything they claim on the bottle is true, but it is a good cleansing mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like this, then don&#x27;t use it.  Find something that will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for me.  I have finally gotten into a dental cleaning routine that I&#x27;m committed to.  Sonacare, Waterpik and a toothpaste and mouthwash that I look forward to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way my teeth feel and look.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used Listerine for years, and I cannot really comment on anything but the taste of this one, because I have no way of judging the \\&quot;Total Care\\&quot; features. But it doesn&#x27;t taste as bad as some of the other reviewers make it out to take, though it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as the more traditional mint flavors to me either.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day and it really works. Just remember that this is the one with alcohol that has that zing sting. I&#x27;m used to it. I&#x27;ve used Listerine Zero but I prefer the regular one. There are a lot of rinses out there and it&#x27;s a matter of what you like. I&#x27;m not particular about flavor. I&#x27;m more interested in the product. For me, this works and I like it and have used it for months. The 6 in 1 is great and you don&#x27;t have to spend a zillion hours looking for something that has it all.</li>
    <li> Good additional flavor</li>
    <li> It does not taste bad and does not taste good. This mouthwash is very strong and i can&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than a fewwwww seconds.</li>
    <li> Good transaction, good product.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product as my ONLY brand and type of mouthwash... It has a great flavor... and it works GREAT. Amazon is the only place I can find this... and the seller was GREAT and QUICK in shipping this to me. I will purchase it again thru Amazon from Pharmapacks..the seller. Thank you both... Pharmapacks and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I first began using this product when it was on sale at the local drug store. After a few weeks I noticed brown stains around all my teeth. This is almost exactly the same result as the Crest pro-health rinse (mostly 1-star reviews on that because of the staining) which I used over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing in common with this and the Crest Pro-health I used was that they were both purple. I also tried the light green variant of the Listerine total-care, and the same effect. My dentist needed to extend our cleaning session for about 20 minutes just to get rid of all the stains. At the moment I&#x27;m still looking for a mouth rinse that doesn&#x27;t stain, and this product does not fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Makes your mouth feel super clean.  After brushing,swishing this around releases any particles the toothbrush missed.&lt;br /&gt;If you love cinnamon gum you&#x27;ll love this Listerine flavor !!</li>
