      <li>I use it on Pueen  plates and  it works good.</li>

      <li>Love the konad set!</li>
      <li>Love the product, and worked like a charm!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>100% recommended, this stamper is great for nail stamping is a very functional product and a very good brand, i love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product when I&#x27;m able to get it to work.</li>
      <li>This is a nice tool for those who don&#x27;t have the ability/patience to design nails by hand.</li>
      <li>The people at the fair, where i bought it said it was easy.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing :]</li>
      <li>If it was a really great product why do I have to do it so many times to get it right?</li>
      <li>This works so great, and it&#x27;s super easy, gonna get a kit for my nieces birthday.</li>
      <li>then use it again- it should work fine!</li>
      <li>Have been using this stamper on the SE plates along with the BM and Mash plates I have purchased and have had much better luck since using the Konad stamper.  </li>
      <li>My favorite stamper.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve tried like 48 times already and the designs come out OKAY</li>
      <li>cheap and nice  </li>
      <li>Okay maybe I should do 500 more trials,</li>
      <li>but, overall impressed with the delivery and timing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely pleased and can&#x27;t wait to use it more.</li>
      <li>is money  :)</li>
      <li>I believe its more user error than product error.</li>
      <li>The stamper works great, but I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the scraper, I just use an old credit card and it works great.</li>
      <li>and I feel like it picks up the image better and is more user friendly.</li>
      <li>but the design is the most important part</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with both the stamper and scraper :) It effortlessly transfers a clean, crisp image every time.</li>
      <li>have to say that is very easy to stamp nails, if you like craft you will be able to do it with any polish, this is my first time and the came as a salon quality.</li>
      <li>But other than that, this product is great!</li>
      <li>The one that comes with the actual nail art kit doesn&#x27;t work as good as this one!</li>
      <li>It is quite squishy and conforms easily to your nail.</li>
      <li>you need to clean the plate after each use, to get a more define transfer into the gum.</li>
      <li>so fine i grab a credit card and that works but the design will not come off the plate to my stamper ...</li>
      <li>It takes a little practice to do a perfect stamping job.</li>
      <li>Took a couple of tries to get it right, and practice makes perfect.  </li>
      <li>you should wipe it clean with acetone and rub the surface with a nail file (lightly)</li>
      <li>She was SO excited but it doesn&#x27;t work with all nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Was not having much luck using that stamper or plates and had heard that the Konad stamper was better</li>
      <li>the instructions say: apply polish to the plate, scrape it at an angle and then quickly get the stamper and roll it over the desired stamp and then roll it over the nail</li>
      <li>I have found out that the stamper works better if I remember to use a buffer across the top occasionally.</li>
      <li>This product came fast and is easy to used it.</li>
      <li>Worth using it..</li>
      <li>I had a lot of fun using the stamp.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the scraper yet because I&#x27;ve heard the metal can scrape your plates, but the stamper alone is worth the 5 bucks, or whatever it cost.</li>
      <li>now it&#x27;s useful</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card and that works better.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived in less than a week which was really nice!</li>
      <li>i guess you have to have SUPER HIGH quality or special kinds.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t pick up the polish and i was only able to get it to work to get 2 nails done.  </li>
      <li>and it can get pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about a week now and been trying everything i know to get it to work first</li>
      <li>If the Stamper is not working when you first get it</li>
      <li>It is really awsome ...</li>
      <li>I struggled with it,&amp; even after much practice, the end result was a blurry or smeared image....</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this and use it, as I&#x27;ve seen a few cool \\&quot;nail stamp\\&quot; designs.  </li>
      <li>I have only used this stamper once, but I already know I like it better than the cheapy Pueen one I initially bought.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s easier than a normal stamp with ink and paper.</li>
      <li>The  images arnt wide enough to cover most nails .</li>
      <li>The scraping off of the excess nail polish from the plate got a little messy but it was worth it to get cute designs on my nails that I could never have drawn with a nail polish pen.</li>
      <li>Only drawback is that you have to really watch where you are centering the design on the stamp onto your nail.</li>
      <li>I just use an old credit card instead.</li>
      <li>Based on the number of positive reviews I initially ordered the MASH Double Sided Nail Plate Art Stamp and Scraper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using Konad special nail polish in black and also in white ( just in case one bottle was old</li>
      <li>I suck pretty hard at getting the design on my nail clearly and completely.  </li>
      <li>The scraper works just as it should as long as you clean it after a few scrapes to avoid a build-up of residue; the stamper works just as well.</li>
      <li>Hard to clean off.</li>
      <li>I want to share a few tips and tricks that were helpful for me when I was first starting out...</li>
      <li>The scraper doesn&#x27;t always scrape clean (annoying sometimes), but when it does scrape clean, you&#x27;ll end up with a clear design.</li>

<li> I tried all the tricks and still no success.</li>
<li> She doesn&#x27;t use it very often and when she does she gets angry</li>
<li> The only drawback is that it&#x27;s difficult to see red tones of nail polish on the stamper.</li>
<li> Very narrow  , so if you have wide nails or even med width don&#x27;t use these</li>
<li> I think this is a waste of time and waste of money, I made a mistake buying it now its just gathering dust in my drawer.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> Received in just a few days.  </li>
<li> I purchased this product hoping to replace spending a lot of money for the nail professionals to paint designs on my nails, but it was really waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a week now and been trying everything i know to get it to work first the scraper doesn&#x27;t work all that well always leaves streaks across my plates... so fine i grab a credit card and that works but the design will not come off the plate to my stamper ... I&#x27;m using Konad special nail polish in black and also in white ( just in case one bottle was old I tried two ) so that doesn&#x27;t work either I used fingernail polish like orly regular polish and that half ass worked the stupid paint just will not stick to this stamp thing.</li>
    <li> This is a nice tool for those who don&#x27;t have the ability/patience to design nails by hand. The scraper doesn&#x27;t always scrape clean (annoying sometimes), but when it does scrape clean, you&#x27;ll end up with a clear design. The stamper is tricky. I had to watch a video to learn how to apply. (The trick to using the stamper with non-Konad polish is buffing the scraper with a nail file.) It takes a little practice to do a perfect stamping job. But overall a neat idea.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of fun using the stamp.  The scraping off of the excess nail polish from the plate got a little messy but it was worth it to get cute designs on my nails that I could never have drawn with a nail polish pen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping to replace spending a lot of money for the nail professionals to paint designs on my nails, but it was really waste of money. It doesnt work as well as it says. You need a lot of patients for this one!!</li>
    <li> greatttt! just massage the gunny stamper if it does not pick up the product. have great nails day!</li>
    <li> Love the konad set! Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s amazing :] Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t think this item works, all you need to do is take the pink rubber piece out and rub it with your fingers- twist it around, whatever- then use it again- it should work fine!</li>
    <li> Love the product, and worked like a charm! Took a couple of tries to get it right, and practice makes perfect.  Only drawback is that you have to really watch where you are centering the design on the stamp onto your nail.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the stamp I expected, but I suppose it works well enough.</li>
    <li> This works so great, and it&#x27;s super easy, gonna get a kit for my nieces birthday. I thought it&#x27;d be difficult to line everything up and all that but it&#x27;s easier than a normal stamp with ink and paper.</li>
    <li> Everything came on time and as described.  I suck pretty hard at getting the design on my nail clearly and completely.  I think I just need to practice.</li>
    <li> The  images arnt wide enough to cover most nails . Very narrow  , so if you have wide nails or even med width don&#x27;t use these</li>
    <li> The stamper is very necessary if you are Stamping your nails with the KONAD or Fauxnad stampers, the scraper works but is not necessary to scrape off the excess polish (you can use an expired credit card). If the Stamper is not working when you first get it you should wipe it clean with acetone and rub the surface with a nail file (lightly) then once you pick up your pattern with it, stamp it onto your nail very quickly!!!! if the polish dries out it will not transfer.</li>
    <li> this is great! i ordered it and then a few weeks later it ended up at my mall....a small set was 135.00!!!! so glad i found this product!!</li>
    <li> I used it just like the instructions say: apply polish to the plate, scrape it at an angle and then quickly get the stamper and roll it over the desired stamp and then roll it over the nail but it doesn&#x27;t work all that good, I&#x27;ve tried like 48 times already and the designs come out OKAY but not all that great!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only a couple of times, but it seems that it will only work with their nail polish, regular polishes won&#x27;t adhere to the stamp and it can get pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> Reveived my items on time and were in excellant condition. No Problems with my items at all, work excellant. Have used them non stop since receiving them.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this and use it, as I&#x27;ve seen a few cool \\&quot;nail stamp\\&quot; designs.  Fail.  It didn&#x27;t pick up the polish and i was only able to get it to work to get 2 nails done.  I will say i used non-konad nail polish, which might have played a part, but i tried several different brands and none worked.  Thankfully, it wasn&#x27;t an expensive purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product when I&#x27;m able to get it to work. I believe its more user error than product error.</li>
    <li> I bought Mash plates and this stamper is great, I love it, all the designs on my nails stamped beautifully, it is a great stamper set.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that is very easy to stamp nails, if you like craft you will be able to do it with any polish, this is my first time and the came as a salon quality.</li>
    <li> This stamper and scraper works good on all plates. I use it on Pueen  plates and  it works good. The scraper is metal and scratches the plate but the design is the most important part and the scratches is just cosmetics.</li>
    <li> it transfers the image really good! you need to clean the plate after each use, to get a more define transfer into the gum.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t pick up image. Waste of money. Knock off stamper. I tried all the tricks and still no success. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work, even with their nail polish. Okay maybe I should do 500 more trials, cause I have time for that. If it was a really great product why do I have to do it so many times to get it right? I think this is a waste of time and waste of money, I made a mistake buying it now its just gathering dust in my drawer.</li>
    <li> This product came fast and is easy to used it. It stamps the images perfectly, I would recommend this stamper. Nice Job Konad!</li>
    <li> it wasnt the same as the picture smaller in size but, overall impressed with the delivery and timing.Thank you Let&#x27;s see how it works.</li>
    <li> 100% recommended, this stamper is great for nail stamping is a very functional product and a very good brand, i love it</li>
    <li> Really good stamper and scraper!</li>
    <li> I have only used this stamper once, but I already know I like it better than the cheapy Pueen one I initially bought. It&#x27;s a different material than the Pueen one and I feel like it picks up the image better and is more user friendly. I haven&#x27;t used the scraper yet because I&#x27;ve heard the metal can scrape your plates, but the stamper alone is worth the 5 bucks, or whatever it cost. I&#x27;m definitely pleased and can&#x27;t wait to use it more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I wanted the stamper in the picture but received another version of the konad stamp. It works great but I purchased based on the picture because I prefer the smaller ones for holding and this is not what I got</li>
    <li> I bought this after looking at imitators and deciding to go with the Konad brand-name stamper/scraper. And I must say that I haven&#x27;t been disappointed! The scraper works just as it should as long as you clean it after a few scrapes to avoid a build-up of residue; the stamper works just as well. It is quite squishy and conforms easily to your nail. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s difficult to see red tones of nail polish on the stamper. But other than that, this product is great!</li>
    <li> The stamper works great, but I didn&#x27;t have much luck with the scraper, I just use an old credit card and it works great. Perfect stamper though.</li>
    <li> I seriously thought this product was going to make me have \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; nails. The people at the fair, where i bought it said it was easy. Oh my god. No it isn&#x27;t. This is such a waste! Id rather by fake nails with designs.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister. She was SO excited but it doesn&#x27;t work with all nail polishes. i guess you have to have SUPER HIGH quality or special kinds. She is 12 and that is not likley all the time. She doesn&#x27;t use it very often and when she does she gets angry</li>
    <li> I like the width of the stamper but the scraper blade is a bit too short.  Hard to clean off.</li>
    <li> Received in just a few days.  Bought this stamper after my initial purchase of a Salon Express set.  Was not having much luck using that stamper or plates and had heard that the Konad stamper was better so I thought I would give it a try.  Have been using this stamper on the SE plates along with the BM and Mash plates I have purchased and have had much better luck since using the Konad stamper.  I have found out that the stamper works better if I remember to use a buffer across the top occasionally.</li>
    <li> Based on the number of positive reviews I initially ordered the MASH Double Sided Nail Plate Art Stamp and Scraper. I struggled with it,&amp; even after much practice, the end result was a blurry or smeared image.... So I decided to try this Konad stamper/scraper combo instead. I am very pleased with both the stamper and scraper :) It effortlessly transfers a clean, crisp image every time. When comparing the diameter of the stamping pads, the Konad is the larger of the two, which makes it possible to cover the entire length of fingernail with the transferred image, as opposed to the MASH only partially covering.  All in all, the Konad stamper surpassed my expectations, I have no complaints whatsoever!....I want to share a few tips and tricks that were helpful for me when I was first starting out...The best kind of polish to use for stamping is one that is opaque. Konad polishes are specifically designed for the purpose of stamping(I recommend white and black colors), but are certainly not required. I&#x27;ve had great results with chrome/metallic polishes, especially when stamped over a dark base color. Hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me even after i purchased the stamping polish so i gave it to my cousin (14) she loves it!</li>
    <li> I just saw some videos on stamping and read that this stamp was one of the favorites of a nail blogger I follow so I decided to try this stamp. It works great, although stamping takes some practice but I&#x27;ve (sort of) gotten the hang of it!  The only suggestion i have is that the scrapper that it comes with scratched some of my nail plates so I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card and that works better.  Item arrived in less than a week which was really nice!</li>
    <li> Im using this product for a month now it&#x27;s useful and I like it .its cheap and nice  worthed forth is money  :)</li>
    <li> Great scraper! The one that comes with the actual nail art kit doesn&#x27;t work as good as this one! Love it!</li>
    <li> This order only gets 2 stars because I did not get the stamper pictured - which is what I wanted.  I specifically ordered the stamper shown because of the smaller size.  I already have a double sided stamper, but I sometimes find the length annoying to work with and wanted to try a small one.  That&#x27;s the only reason I ordered this stamper.  What I received was another double stamper.  When I place an order with Amazon, I expect to get what is pictured - not what someone in a warehouse thinks I should get.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> My favorite stamper. I do not use the scraper because it scratches my plates I just use an old credit card instead.</li>
    <li> It is really awsome ... Worth using it.. Perfect for stamping Nailart..</li>
