    <li> Such a credit product! Works great and the timer settings help to cure gel more precisely! It&#x27;s a must have for all nail techs! Go CND!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter for christmas . She has used it once so far and is pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LIGHT!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! ITS PERFECT!!! (:</li>
    <li> New. Took around three weeks to get but works perfect.Came in excellent shape. Must have for doing shellac nails.</li>
    <li> Easy to use but takes longer when doing your own nails (because you can only do one hand at a time) but money saved is worth it!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this light for anyone interested in gel polish.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and is large enough to cure all 5 fingers at the same time.</li>
    <li> AFTER HAVING A MANICURE 3 TIMES FOR GEL NAIL POLISH, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO DO MYSELF AT HOME, AND I&#x27;M SO HAPPY WITH HOW EASY IT IS.  IT DOES TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN I&#x27;D LIKE FOR THE ENTIRE PROCESS, BUT WORTH IT IN THE END.  I PURCHASED THIS UV LAMP AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS, AND DOING RESEARCH ON-LINE AND WATCHING VIDEOS.  NOT DISAPPOINTED IN MY PURCHASE AT ALL!</li>
    <li> works really well.  I didn&#x27;t know that I need to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; the polish with alcohol after 2 min.  so I thought the machine wasn&#x27;t working because after 2 minutes, my nail polish was still somewhat wet.  but after just light touch with alcohol swab, my nails were perfect.</li>
    <li> I LOVE getting manicures and pedicures at the salon, but now I&#x27;m trying to save money.  I started researching gel curing lamps and found the 36W Shellac CND UV Lamp Nail Acrylic Gel Curing Light Timer Dryer Manicure System and decided to get it.  So...I received it yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  The instructions were easy to follow and understand.  I had a little trouble taking off the top lid of the lamp to remove the blue film as indicated on the instructions.  In the end, I had to show that lid who was boss and eventually got that darn thing off.  The bulbs were easy to install.  I put the lid back on and was ready to go.  The lamp is so easy to use--user friendly.  Yay!!  I basically only used two buttons (A-10 seconds and C-120 seconds).  The curing for 2 minutes for each layer was a bit warm.  I may have to order those gloves.  I have to admit doing the left hand was so easy.  Doing my right hand may take some time to perfect as I was a bit shaky.  I&#x27;ve never come across a curing system that had the curing lights AND the air blowing but it seemed to cure the nails very well.  All in all from what I can see so far, I am very pleased with the way my nails turned out.  Love this system!!!</li>
    <li> The product was as described, but it came with 2 of the 6 bulbs not working.  I found out when I tried to cure my polish&lt;br /&gt;and one side didn&#x27;t cure.  I was able to finish the manicure by doing one hand at a time, but I wanted one that I could put both feet and hands in at the same time.  I tried to get an exchanage, but Amazon would only let me return it without an exchange.</li>
    <li> Have used a few times now. Works great, easy to use. Only complaint was that it took a long time to ship. I am a prime customer and usually get my orders in 2 days</li>
    <li> Perfect...as described and delivered quickly&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all who love gel nails.  The lights came separately in the same box, were easy to install and the unit works perfectly.  It makes nail care so much easier!</li>
    <li> Came neatly package, easy to put together, easy to use.  Has four preset timers and comes with bulbs.  Dried shellac completely.  Can fit feet in to cure pedicures.</li>
    <li> Everything seems to work the way it should. My nails are cured after following the basic instructions. It&#x27;s kinda nice to be able to shellac my nails in the comfort of my home. I seldom have time to go to a salon.</li>
    <li> I had been going to the spa to get my gel nails every 1.5-2 weeks and was spending a lot of money. I got this lamp and I actually feel it does a much better job than the one they have at the spa... my nails now last solid 2-3 weeks. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Got the item speedy and it wAs a genuine cnd uv lamp. Nib complete with 30 day warrenty. It works great. Drys my shellac fast and now i can save on going to the spa all the time!</li>
    <li> saves so much money no more going to the salon- Highly recommend</li>
    <li> If you want a professional outcome get the equipment they have in the nail salons. This lamp is perfect every time. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year and so glad I invested in a high quality lamp. I paid for with only 4 nail manicures. Tip if you take the bottom plate out you can do a pedicure also.  It&#x27;s best out there.</li>
    <li> I got this item for a friend and she loves it. She is very happy about the time it takes now for her to give her nails a beautiful look. I would recommend buying this product if you want to get nice nails in no time.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, came with great instructions.  Doing my own nails is saving me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Love it , so happy I got it, my nails look great, I would recommend it to everybody</li>
    <li> Love this machine!  So worth the money!  Very easy to set up and use.  No regrets on purchasing this!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Easy to put together by a non-professional.</li>
    <li> love theses lamps they do the job well! recommend these lamps to any salon. they just work so quickyly and dry the gel polish in a good speed so im able to fit more clients, love it so much i just may order another one for a back up</li>
    <li> Arrived within the week,  Set up was a breeze, instructions were quite simple and was having a mani/pedi session with my daughter that evening ;)  Love the shellac products, as a manicurist I have to say this is the best way to maintain healthy nails while still allowing for nail growth and just a little added strength!  Best of all my manicure looks perfect for well over 14 days and my toes look great for a month!! ;)</li>
