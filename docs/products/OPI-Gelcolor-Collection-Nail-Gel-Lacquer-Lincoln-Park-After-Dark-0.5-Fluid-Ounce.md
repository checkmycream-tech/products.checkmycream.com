      <li>This works perfect.</li>

      <li>Great OPI color.</li>
      <li>Bottle doesn&#x27;t have good consistency.</li>
      <li>I loved using this brand and color, will buy again.</li>
      <li>But you must shake the bottle really good or the color doesn&#x27;t go on well .</li>
      <li>This color is my favorite, great any season.</li>
      <li>I really liked the color, and so I went with it, and now I have a bottle of watery, runny, transparent shellac that I will never use.</li>
      <li>Since it is so popular at the salon, I bought my own bottle.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s kind of a grayish purple.</li>
      <li>I love my Colorgel, but won&#x27;t be using this one again.</li>
      <li>My husband purchased this for me because this is one of my favorite colors.</li>
      <li>I have been using the color in nail polish before I was able to get Gel.</li>
      <li>I just love the OPI Gelcolor Nail Gel Lacquer.</li>
      <li>Totally bizarre product!</li>
      <li>Overall the product works well and the color looks great!</li>
      <li>OPI gelcolor is a better quality gel than others, is more glossy.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color from OPI of all time.</li>
      <li>I love OPI Gel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been asked if I use a top coat or not - it all depends if I have some on hand.</li>
      <li>love this color  </li>
      <li>I say more</li>
      <li>This is an awesome color and it seems to last forever!</li>
      <li>Love the product and the color .</li>
      <li>no matter how many coats you use.</li>
      <li>The gel version perfectly matches the regular nail enamel version.</li>
      <li>Love OPI quality and consistency.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This has always been one of my favorite nail colors.</li>
      <li>Good price and exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>so I am more than familiar how this color should look and feel.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use if you have the lamp, as application is just as you would apply nail polish.</li>
      <li>I am a loyal OPI nail polish and Gel user, having tried many colors in Gel.</li>
      <li>This is the same product my salon uses and I&#x27;m tickled that I can purchase it for a great price here in Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
      <li>goes on smooth</li>
      <li>I recommend CND Shellac, Gelish is good if you&#x27;re on a budget (colors require about 3 coats at least), and ManiQ is great if you are experienced with gel and wanna pay a little more, as they are also runny (BUT opaque and it stays on forever).</li>
      <li>so you really need to  make sure you shake, shake, shake and then shake the bottle some more to make sure the color completely mixes before applying.</li>
      <li>But at least it is still perfect for fall!!</li>
      <li>I have always loved this color, which I have had for years in regular polish.</li>
      <li>My nails grow so quickly</li>
      <li>If not, this is shiny, sets quick, and again, I use it to keep my hands looking fresh where it has grown out between nail appointments.</li>
      <li>I have used several other OPI gels at home with great results, but this is not usable !</li>
      <li>the color of the lacquer wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>I applied 4 coats and it still didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and am wearing it right now.</li>
      <li>I had to purchase it for those aggravating days between fills when I want to have a perfectly manicured look, or if I have to go out of town for an unplanned business trip and can&#x27;t get to my salon, I&#x27;ve actually covered up my &amp;#34;pink &amp; whites&amp;#34; when they&#x27;ve grown out a little.  </li>
      <li>Thought I was buying the GEL version of the polish but is in the regular bottle labelled OPI, not Gel Coat so assuming it is the regular nail polish, yet paid a lot more for it!!  </li>
      <li>I do use a very fine buffer just to even out the nail, and the seam between the fill and my cuticle, but it&#x27;s an easy fix to help hold me over for a few days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a clear watery light purple color....</li>
      <li>The first thing out of my daughter&#x27;s mouth after she tried this was &amp;#34;Gross&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>I purchased it because its one of my favorite colors in the regular polish.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
      <li>I must admit that I am a Gelish fan, so this was the first non-Gelish gel nail color I have applied on myself.</li>
      <li>I love the regular Lincoln Park</li>
      <li>I love the OPI regular nail polish but not a fan of the gel polish.  </li>
      <li>so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.</li>
      <li>I do the first week with the gel polish, then clean it up with the regular polish and a gel topcoat to keep it nice for the second week.</li>
      <li>Even in the bright sunlight, where the regular version looks a lot more deep purple with tiny sparkles.  </li>
      <li>it is too big and bulky, and no matter how many times I try to get the excess of the brush, it still seems to be too much.</li>
      <li>I have always purchased OPI Gelcolor, and this is absolutely the first issue I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed with the colour.</li>
      <li>But you must know that it HAS to be shaken very well or can be runny.  </li>
      <li>But what I really don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t coat evenly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the color</li>
      <li>Very runny and</li>
      <li>I do my own gel polish nails at home and although I really do love to wear this color, I have found it to take a little longer to cure than all of my other gel polishes.  </li>
      <li>I have many other gel OPI colors and none have the consistency of the color I received.</li>
      <li>After Dark is one of my favorite colors from OPI.</li>
      <li>After Dark is my favorite color.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great black color :</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and new</li>
      <li>After Dark Gel Polish is a nice dark redish purple, the color is great, however the polish is a bit thick.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a nice deep purple but turns out its almost black and not at all like the picture shown.</li>
      <li>By the time you get enough coats to make the nail look good, there is so much pooled around the edges that it just looks ridiculous.</li>
      <li>gel manicures are very popular and expensive.  </li>
      <li>I wish I read the reviews prior to purchasing and checked out some nail polish blogs; this is not the rich deep purple I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using OPI Colorgel at home for the past year, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I had to use 3 coats on the first hand, and couldn&#x27;t figure out why on the second hand, the color looked clear coming out of the bottle.</li>
      <li>The color was watery and not near as rich as the color should be and overall, just a hassle to use because of its viscosity.</li>
      <li>I love the color (because I already own the non-gel version of OPI Lincoln Park), but I hate the applicator brush on the Gel Lacquer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is one of my favorite go to colors, as its edgy but classy, when I don&#x27;t have my standard &amp;#34;pink and whites&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The picture depicts a more dark purple, but in person in is almost black.</li>
      <li>Really thin- took 3 coats to not be able to see through it.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this color - I really wanted a nice deep purple that would have the shine of gel but was sadly disappointed.</li>
      <li>This is the first and most disappointing issue I have run into with this nail Gel product, and only in this color.</li>
      <li>Some of the nails come out really dark and some much lighter.</li>
      <li>Also, I have this EXACT color and the gel is a glossy dark purple brown black mess rather than the pretty deep plum polish.</li>

<li> The polish is super thin and runny, so it pools by your cuticles and looks nice and dark, while the actual nail looks sheer and sloppy.</li>
<li> I was looking for a dark purple/black and even with multiple coats it was never dark enough.</li>
<li> ManiQ is a runnier gel, but this stuff won&#x27;t sit on your nail long enough to paint the rest of your hand.</li>
<li> I can cure thin coats for up to three minutes each, and after I get the top coat on, it&#x27;s still a streaky gooey mess</li>
<li> Although I get my nails professionally done, when my appointment of two weeks limit for a fill gets pushed back, and I can see a little aggravating space between the color &amp; cuticle,</li>
<li> the only disappointment is that I love the selection of OPI colors, but I guess I will just have to stick to their non-gel for my toes, and use Gelish on my fingers.</li>
<li> When I finally went to go use it-the polish was extremely watery and did not have the same consistency that my other opi polishes have</li>
<li> long story short, NOT worth the money AT ALL.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish I read the reviews prior to purchasing and checked out some nail polish blogs; this is not the rich deep purple I was hoping for.  If I had to describe it, it looks like a grape popsicle that&#x27;s just melted in the wrapper.  The color I was going for when ordering this was \\&quot;Every Month is Oktoberfest\\&quot;, which is heading my way as we speak.  At least now when I&#x27;m feeling goth or it&#x27;s Halloween, I can paint my nails accordingly.</li>
    <li> This color was not as shown and was way lighter.</li>
    <li> As a Cosmetology student, I&#x27;ve played around with a couple of brands of gel. OPI has been the biggest pain. I&#x27;ve used Shellac, ManiQ, and Gelish and I feel that this OPI is way too runny and cures poorly, even with OPI&#x27;s base and top coat (which I also do NOT like). ManiQ is a runnier gel, but this stuff won&#x27;t sit on your nail long enough to paint the rest of your hand. Also, I have this EXACT color and the gel is a glossy dark purple brown black mess rather than the pretty deep plum polish. I can cure thin coats for up to three minutes each, and after I get the top coat on, it&#x27;s still a streaky gooey mess underneath.&lt;br /&gt;So long story short, NOT worth the money AT ALL. I recommend CND Shellac, Gelish is good if you&#x27;re on a budget (colors require about 3 coats at least), and ManiQ is great if you are experienced with gel and wanna pay a little more, as they are also runny (BUT opaque and it stays on forever). BUT NEVER BUY THIS OPI JUNK, please please please.</li>
    <li> This is one of my Go To favs.  But you must know that it HAS to be shaken very well or can be runny.  Also I suggest curing it longer then needed.  Al dark colors should be done longer.</li>
    <li> Really thin- took 3 coats to not be able to see through it. Then it was almost too thick- could be because it&#x27;s so dark</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OPI Colorgel at home for the past year, and I love it. This has to be the worst one. I would give it no stars if I could. I purchased it because its one of my favorite colors in the regular polish. Beware that it doesn&#x27;t stay mixed. I had to use 3 coats on the first hand, and couldn&#x27;t figure out why on the second hand, the color looked clear coming out of the bottle. I had to keep shaking it. It looked like I had different colors on both hands. It was also very difficult to remove compared to the others. I love my Colorgel, but won&#x27;t be using this one again.</li>
    <li> I love the regular Lincoln Park After Dark polish, which is admittedly a very dark color.... however the gel version seems SEVERAL shades darker than the regular version.  So dark that it&#x27;s virtually indistinguishable from plain old black polish.  Even in the bright sunlight, where the regular version looks a lot more deep purple with tiny sparkles.  There is none of that with the gel version!</li>
    <li> This color is my favorite, great any season. OPI gelcolor is a better quality gel than others, is more glossy.</li>
    <li> This works perfect. I loved using this brand and color, will buy again. OPI is great and the way to go.</li>
    <li> I had the same issues as most everyone else here, unfortunately. Like another reviewer said, I should have read the reviews before I purchased. I really liked the color, and so I went with it, and now I have a bottle of watery, runny, transparent shellac that I will never use. I have always purchased OPI Gelcolor, and this is absolutely the first issue I have ever had. Not sure if the color is just bad, or if it was the seller.</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy any polish from Club Beauty! I purchased this product from them and it had been cut with acetone! It was runny like water and the color had no shine it was like this nauseating purple water color. Awful!</li>
    <li> I love this color, it really is fun, and I usually wear boring beige or french manicures.  When I saw this color being put on a customer next me, I decided to have it.  Since it is so popular at the salon, I bought my own bottle. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I tried the OPI gel polish after using Finger Paints from Sally Beauty.  The OPI was way too watery and didn&#x27;t stay put on my nails.  I painted one hand and it had all slid to my cuticles on the sides.  I ended up removing the entire polish.  I would not recommend this brand.  I love the OPI regular nail polish but not a fan of the gel polish.  I will stick with Finger Paints instead - that gel polish is great!</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed with the colour. I thought it would be a nice deep purple but turns out its almost black and not at all like the picture shown. Worst part is you can return or exchange it!</li>
    <li> Although I get my nails professionally done, when my appointment of two weeks limit for a fill gets pushed back, and I can see a little aggravating space between the color &amp; cuticle, (I know your nodding your head yes, you know what I mean) then it&#x27;s time for a little home gel fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite go to colors, as its edgy but classy, when I don&#x27;t have my standard &amp;#34;pink and whites&amp;#34;.  I had to purchase it for those aggravating days between fills when I want to have a perfectly manicured look, or if I have to go out of town for an unplanned business trip and can&#x27;t get to my salon, I&#x27;ve actually covered up my &amp;#34;pink &amp; whites&amp;#34; when they&#x27;ve grown out a little.  Of course you need the lamp to set the gel, but I&#x27;m just talking about product. This is the same product my salon uses and I&#x27;m tickled that I can purchase it for a great price here in Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more, it&#x27;s easy to use if you have the lamp, as application is just as you would apply nail polish. I do use a very fine buffer just to even out the nail, and the seam between the fill and my cuticle, but it&#x27;s an easy fix to help hold me over for a few days. I&#x27;ve been asked if I use a top coat or not - it all depends if I have some on hand. If not, this is shiny, sets quick, and again, I use it to keep my hands looking fresh where it has grown out between nail appointments.</li>
    <li> There was no color in my bottle!</li>
    <li> darker than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> The picture depicts a more dark purple, but in person in is almost black. But at least it is still perfect for fall!!</li>
    <li> Good price and exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color from OPI of all time. However, the gel version is weird and requires many coats. Unless I got a defect, I struggled with it and ended up not using it a lot with my gel kit.</li>
    <li> The first thing out of my daughter&#x27;s mouth after she tried this was &amp;#34;Gross&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;She said it was too watery and the color of the lacquer wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> Totally bizarre product! I thought it was defective because I use these OPI Gelcolor polishes all the time and they are great but this doesn&#x27;t look like the Lincoln Park After Dark Polish at all. It&#x27;s a clear watery light purple color....I applied 4 coats and it still didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned the hard way with very dark OPI colors is if you don&#x27;t shake them, you will have serious trouble with pooling, the polish not curing and no color saturation without several coats. What I think happens is the color will separate and sink to the bottom of the bottle. SHAKE,  SHAKE, SHAKE. Ignore the reviews that say that these dark polishes &amp;#34;don&#x27;t work&amp;#34; or are not actually OPI. If you look at reviews for these dark colors across the board they all day the same things.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product.  It runs and the shellac is not worth anything. Even after 3 coats!  Very disappointed.  My husband purchased this for me because this is one of my favorite colors. We should have heeded the reviews.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery! Great product!</li>
    <li> I love OPI Gel but this was so runny, the gel didn&#x27;t stay on the brush well. I would give it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> gel manicures are very popular and expensive.  I bought this for my daughter she loves these polishes as they last longer and prevent nails from breakage.  She works in a hospital and washes her hands a 100 times a day and regular polishes chip away daily.  Gel polishes stay on.  I would remind you to purchase the curing lamp/light that is needed with any gel polish or you will be disappointed.  This brand is a quality product.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite nail colors. I do my own gel polish nails at home and although I really do love to wear this color, I have found it to take a little longer to cure than all of my other gel polishes.  The color also settles a lot in the bottle so you really need to  make sure you shake, shake, shake and then shake the bottle some more to make sure the color completely mixes before applying.</li>
    <li> Unusable. My go-to nail salon tried to apply it and it just ran all over my finger. Bad gel. Too bad...Lincoln Park After Dark is my favorite color.</li>
    <li> I love this color for fall/winter!!! I do my own gel color nails and this was a great addition to my color collection!!</li>
    <li> The picture showed a purple, a dark purple, color. It&#x27;s black. I have had this problem multiple times. What a pain!!!</li>
    <li> I feel totally duped.  Thought I was buying the GEL version of the polish but is in the regular bottle labelled OPI, not Gel Coat so assuming it is the regular nail polish, yet paid a lot more for it!!  Totally misleading.  Seller should explain it is not a Gel polish.  Now I can&#x27;t return it even though it isn&#x27;t what I thought I was ordering.  Forget it!</li>
    <li> Great OPI color. Arrived on time and am wearing it right now.</li>
    <li> Bottle doesn&#x27;t have good consistency. It doesn&#x27;t set up properly. It seems like the mix is screwed up. I&#x27;ve tried applying twice and it doesn&#x27;t look like nail polish</li>
    <li> Lincoln Park After Dark is one of my favorite colors from OPI. I have been using the color in nail polish before I was able to get Gel. I have had Lincoln Park After Dark in Gel on my nails from salons so I am more than familiar how this color should look and feel. However, I was beyond disappointed by the consistency of this Nail Gel. The color was watery and not near as rich as the color should be and overall, just a hassle to use because of its viscosity. I am a loyal OPI nail polish and Gel user, having tried many colors in Gel. This is the first and most disappointing issue I have run into with this nail Gel product, and only in this color. Other colors I have purchased from this seller like Cajun Shrimp, I had no issues with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in March and haven&#x27;t used it since. It&#x27;s a watered down bottle that does not cure no matter how long you do it. I contacted the seller and that told me to try shaking the bottle. Well decided to try it again and again it rubbed off like it was never cured. I&#x27;ve been an Opi user for years and this is not true Opi.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this color, which I have had for years in regular polish. Having recently become a gel addict, I had to get this color. My nails grow so quickly I do the first week with the gel polish, then clean it up with the regular polish and a gel topcoat to keep it nice for the second week. Then I don&#x27;t have to soak them every week. I appreciate that I can get OPI in both gel and regular polish, which makes this practice work. Overall the product works well and the color looks great!</li>
    <li> It was so runny and clear that you couldn&#x27;t tell it was suppose to be purple:( waste of my money!</li>
    <li> This Polish ran off of my nails , like colored water! I have used several other OPI gels at home with great results, but this is not usable !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the color, it&#x27;s kind of a grayish purple. But what I really don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t coat evenly. Some of the nails come out really dark and some much lighter. Even on the same nail it&#x27;s really hard to get an even color no matter how many coats you use. I&#x27;ve tried 5-6 other colors and not had this problem</li>
    <li> Love the product and the color . But you must shake the bottle really good or the color doesn&#x27;t go on well .</li>
    <li> I must admit that I am a Gelish fan, so this was the first non-Gelish gel nail color I have applied on myself. I love the color (because I already own the non-gel version of OPI Lincoln Park), but I hate the applicator brush on the Gel Lacquer. it is too big and bulky, and no matter how many times I try to get the excess of the brush, it still seems to be too much. It chipped faster than Gelish as well....the only disappointment is that I love the selection of OPI colors, but I guess I will just have to stick to their non-gel for my toes, and use Gelish on my fingers.</li>
    <li> Love OPI quality and consistency. The gel version perfectly matches the regular nail enamel version. Can never be disappointed in what you get - only wish they would offer more of their colors as gel polishes.</li>
    <li> love this color  goes on smooth</li>
    <li> Lincoln Park After Dark Gel Polish is a nice dark redish purple, the color is great, however the polish is a bit thick. With the OPI gel polishes my gel manicure will usually last about two weeks.  However, I am always changing my color so I normally don’t go a full two weeks.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this color - I really wanted a nice deep purple that would have the shine of gel but was sadly disappointed. The polish is super thin and runny, so it pools by your cuticles and looks nice and dark, while the actual nail looks sheer and sloppy. By the time you get enough coats to make the nail look good, there is so much pooled around the edges that it just looks ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Be very careful applying this color.  It will bleed into your cuticles and sides of nails.  Apply a VERY thin coat!  Other than that, great black color :&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I just love the OPI Gelcolor Nail Gel Lacquer. This is an awesome color and it seems to last forever!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and new</li>
    <li> I purchased this just a few weeks ago. When I finally went to go use it-the polish was extremely watery and did not have the same consistency that my other opi polishes have (they are gel). I ended up not using this polish sadly :/</li>
    <li> This is the worst polish I ever purchased. Very runny and the color is awful! I was looking for a dark purple/black and even with multiple coats it was never dark enough.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing from this seller. As others have stated, the gel was runny and obviously cut with acetone. I have many other gel OPI colors and none have the consistency of the color I received. I will not purchase from the seller again.</li>
