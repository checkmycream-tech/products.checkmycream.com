### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very impressed with NeuLash</li>
      <li>Best of all, I bought the 6 ml tube on July 26, have used it every night, and haven&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>They look beautiful!</li>
      <li>This works awesome!!  </li>
      <li>Since then, the product ingredients have been altered a bit, however, it still remains the best lash serum out there in my opinion.</li>
      <li>NueLash is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Perfect price for a perfect item.</li>
      <li>Now this client was someone who started with scanty lashes and now has gorgeous ones!</li>
      <li>After three years, I am still happy with Neulash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used NeuLash on and off for years and the product really is great.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Great product to use</li>
      <li>A friend who had been using neu lash, and had great lashes, encouraged me to try it.  </li>
      <li>and I think its great</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>And amazing!</li>
      <li>well, let&#x27;s see if...\\&quot; and it honestly works!</li>
      <li>Best on the market and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Takes about 4 weeks to get the full effect, but works awesome!</li>
      <li>This stuff is so great, and I get so many compliments on my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>i LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
      <li>; who could ask for anything more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m purchasing more!</li>
      <li>...I don&#x27;t lose my eyelashes in clumps any more!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing-</li>
      <li>Amazing.  </li>
      <li>They even have a nice upward curl when I use mascara.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so excited!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty incredible.</li>
      <li>No moisturizing benefits to it).&lt;br /&gt;One of the BEST benefits to using Neulash (besides luxurious, long lashes) is that they curl on their own, so you can throw away that pesky eyelash curler!</li>
      <li>I use it every night before I go to bed, top and bottom.</li>
      <li>Both of us were able to stop wearing brow color.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>it is so easily available to consumers who want jaw dropping lashes!</li>
      <li>Fuller, thicker, more defined brows</li>
      <li>If I go more than that, I start to lose lashes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>After using this for a couple of months my lashes look better than before 😊</li>
      <li>This really is a surprisingly effective solution to thinning eyelashes and eyebrows and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say they are significantly thicker; I reduced use to twice-three times a week from 3-4, and saw more lenght, and maybe some darkening.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and a tube lasts me for about 2 months or so.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and you do get growth where you put it.</li>
      <li>My lashes are already pretty nice</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are okay, but I have never had full eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I started using this new product!\\&quot; As she gestured to Neulash in a bright and shiny case.</li>
      <li>My neighbor has light brown hair &amp; used neulash to darken and thicken her medium brows.  </li>
      <li>After a lot of research online, I chose Neulash, in part because I seemed to see discount values available on ebay and amazon.  </li>
      <li>but she said it was NeuLash and was available to anyone...without a prescription.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>And the strategy of using them to supplement the lost eyelashes due to extensions was brilliant, if I do say so myself.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been 4 months since I started using Neu Lash, and in conjunction with the perm, I now have beautiful long full lashes that I can just apply mascara to every morning without the hassle of curling.</li>
      <li>Within 4 weeks they were significantly longer.</li>
      <li>I have started using Neulash again and right away my lashes grew longer!  </li>
      <li>A bonus for me was the darkening at the lashline which, on a fair skinned blonde, means no need for eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>NeuLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum Active Eyelash Technology 6 ml 0.2 oz great product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would be as good as latish, but after trying it for a few weeks, I noticed the effectiveness and no side effect.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for several years, and have been very pleased with results.  </li>
      <li>Pretty soon my lashes will once again touch my eyebrows!</li>
      <li>all are getting similar spectacular results.  </li>
      <li>I feel like my lashes are naturally curling now with definitely more length.</li>
      <li>iT&#x27;S PRICEY BUT WORTH IT</li>
      <li>I smile coyly and say thank you.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>She laughed and told me she had been using a new lash serum that made them grow so long.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>When I first started using this</li>
      <li>I first bought Neu-Lash at SAKS thinking \\&quot;oh</li>
      <li>first bought Neulash three years ago at Nieman Marcus.  </li>
      <li>BUT DEFINITELY GIVES MORE AND LONGER LASHES.  </li>
      <li>Better and faster than enormous lash!</li>
      <li>My first review on amazon.</li>
      <li>I love the lashes so much that I&#x27;ll deal with the facial hair</li>
      <li>Also, since my lashes are naturally pretty straight, there has been no curl effect as some have mentioned</li>
      <li>Eyelashes have definitely grown a bit, but being Asian perhaps the effect is not as great as on some whose lashes are naturally longer from the start.</li>
      <li>[...]bucks a month and the ability to buy drugstore mascara on sale once every 3 months, means I am only spending about 8 bucks more for a new look.</li>
      <li>It is very noticeable and I would recommended it to anyone wanting longer lashes.</li>
      <li>You really get to design and shape your eyebrows when you swipe it on at night.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>so I asked if they were real</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
      <li>The real enhancing product is called NUILASH</li>
      <li>I am only using 2 nights a week now that I have beautiful long lashes -- I have sent this as a gift to several friends...</li>
      <li>Within one week of using my OLD tube of Neulash, VOILA!!!</li>
      <li>My eyelashes were never lush, long and full, but turned 50 a couple of years ago, and the lashes were getting skimpier, and shorter, and mascara no longer seemed to work magic.  </li>
      <li>My eyelashes are back to their original fullness PLUS since the extensions and my eyebrows</li>
      <li>I also used it on my eyebrows which are naturally very fine in texture and sparse with next to nothing on the outer third.  </li>
      <li>I have had some slight results so may to give it more time.</li>
      <li>However, if you stop using it for more than two weeks, the lashes go back to regular size</li>
      <li>my lashes were sky high.</li>
      <li>I use liner on the inner rim of my upper lashes &amp; with the combination of the enhanced lashes and the slight smudge of darkness on the lower lashes, it&#x27;s a great look with no make-up.</li>
      <li>Went for lash extensions for awhile which are great for that va va voom effect but expensive to maintain</li>
      <li>I was instantly sold, and she was right.</li>
      <li>So, I just bought a new tube</li>
      <li>I tried to go out on a limb and try new serums to save a buck...</li>
      <li>I am a Certified Esthetician (Facialist &amp; Makeup Artist) and always looking for new beauty products to try.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life I felt I had enough eyebrow to wax.  </li>
      <li>with mascara, wow!  </li>
      <li>I purchased Neulash when it was first offered on ShopNBC several years ago.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it is a valid product as so many others have given such positive reviews.</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for about 18 months and will continue to use it. When I first started using this I really didn&#x27;t think it would work but it does. Within about a month my eyelashes became longer. It is a product that you have to keep using to keep the eyelashes long so I use this every night before going to bed. It&#x27;s easy to apply and a tube lasts me for about 2 months or so. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You will have longer, thicker lashes in a couple of months.  It is very noticeable and I would recommended it to anyone wanting longer lashes.</li>
    <li> I am a Certified Esthetician (Facialist &amp; Makeup Artist) and always looking for new beauty products to try. One day one of my clients visited me for a facial and I hadn&#x27;t seen her in a couple months...when I saw her eyelashes I had to look at them under my magnifying lamp. I thought her lashes were fake or lash extensions! She laughed and told me she had been using a new lash serum that made them grow so long. I assumed it was a prescription lash growth enhancer but she said it was NeuLash and was available to anyone...without a prescription. Now this client was someone who started with scanty lashes and now has gorgeous ones! My lashes are already pretty nice so I plan on investing in a tube now that my wedding is coming up...I won&#x27;t have to wear falsies on my wedding day! I am very impressed with NeuLash and I think its great it is so easily available to consumers who want jaw dropping lashes!</li>
    <li> NueLash is an excellent product. It lengthens and thickens eyelashes, and works the same for brows within just a few weeks. My eyelashes are okay, but I have never had full eyebrows. Using NeuLash has given my eyes the frame they have always deserved! You really get to design and shape your eyebrows when you swipe it on at night. It&#x27;s easy to apply and you do get growth where you put it. Fuller, thicker, more defined brows; who could ask for anything more! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using NeuLash daily for 3.5 weeks with absolutely no difference.  I&#x27;ve heard it can take over a month but I&#x27;m doubtful.  I will continue to use up the product since I invested the money, so I still have a little hope that it will work.  I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> I purchased Neulash when it was first offered on ShopNBC several years ago.  My lashes were long, medium thick, medium blonde as a teen, but through the decades have become thin and not very long any more.  After 3 weeks I could see a difference in thickness and color.  After 6-8 weeks my lashes were long again.  They were also thick and dark enough to see without mascara.  By week 12 I found I was barely touching the mascara wand to my lashes or they were too long and too thick .. like wearing very full false lashes. Even strangers commented on my eyelases regularly.  I also used it on my eyebrows which are naturally very fine in texture and sparse with next to nothing on the outer third.  WOW.  After applying to my lashes I used what was left to apply to my brows.  It really darkened my blonde brows and made them thicker in texture and fuller.  For the first time in my life I felt I had enough eyebrow to wax.  My neighbor has light brown hair &amp; used neulash to darken and thicken her medium brows.  Both of us were able to stop wearing brow color.  &#x27;Missing my eyelashes after not using this product for over a year, I am purchasing again &amp; doubt I&#x27;ll be without it going forward.  A bonus for me was the darkening at the lashline which, on a fair skinned blonde, means no need for eyeliner.  I use liner on the inner rim of my upper lashes &amp; with the combination of the enhanced lashes and the slight smudge of darkness on the lower lashes, it&#x27;s a great look with no make-up.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would be as good as latish, but after trying it for a few weeks, I noticed the effectiveness and no side effect. I have now bought it twice, and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My lashes are naturally short and stubbornly straight. I&#x27;ve always had to use an eyelash curler plus a spoon to get the curl I want. Within 2 weeks of using Neu Lash I began to see a difference in length. Within 4 weeks they were significantly longer. I then went to get them permed for a natural curl (it took my esthetician 2 tries for the curl to take - thats how stubborn my eyelashes are) It&#x27;s been 4 months since I started using Neu Lash, and in conjunction with the perm, I now have beautiful long full lashes that I can just apply mascara to every morning without the hassle of curling. Best of all, I bought the 6 ml tube on July 26, have used it every night, and haven&#x27;t run out. It&#x27;s been 4 months and 2 weeks. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great, and I get so many compliments on my eyelashes.  Takes about 4 weeks to get the full effect, but works awesome!</li>
    <li> I have used Neulash before but wanted to try something cheaper.  What a mistake!  I have started using Neulash again and right away my lashes grew longer!  Best on the market and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The real enhancing product is called NUILASH this is not the all new American lash improver  ! Don&#x27;t be caught out</li>
    <li> I have purchased this through a store.  Small and Large.  This Item is not the same as the item it is promoting to be.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time.  I threw it out after examining the box carefully.  Really sad Amazon out not catch this one.</li>
    <li> Every lady needs this product. It makes your lashes longer and fuller. Been using for two years. Great product to use</li>
    <li> I used Neulash for about a month and then spring came and I developed allergies so I couldn&#x27;t do the recommended six weeks. I did notice that at the end of that month that my lashes seemed longer. I had false eyelashes on for about four months and after taking them off, my lashes seemed so sparse. Neulash seemed to enhance the growing period. It burns a bit at initial use.</li>
    <li> Perfect price for a perfect item. The regular price in shops is around 150 $ and not easy to find it in everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have used it, as directed, every night. Maybe it works for some, but not me. I am seriously bummed.</li>
    <li> I used it before for a long time.  Decided to go with Smart Lash which didn&#x27;t do a single thing.  Yes, it you stop using this item, your lashes will go back to the way they were before you started using it.  I am back on NeuLash and can already see the difference.  Yes!!!!!!!  I paid $150 plus S&amp;H last time.  But through Amazon I only paid $95 plus S&amp;H</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 3 weeks now and zero complaints! I feel like my lashes are naturally curling now with definitely more length. Better and faster than enormous lash!</li>
    <li> My eyelashes were never lush, long and full, but turned 50 a couple of years ago, and the lashes were getting skimpier, and shorter, and mascara no longer seemed to work magic.  After a lot of research online, I chose Neulash, in part because I seemed to see discount values available on ebay and amazon.  Paid aroudn 90.  Saw a small difference at one month, and by 3 months easily doubled the length.  Can&#x27;t say they are significantly thicker; I reduced use to twice-three times a week from 3-4, and saw more lenght, and maybe some darkening.  I still need mascara, but with mascara, wow!  If you do get irritation, try changing the cleanser you use for your mascara and shadow.  I found that if I used Loreal liquid remover then applied, it burned a little or itched - but changed to a different remover, and never a problem since.  I am still on the same tube at 4-5 months, will probably need replacement soon.  If you figure I now only use it half as much as the first three months, if the next tube costs 90, I should get almost 8 months out of it - [...]bucks a month and the ability to buy drugstore mascara on sale once every 3 months, means I am only spending about 8 bucks more for a new look. Thought about switching to Latisse to see if I could get thicker, but the possible side effects warned me off.  Sticking with Neulash.</li>
    <li> This product has not performed as I thought it would, based on other reviews.  I have had some slight results so may to give it more time.</li>
    <li> Definitely pricey, but I used this without any ill effects.  My short stubby lashes grew noticeably longer with a curl.  Can&#x27;t dispute that this works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used NeuLash on and off for years and the product really is great. My friends always asked me if i was wearing fake lashes. But the downside is once you start using it (which I do because it gets really expensive), your eyelashes go back to normal. Or in my case, they grow back shorter.</li>
    <li> NeuLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum Active Eyelash Technology 6 ml 0.2 oz great product. i see the result. recommend this. see the result in a month.</li>
    <li> A friend who had been using neu lash, and had great lashes, encouraged me to try it.  I was skeptical, wondering if it would truly grow my lashes to the point that they looked like the celebrities.  Well, I am a believer!  I have actually had to cut back on the product, only using it a few nights a week.  They are so long, and curl.  This is one product that truly delivers what they sell.</li>
    <li> I always envied people with long thick dark lashes. Mine were always short and sparse. Mascara just made them look short and spikey. If I felt like something was in my eye, it was usually an eyelash and several would come out at once. I don&#x27;t believe in miracle products. But when there&#x27;s a possibility....&lt;br /&gt;I first bought Neulash three years ago at Nieman Marcus.  I had tried Latisse but was afraid of the side effects and trashed it. My eyes are green and I don&#x27;t want them to turn brown.&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, I was pretty skeptical. So you can imagine my delight when a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product actually produced miracle results! I started out using it every night at bedtime. I have very sensitive eyes but this hasn&#x27;t harmed me. It IS a foreign substance and can make my eyes tear, so I do wash it off immediately in the morning. After three years, I am still happy with Neulash. I can skip a day or two or even three between applications. If I go more than that, I start to lose lashes.&lt;br /&gt;But...I don&#x27;t lose my eyelashes in clumps any more! And... I had a makeup artist compliment me on my beautiful long thick lashes a few weeks ago! I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> returned because it burns my eyes :(</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years, and have been very pleased with results.  Have never ordered online, so thought I would try it.  The box and tube are both different from what I purchase in the salon, not sure if it&#x27;s a knock off, or just an earlier packaging that has been changed?  Either way, was not willing to chance it, and returned it.</li>
    <li> This product really works! It takes a few weeks to see results, but it works! However, if you stop using it for more than two weeks, the lashes go back to regular size</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS STUFF!  CAN&#x27;T SAY IT TAKES THE PLACE OF MASCARA BUT DEFINITELY GIVES MORE AND LONGER LASHES.  iT&#x27;S PRICEY BUT WORTH IT AND IT LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I used a similar, less expensive product for 2-3 months that had done nothing at all to my lashes. My friend was using neu lash and after 4-5 weeks looked like she was always wearing false lashes. I&#x27;ve always had a descent lash size but wanted to be extravagent also. I started using it in may 10 and by july i was getting asked regularly if they were my real lashes. They look beautiful! The only down fall is that you will grow hair on your upper cheek bone. I bleech mine. I love the lashes so much that I&#x27;ll deal with the facial hair lol.</li>
    <li> My first review on amazon. Neulash was a last resort after 4 months of fake eyelash refills- I realized that I couldn&#x27;t afford the two week treatments. I&#x27;m Asian, and none of the eyelash growth treatments ever worked on me- and fake eyelashes were great, but left me bald. Literally- bald.:( I was scared that I would have no lashes and ran to get Neu lash. After 4 weeks- the length was the same, but it started to look like the bald spots were filling in, but I was still not convinced. After three months- my lashes were back to normal. After 4.5 months- all of a sudden my lashes were so long! Twice the length and with a but of mascara- my lashes were sky high. I use it every night before I go to bed, top and bottom. It works so well and I&#x27;m prone to allergic reactions and this product had little to no reaction. The small amount if darkening under my eyes may be from the product- but I think it may be from the shadow of my new long long long lashes! This product is amazing- and when I am done with it- I&#x27;m purchasing more! My mom and sister were like &amp;#34;woah&amp;#34; fake lashes- AGAIN?&amp;#34; And I tell them &amp;#34;nope- it&#x27;s neulash&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s pretty incredible. Do it for 6 months and you WILL see a difference. Hooked. And amazing!</li>
    <li> It is working, and make you eyelashes longer</li>
    <li> I starting using Neulash in 2009 when it was sold in high-end salons for no less than $150/tube. The sales girl had these amazingly long lashes that touched her eyebrows so I asked if they were real and she said \\&quot;yes!!! I started using this new product!\\&quot; As she gestured to Neulash in a bright and shiny case. I was instantly sold, and she was right. Since then, the product ingredients have been altered a bit, however, it still remains the best lash serum out there in my opinion. I have tried Latisse, Lilash, Revitalash, just to name a few. I have actually seen my lashes wither away to mere stubs never to regain their length and fullness while using any of these other imposters... (With the exception of Latisse, which I&#x27;ll give 3/5 stars.... No moisturizing benefits to it).&lt;br /&gt;One of the BEST benefits to using Neulash (besides luxurious, long lashes) is that they curl on their own, so you can throw away that pesky eyelash curler! I haven&#x27;t used one in 5 years! I tried to go out on a limb and try new serums to save a buck... NEVER AGAIN: I ended up using an OLD tube of Neulash after faithfully using Lilash for AT LEAST 2 months EVERY NIGHT and was just disgusted and irritated every morning with the lack of results. Within one week of using my OLD tube of Neulash, VOILA!!! Hello lashes! So, I just bought a new tube and I&#x27;m so excited!! Pretty soon my lashes will once again touch my eyebrows! Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this same product in the past from Saks Fifth Avenue, but they no longer sell it there.  I saw improvement in my lashes after using it for four weeks.  I bought it here thinking it&#x27;s the same product since it cost the same and is the same name.  After using it for three months, I see absolutely no improvement in my lashes.  For the price, I felt I wasted my money.  I&#x27;m very disappointed! I wish the company had a money-back guaranteed since their product is no longer the same, as far as I can tell.  I wonder if they changed the formulation.</li>
    <li> So, three weeks ago, I decided to get lash extensions.  I knew it was a bad idea because I am not a fussy girly-girl, but I wanted to do something to shake up my hum drum existence and I thought lash extensions would do it.  Well, they are just annoying.  My eyes itch and I can&#x27;t rub them. The lashes are slowly coming loose and turning sideways, so I have to remove them, taking my natural lashes with them.  I worry about them constantly, making sure they don&#x27;t look mangy and unkempt, but truthfully I can&#x27;t wait until they all come off because they are like having a sick pet living on your eyelids.  In preparation for all of the extensions coming off and having bald eyelids, I purchased this serum.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my brows and eyelashes for the past four nights and I will write back in a couple of weeks with an update. UPDATE: So far, so good.  I am not having any reaction to it on my eyelids, such as redness or itching or anything. I do not think the extensions are being adversely effected either, such as, melting them or breaking down the glue.  I hope it works!  I&#x27;ll be back! UPDATE: Well I have used this for nearly two months and I have to say it&#x27;s nothing short of miraculous!  And the strategy of using them to supplement the lost eyelashes due to extensions was brilliant, if I do say so myself.  I have been using on my eyebrows as well, but I think I&#x27;ll get a separate tube to avoid any eye infections or anything.  My eyelids are sensitive to rubbing, so I only use the product every two to four days. My eyelashes are back to their original fullness PLUS since the extensions and my eyebrows would make Chewbacca jealous!  I&#x27;m actually having to get them waxed, which I haven&#x27;t had to do in years!  This really is a surprisingly effective solution to thinning eyelashes and eyebrows and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks- so far, no difference. Will have to see. Not as immediate a response as Latisse.</li>
    <li> I found a need for this after starting a medication that wrecked havoc with my eyelashes...they were broken and falling out.  This product is a miracle worker for eyelashes.  My lashes are now so long they sometimes touch the back of my sunglasses!  Amazing.  I am only using 2 nights a week now that I have beautiful long lashes -- I have sent this as a gift to several friends...all are getting similar spectacular results.  Hooray for Nu-lash!</li>
    <li> This works awesome!!  I used false lashes and lost all of my real lashes. After using this for a couple of months my lashes look better than before 😊</li>
    <li> I first bought Neu-Lash at SAKS thinking \\&quot;oh well, let&#x27;s see if...\\&quot; and it honestly works! I can see the difference in only one week. Yes, you&#x27;ve got to keep using it - as you must with all&lt;br /&gt;  these type products.  People comment on my lashes all the time...I smile coyly and say thank you.  it is expensive but worth it. Definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> Eyelashes have definitely grown a bit, but being Asian perhaps the effect is not as great as on some whose lashes are naturally longer from the start. Will continue using. Went for lash extensions for awhile which are great for that va va voom effect but expensive to maintain and also I&#x27;d get irritated with them and rub my eyes and then they&#x27;d tear the little lashes I had. Also, since my lashes are naturally pretty straight, there has been no curl effect as some have mentioned but again, I think it depends on your natural lash shape. Have been using for over 2 months, alternating with RevitaLash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Have been using for over two months, was using just RevitaLash before for a long time. I like alternating the two but probably about 2/3 of time is neuLash.</li>
    <li> Buy it for my mom who swears by it! Unfortunately you lashes will stop growing once u stop using it but seems safer than Latisse!</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed lash growth after using Neulash for several weeks.  I am asian and my lashes are fairly short naturally, but now are longer and fuller.  They even have a nice upward curl when I use mascara.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work..very disappointed.  Not sure it is a valid product as so many others have given such positive reviews.</li>
