    <li> Poor quality fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume a lot so the small bottle is perfect for me. This way I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting my money or that a huge bottle of perfume will go bad.</li>
    <li> Been using this scent for over 15 years...awesome, sexy scent.</li>
    <li> to small for the price</li>

    <li> I love the fresh scent of this Parfum.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is one of my favorite scents and I wanted a travel size. Unfortunately it stopped spraying after I used it twice. So I now have a nearly full travel size that doesn&#x27;t spray. Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Definitely a MINI!! the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work properly so when I go to put some on the fragrance gets all over my hands and no where else. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this smell from the collection of classic parfumes by Estee.&lt;br /&gt;I think, I&#x27;ll buy a bigger bottle, but this one is perfect for carrying in purse.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume in a travel size. Perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> Love the small size. Easy traveler. Price allows you to try for a while to see if you really like the fragrance. I don&#x27;t care for heavy fragrances and this was very nice. Would order again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend to see if she would like it - she does.  Good to know with Christmas not too far away.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this perfume spray as gift was very happy with it and loves it!  I am therefore very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I thought the bottle was small for the price.  However, perfume is very expensive today.  The bottle smelled great as pleaures would.</li>
    <li> This lovely scent was shipped promptly and priced right.  Yes, it is small, but if you read the description, you will know what you&#x27;re getting.  I was very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s Beautiful and have always wanted to try Pleasures,so glad I got to try it cheaper.I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Old old perfume. I could tell this bottle was old as sh*t. It stank. Waste of $</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder customer since 1966. Thanksomuch</li>
    <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled and it didn&#x27;t last at all once I sprayed it but it came on time.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is one of the few perfumes that does not &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34; in your body after wearing it for 8 hours in a warm weather</li>
    <li> This was the ideal &amp;#34;stocking stuffer&amp;#34; for my daughter.  She loves  Estee Lauder, and the size is great for carrying in her purse or when she&#x27;s traveling.</li>
    <li> Perfect for carry on luggage!!</li>
    <li> It smelled ok but it just didn&#x27;t suit me personally if</li>
    <li> I have 2.5ml bottle and purchase this one just to have it always with me just in case and/or for traveling.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, great size for travel or purse. Wish I&#x27;d thought to buy it long ago.</li>
    <li> Price was great. I often like to refresh my scent, and this is a great purse size refresher.  I was surprised at the speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance, the price is good, my wife love it, the size is perfect for purse or small hand bag.</li>
    <li> This softly floral scent is perfect for both daytime and evening wear.  I use it almost daily and I wore it for my son&#x27;s wedding this past weekend.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This arrived a day early and smells nice. I keep it in my purse for random occasions or when I need to smell happy smells :)</li>
    <li> its very nice but deeply disappointing for the money. If you&#x27;re gonna buy it, go all out and not get this one.</li>
    <li> My wife love the Parfum....</li>
    <li> My husband likes it!  Nice sexy scent, not over powering...</li>
    <li> I use Pleasures about 15 years, I know the real smell of this perfume. When I ordered it on Amazon, I made a risk with buying a product without smelling it. Now I see it is real smell. So I will buy a perfume only from this seller.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures perfume has become my favorite! I needed these small travel size spray type for our many travels and the stores don&#x27;t often have the travel size. As usual, if I can&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m looking for in stores, I can find it on Amazon. So thank you, Estee Lauder, for a light, wondeful aroma perfume and to Amazon for carrying the travel size.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent buy.  The size is great to slip into my bag, and the fragrance is very feminine!</li>
    <li> Very small but great scent.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for this travel size cologne. I received one of these years ago as part of a free gift promotion and was so happy with the size. It is perfect to fit in your 1 quart zip lock bag. I have been doing carry on for years now and have made an effort to find the perfect travel size items that will all fit into the required bag. It should last through my month long trip to Europe. The spray glass bottle measures 3\\&quot; h x 3/4\\&quot; w.</li>
    <li> I carry this in my handbag. Then I also get a large bottle of same for home. Thanks P. Ar.</li>
    <li> A classic scent.  Fun, but also elegant.  Anything Estee is a winner.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my all time favorite, I would Never stat my day with out this . Love the smell very plesen !!</li>
    <li> Nice to have small parfum to carry in the purse</li>
    <li> Purchased as a travel gift with the travel lotion and full size perfume will fit into almost any bag or purse.</li>
    <li> I have worn Pleasures for almost 20 years. So i wanted a small one to take on vacation with me, hence why i ordered this small sized one. When it arrived, it was a yellowish color. Which is NOT the color of Pleasures. Also, it did not smell like Pleasures. Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Its my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Speaks for itself. Great smell</li>
    <li> I have always loved Estee Lauder Pleasures perfume. This particular purchase makes it very convenient for me to carry it when I travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect size great size</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s small I can carry it in my makeup bag. It smells great!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful summer fragrance!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and they arrived on time. All good. Great value. Perfect for taking with me in my purse.</li>
    <li> Pleasures has always been a favorite &amp; when I saw the price I had to purchase.  Even though, I&#x27;m all out of this product, I would recommend to those who like to have a nice fresh scent that will stay with them all day.</li>
    <li> Delicious fragrance.  Sweet little bottle for my purse.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how VERY SMALL this bottle would be.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my mother in law. She loves the scent but really wanted one for her purse. This was perfect!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little more in the bottle they were not filled all the way, which was disappointing after the bottle is already small as it is</li>
    <li> The two bottles that I ordered I was aware were very tiny bottles because I read the reviews before purchasing them.  The price was very reasonable but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  This worked out good for me because it gives me a chance to try Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pleasures&amp;#34; fragrance before I purchase a full size bottle which is expensive.</li>
    <li> There was no scent to this perfume....made me think it was bottled water, except bottled water smells better than the bottle of Pleasures,</li>
    <li> Purchased for airline travel.  Already love the scent.  Why do other perfumes not come in this great travel size I wonder?</li>
    <li> My fav perfume glad to find. It in small size for travel</li>
</ol>
