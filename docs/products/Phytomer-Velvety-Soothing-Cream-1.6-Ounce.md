    <li> This is a great moisturizer!  I have rosecea, and it works great for me.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skn feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Best product line hands down!!  My skins can be very sensitive and easily irritated but this product makes my skin feel like fine silk.  I&#x27;m totally addicted to it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Been using it for years. Really shows skin improvement after several months.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a non-greasy, effective face cream, this is the one.  I have used Phytomer products and have been using the velvety soothing cream for well over a year and my skin feels and looks hydrated, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it did not improve my rosacea as I had hoped it would.  It spreads easily and has a nice mild scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for rosacea but as a moisturizer it seemed fine.</li>
    <li> I had Rosacea-like symptoyms with dry/itchy/red skin where my nose meets my cheeks. That area and on my nose was so irritated, that I couldn&#x27;t help myself put itch constantly. It was very flaky and dry. I tried lots of different lotions, I even got so desperate to the point I was putting Vaseline on my face. It soothed the pain, but it was so oily and obvious. Douceur Marine is such an incredible product. It took away the irritation and the urge to itch. I still have some flakes here and there, but nothing like before. It looks so much better, amazing product. It saved my face.</li>
    <li> My Wife has Rosacea which is aggravated by Lupus.  She had tried a thousand prescription creams, gels, pills, face washes, etc..  She had tried twice that many OTC items to try to keep it under control.  I bought her this because of the ingredient Chrysanthellum Indicum.  After researching the rosacea and lupus blogs, this seemed to be a common factor in effectively working for both situations.  We were skeptical at first but it has kept everything in check so well that she has stopped taking the Rx items and we actually just purchased another one of these.  she had used up the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time and the cream is smooth and soothing.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is one of my favorites. I use it as a nighttime moisturizer, and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found. I have combination skin, with some spots normal, some oily, and in the winter occasional dry patches. It moisturizes well, and leaves my face soft and smooth and not greasy as many others have. It&#x27;s not too thick, nor to thin, at least not for nighttime use. It also does help with redness as stated. And it doesn&#x27;t have any sort of unusual smell as other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried occasionally do. I would say that you should pay attention to the price on here, as sometimes it&#x27;s better than others and this costs enough already without ending up paying too much for it. But it&#x27;s worth what I&#x27;ve paid for it each time so far, as I have yet to find a nighttime moisturizer that works as well for me!</li>
    <li> The best daytime cream for dry or sensitive skin. Love everything from phytomer!</li>
    <li> My face was red I didn&#x27;t know why. This cream hepled me. Now my face is perfect. I love this ceam!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a number of years.  I really like it because it keeps the skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t cause any acne breakout.</li>
    <li> Good price, and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I used about 3 jars of this product and was very pleased with it. However after starting on my last jar my forehead got dry,itchy, and scaly so had to stop using it. Was very surprised by this but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
