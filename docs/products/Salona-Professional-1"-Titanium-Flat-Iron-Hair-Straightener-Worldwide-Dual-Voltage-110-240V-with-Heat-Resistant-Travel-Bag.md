      <li>It comes with a free travel pouch where you can pack your iron when on the go.</li>
      <li>Its a good travel straightener for most people I think as it already comes with 3 converters which I think is above and beyond for a product, so</li>
      <li>I was excited.</li>
      <li>After using a CHI flat iron years ago with wonderful results even in the humidity of Austin, Texas, I thought perhaps the more affordable flat irons would suffix.</li>
      <li>The Salona Professional Titanium Flat Iron Hair Straightener is one of the best I have ever owned.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> EXPOSED WIRES came out of swivel. SPARKS WHERE FLYING.</li>
    <li> Salona Professional 1inch straightner is a must have. I&#x27;ve had a few straighteners and you get what you pay for in performance and durability. The Salona Professional Straightener is awesome! I knew of one great feature, a heat protected case that came with it .this is a must to be able to store it immediately after you turn it off instead of waiting for it to cool all the way down. Not only that but it&#x27;s great for travel and keeps the straightner looking brand new. More features to be had is a wonderful swivel cord so the cord doesn&#x27;t get twisted whilr you straighten your hair. And on and off bottom. It also has a lock bottom. And a nice big digital screen that shows the heat number in a bright neon blue which heats up no more than 400 degrees. And three extra plugs for international travel. The Salona has a smooth sleek design that fits comfortable in the hand. Upon  plugging it in the heat number will blink while it&#x27;s heating up but will stop to let you know It&#x27;s done heating up. I have very stubborn frizzy curly hair and was worried 400 degrees wouldn&#x27;t be enough heat  to straighten but it straighten my hair with ease. Usually I&#x27;d have to run the iron a few times but this took one pass, the titanium plates glided through my hair like butter. And no missed heat spots. I was amazed at the shine it gave my hair and the plates didn&#x27;t pull or snag my hair one bit. I have smooth frizz free hair that stays frizz free and straight all day. Best straightner ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product discounted in exchange for an honest review.”</li>
    <li> best flat iron for my hair my hair looks straight thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the international plugs but it is a total disappointment as a flat iron.  I have used HAI flat irons for years so that is my expectation for a nice use.  The plugs are great and it gets hot, but it does not glide through your hair.  The plates are junk and it is a very bumpy ride down the hair strand.  And, that leaves marks on your hair.  This is a cheep, made in china flat iron.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Trusted the other 5 star paid reviews. They receive the product for free or a huge discount So they can leave a review, I didn&#x27;t realize it until now that I had an issue with the iron and read the other reviews carefully. They received a financial benefit for their 5star review. Pay close attention. In regards to the product it&#x27;s a piece of junk. Doesn&#x27;t get hot and pulls hair.</li>
    <li> I have coarse thick hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for a flat iron that will straightened my hair. Most flat irons straightened my hair, but leave a little frizz, or just fry my hair. So when I had the chance to try Salona Professional Titanium flat iron I was excited. It has titanium plates which are more smoother on your hair then ceramic. It doesnt snag or pull on my hair, but gently glides through it. It goes from temperature 255 to 400 for your desired look. I usually straightened my hair on 415, but with this flat iron I&#x27;m able to use a lower temperature setting. It also doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like other flat irons I have used. But I still recommend using a heat protectant to prevent damage. I also like that when it&#x27;s not in use it will automically turn it self off. A nice little bonus that it comes with is extra plugs, so you can use it in different countries. When you&#x27;re done with it or traveling you can store in the nice travel bag that is also heat resistant. I recommend this flat iron for any hair length or texture. Works great at straighting hair.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I have very thick Hair and I love this flat iron. I purchased it as a back up to my normal flat iron becuase i recieved a discount for my review. However, this is now my all the time flat iron. it heats quickly and straightens my hair leaving no frizz. And no poufiness to fight. I love the travel bag. I often times flat iron my hair at work and needed something to carry it back and forth with. The adapters are an added bonus. THat make this product even more worth the purchase price as those can be pricy.</li>
    <li> it is perfect and i would like to say that this product is good to your hair and it would be shinny and straight</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to Israel.  It worked great and the price is right.</li>
    <li> I have held on to these flat irons long enough that I feel I can truly do this review justice. I use flat irons not only to get curly hair straight, but in order to also produce curls (in the same manner of a curling iron). The flat iron looks pretty basic from the photos but it is really captivating in person. The ceramic plates are mirrored. Yes, I said mirrored. You can actually see your reflection in them. My favorite part of this tool is the bright lcd imagery that shows the current temperature of the flat iron. This tool is quick to heat up and comes locked. Another plus is the fact that the on/off switch is not located on the handle as many flat irons are. I use these flat irons whenever I need a change in hairstyle. They were sent to me for a complete review.</li>
    <li> This is a premium quality straightener that not only heats quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t pull at or snag your hair while using. And it is lightweight. It has an automatic shut off button and comes with a heat resistant pouch you can place your iron into without worrying. This is by far the nicest straightener I have ever owned. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This flatiron works wonderfully. I have not used the adapters that it comes with and probably won&#x27;t need to for a while, but the flatiron gets nice and hot, the temperature is easily adjusted, and all in all it works great and was a great price. I&#x27;m very pleased and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great and light weight, perfect for international travel. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Gets to hot will burn your hair</li>
    <li> This flat iron heats up to 400 degrees.  It heats up pretty fast, and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if the 400 degrees heat was going to be hot enough for my hair!  I usually have to use one that goes up to 450 degrees.  For my hair the hotter it is the better because it doesn&#x27;t take as long to iron it flat, versus if I used it at a lower temperature, it would take forever!  I ordered anyway, and I&#x27;m super happy I did!!  I was done flat ironing at 400 degrees in no time at all, I was pleasantly surprised!  It does get pretty hot so you need to be careful when using it.  My only con with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t smoothly glide through the hair, and I&#x27;m not sure why i don&#x27;t see where it snags, but I feel it.  None the less I am going to continue using it, because it gets my hair done so fast!  If they would fix that one snaggy flaw it would be the perfect flat iron!  I&#x27;ve included a pic where it shows you everything that comes in the box, which includes special plug adapters if you need them.  I did received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.Gets very hot.Nice sleek design.I love the multi adaptors that comes with this.It means I can take my favorite new hair tool anywhere in the world and still use it.Must have for anyone who love straight hait.This tool works great.Go over my hair and it is straight as ever.</li>
    <li> Received defective item, got a refund</li>
    <li> Works great for straightening and curling. Hopefully it will work just as well in Ireland since I bought it because of the dual voltage feature!</li>
    <li> Good points - It heats up well (in the US - not yet tested in Europe but this is why I purchased this model). The lighted display is easy to read and it is light weight. I appreciate that it comes with all the adapter plugs for Europe/Asia as these can cost $20 each. Bad points and the reason for only giving it 3 stars: the instructions booklet that comes with this product is replete with very poor english - spelling mistakes and wrong grammar. While this is not important for understanding how to use the product as it is so self explanatory, this smacks to me of a company that is overseas and not making any effort to produce a quality product. If they couldn&#x27;t take the time and resources to properly edit the instruction booklet, have they an equally &amp;#34;caveat emptor&amp;#34; attitude to the quality of straightener? Secondly, I see that Amazon lists this as dual voltage  however in the instruction booklet it clearly states that this product is intended for use in households with 110 volts (US). I wrote to the company using the email address they give for customers and asked them to confirm that it is indeed dual voltage. No reply. Sent a second email a week later - no reply. So basically I would say no customer service  -- good luck if you ever needed to contact them for a failed product...</li>
    <li> Loooove this flat iron!! It heads quickly and is made well. I like its thin design it makes it easier for me to do smaller sections of my hair. It leaves my hair silky and beautiful without fly aways. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The adapters worked perfectly for ireland and I did not have to worry at all about it overheating with it having the dual conversion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;hair girl&amp;#34; and was told my US straightener wouldn&#x27;t work in the US. Not wanting to go without my beloved straightener, I opted to purchase a universal one. It comes with three different adapters, which was worth the price alone. After I was finished with my hair, I plugged in the Kindle/phone to charge. Like two products in one! The straightener is now my new favorite and much cheaper than my current one. It also comes with an insulated carrying case. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works great. Hot but does not burn my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron in hopes it would actually straighten and flatten my hair. It really does the job, and works so well. It heats up quickly, as well as stays hot consistently. It&#x27;s thin and includes many different plug options for any outlet you could possibly be near when needing to use it. I love the Auto shut off, as that means if I forget it on and freak out it will shut off on it&#x27;s own and I don&#x27;t have to rush back home. It includes a great heat resistant carry bag so I can put it away and it won&#x27;t burn anything. It is an overall wonderful flat iron and I am very happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but I haven&#x27;t tried it in Europe yet.</li>
    <li> Needing a straightener for my vacation trip to St. Maarten. I was worried that it is wouldn&#x27;t work good for my thick hair like my Chi does but it worked great. Highly recommend even if if you don&#x27;t need a dual voltage flat iron, just a flat iron that isn&#x27;t expensive it would work for that too.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that my hair is long,thick,and wavy/curly and 1&amp;#34; flat irons have either NOT worked on my hair or take way too long to straighten my hair. I have a $100 straightener that I&#x27;ve been using for 4 years and I love it..However the Salona Professional flat iron is pretty darn amazing! The 1&amp;#34; actually works on my hair and doesn&#x27;t take nearly as long as those that I have tried before. It left my hair silky and smooth with out snagging any of my hair! I love that you can adjust the temperature to where you want it because most only give you a couple choices. I also love that because this flat iron is 1&amp;#34; is fairly small you can also make really cute curls in your hair by just turning the flat iron and the piece of hair over while &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; it. I also love that it comes with a heat resistant pouch for easy storage and for travel needs. The different adapters that it comes with is also a bonus in case you travel to different countries! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> Its a good travel straightener for most people I think as it already comes with 3 converters which I think is above and beyond for a product, so kudos to Salona for that addition. I am a little picky when it comes to hair straighteners though and chose this one because of the titanium plates which I am the most fond of. Though these plates looked like real titanium, I didn&#x27;t feel it with the straightener because my hair felt course and not as shiny and smooth when I use my other titanium straightener. It does straighten well though.</li>
    <li> I got these yesterday love them did my step daughters hair so beautiful so beautiful I put a  treatment on it so it will stay straight</li>
    <li> The Salona Professional Flat Iron was not exactly what I was expecting. I like the fact your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in between the barrels however, it doesn&#x27;t flow as smooth as I thought it would when curling or trying to straighten. Also, when curling I&#x27;m constantly turning the iron off because of where the buttons are located. It was such a great price and I had high expectations but it didn&#x27;t meet them. I can&#x27;t say I would recommend it as your main curling iron maybe a travel one because of the polarized plugs for global use. My search continues....</li>
    <li> Great iron for the price</li>
    <li> This was a life saver in southern Italy.  It really heated up fast and worked great.  One issue though, the adapter that came with unit DOES NOT WORK IN  southern Italy.  Lucky that I purchased before hand in Target, and on line, adapters that worked in southern Italy. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Worked for the purpose that I bought it, which was to use over seas.</li>
    <li> The flat iron does all that is advertised--it works dual voltage great (you don&#x27;t even need to flip a switch or anything--it just works).  I tried it both in the US and in the UK with no problems.  The heat bag is really nice, and I like the electronic display as well--very easy and intuitive to read.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the actual act of using it is less pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t smoothly glide across my hair like other straighteners I have used.  I have owned several different kinds, and this is the least smoothly gliding one I have ever had.  However, it works perfectly, and my hair looked great afterwards.  For the price, I doubt there&#x27;s anything better (and certainly not with dual voltage and a heat bag), but it doesn&#x27;t have the professional &amp;#34;experience&amp;#34; using it.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this, almost every single review was from people who had received it in exchange for their review (if you are curious about my review, I paid full price and was never asked to review it in exchange for the product or a discount). I was hesitant for that reason, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as those reviews make it out to be. However, I am reasonably happy with the purchase--I will definitely use it for the occasional time I need to go abroad.  For at home use in the US, though, I will be sticking with my old straightener.</li>
    <li> this one works well in my hair. just be careful not to put it too high because it gets hot easily when you turn  it up. you don&#x27;t want to burn your hair for sure. it does the job well in my hair. I dont know why others say its not... I&#x27;m happy with my purchased.</li>
    <li> After using a CHI flat iron years ago with wonderful results even in the humidity of Austin, Texas, I thought perhaps the more affordable flat irons would suffix. My experiences were such that the frizz never subsided, the shine was non-existent, and smooth is not an adjective that described the finish. Though I hoped for a more polished look, the results were laughable. Granted my hair is very thick and frizzy, with tight curls and a hint of grey which may have contributed to the unfavorable results. Who knows? The saying, &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; resonates true with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> The Salona Professional Titanium Flat Iron Hair Straightener is one of the best I have ever owned.  The titanium plates heat up excellent and it takes little time to straighten even the longest of hair. This has one of the fastest heat up times I have used. The material are made of very good quality and the iron should last a long time. I highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron. I flat iron my hair all the time. It&#x27;s easy and fast. I found that my hair stays better looking and straighter with this iron as opposed to other ones I&#x27;ve used. It heats up quickly which is great for when you&#x27;re in a hurry. It also has a super convenient auto-off option which I absolutely love. Some irons have a set temperature but with this one you can set the temperature to whatever you want. It comes with a free travel pouch where you can pack your iron when on the go. I highly recommend this product for silky, smooth, and straight hair!</li>
    <li> Finally found the perfect hair iron! It&#x27;s sleek and clear design cuts hair straightening time in half. Worked amazingly on my long thick wavy hair. It looked professionally done. The controlled temperature doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. No static and works amazingly fast. Spent a lot on expensive ones and didn&#x27;t work have as good. The included pouch is a fantastic bonus to store it neatly. Price and quality is top notch!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. The Salona Professional Titanium Flat Iron Hair Straightener really delivers with its titanium plates heating in no time and giving even heat distribution made my hair straighter and more easily manageable. The construction is of good quality material and durability.  I highly recommend this product for all types hair as its ease of use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy  to use. It heats up quickly. Very convenient and what i really like about this product is the features and it last longer..i used this flat iron hair at night after washing and blow dry my hair before i go to bed so that i will not have to straight my hair the next day and be late for my appointment..even after i tied my hair or get messy on my sleep it still remained straight the next day.. it really works well on my hair and last longer.. (dont do it if you are planning to wash your hair in the morning. I used shower cap on my morning shower.) I received a discounted price on this Salona Professional 1 flat iron hair straightener in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> this product is very CHEAPLY MADE</li>
    <li> I returned it.  Did not heat up in 110v so was afraid to get stuck with it not working for a trip where I needed 220v.</li>
    <li> Very recently my loyal and devoted Remington hair straightener finally kicked the bucket. One of the heating plates came unglued and slipped from its track. Now let me tell you this: I had this CVS purchased straightener for 10 years! That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;ve had it since 2005! Was it clunky? You betcha. Was it inexpensive? Damn right. Did it smell like my house was burning every time I used it? Uh uh. But it did the job. Anywho it gave me some good years and with it breaking came the tedious task of searching high and low for the perfect longstanding flat iron that would become its successor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been eyeing up the new Kardashian beauty brand flat iron which, if you aren&#x27;t aware, is manufactured by Chi. Now my former CVS straightener was a mere $40 bucks back in the day, so the idea of spending $90 bucks for this friggin thing was a stark realization I was about to come to terms with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I figured why not search Amazon first, which subsequently brought me to this Salona professional iron. The reviews were high and the price was even cheaper than my original so I took the plunge and figured why not. It arrived this morning on my way out the door to work. I snagged the box up and brought it with me anxiously awaiting the time for when I could come home and wash my hair to initiate my new iron. I have to admit when I opened the box up, it FELT kinda cheap, which immediately had me second guessing myself. Nevertheless I proceed with my intentions and voila! My hair actually is silky smooth and even better than my old one. I am very much a real consumer on Amazon, not paid in any such way to write this review. I have thick Hispanic brown hair and this flat iron did a fantastic job at running through my strands with little to no snag whatsoever. If you have thin hair, I can understand that it may grab towards the end of your strands seeing as the plates have a slight maneuverability to them. So take that into consideration. Anywho, I really hope this thing lasts just as long as my previous iron. It&#x27;s slender and has long plates which provide much more coverage. I&#x27;ve attached come very real photos showing my natural hairs state after a blow dry, followed by the results of it being straightened WITHOUT any styling product used whatsoever.ing lasts just as long as my previous iron.

    <li> Very nice slip design! I loved the fact it had a feature to hold the thing closed for traveling!</li>
    <li> Very well made, high quality product at a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this straightener for my mom to replace her old one and she loves it. She uses it every day because she hates dealing with her naturally curly hair. She&#x27;s said it takes her a great deal less time fixing her hair since it heats up much faster than her old one and it also has a larger platform for her hair so she can straighten more at a time.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a straightener that will actually work on my hair for a while now, I&#x27;ve tried the generic brands and still wasn&#x27;t ultimately satisfied. I bought this straightener because it comes with a 100% money back guarantee, which means they probably care about their customers. The straightener arrived about five days ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it every day!  I absolutely love it and that is why I decided to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the straightener came with three extra plug-ins for Aus, UK and Europe. So you can take this baby anywhere in the world! The second buyer bonus was the heat resistant bag. When I&#x27;m finished straightening my hair, I just pack it back in the bag and back in the drawer. I no longer have to let it sit on my countertop and wait for it to cool down. It also has a Lock feature that keeps the straightener closed while storing.&lt;br /&gt;The straightener itself does a great job because the plates are coated in titanium which is why it can reach 400 degrees and provide a smooth finish for frustrating curls like mine! I included a couple of pictures so you could see how straight it actually gets my hair. If you are looking for a valuable straightener for a great price, this is it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the States and bought this hair straightener to use while in Germany. It was perfect. It&#x27;s slim, heats up quickly, and get very hot (400*). It was nice that it came with the necessary adapters and the sleeve. I highly recommend this product.</li>
