      <li>Beautiful color and did match with any season.</li>
      <li>the color is great for the spring and summer.</li>

      <li>The nail polish works great though.</li>
      <li>Great summer color.  </li>
      <li>I ended up with a fast and perfect manicure, and that&#x27;s saying something as I&#x27;m not the best nail polisher out there.</li>
      <li>Very Pleased, Loved the color was a great color for the fall.</li>
      <li>It makes my hand look more beautiful.</li>
      <li>this color would be very cute on the nail, but the formula needs improvement.</li>
      <li>It looks great with so many colors in my wardrobe.</li>
      <li>My husband loves it with my sandals...says I have sexy toes !</li>
      <li>this brand is amazing, lasts for a about a week.</li>
      <li>Nice color for work.  </li>
      <li>Was very happy on how fast I recieved this product.</li>
      <li>Friend liked it - thank you</li>
      <li>I just love this color and it comes out so bright orange :-)</li>
      <li>I actually liked it better on my nails and toes</li>
      <li>There are so many good ones available which are so reliable.</li>
      <li>Great color (usual OPI great color name, too!)</li>
      <li>I thought it was more peachy.</li>
      <li>This was more of a shiny orange color.</li>
      <li>I love this color and get many compliments .</li>
      <li>LOVE OPI products and have no complaints just want to save someone the hassle of trying to return a product that they won&#x27;t allow you to return.</li>
      <li>I love the color.  </li>
      <li>Appears to resist chips, but I use Chip Skip with it anyhow, and OPI&#x27;s top coat.</li>
      <li>The color itself is gorgeous, a really yummy and bright \\&quot;true</li>
      <li>Great formula + amazing flat brush!</li>
      <li>The polish itself works just fine, but the color is a true orange with shimmer.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color with a strong shimmer.</li>
      <li>Great for people with warm-toned skin shades or for those who love a slightly pinky orange.</li>
      <li>OPI makes such good polish.</li>
      <li>and this was an easy and fast purchase.</li>
      <li>Great orange color with just a little bit of shimmer in it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but definitely worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This is a fun summer color</li>
      <li>And they were right.  </li>
      <li>Throw it in the bin and replace it with good old American made products.</li>
      <li>It came pretty quickly and it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
      <li>I was aware of this possibility but took the risk.</li>
      <li>It even looks good on my pale hands.</li>
      <li>On me the color&#x27;s a good hard wearer, and it plays well with my basecoat (Revlon Colorstay) and topcoat</li>
      <li>This color is great for leaving summer behind and going into fall.  </li>
      <li>The real question is, what is the name of the color in the photo on Amazon because that&#x27;s the color I want</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for all the girls!</li>
      <li>It has really helped me in prepping for the cooler fall weather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highway robbery for the rest of the whole world.</li>
      <li>Before you purchase that particular color, please do a quick google search to see what it actually looks like.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend OPI nail polish.</li>
      <li>it goes on too thin &amp; takes many coats to even look somewhat decent, but still doesn&#x27;t look just right because of the streaking caused by its thinness.</li>
      <li>First application was streaky, but evened out on the 2nd application.</li>
      <li>This is another Chinese-made product which is ripping off those who work very hard to treat themselves to something new and eye catching.</li>
      <li>The actual color of this polish is medium clear orange.  </li>

<li> After 2-3 thin coats my few streaks disappeared (seemed to vary by finger), and I was surprised with the quick dry.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try OPI.</li>
<li> Both hands took me less than a 40-minute segment of Mad Men (including top coat)!</li>
<li> coral,\\&quot; with very subtle golden flecks in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A punchy low-maintenance coral that&#x27;s both fun and sophisticated--hard to go wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Its a little thin, so you have to apply multiple coat.</li>
<li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
<li> Spend your hard earned money in the US!</li>
<li> find this applies thin, but evenly.</li>

    <li> Great color (usual OPI great color name, too!) Especially good for semi-bright, summer shade that will go well with a lot. Appears to resist chips, but I use Chip Skip with it anyhow, and OPI&#x27;s top coat.</li>
    <li> this color would be very cute on the nail, but the formula needs improvement. it goes on too thin &amp; takes many coats to even look somewhat decent, but still doesn&#x27;t look just right because of the streaking caused by its thinness. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this color</li>
    <li> I love this color and get many compliments . It looks great with so many colors in my wardrobe. My husband loves it with my sandals...says I have sexy toes !</li>
    <li> Not the color shown on amazon.  This was more of a shiny orange color.</li>
    <li> OPI makes such good polish. I can&#x27;t get it where I am so I search for it online and this was an easy and fast purchase. A happy customer here!</li>
    <li> The photo is misleading.  The actual color of this polish is medium clear orange.  It is not hot pink or vibrant coral as the photo may appear.  The polish itself works just fine, but the color is a true orange with shimmer.</li>
    <li> the color is great for the spring and summer. It came pretty quickly and it&#x27;s the real thing. this brand is amazing, lasts for a about a week.</li>
    <li> This color is great for leaving summer behind and going into fall.  It has really helped me in prepping for the cooler fall weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as a warning.  The photo that is shown for &amp;#34;Are We There Yet&#x27; is not even close to the actual product.  I have notified Amazon and the incorrect photo is still shown.  Before you purchase that particular color, please do a quick google search to see what it actually looks like.  The real question is, what is the name of the color in the photo on Amazon because that&#x27;s the color I want lol!  LOVE OPI products and have no complaints just want to save someone the hassle of trying to return a product that they won&#x27;t allow you to return.</li>
    <li> I love OPI nail polish, but I am not as crazy about this color. This is no fault of anybody&#x27;s. It is just too orange for me. I thought it was more peachy. The nail polish works great though. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and did match with any season. I definitely like both the quality and color. Highly recommended for all the girls!</li>
    <li> Very Pleased, Loved the color was a great color for the fall. Was very happy on how fast I recieved this product.</li>
    <li> Nice color for work.  Not too bright.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this rating, because the color is as depicted in the picture.</li>
    <li> I just love this color and it comes out so bright orange :-) It makes my hand look more beautiful. Its a little thin, so you have to apply multiple coat. I will buy this again in future.</li>
    <li> Friend liked it - thank you</li>
    <li> Great formula + amazing flat brush! Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try OPI. The color itself is gorgeous, a really yummy and bright \\&quot;true coral,\\&quot; with very subtle golden flecks in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this applies thin, but evenly. After 2-3 thin coats my few streaks disappeared (seemed to vary by finger), and I was surprised with the quick dry. I ended up with a fast and perfect manicure, and that&#x27;s saying something as I&#x27;m not the best nail polisher out there. Both hands took me less than a 40-minute segment of Mad Men (including top coat)! On me the color&#x27;s a good hard wearer, and it plays well with my basecoat (Revlon Colorstay) and topcoat (Sally Hansen Dries Instantly). After 3 days (with  showers, dishes, and tons of typing) I&#x27;ve seen only a hint of tip wear. A punchy low-maintenance coral that&#x27;s both fun and sophisticated--hard to go wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the color of summer for me. And yeah, never going back to Essie (or Chanel, or any of the others) again.</li>
    <li> The color shown on the product page was different from what I received. I was aware of this possibility but took the risk. Turned out it&#x27;s yet another lesson not to buy colored nail polish based on online pictures.....ah!!</li>
    <li> I get a mani/pedi every two weeks.  Rather than use the polish in the nail shop I am building my nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend OPI nail polish. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but definitely worth the cost. You won&#x27;t regret it....trust me!</li>
    <li> First application was streaky, but evened out on the 2nd application. Very pretty color with a strong shimmer. I think it&#x27;s a great color for summer.</li>
    <li> Great orange color with just a little bit of shimmer in it. Great for people with warm-toned skin shades or for those who love a slightly pinky orange. Not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> Opi has some great colors!! I have been using opi just about exclusively for 20 years. This is a fun summer color</li>
    <li> I am not a field worker, but I might as well be one as this polish flakes off the nail tip within 24 hrs. This is another Chinese-made product which is ripping off those who work very hard to treat themselves to something new and eye catching. It&#x27;s highway robbery for the rest of the whole world. Throw it in the bin and replace it with good old American made products. There are so many good ones available which are so reliable. Spend your hard earned money in the US! Be wise!</li>
    <li> I heard that orange nail polish is this summers color.  And they were right.  It even looks good on my pale hands.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is awesome.  I love the color.  Great summer color.  I actually liked it better on my nails and toes than I thought I would.</li>
