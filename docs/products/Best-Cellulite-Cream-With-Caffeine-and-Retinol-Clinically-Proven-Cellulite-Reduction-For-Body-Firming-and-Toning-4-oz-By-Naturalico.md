<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Last month I received a jar of Naturalico Firming Cellulite Cream to try and review. When first opening the jar I realized that it did not have the best smell but I still wanted to give it a chance. I used it morning and night for about three weeks. The cellulite didn&#x27;t totally go away but my skin does seem firmer. If I get over the smell and continue to use this product, I think I would see a major difference but it&#x27;s just not there yet. Since I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a major difference I truly can&#x27;t say I recommend it but if you want to give it a try I believe it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money Horrible customer service</li>
    <li> I do not know if it worked bc theres no way there is enough product in this can to use twice a day.  I would be spending $20 every two weeks! I mean I get more bank for your buck but, not enough product in my opinion.  If it works for you thats great! I do think it made the skin tighter but, I cannot use it twice a day without running out.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Saw results right away! Incredible! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Dont see any difference except my skin feels softer</li>
    <li> I was super skeptical with this product because it does sound too good to be true, but even after a few days I see my skin feeling and looking tighter and more firm, DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
    <li> I’ve noticed some cellulite on my legs lately and while it wasn’t horrible I felt like I needed to do something right away so it wouldn’t get any worse so I ordered this cream and I’m so glad I did!  I love this and the nice, silky texture of the cream. It goes on beautifully and absorbs quickly leaving my skin very soft.  After using this every morning and evening for a couple weeks my thighs and even my butt have been looking firmer and smoother. Every day the skin looks better and better. I almost can’t wait for bathing suit season to roll around now!  I definitely recommend this excellent quality cream!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! I was VERY skeptical and dealt with cellulite for a long time, but I was desperate and decided to give it a try! I was shocked and so was my husband! I love this stuff! Definitely ordering more!</li>
    <li> A great way to moisturize legs and give them a better look</li>
    <li> hasnt really worked for me - but i am pretty lean to begin with my  issue in on my inner thighs - and it is more noticeable when i dont exercise so i try to do squats, stretches and inner thigh exercises -i am actually going to try heated yoga and see if that helps -  but the cream didnt really do anything for me- i was hoping it would based on peoples comments - will try the yoga :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, applied twice a day, but no results.</li>
    <li> The product is great, the delivery was very slow.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with cellulite and I finally found something that helps it. I love this product, use it with that back shower brush. Make sure and dry scrub up and once done add this lotion. You will see a big difference.</li>
    <li> Hey it actually does what is say&#x27;s it will do.</li>
    <li> Did not work... Waste of money</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> OMG it really does work! I definately saw changes within the first week. Product is great and recommendit. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is feeling a bit sticky afterwards so don&#x27;t put too much on!</li>
    <li> I can see it working after a few weeks, I use it in the morning and at night and it works, but you have to be patient.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I must say that in 3 days my skin appears to be slightly tighter. Will definitely continue using this to see complete results!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money.  No change.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was skeptical, but a few days after I began using this (about a week), my friend visited and said my hips looked thinner. I wasn&#x27;t wearing tights, just yoga pants which don&#x27;t hide anything. So hopefully this does work. I will keep trying it to see what the results will be.</li>
    <li> First day using this product. The packaging was fairly nice. The cream is almost like liquid(watery). However, the cream does absorb quickly to your skin, which is a good thing since you don&#x27;t have to rub it on for a long time. Once I open the cream the scent was strong. It smells like mint chocolate but at the same time some sort of alcohol. The smell does go away. It&#x27;s not much of a bug. Very bareable. I put the cream on my thighs, stomach, and arms. Instantly I felt a tingly/burn sensation. It&#x27;s takes about 15 min for it to go away or so. It feels great may I say. It feels as if my skin is already tightening but obviously I haven&#x27;t seen any change. Only time will tell. I will update my review since this is my first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have much hope for this cream (:</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for 2 months and got amazing result. It really works and keeps my body in a nicer shape. Thank you for your product! I love it!</li>
    <li> This product works really well. The only con is that the container is not completely full. They need to give you more of the product in the container.</li>
    <li> Does anything ever really work?&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a chance as I have several creams&lt;br /&gt;The only way I think is to change your diet an exercise, but even that cant help in some of us that just have it :(</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvements, cream was a little sticky.</li>
    <li> This Naturalico Firming Cream is powered with caffeine and retinol to help fight cellulite.  We purchased this cream in a&lt;br /&gt;promotion for personal use, honest evaluation and review.  I have been searching for a product to aid in to the lessoning&lt;br /&gt;of current development of cellulite and also to try and create firmer, tighter skin on arms, abdomen, legs, and butt.&lt;br /&gt;The rose hip seed oil and lactic acid has been said to help in hydrating, lifting, toning, and to visibly improve skin firmness.&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs quickly, and leaves no greasy residue.  Looking forward to seeing great results, and will report back&lt;br /&gt;with all future findings.</li>
    <li> Certainly a great product! Felt a difderence and saw a difference with the first few uses. Obviously this should be paired with a diet and exercise regimen for maximum results, but with all that considered it is worth it!</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review it. It was delivered in in a couple of days after ordering. I expected it taking longer to ship but it was shipped to me right away. I really like the way it makes your skin feel hydrated and not tacky like some products do. This product is not a thick lotion, it light and very easy to massage into your problem areas.The smell is very mild. I am enjoying using this product on my legs and other places. It seems to be helping some, but I have not been using the product for very long. Once I see the end results I will  review again so you will know about how long before the full effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for about 2 weeks and I finished the tub. I did follow instructions and applied twice a day. This did not take any cellulite away but it did make my skin feel tighter while the cream was on. You will only feel results while the cream is on but long term results were not seen. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Like this stuff and seem to have firmer skin and less visible cellulite</li>
    <li> I have actually been using this on my face, as it seems to help with wrinkles! Yes, can you believe that? I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have this to use after the birth of my son.  Along with the belly wrap that the hospital gave me, I apply this and then wrap the belly wrap around my tummy.  I just had my fifth c-section and this has helped me to get my posture back as it was difficult to walk.  The cellulite has helped with making it easier to stand straight and reduce the belly to where I have not been doubled over in extreme pain. Thank you Cellulite Cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these as a review. No other compensation has been given.</li>
    <li> Is it safe to use this cream while pregnant ?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several product and this one definitely works the best, if you use it as instructed. I&#x27;m not a fan of scented products and you do smell a light, what I would call a peppermint scent, however it is NOT overbearing at all and dissipates rather quickly. It goes on smooth and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product for my wife and I could not be more pleased. She started using it and we could begin to see reduction in her cellulite from aging in only three weeks. Her legs also began to look and feel softer in only four days of repeated use. She&#x27;s told me how much better she feels now in her own skin. She has even tried using some on other areas of her body that look better as well. We will definitely be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> This Cellulite Cream makes a real difference. I was skeptical at first, so I did a test and used the Cellulite Cream on my right side, and a product I like from Body Shop on my left. After only around two weeks, the Body Shop arm looked much more crepe-papery and withered than the Cellulite Cream side. I&#x27;ll be keeping a jar on hand from now on!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see Retinol or Caffeine in the list of ingredients....unless they&#x27;re under a mystery name I feel like this was falsly advertised. I have ordered a different cream previously which I saw results but because the price had doubled and this supposidly had the same ingredients I thought it would be as good. However, that was not the case. After several weeks I do not see any change from this one and feel like I wasted that time. Also, this one stays sticky for quite awhile after applying... and feels dry tacky from then on. I will search for a different cream.... and will be sure it has the necessary ingredients or return it next time.</li>
    <li> I love this Cellulite Cream by Naturalico. It comes packaged well and in a very generous jar. The cream itself is very smooth and feels refreshing going on to the skin. The scent is very light and is nice. I have experienced no irritation at all. My skin has been looking tighter and smoother and just better over all. I am very happy with the purchase and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This cream has multiple ingredients to soften and tighten skin to improve its appearance. It has a viscous, creamy texture and a pleasant minty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are to rub it into the skin on the problem areas vigorously once or twice a day. This does seem to stimulate blood circulation and a good massage is very helpful, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar I received is safety-sealed and it has an expiration date about two years from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturalico provided a jar for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> So i just received this product 2 days ago but have been using it daily. Haven&#x27;t really seen results but my skin where I am applying the product feels firm and less saggy...well keep update within a month to  show results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying out the Naturalico cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine to see if it would help &amp;#34;firm up&amp;#34; some problem skin areas. I&#x27;m losing some weight (long time being overweight), and some of my skin tone is &amp;#34;less than great&amp;#34;. This isn&#x27;t going to wipe out 50 years of abuse of my skin, but it&#x27;s doing a good job in smoothing out the skin texture. I&#x27;ve been using it on my thighs with positive results (smoothing out some of the ripples), as well on the stomach area. The stretch marks aren&#x27;t going to go away, but they seem to have lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent too... it&#x27;s a pepperminty-metholated mix, and it smells nice (and isn&#x27;t greasy) when applying it. I&#x27;m looking forward to see what happens over the long term with this cream, but in the shorter term, it&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> I’m excited to share with you all my “Cellulite with Retinol, Caffeine &amp; Body Firming Cream Review!” This cream is perfect for morning use like right after your morning shower routine. As soon as you apply you can feel it going to work instantly. The tingling sensation is a nice little wake me up type of affect. This product feels good on my skin and the scent is not bad either. I’m defiantly looking forward to continued use to keep seeing my dreaded cellulite disappear!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Smooth those lumpy bumpy cottage cheese thighs and firm that jiggly butt!&amp;#34;?  Quite an interesting claim that I, for one, did not want to pass up!  Before even receiving the cream, I received an e-mail from the manufacturer with some hints and tips on how to use the product once I receive it.  I appreciated that they reached out like this and was already impressed with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first opening the product, I was surprised by a somewhat minty glue/paint scent.  Bella Naturals informs users that there might be a &amp;#34;menthol&amp;#34; type fragrance, which is the peppermint left extract and peppermint oil, used to reduce inflammation.  Much like the smell, the product also felt like glue.  It was gooey and slimy.  After application, it didn&#x27;t seem to really soak into the skin - rather sit on top and leave a sticky residue.  I once tried to continue rubbing the product into my skin to see if it just took more &amp;#34;elbow grease&amp;#34; to make it absorb, but the product ended up drying and peeling off, leaving chunks of what looked like dried glue all over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dried, the product does show immediate (although I am sure temporary) results.  My thigh looked sleek and silky.  After three weeks of use, my skin definitely felt softer and smoother, but I was under the impression that this product was basically for immediate results and probably didn&#x27;t do much long term.  However, I then compared at my before &amp; after photos...I can&#x27;t be sure of it&#x27;s actual effects on my cellulite, but my gosh it sure looks like it helped!  In the after photo, my skin looks so much smoother and the lumps towards the front of my leg have almost disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of application, once per day, on only 1 thigh, I used up my entire jar.  Therefore, I would suspect a jar to last less than a week of the recommended, twice daily application.  At $20/jar, this could be quite costly</li>
    <li> I work out and eat healthy but medically have some problem spots. I used this cream and they actually got worse!</li>
    <li> Been using it for couple of weeks on my tummy region, am yet to see any visible difference. shruggs</li>
    <li> This cellulite cream comes in a 4 oz tub, and has a great peppermint scent, that reminds me of my favorite foot scrub! This particular cellulite cream boosts the greatest amount of both Retinol, and caffeine. The Retinol in this cream, enhances collagen production, encourages skin renewal and helps tighten and firm the skin. While the caffeine provides antioxidants that help protect the skin from free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that the  L-Carnitine that helps the body metabolize fat, Green Tea that stimulates the release of stored fat, Glaucine which is Responsible For Decreasing Fat Deposits , and Coenzyme-A that breaks down fat and helps restore connective tissue, and you have a recipe that will work from the outside in, to help heal your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I have not seen a complete disappearance of the cellulite that is on my hips and thighs, but there is a difference in appearance. The skin is tighter, looks healthier, and the cellulite is less pronounced. All in all, I am pleased with this product, and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I tried something different with this cellulite cream, that I have not tried with the others, and it was using a brush after applying the cream. The direction say to rub the cream vigorously into the affected areas, once or twice a day. Well, I did that, only this time, I also lightly brushed my skin is a circular motion to increase blood flow to the area. I can&#x27;t say for certain if that helped, but I wont discount it either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really liked, was that it has also made a difference in the appearance of my stretch marks! You have to love that feature! So, if you are looking for a product that will help lessen the appearance of your cellulite and stretch marks, then you should try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was given this product complimentary as part of a review. All opinion are my own*</li>
    <li> I have not used this cream for long and I have not seen an improvement.  I will continue to use it and will post a second review.</li>
    <li> I’ve been informed that the smell is due to peppermint leaf extract, but to me, this cream still smells like chemicals. It’s also a lot more liquidy than most creams–it’s more like thick water than a cream. It does make it easy to spread over a large area though, so that’s not necessarily bad. It’s also pretty absorbent, and it doesn’t leave an oily feeling on your skin, so that’s good. Just be careful when opening it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however, contain many ingredients shown to firm and smooth out the skin and cover up the cellulite. I’ve used it daily for 2 weeks and the effects are there. It doesn’t make it go away completely, but it’s less visible than before. If you use it for a longer period of time, the effects might be more significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this isn’t a bad product. Beauty products are always a bit shaky, as you never know if something that works for someone else could work for you. Personally though, even though it worked, the smell is a intolerable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent a review sample</li>
    <li> Doest not work! A waste of money</li>
    <li> So ive been using this for about two months and it has done absolutely nothing for my cellulite at all&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed</li>
    <li> Most men aren&#x27;t plagued with the cellulite problem the way women are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean this new product from BELLA NATURALS Naturalico Firming Cellulite Cream isn&#x27;t meant for men, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This very smooth, enriching cream absorbs rapidly into the skin to deliver caffeine burning of fat tissue, retinol stimulation of collagen production, along with Green Tea release of stored fat, Coenzyme-A for breaking down fat and restoring connective tissue and the result is a tightening of sagging skin. Yes, we all, after a certain age, have it but most people cover those embarrassing crepe paper appearing areas (like under the arms and in between the thighs, etc).&lt;br /&gt;This cream does attack the cellulite problem, but for the gentlemen it really does improve the areas mentioned in addition to tightening that little mid-drift role that gently hangs over the belt and the genitalia. Does it go miraculously away? No, but with in a couple of weeks of using this soothing cream there is a definite improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is not only for cellulite (but friend using it swear by it for that), but it has specific solutions for men&#x27;s body parts as well.

    <li> Received this item in exchanged for my review.&lt;br /&gt;Love what it is doing for lower body. Looking forward to the summer and the beach.</li>
    <li> I wish i could have given this more than 3 stars but sadly i didn&#x27;t get to continue testing this product. i want to say thank you because i got this for free , So Thank you to Bellas Naturals &amp; Amazon . I am sad that Im not able to continue to use it for the next couple weeks to get the firmer skin. It seems like a great thing to use,sadly I have sensitive skin &amp; on the first night i felt a itching sensation. It also had a smell that bothered me. it is a light smell so for more it should not be a problem I do think it would be great for those within skin issues. So i would say test it out and maybe it&#x27;ll work better for you :) I think others without sensitive skin would have a good experience</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this product at all and very thankful for the money back guarantee if not satisfied within 30 days. I read all the reviews before making this purchase and was hoping to see a difference but saw no difference in the cellulite on my thighs. Glad I was able to return the product, it did not do a thing.</li>
    <li> I do not expect long term results but I think it does give some good temporary results for a day at the beach.  I have only been using for a few days so not sure about any permanent results.  The smell is good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> NOTE: I received a free sample of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried a product of this type before.  I admit I was a bit skeptical, but also intrigued:  although my weight is in the normal range, I carry excess fat on my lower body.  If this cream could help improve the appearance of the skin in those areas, then I was all for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had several issues with this product.  The first was the packaging.  Although it is packaged in a tub, typical of a cream, the product actually has more of a lotion-like consistency.  Therefore, I found it was easy to spill over the sides of the tub and quite messy; a bottle would have been more appropriate.  Secondly, it was rather strongly and unpleasantly scented.  I am not someone who dislikes scented products--in fact, I tend to enjoy scents--but this had a rather odd odor, somewhat between too fruity and too floral.  The biggest issue I had with the product, however, was that it was extremely sticky.  I applied the product post-shower (after drying off), a good 15-20 minutes prior to getting dressed, yet I found that my clothes were sticking because the product was NOT YET DRY even after this amount of time.  This was very frustrating, and it made me limit the use of the product to the front of my body only (i.e., I got tired of sticking to things every time I sat down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I used this product mainly on my belly, outer hips, and front/inner thighs.  Following the directions, it took me just under a month to use the entire jar of product in those locations only.  At the end of this period, I saw absolutely NO discernable change to the appearance of my skin in any of these areas.  The only good thing I can report is that is I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to this product, which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1.  Otherwise, based on both the down sides and the lack of results, I would not recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> My wife reports that this goes on smooth and feels nice to the touch on the skin. However, she admits it&#x27;s no wonder potion lotion. In the sample tested in this review, it works as a cream, but to date, alas, no miracles have been worked on its behalf.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Not only is the scent delightful but it really works! Apply twice a day and your on your way to cellulite free problem areas! It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Do you like having jiggly parts?  Neither do I!  This cream will help get rid of that and firm/tone your skin.  This cream has more retinol and caffeine than most other similar products on the market.  It comes in a 4 oz jar and the cream is nice and thick and silky smooth when it goes on your skin.  I love the logo with the flowers and the pink color on the jar - it&#x27;s so beautiful!  Shipped very quickly I had it within a few days and I have been very happy so far with the results, I have a lot more jiggly parts than most people so it will take a while, but I have been using it in places where I thought I would really see a difference and it has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t understand a lot of the way the ingredients work, here is what the manufacturer says:  Retinol enhances collagen production, encourages skin renewal and helps tighten and firm the skin.  Green Tea stimulates the release of stored fat.  Coenzyme-A breaks down fat and helps restore connective tissue.  And the Active Ingredient Glaucine and Caffeine helps to decrease cellulite fat deposits and stretch marks.  So you are getting a LOT of great toning power in a little jar.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to use, but it will depend on how many places on your body you use it as to how long it will last.  But a little bit goes a long way, you just rub it in, I didn&#x27;t notice any residue or greasiness to it which is good because I hate that!  I also noticed that the cream has a nice fragrance to it, kind of minty but not loaded down with scent :)  I think you would be very satisfied with this product!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
    <li> i love it this cream it hepls a lot.. thanks for the discount,,,</li>
    <li> Actually works when you combine detoxing efforts for cellulite and cleansing the body. Has a minty smell which is a lil off putting at first but once it dries it settles and is subtle.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, as good as expensive creams at stores. I have used many cellulite creams with mixed results. I like that it is easily absorbed and love the peppermint. It is cooling effect as well as nice scent. There is immediate results as far as diminishing the appearance of cellulite. I have not found the magic bullet, there may not be one ut this one is work the money.</li>
    <li> There are pros and cons to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening, you&#x27;ll notice that the cream is more of a gel-cream and it is a bit runny, which is unexpected for the type of packaging in my opinion. The upside to this is that under the lid is an additional piece with a tab that both keeps it from leaking or spilling and is really easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite strong in the container, but it isn&#x27;t as strong on the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it unpleasant, but it isn&#x27;t a scent that I would wear as a perfume either. It reminds me of a menthol-citrus blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is rather pleasant. There is a slight cooling and tingling feeling when you&#x27;re applying it. Its a little refreshing, and I really like that the fragrance isn&#x27;t as overpowering once it is blended into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say that I noticed any change in cellulite, but I will say that this product makes your skin feel firm and incredibly moisturized. Even without any cellulite reduction, it is well worth the money for the incredible skin texture it leaves you with. I&#x27;ve tried many other lotions and creams, but I have to say that I love the way this makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> I’ve tried a few different creams designed to reduce cellulite lately. I have to say that while they’ve all had a scent to them, I feel that this one has the most pleasant scent. Once this soaks into my skin, I really don’t smell it anymore. That’s huge for me. I don’t want any strange smells mixing with my perfume after my morning applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar says: “Apply and rub into target area (abdominals, hips, thighs, arms and/or glutes) vigorously 1-2 times daily. Massage into skin until absorbed or brush on in even layers with a fan brush.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I don’t have a fan brush so I massaged it into my skin with my fingers. I feel as though the massaging of the cream into the skin is a big part of the effectiveness of the cream, so massage it in, don’t just rub it on and leave it to soak in by itself. Also, be sure to wash you hands after use, because you don’t want to get it into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my skin. It’s not the most noticeable, but my skin is just tighter and smoother-looking, in my opinion. I feel like this is a great product for your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently given a jar of this awesome Naturalico Body Firming Cream by Bella Naturals to try for free! I feel like the luckiest mom in the universe ;)</li>
    <li> This SEEMS to be working, but it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks. The problem I am having is that the cream is extremely thick, so it is hard to rub it in to my problem areas. I even purchased a cellulite &#x27;wand&amp;#34; to apply the cream and help it penetrate the skin better, this seems to help. The only other problem I have with this cream is that I do not particularly like the scent. It is sort of a mint scent.&lt;br /&gt;The cream says to apply it twice daily,, but because I do not like the smell, I only apply at night at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been mixing it with one third straight retinol to help it penetrate my skin more easily. I think this is helping.</li>
    <li> I was offered this product to do a review and asked my wife if she wanted to try it out and she gracefully agreed.  I had her apply it to only one leg for a few days without telling me which one she was using it on.  After a few days I was able to tell which was the treated leg fairly easily.  It didn&#x27;t eliminate the cellulite but definitely softened it and continued to show improvements over a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like anything else, this isn&#x27;t a miracle fix but when used daily you should see an improvement in how those trouble areas look.  The cream does seem to go a long way and I&#x27;d estimate most people would get about a month out of each container based on using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line here is the product actually delivers on what it says it is going to do.

I was contacted to test and review this product and I figured, well my body is aging and my skin is getting lose even though I exercise 3-5 days a week and eat healthy so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst case, my skin burns and I die... but I didn&#x27;t, I almost died from disbelief actually (not literally). Most people would say I&#x27;m still too young to have aging skin, wrinkles or cellulite, that it&#x27;s just not possible. Well let&#x27;s be honest here, 30 is older than 19 and the sun, gravity and age takes it toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly 40-45 days following these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use twice daily and rub onto skin vigorously in an up and down motion (not a circular motion).&lt;br /&gt;2.  STAY hydrated! Drink lots of water or water with lemon!&lt;br /&gt;3. Eat less, if any processed foods.&lt;br /&gt;4. Restrict your salt intake and only use seasalt where possible.&lt;br /&gt;5. Find a weekly exercise regime that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;6. Stick to a healthy diet.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Use a free email, task, or calendar program on your computer or phone, and use the virtual alarm reminder to remind you to apply the cream daily if you tend to forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some very surprising results in my legs and arms. They have firmed up pretty decently, my skins has a mor even and younger tone since using this product. I can easily and highly recommend this product to anyone of any age or gender.

    <li> Product is awesome. I have been using it now for a couple weeks and my thighs and legs are smoothing out. I was skeptical like with anything else but it is awesome the way it has almost eliminated my trouble areas.</li>
    <li> I got the chance to try out this Cellulite and body firming cream and I loved it.  This was a thinner cream, I was wondering because it’s so thin how well it would work but it worked great. A little of this cram goes a very long way so this jar will last you quite awhile.  It left my hands a little sticky but that is really not that big of a deal just wash your hands and you are ready to go.  This cream had a very clean scent to it.  This is very refreshing they usually have more of a chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;  I can already tell a difference after just one week of using it my skin is tighter especially in the thigh area. When I used this cream it gave my skin a very cooling feeling.  My skin felt cool to the touch for about minutes.  I loved it.  I could feel it working.</li>
    <li> I received a jar of the Cellulite with Caffeine and Body Firming Cream from Naturalico for review. This product contains caffeine and retinol which are both proven to help fight cellulite and tighten, tone and firm your skin. I love using this cream, the cream absorbs into skin quickly and very easy to apply. There is a slight menthol scent but once this soaks into my skin the smell goes away. I have been using it for a month now and I&#x27;m quite impressed with the result. My thighs looked more toned and more smooth. I would recommend this product to people that have cellulite and are trying to get rid of it. I will continue to use this hoping for more results.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again. I have seen some improvement. It doesn&#x27;t make my legs sticky, but I do have to wash my hands after applying it. I don&#x27;t mind the scent. It absorbs nicely and makes my skin feel nice. Right now I just use it on my thighs.</li>
    <li> awesome product - can feel it working as soon as I put it on. Skin has a warming sensation - hopefully I see some results :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this by far has to be the best, seeing good results in only rwo weeks,love this product reasonable price..definitely ordering more</li>
    <li> This cream works well I wouldnt say it gets rid of cellulite but it does help reduce its appearance. It also leaves your skin feeling firm and soft. I work outfive days a week eat healthy and use a massager and cream and still have it. But overall this product works well and I would recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if it helps cellulite but I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. The only thing i didn&#x27;t  like was how the cream flakedin the jar. It made my thighs softer and firmer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream following my shower where I use Finulite cellulite soap the Jalico cellulite massager and I am happy to say there has been a very noticeable decrease in the rippley look of my thighs. I will continue to use this product as well as the others.</li>
    <li> Has a lovely, refreshing smell. My skin definitely smoother after a month or so using. As with any other product being used for reasons such as weight loss or weight control, a smart diet and exercise is essential. I will continue buying this product as its one of the best ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried many cellulite creams.... but I love the texture of this one and the smell. Best of all is that I did notice some improvement in the appearance of my skin. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another jar. Good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I thought this would sure work with all the great reviews. I took photos and used it religiously and with exfoliation + working out + nutrition. I used it during a fitness challenge for the duration of a month and until the tub was finished. It did not work at. all. I went back to Nivea because that has visible results within 10 days and always have. I guess I was hoping to trump it but this was a fail. ESP with all the help I gave it.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical when it comes to products like these, but I&#x27;m so happy that I tried this. I eat clean and exercise regularly but I still have my problem areas so I was curious as to how well these products really work.&lt;br /&gt;its been a couple of weeks since I started using this and I felt results within the first several days. On the applied areas, my skin feels much firmer and smoother. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that it does what it claims. Clearly creams don&#x27;t make you lose serious weight but with clean eating and regular exercise, this product really gives extra help where you need it.</li>
    <li> This beauty aid has a lovely fragrance with just a hint of citrus and absorbs easily into the skin. A little goes a long way. Results were noticeable within 24 hours of the first application and over a 2 week period, my skin looked and felt much smoother, and there was a nice evenness to the skin tone. Also noticed a nice reduction of stretch marks when used around the upper breasts.</li>
    <li> Two disclaimers to begin with: First, this product was provided as a free sample, but with no strings attached. Second, I did not try it, my wife did but I&#x27;m writing the review based on what she told me about it along with my own observations of the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She liked it. She said it was smooth, creamy and easy to apply.  Her description of the scent, which some people don&#x27;t like, is that it is &amp;#34;pleasant.&amp;#34;  Me, I find it a bit on the strong side but it smells nice. It reminds me of Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint gum.  It leaves a sort of oily feel after application which I suppose is to be expected, but that&#x27;s the reason for deducting a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy enough to use.  As for its effectiveness, my wife said it did the job of firming up her skin.  She has only slight cellulite but the cream did help.  Mainly she liked it for how it toned and firmed her skin.  I&#x27;d say from visual inspection that the cream works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s an effective product and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t have a cellulite problem, but as we age, she worries more about her skin and the effects of age, like cellulite, that may slowly creep up on her.  When offered a sample of this cellulite cream with Retinol and caffeine by Naturalico, she eagerly accepted and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she&#x27;d give it a 4 to 4.5 out of 5 Stars. She likes it, and does believe it is helping her skin, to tighten it and work a little on the tiny bit of cellulite she believes she is starting to notice. She likes the soothing and tightening aspects of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says the cream goes on easily without a mess, but she doesn&#x27;t really care for the smell. She understands that the smell comes from the peppermint leaf extract and peppermint oil in the cream, but she thinks it smells more like menthol than mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a magically formula that will erase and eliminate enormous amounts of cellulite, but my wife does believe it is a good firming cream that will help your skin both in the way it feels and looks.</li>
    <li> I was sent a full sized bottle for review and used the cream for 30 days on my thighs. The mint scented cream booth soothed my legs and reduced or firmed my skin reducing the appearance of cellulite. I applied it liberally in an up and down motion to my skin each morning and evening. It has a pleasant mint fragrance and leaves skin feeling soft. I recommend allowing some time in your routine for the cream to dry before stepping into clothing. Overall the product delivered on its promise and I loved that it also soothed my tired legs. The cream comes with a list of health style recommendations, and I encourage you to increase water intake and exercise for added results.</li>
    <li> Cream has a pleasant smell, not over powering; with regular use the skin becomes very soft and smooth to the touch. I&#x27;m expecting to see less cellulite with regular use of the Naturalico cream. So far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of this for review, and gave it to my wife to try. After a few weeks she said &amp;#34;I haven’t noticed much difference, but I don’t believe I have cellulite either.&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this item gave me this information which I will repeat in this review in case it is helpful to someone:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to follow the instructions on the label so you can get the best results.  Here are 7 tips that we believe will really help make a difference with your results:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use twice daily, and rub onto skin vigorously in an up and down motion (not a circular motion).&lt;br /&gt;2.  Carry a water bottle with you everywhere, and fill it with filtered water and lemon juice, which will help ensure to keep you hydrated and flush your system.  Try out raw vegetable juicing at home.&lt;br /&gt;3. Eat less processed foods&lt;br /&gt;4. Restrict your salt intake and only use seasalt where possible.&lt;br /&gt;5. Use a skin brush in the shower on the target areas.&lt;br /&gt;6. Find a weekly exercise regime that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Use a free email, task, or calendar program on your computer or phone, and use the virtual alarm reminder to remind you to apply the cream daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just a few were asking about the smell of the cream.  There is peppermint leaf extract and peppermint oil in the cream which has a &amp;#34;clean, fresh, minty&amp;#34; aroma although some also describe the smell as similar to menthol. Peppermint is often used to soothe irritated skin (provides a cooling sensation) and also to help reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being made in the USA is a plus for me. I&#x27;m going to give the product the benefit of the doubt and rate it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Works well. Would purchase again and recommend.</li>
    <li> I only use sometimes because I don&#x27;t have time to put it always but it does work and I like the feeling and the cold</li>
    <li> I have tried many cellulite creams, to the moment the one I&#x27;m using is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! isn&#x27;t sticky or messy. I&#x27;m almost finished with my very first jar and can definitely see the difference.</li>
    <li> Very sticky did not see any results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week. Twice a week like it says, no results,  and my bottle is about half gone. Pretty disappointed so far.</li>
    <li> Did notice a small difference after finishing the first jar. Will need to try a couple of more jars to see if it really does work.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt; i have seen results in my midsection. i feel more confident about revealing my body. my skin feels tighter and not so pudgy.  I used this product as instructed. And im overly satisfied with the product. It does have a strong minty smell. Substance is very liquidity. Just wash your hands after. And you will be fine. Nor does this product leave a strong odor. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item smells nice and feels nice on the skin, not seeing any changes in skin, but that might take some time.</li>
    <li> I put this on for the first time today, so this review will be of my initial observations. If I observe any results after some longer use then I will update.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is quite watery. Before applying, I shook the container and it was still watery. When I initially put it on my skin it was a bit difficult to spread but did absorb pretty fast. My skin felt pretty rough in the areas I applied, not moisturized at all. However, after about an hour or so my skin did feel very smooth.</li>
    <li> so ive been using this for a week or so.. I don&#x27;t really notice anything except soft skin... I don&#x27;t feel firmer and I still have the cellulite BUT its soft and smooth cellulite... just kinnna feels more like a moisturizer to me...&lt;br /&gt;*received this item discounted for my review</li>
    <li> received product in trade for review! so far so good! great scent and easy application. I will update with another review once I&#x27;ve given it a weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve used now for a week and wow!! Amazing will never buy another brand again. My skin is soft and bright</li>
    <li> I thought this cellulite cream was more runny than cream-like cream that I was expecting.  .The cream does seem to give the skin a softer, more even look.  Feels like it is tighting up the area although, I have not used the product long enough to say for sure.  However it does seem like something is happening.  After applying the product and washing your hands it feels a little tacky.  It seems like the skin on your fingers are tightening.  This goes away after about 10 minutes or so.  I hopefully it works as well as it says!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review. Despite the discounted item, my opinion remain 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> This cream will help keep the cellulite at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to one of my female relatives that wanted to test the cream, and was used twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week she started to see some improvement on the \\&quot;Cottage Cheese\\&quot; look on the underside of her arm and the inner thigh. After two weeks, I was even able to see a change in a much smoother appearance on her skin. Her skin had a smoother youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this cream. This cream is no substitute for working out, but will definitely give you a head start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream for about 2 weeks. I used it as directed and applied it to all of the suggested target areas including hips, glutes, abs and more. It is quick and simple to apply and takes only a minute or so to thoroughly rub it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a slight chemical smell to it. It is not overpowering or unpleasant but it is there. I only noticed the smell when first opening the jar and during application to the arms. I never smelled anything when applying to other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a firming to my skin within about a week of using this. It helped smooth those bumpy areas and left my skin feeling more silky and with less of those baby stretch marks I have had for years. I liked that it works on all the parts I need help with and I can apply it once or twice a day while dressing, after showering or whenever I think of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to finish this product and see if I get any more results from it. I am happy with the ones I have now, but would be thrilled if it helped even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a sample for review purposes. All opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> I was sent the Cellulite with Retinol &amp; Caffeine and Body Firming Cream by Naturalico for free to test and give my honest opinion on. I did NOT like this product at all. The product was tightening but only slightly and didn’t have lasting effects, ie I still have visible cellulite. The major problem I have with this product though is the smell. The smell of this product is AWFUL and it does not ease up with time. It smells like BenGay to me and I am only 27 years old so going out in public smelling like that is not appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to give this product a 3 out of 10 stars for giving some tightening but the smell ruined any chance I had of wanting to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Naturalico sent me this cream to review for my blog GlamRiver.  Obviously a cream cannot make Cellulite disappear but this cream has really seemed to help the overall appearance of my skin and which makes it less noticeable.  The effect doesn&#x27;t last forever but I love the way it does help make it less noticeable so it&#x27;s great for when you want to wear shorts, skirts or dresses and show a little more leg because it gives you a little confidence boost!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally done with my first jar yet but I really wanted to provide feedback. The first thing you will notice if you buy this product is that it&#x27;s not a creamy consistency but rather more like a liquid cream-gel. For that reason, I recommend being very careful when first opening it or you may spill some once the paper lid thing is removed. (Maybe the packaging needs to be changed to a tube?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for scent, I would call it very minty and herbal in aroma. Not in a bad way,but definitely strong enough to signify it possess powerful ingredients. Even though I live a fitness lifestyle and eat clean, it hasn&#x27;t stopped me from battling with cellulite in certain areas. Being 5&#x27;6 and weighing 127 bears witness that many women can have this issue.  I&#x27;m not severe but it&#x27;s enough to annoy me to no end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROUTINE:  I recently bought the cellulite suction cups on this site and use them in conjunction with this product. After my evening bath, I use olive oil and suction my problem areas for 15-30 min. I follow that up by rubbing in this cream. So far, my skin feels like SUPER silky and soft. As for cellulite, I see good improvement unlike other products I have tried. I think with continued use and my lifestyle, this may be my holy grail routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase and update in the future.</li>
    <li> Ugh....I really really tired to give this product a chance but the smell was unbearable. Like the smell of Vitamin C chewables&lt;br /&gt;I was using it day and night for 2 weeks to see if it would get results that would make it worth while.&lt;br /&gt;Probably using more then I should just to get rid of it. If you use too much however, it does not absorb and leaves a weird layer that rubs off like dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all the sink, I didn&#x27;t see any real difference. Maybe even less then other products Ive used in the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id HIGHLY recommend Nivea Q10 Plus Skin Firming Cellulite Gel-Cream instead. GREAT smell and actually works.</li>
    <li> Short term user, about a week. Not payed by the company as almost all other reviews are.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this twice a day, and applying it to my big thighs. And today was the first day I actually looked at my legs..l and wow.... I would say my skin has cleared about 10%. Cellulite is so much less visible and it is SO EXCITING.  Being skeptical, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m actually seeing a change.  The container is pretty small so that is why I only gave it four stars. I lightly dip my fingers in the jar and that can do about the top part of a leg.. So it really doesn&#x27;t go far. It does smell amazing.  I would  prob purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I have been exercising, juicing with diet, and using a natural bristled brush to brist the cellulite before shower every night.&lt;br /&gt;Also after reading articles, this may only be a temporary solution, as it temporarily tightens skin.</li>
    <li> I think this works!  After three jars, I notice a difference on my thighs.  It is rather cold cream and takes a while to absorb, so not putting clothes on right away and staying warm though is a good idea.  I am also using stretch mark cream, so it could be a combination of both.</li>
    <li> As spring and summer approach and I add another birthday, I decided not only to continue a healthy diet, but also start exercising and gracefully fight what is inevitable -- less toned hydrated skin.  What I notice most of with this cream is the combination of hydration with tightening effects.  The texture is a combination of gel and a cream.  There is no miracle cure for cellulite, but this cream when I use it before exercising, seems to smooth out the appearance of cellulite and have a slightly firming affect -- maybe because water is being drawn out?  I recommend this cream, especially if you are committed to also eating cleaner, drinking water and exercising.  The Naturalico cream is like icing on the cake!</li>
