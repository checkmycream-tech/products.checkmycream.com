      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>My daughter love the smell</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and its great for my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to purchase and use.</li>
      <li>It smells good, it makes my hair soft, and it&#x27;s my favorite color - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
      <li>The smell of Hello Hydration is too strong for me.</li>
      <li>But the absolutely most glorious thing about it was the fabulous scent (clean, outdoorsy:</li>
      <li>The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t help my fly aways and frizz.</li>
      <li>The design of the label on the bottle was iconic and highly recognizable.</li>
      <li>IF YOU STILL HOLD THE RIGHTS TO THE ORIGINAL HERBAL ESSENCE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair clean</li>
      <li>I will recommend it to anyone specially if your hair is curly.</li>
      <li>Clean\\&quot; and love it, but this co diction made my hair very oily.</li>
      <li>But thankfully I found the Aussie Moist line which was able to deliver all of the same results but better with the smell and thicker texture I like.</li>
      <li>The shampoo left your hair clean and manageable...and the conditioner was well-balanced for most users (medium conditioning, I would guess).</li>
      <li>very, very popular (especially with those of us that were among the post-hippie/mother earth era...but still interested in reminders of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cultural movements)</li>
      <li>This stuff smells really good, is really rich, spreads easily through my thick hair, and moisturizes it really well.  </li>
      <li>but I did put a little on my finger just to see, it smells good not like coconut</li>
      <li>that lingered lightly in my long hair for quite some time...very enjoyable thru the day.</li>
      <li>FAST shipping</li>
      <li>I also enjoy the smell immensely.</li>
      <li>Really does hydrate hair.</li>
      <li>Very thick, suds up nicely, rinses clean.</li>
      <li>and I stopped buying them regularly (although I admit I tried the name again sporadically as it was re-invented from time to time in it&#x27;s latest version: but they ALL fell short of my expectations and hopes....and never could compare favorably with the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I keep reaching for this shampoo mainly for the smell.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend using this.  </li>
      <li>When Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner first hit the market in the late 60&#x27;s and thru most of the 70&#x27;s....</li>
      <li>It really helps my natural hair to remain soft through the detangling process.</li>
      <li>The other shampoo and conditioner of this era that I miss was the original REVLON &amp;#34;Flex&amp;#34; brand....</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been on the hunt for conditioner that was similar to the small bottle that comes in the hair dye boxes, because those are SO hydrating and leave my hair easy to comb after I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>It smells like real coconut (not the fake overly sweet smell that some shampoos have).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great deal on these and they smell so good. Not overpowering, just pleasant and my hair is way softer after. Easy to purchase and use. FAST shipping</li>
    <li> I used to use this to co-wash my hair. I liked it because it does deliver great results in regards to conditioning my hair. My hair always felt nice and moisturized from this. The reason I stopped using it and switched to Aussie Moist is because of the smell and consistency. The smell of Hello Hydration is too strong for me. I like to double my conditioners as leave-ins and the smell would linger on my hair. The consistency was too thin for me as well. I have thick afro-textured hair so when I use product I like it to match the thickness of my hair. It gives me the feeling and assurance that I&#x27;m receiving the proper moisture balance. Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t make the cut. But thankfully I found the Aussie Moist line which was able to deliver all of the same results but better with the smell and thicker texture I like.</li>
    <li> Nice for my afro hair. The smell is not too bad either. I co-wash with this and it leaves my hair clean and I don&#x27;t even need a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Silky hair with a nice smell</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites. I love the way it smells and its great for my natural curly hair. My hair likes it and so do I.</li>
    <li> It really helps my natural hair to remain soft through the detangling process. I would highly recommend using this.  I also enjoy the smell immensely.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves this conditioner.  I think I got a really good bargain and also got my subscribe and save discount!</li>
    <li> Best conditioner. Really does hydrate hair. Can feel difference immediately. I even use it on my yorkie.</li>
    <li> When Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo and conditioner first hit the market in the late 60&#x27;s and thru most of the 70&#x27;s....it was the most glorious product...very, very popular (especially with those of us that were among the post-hippie/mother earth era...but still interested in reminders of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cultural movements)...it flew off the shelves for years and years. The shampoo left your hair clean and manageable...and the conditioner was well-balanced for most users (medium conditioning, I would guess). But the absolutely most glorious thing about it was the fabulous scent (clean, outdoorsy: slightly garden/woodsy/spicy scent) that lingered lightly in my long hair for quite some time...very enjoyable thru the day. It also smelled great on guys: it was very nice to snuggle with a guy who had used the Original Clairol Herbal Essence. The design of the label on the bottle was iconic and highly recognizable. At some point in the eighties...the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; disappeared, and the products were re-formulated into a variety of versions...but NEVER have been the same again...not nearly as enjoyable or gave the same results...and I stopped buying them regularly (although I admit I tried the name again sporadically as it was re-invented from time to time in it&#x27;s latest version: but they ALL fell short of my expectations and hopes....and never could compare favorably with the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;......I suspect Clairol lost a LOT of customers because of this...and it may be a big reason in why they sold the brand to another company). CLAIROL: IF YOU STILL HOLD THE RIGHTS TO THE ORIGINAL HERBAL ESSENCE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER FORMULAS----WE ARE STILL OUT HERE....WAITING AND HOPING FOR A RESURRECTION!!!! (ps: The other shampoo and conditioner of this era that I miss was the original REVLON &amp;#34;Flex&amp;#34; brand....another iconic product...but I&#x27;ve already left a comment over on some of the long since discontinued products that have shown up online).</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really good, is really rich, spreads easily through my thick hair, and moisturizes it really well.  The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this is that it doesn&#x27;t help my fly aways and frizz. I get it way cheaper in store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair conditioner. It leaves your hair shiny and soft. I will recommend it to anyone specially if your hair is curly.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I ever used!  This was a gift for someone with problems with fly away hair.  Wanted  to share the find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner in my weekly rotation of hair products for over ten years. It smells good, it makes my hair soft, and it&#x27;s my favorite color - what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> Only stuff I use - smells great too! Very thick, suds up nicely, rinses clean. Did I mention that I adore the smell??? :-)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t use this yet but I did put a little on my finger just to see, it smells good not like coconut but I love the way it feels on my hands and will give it a honest try</li>
    <li> I bought this as I use the Herbal Essences \\&quot;Drama Clean\\&quot; and love it, but this co diction made my hair very oily.</li>
    <li> It does the job of moisturizing my ethnic hair, but i gave 4 stars because of the value. I went through a botlle of conditioner in 1 week, not enough product for the price.</li>
    <li> I keep reaching for this shampoo mainly for the smell. It smells like real coconut (not the fake overly sweet smell that some shampoos have).</li>
    <li> My daughter love the smell and I love that they ship this item to my home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been on the hunt for conditioner that was similar to the small bottle that comes in the hair dye boxes, because those are SO hydrating and leave my hair easy to comb after I get out of the shower. This is it! Love it.</li>
