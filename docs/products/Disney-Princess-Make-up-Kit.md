      <li>My daughter loved it!!  </li>
      <li>Great idea.  </li>
      <li>Our granddaughter loved this.</li>
      <li>My niece LOVED this kit.</li>
      <li>My Granddaughter loved this .</li>
      <li>my grand niece loved it</li>
      <li>She liked playing with it.</li>
      <li>My grand-daughter really liked it when she opened it.</li>
      <li>and she thought it was soo cute.</li>
      <li>THE GRANDAUGHTERS STILL ENJOYED IT.</li>
      <li>my 3 year old niece loved it!</li>
      <li>It was her first makeup kit, and she loves Disney princesses, so it was a good pick for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thought it all fit in a case, but just the make up does the accessories do not.</li>
      <li>like a tea party this is a great play set for play purposes only.</li>
      <li>CHEAPLY MADE.</li>
      <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, this product is extremely cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $5 for this now knowing how flimsy the whole thing is.  </li>
      <li>My granddaughter who&#x27;s only 2 1/2 loved it.  </li>
      <li>Just be aware if you intend to leave the house!  </li>
      <li>this is a great play set though for playing make up with her little friends.</li>
      <li>I got this for my daughter for a fun toy</li>
      <li>worth what I paid.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>Firstly, my 18-month-old daughter had so much fun with this product.  </li>
      <li>It comes with princess stickers, but there are only five of them (I wish there had been more as it took about 30 seconds for my daughter to peel off all the stickers).  </li>
      <li>kinda cheap plastic looking, small amounts of \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; but my 4 yr old niece didn&#x27;t pay attention to that stuff and absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>Besides that it&#x27;s a very cute set for little girls</li>
      <li>She was giving makeovers all weekend long :) I would suggest buying.</li>
      <li>Nice but not worth the price</li>
      <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>Fun gift for a young girl wanting to be all grown up</li>
      <li>So much so, that even her toy horse got to have his &amp;#34;lips&amp;#34; painted.</li>
      <li>It has real makeup &amp; she&#x27;s just too young for that right now.</li>
      <li>this cheap for such a high price</li>
      <li>not till she is older.</li>
      <li>It was as expected, good, as seen on picture, when opened thigs have to be stored in other place or box</li>
      <li>I send this to both of my little granddaughters and they love</li>
      <li>but I could have gone to Walmart and spent 1/4 of the $ to get something equally as cheap..</li>
      <li>The mirror and the comb are decent but small (though I guess this is suitable for young children).</li>
      <li>Item sold as new and it clearly had been opened.</li>
      <li>NOT a good buy, although she loved getting it all over my yellow arm chair.  </li>
      <li>Basically a cheap little toy make up kit, but it was a hit with her.</li>
      <li>and i am a lush.</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;Princess&amp;#34; make-up kit seemed just the thing for a 5-year old girl who loves to be a princess.</li>
      <li>Its made of soft wood vice plastic which she already broke the earrings.</li>
      <li>The makeup itself is in very cheap plastic containers, and my daughter is unable to open the containers herself due to the fact that the lids don&#x27;t fit exactly on the rest of the container.  </li>
      <li>One of the earrings broke the first time I tried to open the back to put it on my daughter&#x27;s ear.  </li>
      <li>I was Secret Santa for a family this year, and bought many of the kids&#x27; gifts online through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I think it was a little too much for my 2 yr old.</li>
      <li>The bracelet is extremely big (too big even for my adult arm)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not worth the price at all. What a rip off. It looks so glamorous and tempting in the picture but I could have gone to Walmart and spent 1/4 of the $ to get something equally as cheap.. Shame on Disney for putting out a product this cheap for such a high price and we are not picky people!!!!!do research on this bf buying trust me</li>
    <li> Great idea.  The makeup left a very dark residual color after several face washing.  Just be aware if you intend to leave the house!  Otherwise a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> This was in very thin plastic throw away cases not your average make up case. They don&#x27;t fully close and the makeup dries out and has to be thrown away.</li>
    <li> came exactly as expected, purchased as a gift for a family overseas, would consider visiting seller page again ^ ^</li>
    <li> My granddaughter who&#x27;s only 2 1/2 loved it.  She smeared the lipstick all over her face, hopefully it was non toxic.  It had some little jewelry items too.  Basically a cheap little toy make up kit, but it was a hit with her.</li>
    <li> The packaging looked like it was opened and put together again. Besides that it&#x27;s a very cute set for little girls</li>
    <li> It was as expected, good, as seen on picture, when opened thigs have to be stored in other place or box</li>
    <li> DISNEY KINDA DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE. QUALITY WAS NOT VERY GOOD. CHEAPLY MADE. THE GRANDAUGHTERS STILL ENJOYED IT.</li>
    <li> I was Secret Santa for a family this year, and bought many of the kids&#x27; gifts online through Amazon. This &amp;#34;Princess&amp;#34; make-up kit seemed just the thing for a 5-year old girl who loves to be a princess.</li>
    <li> All the nail Polish was completely dried up. There wasn&#x27;t enough brushes for the different items. My little girl was disappointed</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!!  Item as described not sure why I have to continue to write a mandatory amount of words.  I rated it and gave a brief description.</li>
    <li> My grand-daughter really liked it when she opened it. Not sure if she has played with it yet, so I don&#x27;t know too much about it.</li>
    <li> kinda cheap plastic looking, small amounts of \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; but my 4 yr old niece didn&#x27;t pay attention to that stuff and absolutely loved it. She was giving makeovers all weekend long :) I would suggest buying.</li>
    <li> my grand niece loved it</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece out in California and she thought it was soo cute. She now thinks she&#x27;s a princess.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday.  Although she LOVES putting her \\&quot;lips\\&quot; on, it only lasted a week, and each piece of jewelry has broken from the moment she tried it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $5 for this now knowing how flimsy the whole thing is.  I can get a kit very similar with an actual make up case locally for $5.  NOT a good buy, although she loved getting it all over my yellow arm chair.  Now it has matching blue finger prints..........</li>
    <li> Nice but not worth the price</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter loved this.</li>
    <li> I send this to both of my little granddaughters and they love&lt;br /&gt; it.</li>
    <li> my 3 year old niece loved it!</li>
    <li> my 3 y/o granddaughter loves this make up kit. So much so, that even her toy horse got to have his &amp;#34;lips&amp;#34; painted.</li>
    <li> Even though my niece liked it, the quality was bad .Not worth what I paid.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> My Granddaughter loved this . My Daughter thinks it could be messy if not supervised whilst her Daughter play&#x27;s with it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing; complete junk; the earrings broke within 15 minutes; the little lipstick broke off right away - total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for a fun toy only I do not let her wear make up or anything like that unless it is play time. like a tea party this is a great play set for play purposes only. she even put it on me. I am a dad and i am a lush. but she is five and I do not let her wear regular make up. not till she is older. this is a great play set though for playing make up with her little friends.</li>
    <li> Firstly, my 18-month-old daughter had so much fun with this product.  It was her first makeup kit, and she loves Disney princesses, so it was a good pick for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this product is extremely cheaply made.  One of the earrings broke the first time I tried to open the back to put it on my daughter&#x27;s ear.  The lipsticks are very small, and the lipstick broke out of the tubes after about a day of use.  I had to keep trying to smash it back into the tube so my daughter could use it.  The makeup itself is in very cheap plastic containers, and my daughter is unable to open the containers herself due to the fact that the lids don&#x27;t fit exactly on the rest of the container.  The bracelet is extremely big (too big even for my adult arm) so is not practical for my daughter or any little girl to wear.  It comes with princess stickers, but there are only five of them (I wish there had been more as it took about 30 seconds for my daughter to peel off all the stickers).  The glitter gel is the only makeup of quality -it came in a small tube with a cap that my daughter can open herself and apply her glitter.  The mirror and the comb are decent but small (though I guess this is suitable for young children).</li>
    <li> Fun gift for a young girl wanting to be all grown up</li>
    <li> My niece LOVED this kit.</li>
    <li> Item sold as new and it clearly had been opened. Package was stapled back together.</li>
    <li> Packed poorly. Product was damaged.</li>
    <li> I think it was a little too much for my 2 yr old. It has real makeup &amp; she&#x27;s just too young for that right now. She liked playing with it. Got her the Wonderworld Pinky cosmetic set and she absolutely loves it. Its made of soft wood vice plastic which she already broke the earrings.</li>
    <li> Thought it all fit in a case, but just the make up does the accessories do not. It arrived in a damaged package but as usual Amazon&#x27;s customer service immediately took care of the situation</li>
    <li> This is not worth the 35.00 I paid for it.  I also thought it would be much larger which would have helped at least ease some of the pain for the cost. It is only about 12\\&quot; x 9\\&quot;.  I will go buy something else for my grandaughter from Santa.  I plan on returning this product as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed in Seattle.</li>
