      <li>The best part is that it is really and truly fragrance free!</li>
      <li>It says that it&#x27;s unscented but to me it kind of has a waxy type of smell and wife says its almost like a mint smell but its very light.</li>
      <li>Moving forward as I get more length I will probably use the Honest Amish beard wax</li>
      <li>It makes the beard nice and soft and makes the sides of the beard tone does real nice.</li>
      <li>I would also appreciate a better price in exchange for paying more to qualify for the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; hype.</li>
      <li>My skin is healthy, beard feels great, and it&#x27;s much easier to coerce your beard into the position you&#x27;d like it</li>
      <li>It works so much better than using hair conditioner on it.  </li>
      <li>I like their beard oil better.</li>
      <li>balm is all about softening your beard, improving the skin underneath, and making your beard more manageable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s thicker and more &#x27;calming&#x27; then</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
      <li>For someone with a mustache maybe they would smell it more...</li>
      <li>He loves it, and I love that it makes his skin and hair softer.</li>
      <li>LOVE the lightness of this product.</li>
      <li>The article is very well contained and pleasantly presented.</li>
      <li>It keeps it healthy and soft and also helps control the fly aways and stubborn beard hairs that I have.</li>
      <li>But most important is that my wife is OK with the smell.</li>
      <li>it has a certain odor, not so good.</li>
      <li>grainy to touch, melts easily with body heat.  </li>
      <li>He was so excited to have a natural product with great reviews to try.</li>
      <li>But the product itself works fine.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as I have not actually used it for myself, but those I bought them for as gifts said it worked great.</li>
      <li>Truly scent free.</li>
      <li>I love it and it helps my beard very much.</li>
      <li>ok, it was my first beard balm.</li>
      <li>It is NOT scent free however has a very light scent which is very manageable for me.</li>
      <li>a full beard you would use a lot of this</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t even been able to use it because when I tried to put it on the aroma was so intense it caused me to cough.  </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s NOT a bad smell.</li>
      <li>However, two things happen if you don&#x27;t adequately massage them in.</li>
      <li>This stuff made a noticeable difference with the first try!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel all that much softer and wasn&#x27;t really any straighter or more manageable vs. without this product.</li>
      <li>Leaves beard incredibly soft and healthy, will continue to purchase beard products from this seller.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>First, your beard stays really oily, which easily transfers to your hands if you touch it.</li>
      <li>But right under your nose you&#x27;re going to smell it for quite a while.</li>
      <li>Meaning they didn&#x27;t add the ingredients which they did to the original kind, intended solely to add a slight fragrance.</li>
      <li>It helps sculpt and certainly does the trick!</li>
      <li>As far as fragrance free, well if that means you get it just the way it comes</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>/&gt;There may be some left on your brush, so brush it into your hair for a more finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>a beard oil, so it&#x27;s more likely to capture the shorter escape artist hairs.</li>
      <li>Light smell down a ok job at ramming hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend and they shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>I honestly generally use jojoba oil or Marrakesh oil since it offers more in the sense of softening the beard.</li>
      <li>What you get with an unscented product is the smell of whatever ingredients when into that product, without any ingredients added to make it smell a certain way.</li>
      <li>I avoid scented and perfumed products, so I avoided beard balms for this very reason.  </li>
      <li>He would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>My girlfriend says it is much softer.</li>
      <li>This is my second can of balm however this time I decided to try the fragrance free.</li>
      <li>No instructions on how much to use or what the results are when using it.</li>
      <li>However, as another reviewer mentioned it doesn&#x27;t really ofter a lot of control.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t help much with that either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really was concerned that this item was as unscented as advertised.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my beard.</li>
      <li>I really like this balm.</li>
      <li>the scent is just too intense to make it work for me.</li>
      <li>At the moment, &amp;#34;Ungarische Bartwichse farblos&amp;#34; seems to be a more adequate choice, at least for me and my beard.</li>
      <li>We were searching for something to make his moustache softer, and wow this really did the trick!</li>
      <li>Pros: Makes my beard softer and gives it a shiny, healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The product is supposed to be unscented, but it does have a slight scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well...did some company come to this particular field and scent it?</li>
      <li>When he shaved his beared we gave it to a friend who had a very unruly beard and it calmed it down right quick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my beard. It didn&#x27;t feel all that much softer and wasn&#x27;t really any straighter or more manageable vs. without this product. I was also hoping this would keep my skin under my beard from drying out during the winter. It didn&#x27;t help much with that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did add a little sheen to my beard.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Smells great but almost undetectable. Lasts a few days. I like to wipe excess off with a towel and it&#x27;s not greasy that way.</li>
    <li> People are confusing \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; with \\&quot;no scent at all\\&quot;. If you smell a blade of grass, does it have no scent? Well...did some company come to this particular field and scent it? No. The grass is a thing on this earth, and so has a feel, look, and smell.    Whatever ingredients go into this balm are \\&quot;things\\&quot;. They have a smell to them. To strip away the smell would be a nasty chemical process and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re avoiding here.    So what this product is, is unscented. Meaning they didn&#x27;t add the ingredients which they did to the original kind, intended solely to add a slight fragrance. What you get with an unscented product is the smell of whatever ingredients when into that product, without any ingredients added to make it smell a certain way.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the normal balm, but it&#x27;s waaay too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fixes that.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and it was used immediately!  He was so excited to have a natural product with great reviews to try. We loved the unscented balm. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be buying him more HA products!</li>
    <li> Great for conditioning and making your hair softer.  I have wirey chin hairs and i use this 2 times a day to soften up sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not control or shape your hairs. If you are looking to do that you will need a wax so order a can of wax too.</li>
    <li> I use this from time to time when I want a little control for my beard. However, as another reviewer mentioned it doesn&#x27;t really ofter a lot of control. I honestly generally use jojoba oil or Marrakesh oil since it offers more in the sense of softening the beard. Moving forward as I get more length I will probably use the Honest Amish beard wax</li>
    <li> LOVE the lightness of this product. It helps sculpt and certainly does the trick! The best part is that it is really and truly fragrance free!</li>
    <li> This is my second can of balm however this time I decided to try the fragrance free. I am very pleased with the way this product works on my beard.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as I have not actually used it for myself, but those I bought them for as gifts said it worked great.</li>
    <li> Good product. It has very little smell.</li>
    <li> Good mixture of oils and nice smell but I do find the honest amish oil to be easier to brush in than the balm</li>
    <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, I really liked this product, it made my beard nice and soft just as described. Does have a slight smell, but it fades. The only problem I have is a month after I purchased this I trimmed my beard :(. This is worth the buy, even if you only want to experiment like I did.</li>
    <li> Good product, as advertised</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any smell, definitely makes your beard softer.</li>
    <li> My beard grows wild and bushy. This makes it lay flat.  Also has a sheen to it when used after a shower.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! He would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Will take 3wks to feel softness(applying once a day in morning). Light smell down a ok job at ramming hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard from looking frizzed</li>
    <li> it´s ok, it was my first beard balm. it has a certain odor, not so good. maybe next time i will order one with fragance.</li>
    <li> Does not work for handlebars.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. The instructions on how to apply it was very clear. No instructions on how much to use or what the results are when using it. I used it every day for about three weeks and still have no clue what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Maybe I ordered the wrong kind. Guess I&#x27;ll never no.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about trying this product for my beard however I was pleasantly surprised how well it works. As one who has allergies to highly scented products I really was concerned that this item was as unscented as advertised. It is NOT scent free however has a very light scent which is very manageable for me. I would recommend this product for someone else.</li>
    <li> I really like this balm. It smells great. It has an outdoorsy smell. Makes you smell like a lumberjack. It is not a strong scent though. You have to be hugging someone for them to even begin to smell it. It has been great for my beard as well. It keeps it healthy and soft and also helps control the fly aways and stubborn beard hairs that I have.</li>
    <li> This tames the unruly mess quickly and naturally. If you&#x27;re growing out your beard and need something to keep you presentable until the beard is long enough to settle down, or just have a man face jungle; this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thicker and more &#x27;calming&#x27; then a beard oil, so it&#x27;s more likely to capture the shorter escape artist hairs.</li>
    <li> He said it was a little too greasy for his liking.</li>
    <li> This product is great . It does what it states. I like the fact it has all natural ingredients. It makes your beard shine and stays soft. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff made a noticeable difference with the first try! It made his beard a lot softer and smoother. A little goes a long way so be careful!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Truly scent free.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, who is allergic to nearly every scented product in the world. Just as described, it is unscented. He has also never had a softer beard/stubble than he does now! He loves it, and I love that it makes his skin and hair softer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome. I tried the scented version first, and although the scent wasn&#x27;t unpleasant, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. This has all of the benefits of the regular version, but without the anise scent.</li>
    <li> Beards, being made from hair, have a massive amount of surface area and beards practically encircle the nose, so why someone would want a scented beard balm is a mystery to me.  I avoid scented and perfumed products, so I avoided beard balms for this very reason.  This new product is about as scent free as it can possibly be which means I only smell anything if I put it up to my nose and try to.  Even then it&#x27;s a difficult-to-explain odor of nothingness.  Other than that I cannot smell it, which is something I cannot say for the mustache wax I&#x27;ve tried which will continue to release a blast of obnoxious outdoory stink even after the initial stench wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that the product works well in keeping the hairs soft and a more manageable than doing nothing at all, but for something that is going to be used on a daily basis this tin is too small and/or expensive. I suppose it is small so that it can be carried in a pocket, but being pressed against the body all day I would worry that this could liquefy the contents.  I would also appreciate a better price in exchange for paying more to qualify for the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; hype.</li>
    <li> Cannot comment on how well it works because I used it once and a few days later it had what looked like bacteria growing in it. So beware. The product packaging mentions normal separation but I don&#x27;t think that is what happened in this case.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It makes my beard a whole lot softer and it lays down instead of sticking out everywhere. I never have to worry about it getting on my phone or any thing like that even having a short beard, i think people that do are prob using way to much. It says that it&#x27;s unscented but to me it kind of has a waxy type of smell and wife says its almost like a mint smell but its very light. Not sure if i will go with this one again after this can is empty or with the original scented but i will def continue using the honest amish brand along with getting the stache wax. I highly recommend and they shipped super fast. i ordered on friday night and had it monday so thats awesome.</li>
    <li> The shipping was prompt. The article is very well contained and pleasantly presented. But, even though the balm is labelled &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; a slight greasy scent unfolds throughout the day. This can, however, be covered by using an additional touch of after shave. Unfortunately, this balm has not really managed to keep my beard totally in shape. At the moment, &amp;#34;Ungarische Bartwichse farblos&amp;#34; seems to be a more adequate choice, at least for me and my beard.Thus: three stars.</li>
    <li> This is FAR from &#x27;unscented&#x27;.  It smells like old twine or burlap that&#x27;s been sitting in the corner of the hay barn all winter.  I haven&#x27;t even been able to use it because when I tried to put it on the aroma was so intense it caused me to cough.  I only gave it 2 stars because it does work to &#x27;condition&#x27; your beard but the scent is just too intense to make it work for me.</li>
    <li> After only two weeks of use, I have been hit on by two dudes and a fat chick. What a great couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s moustache is so rough! Although it looks good, it hurts when he gives me a kiss. We were searching for something to make his moustache softer, and wow this really did the trick! It just takes a very small amount, and works really fast! I&#x27;m so glad we got it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Makes my beard really soft and shiny. Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> My bf didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! I just started using this product and so far I like it. Says unscented but has a slight scent. Goes away after a short duration. Made my ichiness go away. Make sure to figure out how much is good. About a finger tip is good fore without being to oily. Good product!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; is a bit of a reach. There&#x27;s something there, it&#x27;s impossible to pass by, and I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint what the smell is, but it is most definitely not unscented. It&#x27;s not strong, not like someone next to you could smell it or anything. But right under your nose you&#x27;re going to smell it for quite a while. However, it&#x27;s NOT a bad smell. Just not something I would choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, once you&#x27;ve used this in your BEARD (not the stubble people are passing as beards lately, I have facial hair in excess of six inches) a few times it really works wonders. My skin is healthy, beard feels great, and it&#x27;s much easier to coerce your beard into the position you&#x27;d like it naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: A little goes a long way. Once you mix this up in your hand it may look or even feel like it&#x27;s all gone, but trust me it&#x27;s there. I personally will use it in the shower before I get out, wet my beard, then work it in and even into your roots/skin. Once I get out of the shower I&#x27;ll pat dry then immediately comb any knots out and follow up with finer brushes for shaping. Leave yourself semi-damp and allow to air dry the rest of the way. Try to keep your hands out of your beard once you notice how great it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works as described. I will order again, but only 4 stars because I see it as a bit overpriced for the amount.</li>
    <li> my son loved this! He is a hunter so the unscented part was a must and it did the trick last year. When he shaved his beared we gave it to a friend who had a very unruly beard and it calmed it down right quick. Good product from a very good company.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from there website before they where on amazon. It&#x27;s perfect. It makes the beard nice and soft and makes the sides of the beard tone does real nice. There product and packaging is awesome. I am addicted to using this product.</li>
    <li> Pros: Makes my beard softer and gives it a shiny, healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The product is supposed to be unscented, but it does have a slight scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself consists of little soft grains that you rub into your beard. However, two things happen if you don&#x27;t adequately massage them in. First, your beard stays really oily, which easily transfers to your hands if you touch it. Second, you can have various little grains stuck in your beard for the rest of the day, or until you catch them in the mirror and rub them in. This can be really embarrassing to later to realize that you&#x27;ve had stuff in your beard while talking to people.</li>
    <li> Good for moisturizing your beard..</li>
    <li> It works but I didn&#x27;t like the smell. As far as fragrance free, well if that means you get it just the way it comes then it smells pretty awful. If its suppose to not have a smell at all, then it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Excellent beard balm.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, seems a bit small, I only have a goatee so its not that big a deal for me but for someone with for say a full beard you would use a lot of this and it probably wouldnt last as long.  As others stated it does have a small too it, kinda hard to explain. Again with just a goatee I only can smell it for like maybe the first hour then it goes away and its not very strong the whole time I will just get whiffs of it. For someone with a mustache maybe they would smell it more...its not a deal breaker for me though. washer off your fingers well with water too. This is just a conditioner not for moulding anything, its not a wax if you didnt read that as well. AS far as the conditioning goes and making it softer...I think its does a little bit of that, its hard to tell and might actually be entirely in my head. This is why 4 stars. I would get it agian though, as it seeeems to do good putting it in my beard.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. But most important is that my wife is OK with the smell. You know: Happy wife, Happy life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm is all about softening your beard, improving the skin underneath, and making your beard more manageable. Take a little bit (experience will show you how much is enough) and rub it between your palms to liquefy it. Then rub it into your beard. (If your beard feels greasy, use a little less next time.) Brush it in to spread evenly and to dress your beard so it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be some left on your brush, so brush it into your hair for a more finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff like the rest of Honest Amish&#x27;s products. If fragrance isn&#x27;t an issue, consider their heavy-duty beard balm and waxes too.</li>
    <li> grainy to touch, melts easily with body heat.  I like their beard oil better.</li>
    <li> It works so much better than using hair conditioner on it.  My girlfriend says it is much softer. - product user is D. Claypool</li>
    <li> Not exactly fragrance free, but what fragrance there is isn&#x27;t unpleasant. But the product itself works fine. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for a man beast.</li>
    <li> I love it and it helps my beard very much.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent beard balm, appreciate an unscented version. Leaves beard incredibly soft and healthy, will continue to purchase beard products from this seller.&amp;#34;</li>
