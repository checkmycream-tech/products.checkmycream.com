<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It came two weeks early which is great, also the quality of the brushes are great!! So this is worth buying but it does have a weird nail polish smell but other than that it is amazing worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> missing a brush out of the set</li>
    <li> I have ordered these for a Christmas gift for a young girl who is just getting into make-up.  I obviously have not used them but from the look and feel of them they will be great brushes and I am tempted to order myself a set.  I was VERY surprised with the case they are in..it is very nice.  My only complaint is that the brushes do not have what they are to be used for on them and for someone who is not a professional such as myself that is something I like to have on each brush.  Also, there is a very strong &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell to the product that I am sure will fade with time!</li>
    <li> I like the kit but It was missing a bush when I recieved it!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it! Obsessed with brushes!</li>
    <li> Good quality soft brushes. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes before I bought them I read the reviews and I wanted to take a chance but they are really good products the brushes are also labeled which is hard to  find for that price. And the haven&#x27;t shed yer I use soap and water to soak them after 5uses</li>
    <li> They just came today so haven&#x27;t got a chance to use them yet but they feel VERY soft against the skin. They are gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but very dense and didn&#x27;t hold up all my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Got it really love the brushes</li>
    <li> So many choices of applicators!  Brushes don&#x27;t shed and I have used them daily.  There was a strong plastic smell when the product arrived but that went away after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Oh i saw some negative reviews about this and started regretting that i ordered it but hey, i could have not get anything better for especially people like who are beginners, i hv just started learning make up tutorials so this is great help, didn notice anything wrong with them, already washed them several times and used them several times! They are in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> Very Nice brush set!  LUV them!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter wanted this for her birthday. She was absolutely THRILLED! The brushes are really nice, and the carrying bag is too. Matter of fact my daughter in law and I want one now!</li>
    <li> Altogether great brush set for those just starting out. Some brushes pick up product better than others but i think theres a brush for just about everything in there so it does the job. Cute colors, i get so many compliments on it from clients.</li>
    <li> as soon as i open it there was a nasty smell,but i think airing them out will help that. they are very pretty and alot of brushes and yes some hairs come out but you get what u pay for. but over all its good.</li>
    <li> this set was a lot better than I expected, the brushes are soft &amp; they look exactly like the picture in person. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for myself. I was extremely excited to get them today. The brushes are very nice, very soft and very good quality. The case is nice material and I love the flap that keeps the brushes from coming into contact with anything when you put them away. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money so to find something so high quality for a low price is very nice. Thank you!</li>
    <li> S***tiest makeup brushes that I have ever used. They don&#x27;t pick up product very well.</li>
    <li> These brushes came a couple of weeks earlier than expected, which was great. And when I opened them, they did smell a little funky, therefore I gave them a wash with water and dishsoap. The smell disappeared easily after that, and I have to say the brushes are really soft and they are amazing quality. I use these on a daily basis and there has barely been any shedding. Recommend to anyone who loves makeup and wants to try something new. 10/10 brushes (:</li>
    <li> I got my brushes 3 weeks before they were supposed to come, so they ship fast. When I opened the package though, there was a slightly strong paint smell that made my head hurt, and I was missing a brush, but other then that, my brushes are great. My eyeshadow brushes had slight shedding, but once you removed them, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> cheap fell apart 1 week later</li>
    <li> I just loved them their so soft 😍💗</li>
    <li> My brushes just came in and I love it, its girly and super cute&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. EASY to maintain and clean. Very SOFT on my face. I love the pink case it came with because it&#x27;s easy to clean to. I love all the different sizes of brushes. If you buy this you won&#x27;t need any other set.</li>
    <li> Completely in love. Great beginners set. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t very good quality. The brushes were too flimsy to even apply makeup...</li>
    <li> So far so good brushes are very soft and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with it all next week for Valentine&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> Got these because they were cheap and I wanted to experiment with some different style brushes. Unfortunately, a bunch of them were not even usable because the bristles were falling out so badly, even when I tried fixing them by crimping the metal. There were a couple that were usable but obviously not very good quality. These would be OK in a pinch but I was very disappointed by the poor quality since I was already not expecting much at this price.</li>
    <li> Love these and use everyday!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are great and very soft. I love that they&#x27;re pink. The bag does smell like plastic, but not that bad. I still keep them in there. The only problems are that I got 3 of the same brush, and the brushes are irritating when you stipple. I like them and I would probably buy them again.</li>
    <li> some brushes are good quality some&#x27;s not very</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased</li>
    <li> Perff❤️❤️ just in love</li>
    <li> I love theses brushes! My roommate had bought a set and I decided I needed to have them!!! I probably won&#x27;t use all 24 of them but you never know. I like that they have what the brushes are for on the handle.</li>
    <li> A little smelly like the other reviews said but after washing them the smell was gone! They are soft and seem to be quality brushes.</li>
    <li> The only thing i see wrong at this point is the loss of bristles on a few of the brushes...and i wish there was a kabuki brush. Otherwise i am happy with these.</li>
    <li> These brushes are freaking amazing and easy to clean. The brush hair doesn&#x27;t shed at all and it sooooo soft. The big fan brushes is my favorite it huge, soft just amazing for the price and super cute.if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this DO IT!</li>
    <li> These Brushes Are Amazing They Are Very Soft, Very Pretty, And Great Quality They Arrived On Time As Well, Ummm Pretty Much Everything Was In Great Condition When Received I Would Definitely Recommend These!!! I Really Enjoy Using Them</li>
    <li> Bought these for my teen daughter.  She is very impressed.  She watches a lot of youtube to keep up with all the beauty trends and really likes these.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my sister and she flipped out I mean she went wild.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and so nice quality. The wrap has a plasticy smell but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. I washed the brushes and they didnt shed at all. the handles and decent length so it&#x27;s easy to use. I&#x27;ve  had them for a couple months and they are still in great condition.  EDIT: Had them for over a year and they are still in great condition, and not shedding</li>
    <li> Absoluetly PERFECT! im so happy! theyre so soft, amazing quality, took a while to come but definitly worth the wait! some of the handles come off from the brish part but some super glue fixes it right up! honestly the best thing ive ever bought online, im so happy! can i give it 6 stars?!</li>
    <li> I got these when expected and I love them oh so much. I&#x27;ve been wanting a nice set of makeup brushes for a few years now and I finally found a reasonably priced set and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They&#x27;re super soft and the case is absolutely adorable. I have been using these brushes non stop and they haven&#x27;t shed once surprisingly. I definitely recommend to any potential buyers.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for someone starting out in makeup. Got these for my younger sister and she adores them.</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes, their easy to wash as well. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great price and the brushes don&#x27;t shed. Totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are too soft and don&#x27;t apply makeup well. The item also took long too ship. The carrying case is cute but I have a lot of cute brushes that I cannot use.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft i like them i jad to wash them when i first got them after that they were good</li>
    <li> I bought for my 9 years step-daughter. She is happy! If i would buy for myself ill buy more better.</li>
    <li> Our daughter is excited to use it!</li>
    <li> These brushes are everything!!!</li>
    <li> great brushes, soft and very cute. picks up makeup well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with them , especially as a new beginning makeup &amp;#34;artist&amp;#34; they&#x27;re soft and my fav color so yea I recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought these because of all of the great reviews.. But when I received mine, the stitches between the brushes in the pouch were coming out and when I was taking the plastic off of the brushes, the tops popped off</li>
    <li> Loved them! They are super soft. and apply makeup v smooth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really pick up the colors well but does an ok job for blending out the colors you apply on your crease of the eye.</li>
    <li> Absolutely obsessed with this set! The brushes are super soft, cute, and easy to travel with! Im definitely gonna be buying more soon(:</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes! They are soft and blend wonderfully. But the black part of them detached from the handle and I had to tape them back on! But other than that, they are great!</li>
    <li> Super cute set!! Worth the purchase, has interesting smell but it goes away after 2 days! But totally worth it, came in time for shipping! (Some of the brushes may have make up on them cause I did use them before I took the picture)</li>
    <li> Considering how inexpensive these brushes were, they were very good quality! I highly recommend them for beginners, because this little kit has everything you need to start. The bristles are soft and nice on the skin, all though some bristles do fall out over time. The only complaint I have is that some brushes don&#x27;t pick up the product as well as I would like them to, and some of the handles did fall off.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended great brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes don&#x27;t smell funny, I don&#x27;t have much need for all of them but they&#x27;re nice to have. Good quality for a beginner.</li>
    <li> The color is really pretty and the quality is amazing. I bought a second set for my mother because she liked it so much.</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> For the price of the brushes it&#x27;s a great deal! They&#x27;re pretty soft and I like how they turned out and the variety of them! It&#x27;s a great purchase</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase, I love them!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Brought these brushes as a gift and glad I did, they came fast-real fast,and way ahead of of the schedule time. I had plenty of time to gift wrap it and put it under the tree. These brushes were in excellent conditions, and the color {pink} is really fantastic. These brushes are wonderful for the beginner. Thank You.&amp;#34;  This gift was a hit, No complaints and as far as i no--there is no shedding. I will keep you posted if anything changes.  January 04, 2014</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes, especially for the price. A lot of people complained about a strong smell, but I never noticed anything weird. The head fell off one brush, but I just glued it back on. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> great buy.  wish i knew what each brush was good for.  One of the brushes broke on me :(</li>
    <li> LOVE. Soecially For Price!!!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t be afraid the the smell of chemicals disappears after airing. very good brushes</li>
    <li> Perfect, my sister loves it</li>
    <li> My mom got me this for Christmas and I absolutly loved it!! lately i have been having a problem with the top of the brushes falling off (coming unglued) . But they still wok fine! i think for the amount of money ($12.40) there great!! I us them all the time!</li>
    <li> They smelt likw paint for the first few hours but I let them air dry over night. I used them the next morning and they are unbelievability soft. They are very good quality and the package came before it said it would. I am very happy with this purchase and I would highly recommend them</li>
    <li> A very good product, fast delivery and product is as described. It has more value for its price. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! Perfect fit:)</li>
    <li> great!! I loved them!! It came faster then expected! Very soft. I use them everyday. Great quality for the price. I use these more then my $60 brush set! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes  I have ever had. I had them for TWO years and they are still alive and well and for a good price too!!😄</li>
    <li> quick delivery and nice prroduct</li>
    <li> 1) the brushes are pink!&lt;br /&gt;2) they are soooooo soft!&lt;br /&gt;3) they are great for the price&lt;br /&gt;4) exceed my expectations&lt;br /&gt;5) they are pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have some fall out of the bristles but that&#x27;s expected with any brush (even mac and sephora brushes). I&#x27;ve only had one where the stick and the tip came off but not too big of a deal since I never use it and a little glue will fix that. Other than that these brushes are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Too bad quality every time I use the brushes I find my face full of the brush hair and it hurts my eyes</li>
    <li> $12 for 24 pieces of makeup tools that is affordable, but please do not expect the quality. They are  not easy to apply because they can&#x27;t catch much power on the brushes. Some of them are works well like those small tools. However, with this price you just can&#x27;t complain. do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Came on time and is exactly what I expected. The best you&#x27;re gonna get for the price</li>
    <li> I received this product on the 14th of April, 2015, so it&#x27;s been a little over a month now. I was very skeptical about getting this because it was so cheap, but I&#x27;m glad I trusted myself &amp; bought them. It&#x27;s a GREAT investment if you don&#x27;t want to spend so much on brand name brushes. They pick up powder great, and blend in my liquids/creams well. They did have a strong scent of paint when I first got them but I let them air out overnight. I do recommend ALWAYS washing any of your brushes before using them on your face. And they are superrrrrrr soft, lol. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the hair falling out.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft, they pick up a decent amount of product and blend out well. The only issue. I have with these is that they shed like crazy. I&#x27;ll update my review after the shedding stops.</li>
    <li> worst purchase ever! Save your money!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good some are a little thicker than what I like but all in all good set</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Quality  is fare.</li>
    <li> This product is simply perfect... Who wouldn&#x27;t Love PINK Makeup Brushes and Case to match😍❤ ..It looks nicer in real tho</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before my product came, and I was expecting the worst thing that I have ever laid my eyes on. I was pleasantly surprise. Honestly, don&#x27;t even read the negative reviews. They just worried me. Instead, I received a pretty well made set of brushes. I will say, the brushes with the brown hair do shed a bit, but one you pull all the excess ones out, you should be alright. The bag did smell like plastic...because it is plastic. It didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s not extremely potent in the slightest. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend these brushes to anyone. However, these brushes WILL NOT work with cheap makeup. Because they are synthetic brushes, and cheap makeup is made from different materials than high quality makeup, the brushes do not pick the minerals up; just be careful with what you use them with.</li>
    <li> I love them. There soft and not small. But it took forever to receive.</li>
    <li> When the makeup brushes came in I was really excited. They are soft..  I LOVE these brushes !!!</li>
    <li> To be honest I thought this product would be poor quality and stuff but, literally I thinks its worth its price and its super soft and not to mention cute. I would buy this again if I have to rather than paying $30-50 makeup brush set. It has a smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Love it</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these brushes. They where delivered on time and in perfect shape. The pink case is cute and soft and is well made. The brushes are all in great shape I threw out all my old brushes (every single one) after I used these because these are so amazing. Everything was distributed evenly and at the exact amount I wanted. None of the hairs on the brushes came off. I will leave another review in a few weeks/months IF anything goes wrong but for now I couldnt be happier.</li>
    <li> Am so in love with them GREAT BUY 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Very good brushes for the price!  Ordered 2. Now I&#x27;m going to order a set for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Super soft, complete set once you get a kabuki brush. Love these, got 3 sets for nieces.</li>
    <li> awesome, maybe a little too soft but will do</li>
    <li> Love them all!!! Their are so many!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews.. And I have not had any bristles fall off on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Also, abundance of brushes that I do not know what to do with all of them.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected</li>
    <li> These are the cutest and they are soft to the skin. I love pink so this product fits me well. If your afraid of getting them dirty you should pick different one unless you enjoy the cleaning.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. Very cute, but super cheap (and not in a good way)</li>
    <li> At first when I saw these makeup brushes I was expecting them to be bad quality, because of how cheap they were but looking at earlier reviews I decided to buy them. As soon as I opened up the package I was in love! The Brussels were so soft and they were so cute! I highly recommend to get these brushes. There definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and great for my every day makeup application. The color is adorable as well! I love them!</li>
    <li> Lots of great brushes. A good mix of soft ones and stiff ones, and none seem to be wobbly on the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People aren&#x27;t exaggerating, the pouch is incredibly stinky at first. It spent a couple of days in my garage reconsidering its pungent ways and only when it sincerely promised to do better did I let it back in the house.</li>
    <li> Love these just received and they&#x27;re just as I expected!!:)</li>
    <li> After using these for about a month now I can say that these are some of the best brushes I have ever had. The roll-up case is kind of silly and doesn&#x27;t work great, but I just have them set up in a cup by my makeup station</li>
    <li> They shed a lot while applying makeup</li>
    <li> The brushes are cute and amazing. I love them! The only thing I&#x27;d reconsidered before buying them again is that they arent as stiff as I&#x27;d like them to be as they are a bit flimsy. Other than that the brushes are awesome~ would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes today when i opened the package it smelled like paint but it doesn&#x27;t matter for me cause i love the smell of paint! I just absolutely love these brushes they are beautiful and i will definitely buy from this person again</li>
    <li> Would buy them again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money</li>
    <li> 10 of them came broken, and the brush part is so cheap. Do not get them. There is so many better ones out there for a little more $$ but WAY better quality. And they took foreverrrrr to ship</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft &amp; so far have worked really well! (Had them for about 2 weeks already.) I&#x27;m aware that they won&#x27;t last an eternity but did get good quality for the price I paid. I&#x27;ll most likely order these again.</li>
    <li> Been having them for like a year I love them...has everything you need for any occasion</li>
    <li> loved it! I can&#x27;t wait to start using the brushes and it has all 24!</li>
    <li> The brushes were okay. Half of them are useless because the material were fake. Only a several eye make up brushes were real and usable. Don&#x27;t reccomend, you&#x27;re better off investing in some real brushes from sephora.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for great quality brushes. I love the color and they work great for all my brush needs. I&#x27;ve seen the same ones for double the price at stores.</li>
    <li> Very good for price it is shipping was fast but the brown brushes shed a but at first. They stop shedding after a little but</li>
    <li> I am literally in love with these brushes, they are perfect. they are everything I expected and more. 1. there is no shedding. 2. they apply perfectly. 3. they are unbelievably soft! I love them. one thing that I do dislike is that they are not labeled, that makes it hard to use the correct one for the process you are doing. but other than that you defiantly get your moneys worth!</li>
    <li> They didnt smell  and they are awsome</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with these brushes they are everything I hoped they&#x27;d be. Of course they&#x27;re not top notch but for their price they are decent quality. Great for beginners such as myself they also got here quicker than expected. Definitely pleased with them I would by them again if it where necessary.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it! Really soft and works great!</li>
    <li> I love them. They are very soft, and a right size. Just wish they had their names on them, but other than that they are prefect, and the best part they are pink!</li>
    <li> The smell was so bad I had to toss them. But the company did give me my money back. They were so cute, I wish I wasn&#x27;t so sensitive to strong odor.</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes but the smell like paint. I washed them right away and good as new. Great deal! Thanks</li>
    <li> Really great product at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Want an excellent brush set? One that is even better than it appears? Has softer brushes, each with its own protective sleeve, and impeccably packaged in its roll case? This is it. I am so glad I bought this brush set, it&#x27;s truly incredible! You will NOT regret it.I LOVE THIS SET!!!</li>
    <li> Great kit, everything it need for my makeup. Love the color and the carrier is nice.</li>
    <li> I think the big brushes are great! Two things I don&#x27;t like are: the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled for what they are supposed to be used for, and the smaller brush seem to be the exact same brush!</li>
    <li> I just got these make-up brushes in the mail today. As a beginning make-up artist on a budget, I was in dire need of brushes. I was reading reviews that the brushes wouldn&#x27;t pick up make-up, the bristles were scratchy, they fell apart easily, etc. I was pretty skeptical, but I saw more good reviews than bad and the brushes were inexpensive. So, I decided to purchase them. I met with a client before she had a photoshoot and thank golly I had my other make-up brushes with me because these were falling apart. The hairs were coming out mid-application and it was not picking eyeshadow up. It was so embarrassing!! These might be good if you&#x27;re 13 looking to play with make-up, but if you&#x27;re attempting to build a portfolio and go professional like myself, I would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> Great quality for price. But the case that the brushes came in smells really bad i threw it away. Stinks like plastic. Really smelly i didn&#x27;t like it. I washed the brushes too because while looking at the them i noticed some black hair in the individually packaged brushes. So i got scared and cleaned them before use.</li>
    <li> Took a while to receive, yet was very well worth it.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are falling of...</li>
    <li> At the beginning of the bag will smell bad taste, I want her to be better ventilation.It will not affect the make-up</li>
    <li> So I love these brushes although they smelled heavy of paint lacquer once aired out for about a day they were fine (:</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing quality and very soft, they arrived pretty fast and just are soooo cute. the pouch is very sturdy and they hairs don&#x27;t shed. THESE ARE AMAZING!!! &amp;#60;3 I recommend them to anyone whose starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> This item arrived the same day as mentioned in the offer.  My 14/15 year old daughter is in complete love with this pretty pink package.  We have no complaints.  I can&#x27;t believe I ordered it right before she left for school and it was at my home by 5 that evening when in fact it said at 8 pm.  A must have for anyone in LOVE WITH PINK.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get. The packaging does smell like strong paint fumes but the brushes are really pretty and soft</li>
    <li> It works well but i wish it had labels on which tool is used for what on your face. Thats all</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful set😊i love it brushes are nice and soft💄</li>
    <li> I own several sets of very expensive, high end cosmetic brushes and bought these to travel with. Now I use them as much as my high end brushes! I&#x27;ve also seen this exact set selling on other sites for much more then it&#x27;s priced here.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, especially for the price. Well worth the wait as it ships from China. Perfect for both travel and at-home application and gives almost identical results and feel of brushes costing 5x as much!</li>
    <li> Great for the price! Cannot go wrong love the colors! Very pretty and easy to carry around on the go</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes . they are beautiful . I agree with some of the comments about the smell , but hopefully that would ware off . the pink color is beautiful . my brushes have the labels on them . I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item and is worth the money .</li>
    <li> Great kit, soft brushes, everything it need for my makeup plus 10 more! Love the color too. The carrier is nice too</li>
    <li> I usually buy my makeup brushes one at a time from $7 to $15 each, these brushes are just as good quality. Soft easy to blend and it puts on makeup wonderfully. I&#x27;ve never thought I would have been this satisfied and the colors are gorgeous my mother wants these same exact brushes. I&#x27;d buy these exact ones again and again they don&#x27;t shed either. Tho I&#x27;ve never had that prob with any of my brushes. These are such a great price everyone loves my brushes. I would deff recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It. Is Worth the price</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft! I can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> The product was very cheap and did not hold the make-up well. I was expecting the brushes to be a little more soft.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful! My brushes arrived sooner then I was expecting , so happy about that!</li>
    <li> This is great brush set. Various sizes and brush textures. Different hairs used in the brushes as well. They shed just a little like any other brushes when you first get them. And such a wonderful price for the amount and quality. The only thing...I&#x27;ve noticed: a few brushes, after washing them several times, have weakened the glue progressively. Other than that, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes shed and some are scratchy. They are cheap and some come in handy at times and are nice to use. For some people just having them on display because of the color is what this would be perfect for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than I was thinking</li>
    <li> These are so cute and I have a huge variety for everyday use , not cheap at all</li>
    <li> This item arrived 15 days after shipment on the date I predicted. Once I opened the package there was a chemical plastic smell, but it was very short lived &amp; I assume it is from being shipped in a plastic mailing bag to Florida, where it has been nearly or one hundred degrees everyday. I was immediately surprised by how large the brushes were. I ordered the pink 24pk when they were at a special price. So I honestly expected less than what I received. I pulled out the largest brush to see if there would be an issue with lost hairs, but there was no issue. I was amazed at how soft they were. I used them yesterday for my entire makeup routine &amp; was a little disappointed that they were not labeled, &amp; that I had to look up a chart. But they did not streaks &amp; still did not loose hairs. Over all, this was my first experience with doing my make-up strictly with brushes &amp; for my first set I was highly satisfied. For anyone looking for a cheap way to do away with dirty sponges, I highly recommend these brushes if you are willing to wait. I honestly don&#x27;t understand why consumers have been complaining about these at all because they are well worth the purchase &amp; wait.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet. I saw some reviews that say the brushes smell really strong, but what smells is the plastic pouch they are in (&amp; it just smells like plastic). They do not smell bad whatsoever. The pink is so pretty I just love them.</li>
    <li> They are cute but came really dusty i dont know what kind of powder it had so i had to wash them all and smelled weird.</li>
    <li> These brushes are o so lovely I couldn&#x27;t wait until they came...The are soft and easy to use I recommend washing them before use cause of the processing that it had been through but these brushes are very pleasing and I absolutely love them very easy to take and go because of the bag it comes with.....The bag is very helpful I didn&#x27;t really have a smell so I used the bag right after I got my brushes washed,  its very useful.....will be using these on clients</li>
    <li> Hard smelling of paint when you first get the package and the brushes to shed a little. Other than that they are really great brushes.</li>
    <li> I received it to day and it was just amazing .... I love it !!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The price is sooo worth it for these brushes! I just got mine today and let me tell you that the shipment was FAST! The brushes themselves are very cute! However, the only problem for me was that the brushes weren&#x27;t labeled and it has a strong paint-like odor, but other than that, I loved it! I would definetely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I did not like these brushes. I&#x27;m a licensed makeup artist and I know a good brush. I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but I don&#x27;t want anyone else to be bamboozled by the other GOOD reviews! These brushes have cheap bristles that fall out and stick to your face while trying to apply makeup. They foundation brush didn&#x27;t blend foundation into skin well, and shadow brushes didn&#x27;t mesh colors on. They just dusted eyeshadow everywhere and caused a mess. Bottom line I was not pleased!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes to death. My aunt who does make up almost stole them from me. So I am definitely going to be getting her a set.</li>
    <li> Dang these brushes suck. Don&#x27;t buy they don&#x27;t hold make up and they are just for looks. Don&#x27;t buy!! I repeat don&#x27;t buy!! Such a waste of money...</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for its price. They are so soft &amp; I love the color!! When I first got them they did smell a little like paint but nothing to major. I just suggest you open up the kit &amp; let it sit to get rid of the smell. But, overall they are good brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, but when I received them the smell of paint was so strong. They still smell.</li>
    <li> There alright but for a few extra bucks I can get professional :/</li>
    <li> I love these brushes there so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;The color is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;There so soft and the little pouch is cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do recommend these for begginers</li>
    <li> Gorgeous brushes! I love the pink color and the brushes are nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing these brushes. Bought one for my mother in law and she absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I got these in just 3 days! Super fast! The quality is good for the price you&#x27;re paying. They do have a strong paint smell to them (mostly just the case), but I&#x27;m sure it will go away after a while. They don&#x27;t shred and I thought the handles were plastic, but it&#x27;s wood :). Can&#x27;t wait to use them!&lt;br /&gt;***Edited to add that the bigger brushes have a protective case over them. I&#x27;m just in love with this set! Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Loved them great price and great quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! The brushes are beyond soft and the pictures don&#x27;t do the colors justice! They&#x27;re so much fun. Other reviews I read stated there was a plastic smell so when I first opened my set I smelled it and there was barley anything. It smelled vaguely of plastic only when I shoved my nose in it. However I didn&#x27;t clean the carrier and by the second day I couldn&#x27;t smell anything even when I shoved it in my face. Keep in mind that these brushes aren&#x27;t MAC quality but they are still great especially considering the fact that you paid around $12 for 24 tools!!!</li>
    <li> They where not what i was expecting. But again for the price  their ok.</li>
    <li> I just got these today, and they weren&#x27;t supposed to be in for 2 more weeks. They&#x27;re all very nice with their own covers and a nice case to come in. I&#x27;m really looking forward to using them.</li>
    <li> Many different brushes to choose from, look beautiful, although when I started using them the hairs fall out a bunch at a time and go all over my face and eyes..</li>
    <li> love my brushes. my package arrived in my mailbox couldnt wait to open it up and start my makeup process</li>
    <li> They are amazing I get them so fast</li>
    <li> I was expecting better because the brushes are good just really soft I have to pass the brush many times on the blush to pick up the product when using them for the first time the brushes would leave senteric hair . I had to wash then 2 times so they wouldn&#x27;t leave so much hair behind when putting product on . If I knew I would of choose something else .</li>
    <li> I love them..super girly..yes a small smell but nothing to majorly complain about...one of my brushes did come with a black flim over the bristles but once they were all clean it went away..they hold up well and i recieved them in a timely manner..so far so good</li>
    <li> they smelled at first and one brush has no bristles but all and all not bad</li>
    <li> My Brushes Came Today!! I&#x27;m Using My Husbands Account To Make My Purchases, (forgot my password) But My First Initial Response Was OMG!! There So CUTE And Pleasantly Soft. There&#x27;s Only Four Things I Didn&#x27;t Like  1. No Labels On The Brushes.....Luckily I Know What Brushes To Use For Face, Eyes And Lips. 2. There&#x27;s A Slight Smell From The Bag Which I&#x27;m Sure Antibacterial Soap And Lysol Will Take Care Of. And 3. There&#x27;s Powder/Dust Residue On The Brushes, Again Antibacterial Soap, Deep Conditioning And  91% Alcohol With Do The Job For Sanitized And Sterile Brushes. 4. No Liquid Foundation Brushes Included In The Set. But Other Than That I Love Them! I Will Update My Review On My Take On The Brushes Once I&#x27;ve Used Them..... So Far I&#x27;m Pretty Satisfied With My Purchase. I&#x27;m Super Excited To Clean-Santize-Dry(air dry) Then Use Them. I&#x27;m In Love Thus Far.&lt;br /&gt;~Lyisha Lady Duke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, I&#x27;ve Love This Set! I Use Them Each Time I&#x27;m Wearing Make-up, All The Brushes Are Excellent, Pretty Good Deal For The Price If You Ask Me, The Face Brushes Picks Up And Deposits Powder Products Really Well. I Personally Would Have Loved To Had At Least Two Foundation Brushes Like A FlatTop &amp; Rounded Kabuki Brush Included In This Set..... But, I Ordered Them....Super Excited To Get Them! The Eye Brushes Are My Favorite! The Set Has Everything You Need To Do Your Eyes!! The Lips Brushes Are Cute And The Tools, Like The Eyebrow\ Eyelash Brushe, Comb, Smudger Are Good To Use:-)</li>
    <li> Super soft and work really well!</li>
    <li> Love em superr💚💚 its so soft..cant wait to try em all lol</li>
    <li> The shipping &amp; service were excellent.  The brushes are not very good quality but I am picky and it was a low price.</li>
    <li> Received these brushes today and they r super soft. Love the quality! However I did notice the scent everyone was complaining abt. Hope it&#x27;s away with washing</li>
    <li> I knew before hand that the case had a paint smell from reading reviews before purchasing so I washed them twice before using them and trashed the case.  All of the brushes work well besides the brown ones, they started to shed so I stopped using them.  It looks like the brushes don&#x27;t pick up eye shadow but it really does (you&#x27;ll notice when you put it on).  The price is really good too compared to others that I looked at. Oh and they&#x27;re pretty soft too!</li>
    <li> I love it ;) the brushes are soft best shopping so far :) I love it def worth it.. Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I love it !!! Every brush of interest was included and the pink is my favorite color!!!</li>
    <li> My girl friend loves these and they seem to hold up to everyday use.</li>
    <li> These came in about 3 weeks early which is awesome!! It did have a plastic smell to it so i washed all the brushes, they are VERY soft, great for the price!</li>
    <li> They are good brushes for what they cost. I wish they had more firm bristles but I can&#x27;t really be that picky</li>
    <li> Eh, these are cheap. You get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re just dabbling in beauty, then sure, they&#x27;er ok. If you&#x27;re a seasoned makeup enthusiast, these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, gets the job done and they and the case are pretty.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It does have a bit of a smell but the brushes are AMAZING and the color is awesome. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I would have gave it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for two brushes the hair fell off on its own..</li>
    <li> i got these brushes on time the are sooo soft great quality very stirdy i would deff recomend these for beginners deff worth i cleaned them right after getting them and no shedding so yeah thumbs up</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves the Brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are great they have no fall out bristles which I love. They are very sturdy and great quality. I&#x27;ve had them for a couple months and haven&#x27;t stopped using them since I received them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the brushes. So many of them. They each have names on them also which is helpful. Only reason I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars is because today I wanted to wash my brushes. So what I normally do is put them in a cup of warm water and soap to get the makeup off. Normally works fine and they&#x27;re clean. Well not with these. The wood cracked on all of them and I now have to tape them all up and it&#x27;s a pain. They are really good brushes but cleaning them is not fun.</li>
    <li> The bigger brushes pick up hardly any product .. But I love the smaller ones for , concealer and eyeshadow .</li>
    <li> Super amazing, super good quality, exactly like the picture. SOOOOO worth it!!</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic case, but the brushes are nice and don&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> Great.the only thing that I am not satisfied is  the bad smell</li>
    <li> These are some great brushes :) great for blending and the hair does not fall out!!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and packing was good. I would buy these babies again! Great price&lt;br /&gt;also and their are so pretty.</li>
    <li> OMG!! These brushes are AWESOME!! They&#x27;re SO good for such a cheap price!!! The bristles are very soft .Every single brush is on point, definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> They smell intoxicating and weird. Thought the would&#x27;ve smell better after hours of let them get some fresh. They smelled okay but after I wrapped them back up and was ready to use them. They smelled weird again. So I seperated the brush from the bag and came to realize after giving it some fresh air for the second that it was in fact the case ONLY and not the brushes. I wiped down the case and it seems to be okay only after I let it air for a week and a half. but I have got to admit I do love them. The brushes but the case just smells wierd. If you&#x27;re a beginner beauty specialist I would recommend. For professional I would also recommend, if you can be gentle enough. I have had them for a while and not much shedding so far only is that they aren&#x27;t as fluffy or sturdy as those extremely expensive but good brushes but just as good. Just get rid of the smell and they are A-okay. But why four stars? The smell is a bother to me and despite my allergies I never sneeze when using them. And they aren&#x27;t as fluffy when I compare them to my other brushes but really and truly for the price they are good and better than one big name&lt;br /&gt;brand cheaply made makeup brushes kit. Everyone knows the name: E.L.F. I always have to buy their brushes seperate  to get my money worth and have glue around to stick the brushes back when they come or break apart.</li>
    <li> I rate them 4 because they arent amazing but they are amazing for their price. You get what you pay for. I really recomend these for a begginner. Very true to their color and ship cery fast but have an awful plastic smell at first. Also my brush heads kept falling off the stick so that was a bummer. Over all liked them</li>
    <li> Pretty and seem to be high quality</li>
    <li> I love them there so soft and cute oh baby oil is a way to clean them too</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes today they came very fast ordered them Thursday or Friday and got them today Wednesday. ... they do smell a little but its not horrible have not used yet though they are the firmer brushes (not a problem but letting you kno)  the darker brushes are soft thats the difference I do wish they had what they are used for on them but mayb with a small sharpie I can mark them!!  Ill b back and let you kno how they work.....</li>
    <li> They were great but not too great!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but the brown ones are a bit rough and there&#x27;s lots of fall out</li>
    <li> I really really like these brushes. I only had 2 shed, and for the price, I didn&#x27;t mind at all. They are the brown-haired brushes, so be aware, those shed, for me at least. The one with the pink hairs, or pink and white hairs, are so soft and apply great to the skin and eyes. I recommend this purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes came in the mail the day after I ordered them. The brushes are super soft on my skin and apply the make up evenly. The only draw back to this product is the fact that the case reeks! Though I had prior knowledge to this before I made my purchase, so that had no impact on my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are super soft, convenient to use, and arrived in a timely manner--which was appreciated!</li>
    <li> I love it. It came when it was supposed to and the brushes are really nice.</li>
    <li> Save your money- i cleaned these brushes ONCE amd they fell apart and are unusable. The first couple uses were okay but you can tell the quality is very cheap. The bog powder brushes are ok but dont expect to be applying any type of cream or liquid with any of the brushes. The brushes dodnt even last 2 months. Garbage. And when i contacted the seller they tried to get me to buy another ser by offering me 20 percent off. WHY would i want to waste any more money on these cheap brushes.!!</li>
    <li> Gave them to my girlfriend she loved it</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great product. It arrived on time and I use the brushes on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Everything was great except one thing. Two of the brushes shed. The bristles were literally falling out.  Other than that, they came a week early and they work perfectly. I love my brushes.</li>
    <li> I got this on my boyfriend&#x27;s account for the fast shipping I was worried because the reviews all said it smelled very strongly like plastic and one had to throw the bag away. But unless you have it up to your face you can&#x27;t smell the plastic and the brushes don&#x27;t smell at all they are soft and just what I wanted. But four are brown not pink, one came off the handle but I easily put it back and it hasn&#x27;t  came off again even when I pulled it out by the top, and one brush is a little smashed. But non of this made me think it needed a lower rating then five. all the brushes are there they cam fast and are just perfect. I highly recommend this and it&#x27;s worth the extra dollar to get it from amazon.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible uuugh and the brushes are not that bad but they are not great either</li>
    <li> Super soft! Idk what all these people are talking about but mine don&#x27;t smell at all! Great brushes.</li>
    <li> They shed too much.  Cheap looking pink trash.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very nice and they got here very fast!</li>
    <li> They came really quick but they are poor quality ,come apart</li>
    <li> I fell inlove with this pallet , blends really well but once u get it it smells like spray paint but it fades away</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and that is what I got</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooooooooo soft and the hairs of the brushes don&#x27;t really come out.</li>
    <li> Altough it did smell like plastic , I washed them and the smell went away. Soft brushes. It was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as described! thanks!!</li>
    <li> I was missing a few brushes and they also break easily</li>
    <li> These brushes a re good. No shedding and I&#x27;ve washed them several times no problems. The face brushes could be firmer for my liking they are a bit soft to pick up product but that&#x27;s just my preference. A good buy for anyone on a budget.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. I do my makeup every day, but I&#x27;m no professional. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out, cute color. Everything was exactly as described. Only reason it didn&#x27;t get all 5 stars is because of the extremely bad rubber/plastic smell on some of the brushes and the carrying case.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are a great quality for the price makes you want to play with your makeup and experiment with color and technique.</li>
    <li> This is a great set to use for your make up--all materials are good and definitely quality. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Incredibly soft and plush brushes. Yeah the bag stinks, so what. Throw it away. Great quality for a set that&#x27;s so affordable. Who doesn&#x27;t love pink?</li>
    <li> Too soft and the silver part comes off too easy had to hot clue some</li>
    <li> Great for the price, I did wait about a month for shipping. The brushes work very well and are soft, great quality. You get over 20 brushes, I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely pleased by the quality of these brushes. I give them 5 stars. They are super soft, good quality leather case and i love the color! I&#x27;ve read some reviews about the smell which is not even that strong to be honest it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I must say it is exactly what you see in the picture and for this price it is a good deal. MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I placed my order on the 27th and it is now the 31st and I received my set. I am very pleased with the set, the brushes are SOO SOFT!! I read through the other reviews before ordering and noticed some people mentioned a smell. The &#x27;smell&#x27; is NOT as strong as some people were saying, I had to put the wrap they come in directly to my nose to smell it, and the smell was still faint. Perhaps the sellers came up with a solution to the issue. I am satisfied with this set. I was brushing the tools on the back of my hand and running my fingers through them to see if there was any shedding, and I had absolutely no shedding. This set comes with just about everything an everyday person would need. Although, the brushes are not labeled, so you will have to know what you&#x27;re doing. If you look in the description of this product on this website, they do list each brush. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody who is new to makeup or is just trying to find a set for everyday makeup. You definitely get the bang for your buck with this product!</li>
    <li> Theses are amazing i was not sure if they would be good enough for me but for the price i thought whats the risk......well they are great. The only con is the smell of them at first, but it goes away.</li>
    <li> Item arrived way faster then anticipated.  Brushes are slightly slender than I expected but still a great item for the price.</li>
    <li> Loved them!!! Great for the price!!</li>
    <li> More than I expected.</li>
    <li> Really great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Very cute, just wish the brushes has lables. I love them. Great brush set.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They make it so easy to achieve the looks I want.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister as a present when it arrived I was so impressed I went back on and ordered another one for myself 😊</li>
    <li> I love it. So worth it.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great! They arrived faster than i expected. I really like how soft they are and how great they work. They don&#x27;t fall apart when cleaning and the case is of good quality too. Over all Im very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love love these brushes!!!!!. They smelled like paint when i received them but i just washed them.:) such a great deal!! love the Angled eyebrow brush!👍</li>
    <li> I love my brushes and the color is beautiful</li>
    <li> Very nice set, good quality!</li>
    <li> Just received my brushes today and I was very excited!! They took about 2 weeks to arrive. Initially, I love the brushes...they are soft and nicely colored plus the range of brushes is quite good. The brown brushes are super soft and they are the ideal blending brushes!! The pink/white brushes are nice, some are very similar to one another and all of them are flat and I did have some pretty serious shedding from one (but there&#x27;s another just like it!) but after it lost some bristles, no more have fallen out. The face brushes are great! Super soft and you get a brush for everything! I like the added smudger, spoolie and comb. The cons are that the one brush did have a considerable amount of bristle loss and there is an offensive odor. It&#x27;s just like a plastic smell but it&#x27;s not a pleasant one...washing the brushes rids them of the smell. The case is also smelly, I wiped it down with some rubbing alcohol and it diffused the smell. I think the positives far outweigh the negatives and at this price, they&#x27;re a great buy!!</li>
    <li> I literally just ran to the mailbox at 3am in the rain after I saw an email saying my brushes were delivered &amp; it was soooo worth it!! The brushes are beautiful &amp; soft! Mine don&#x27;t smell at all!</li>
    <li> Amazing makeup brush kit for the price! Some of the darker (brown tip) brushes have had issues shedding but the white ones have worked great! All in all its a great product and I love that I have somewhere to store them all.</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived very fast. I love the quality, the brushes are fantastic!! The bag it comes in does smell like nail polish but i washed it and the smell was gone. Im very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> they could of been better if the brush had what they were for on it....</li>
    <li> They are amazing! The picture doesn&#x27;t do them justice they are even cuter in person! I absolutely love these brushes! Defiantly recommend these to anybody!</li>
    <li> I am a teenage girl and love makeup but I obviously don&#x27;t have the kind of money to spend on expensive brushes. But these are incredible! They are super soft and the pink color is adorable! Many complained of the smell but all the brushes smell fine and the case only smells if you shove it up in your face. I only wish the brushes were labeled but other than that they are perfect!</li>
    <li> They are pretty nice and soft BUT the case smells like paint... And it gives me a headache. Overall the brushes are still pretty nice and stuff. Shipping was fast and they came in like 3 days💄</li>
    <li> In love with these brushes! I ordered them on Friday and got them on Monday, so very fast shipping. The case does smell like paint or (almost like a new pool when you get them,) but it is not that bad. They are extremely soft and they&#x27;re very pretty! The only thing I wish is that they had names, but no matter.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I almost purchased a brush set directly from Sephora but I found it a little too pricey. After reading the reviews for this set I decided to go for it. I am amazed at the quality for $13. The baby pink is so pretty. The brushes are very soft, yet sturdy, and did very well when I applied my make up. I actually got compliments on it at work! It does have a fresh paint smell to it, but it&#x27;s just the case and it&#x27;s not particularly strong (to me). The case, by the way, is nicely designed and has a little flap that covers your brush tips to keep them safe from damage. I like that you can tie it shut, too, because it looks like a little bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m 100% happy with this set. If you are looking for a quality brush set but don&#x27;t have the budget for MAC or Sephora brushes I would recommend you try this!</li>
    <li> The professional wool makeup brushes were exactly what I expected and arrived very quickly. I have no complaints with this product and I just love the pink.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great buy. I actually wanna order two more sets plus some as gifts. The quality is really great, they wash and dry beautifully. No shedding. Brushes have an expensive feel to it not to mention the colour is gorgeous and all the brushes you will ever need is in this little leather case! Buy it, dont think!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!! I order as gifts and everyone loved them...</li>
    <li> I just got my make up brush and I really like it, it&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s so soft</li>
    <li> Got here sooner than expected. Love how soft they are, just a couple of brushes cant be used the bristles came out, but for the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loved it I recommend</li>
    <li> Just got them in today &amp; my god I was so excited ! They are just as they are pictured! The bag smelt a bit but smells like brand new material ! Brushes are long &amp; steady . &amp; oh gosh so soft . Haven&#x27;t used them yet . but In all its better than I expected . 💁👍👍💕</li>
    <li> Love love love the color! The package smelled a little of plastic but it is bearable and will wear off over time, and the brushes do seem kind of cheap but for the price I payed they are a great deal!</li>
    <li> It was awesome loved them</li>
    <li> All the different shapes, styles, and colors of the brushes make it easy for me to do the right look I am trying for. I definitely love this set.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are very soft</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. One came broken in two pieces so I had to glue it back together :/</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes I won&#x27;t use. There is not a good blush brush.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! Wash them when you first get th while also letting the roll air out. Have used almost all of them!</li>
    <li> This brushes are amazing !!❤️ I love them so much and they package them very we&#x27;ll. there is no odor whats so ever and they are so soft ! I&#x27;m glad I pick these❤️</li>
    <li> I love it, it is very cute and the brushes are soft with your skin.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeee these brushes. They are great quality and I make use of most of the brushes on here. The downside was that the bag smelled really bad but after some days the smell went away by itself. Overall, Love these brushes so much and they are really pretty too. Awesome product for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing for the price ! My friend has $100 ones and mine are thicker and softer so she&#x27;s going to also buy some! The shipping was super fast got it in three days</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and the brushes are good</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft enough, but one of the fan brushes was packaged incorrectly so it is pretty much ruined. The handles aren&#x27;t great quality, but you get what you pay for. Otherwise they get the job done and are a nice color.</li>
    <li> These cosmetic brushes had iffy reviews and I have to admit I was very worried about the quality of these. When I opened them it did smell of chemicals, but as soon as I removed the brushes from the convenient little case they came in and found that it was the case that smelled not the brushes. After setting the case outside for a day, the smell really aired itself out and I didn&#x27;t smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves shed slightly at first but didn&#x27;t after the first day or so of use. I really love these brushes! I recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> These brushes make you feel like a professional and a model.  The brushes are so soft and they don&#x27;t fall out! There are so many different ones so they can help me with any look I feel!</li>
    <li> Soft and functional brushes for a steal of a price.</li>
    <li> They are awesome! Super soft and do exactly what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> A little too soft for me!</li>
    <li> There Reolly cheap plastic they suck</li>
    <li> Worth the purchase the brushes are soft just wash before use smells like nail polish</li>
    <li> Great kit for the price</li>
    <li> The brushes where pretty, came pretty fast  but a few of my brushes were broke . was kinda sad about that but other then that love them</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing!! I love them!!</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 they are wonderful it comes with different size of brushes and is good because you need the different to get to some smaller spots on face. Yes the plastic does smell but hey its gonna smeel because its plastic all plastic smell. Yes it did took forever to arrive but i dont comolain because the wait was worth it these brushes are beautiful</li>
    <li> my daughter loves ALL the brushes, so many to choose from. good quality.</li>
    <li> I LOVE. LOVE . LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!! When I opened the package they came in this super cute pink travel case. All of the brushes were properly wrapped and placed in order. My package arrived a week before scheduled time. I couldn&#x27;t have been more happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift for my niece, and now I want one.  Really soft.</li>
    <li> I was not very satisfied with the product I received, very poor quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone is saying they smell bad or something. It just smells like plastic and it really isn&#x27;t a strong smell... But i love these brushes! They are amazing and i love the colors too! They Are everything i expected!  And i would recommend this to anybody...</li>
    <li> Their not very good at all the do not pick up product at all the only one that is good is the flat one because I use it for glitter. They all fall apart and come undone DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE BUTING THEM FOR A YOUNGER KID LIKE 7 OR UNDER I&#x27;m 13 and they are very stupid I have to buy new ones now</li>
    <li> really great brushes I love them</li>
    <li> There was a brush missing from the set. It was a gift to my daughter, she waited a while and I didn&#x27;t want her to have to wait again, so I chose to just keep it with the missing brush. It would have been nice to have had the set! Oh well, sometimes we have to make a decision for the best outcome, and thats what I did! Other than that the quality was ok and the look was ok as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They&#x27;re soft &amp; don&#x27;t shed.very satisfied with these 😊👍Came in 3 weeks early as well ...Will definitely buy again .</li>
    <li> These arrived super early and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
    <li> Some brushes had hairs falling out and one was damaged but other than that they are decent quality. I use very high dollar products and the brushes worked well with them. They are very soft.</li>
    <li> for the Price very good!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Really soft.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect, product looked exactly like the picture.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t doubt them for one second. I bought these because a friend of mine has them, they are amazing. They don&#x27;t smell, they come Nicely packaged. The carrying case is in great condition. And THEY ARE LABLED. One side of the brush says &amp;#34;make up for you&amp;#34; and the other side has the actual name of the brush. These are great and super soft. They don&#x27;t feel cheap at all. Will buy again as gifts</li>
    <li> Very happy with them :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about brush quality as I am just a beginner, so I won&#x27;t go into detail about that, but I will say that I mainly bought this cause I needed powder brushes and eyeshadow brushes and this definitely delivers on both of those things! And for 24 brushes this is a great deal!!!! I also love that I ordered these Saturday night and they came the very next day Sunday evening!!!!!! Isn&#x27;t that amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Took a very long time to get here, but they are so nice ! They do have the smell of really strong paint but you just have to wash them with some brush cleaner !</li>
    <li> I just wish the bag wasn&#x27;t as crinkled but it&#x27;s all in all very nice</li>
    <li> Great variety.. A little stiff good beginner set</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soooo pretty!! It&#x27;s packed nicely and for the price You won&#x27;t find anything better! It arrived really fast and I will be ordering more!! For backstock incase they raise the price!!! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> These brushes do the job, however the make up does not hold as if you were buying a big brand set of brushes. They are all right for the price, the ones I think are the best are the ones with brown hair, the applicators, and the pink ones, then at the end the white ones are not my favorite but I use them to contour my face so they work well. They do not a kabuki brush, just the ones in the picture so I guess if you want a full set of brushes you need to buy it somewhere else. Overall they are perfect for the prize. The pink roller bag does smell like paint at the beginning, and it seems cheap but I have taken it with me to 5+ trips already, and it still looks like new. The paint smell went away after a night open.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes they came super fast and they were neatly packed. When I opened them they did have a smell to them but it was just the case. I pulled each brush out and pulled on the hairs and they did not shed at all even with me pulling on them I am very pleased with my purchase I recommend them to everyone thank u have a blessed day</li>
    <li> Just what I suspected.  The brushes are perfect and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I dont recommend these at all they suck the hair falls off their not glued on right...</li>
    <li> Excellent. Have been looking for a brush set for a while and these brushes are amazing quality everything you need to get a professional look.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes,i use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but thier soft &amp; true to advertisement. Some of the brushes feel similar to some of my MAC brushes! Also, I cleaned them &amp; there was no shedding. Thanks for providing a good product at a reasonable cost!</li>
    <li> When I first ordered these brushes, they somehow magically got lost in the mail. The mail carrier was zero help in locating my lost package. However, when I emailed the seller I was able to find my brushes through them, and the brushes were mailed to me again. I got my package less than a week after contacting the seller, which I thought was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves smelled a little funny when I opened them. A quick dip in some sanitizer has solved that problem though. I love these brushes for the price I payed. They&#x27;re not top notch, amazing performance brushes but they blend well and they&#x27;re very handy. My only serious complaint is on the handful of brown bristle brushes. The fluffly blending brushes, the angle fluffly brush, and the flattop fluffy brush all shed, horribly. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just access loose bristles that I can work away, but if I can&#x27;t get it to improve, the shedding is bad enough that I&#x27;ll have to buy replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars some of tips of brush are falling off will recommend</li>
    <li> The brushes were very soft on my face and my makeup rinsed off of them very well. The package came two weeks earlier than expectedly, and the only complaint is that the case smelled terrible. But after wiping the case and brushes with baby oil it smelled fine</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES. Best investment I&#x27;ve done! Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Alrighty, I just got my brushes, right when they said I would! I&#x27;m super excited to have them, I&#x27;ve needed a good set of brushes for a while now...&lt;br /&gt;They are right about the bag having a super alarming smell, but it&#x27;s more akin to nail polish remover than paint itself, and could probably use a few days to air out. For the larger brushes I recommend KEEPING THE STURDY PLASTIC THAT COVERS THE BRUSHES. It will protect the hairs. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, I&#x27;ll update or write another review when I do and add some pictures. The brushes are super soft, this being said, I hope they can withstand my merciless blending routine!!!</li>
    <li> i love this except one brush came missing that upset me i was lookin n looking so yea</li>
    <li> It arrived sooner than expected. I love the fussy pink brushes.</li>
    <li> I really liked the assortment of brushes but it would have been nice if they had something on the side of the brush for identification or to tell you it&#x27;s purpose.  Two of the brushes were broken.  My bag did not smell weird like the rest of the people are saying.  It just has a plastic smell.  Clean with cold water so the glue doesn&#x27;t come apart.  It did take awhile for them to get here. Overall they are ok for newbies or beginners you do get what you pay for.  The quality of the brushes is not that great.</li>
    <li> I like it just I would of like it better in black</li>
    <li> Nice selection of brushes, my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my makeup obsessed sister and she loved it.  The colors are vibrant and the brushes are very soft and well made.</li>
    <li> What a great pack of makeup brushes theses are &amp; it was so inexpensive. Thanks I needed these!👍</li>
    <li> To start my estimated delivery date was October 14th and my set came here 09/25/14 so that&#x27;s an automatic plus! I am excited to have this brush set it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is the strong smell the case hs and it transfers to the brushes, but with some dawn platinum that can be taken care of😄. The brushes seem sturdy well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. I love them and they work very well. I also love the color, because I am a pink fanatic.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how people DO LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this set on November 9, which is three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to get this finally, and the smell stank but it&#x27;s ok because I already knew that by reading some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;But when I checked the brown brushes, it was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The hair fell off sooooo bad. I rubbed brushes with my fingers, and the hair fell off endlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s really cheap but this is terrible. Well, there are just four brown ones and others are synthetic&lt;br /&gt;so if you only want to use synthetic ones, it would be okay but not good.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I waste my time and money as well. I&#x27;m gonna return this set.</li>
    <li> these brushes are great for beginers! right now i use these brushes for my clients. they seem to think they are soft and enjoy them alot. most of the natural brushes shed ALOT! yet the senthetic brushes don&#x27;t. there good but they dont pick up alot of product.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. some of the brushes are great some are crap. lots of shedding after initial wash. but for 24 pieces can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> the brush does work well at all went back to my old brushes</li>
    <li> While reading the reviews I was scared that the would come smelling weird but when I got them they did not have a weird smell. They are very nice and there&#x27;s a BIG variety. I am very happy and when I use them they are soft not harsh like other brushes. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pink think they come in although it is very portable. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Arrive amazingly fast and have had no fall out AT ALL. The brushes are perfect for the makeup I do which is dramatic cheer make up. Really recommend this product to everyone who needs brushes for cheap</li>
    <li> Love this set. The fan brushes were placed in a spot that it was folded so are deformed and frayed at delivery,  but that could of been just mine. On the brushes there was a few overly long hairs, but I just trimmed them up. Love this set. And can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> I really like the case and the varieties of the brushes.....I gave it three stars because all of the brown tip brushes that come with this all sheds....badly. some of the bristles got in my eye when I Applied eyeshadow on.</li>
    <li> Received my package in a timely manner. Love all my new 24 brushes!!!</li>
    <li> It was awesome but I got charged 34.00 for delivery when my item was only 13.00</li>
    <li> Came sooner than expected!! Yes it does have a plastic smell, but that wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me.</li>
    <li> These brushes were given to my daughter. She loves them and uses them everyday. It was a great price for 24 brushes and pink is just icing on the cake. They work very well and are holding up great. Great for the price when compared to other brands and the carrying case makes it easy to keep track of and keeps them safe.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE COSMETIC MAKEUP BRUSH SET KIT IT WORK GRATE AND LOOK GRATE!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I like the brushes pretty well. I will say that the eye shadow brushes don&#x27;t pick up and deliver pigment quite as well as I&#x27;d like, but requiring an extra pass or two to get the richness you want can also help prevent colour being to bold right away. The blush type brushes are the same. I was happy about it when shading and bronzing, but had to revert to my older blush brush for proper blushing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not bad enough to be unhappy with the brushes, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;d have taken into consideration had it been included in any of the reviews I&#x27;d read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cosmetologist/makeup artist</li>
    <li> I received these brushes today after a weather delay and they are exactly what I wanted! I read other reviews on here about brush fallout and missing brushes so I was worried about that however mine are perfect and sooo soft!</li>
    <li> Grear buy and nice quality product.  This is our 2nd purchase.</li>
    <li> Same as the pic...its kind of cheap material but don&#x27;t expect to much w tht price.. Good price n is not tht bad...worth it</li>
    <li> Great price. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure these are not of the highest quality, but they look great &amp; give you plenty of choices</li>
    <li> i love these brushes because they are so soft but they kinda smelled like plastic</li>
    <li> Very soft and good quality for the price. Would definitely reccommend this product!</li>
    <li> Ive had these brushes for months almost a year now and theyre still super soft and useable.</li>
    <li> LOVE my brushes. I&#x27;m happy with them and the price. I refuse to pay those ridiculous prices for some name band stuff. These work just as good. They arrived fast and I love the color too.</li>
    <li> Perfect! For The money and the amount you get this is great the handles of the brushes a very long it was a pleasant surprise I ordered a second set for Christmas gifts, they did however fall off the wooden handle - the brush from the handle. Literally all of them fell off but the brushes are great</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft! The bristles don&#x27;t shed super easily like mentioned in other reviews. There is however a slight paint odor but nothing to terrible. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The brushes were really soft and the holder it came in did have a fresh new paint smell but wore off after a day. I really recommend these brushes to anyone interested. Shipping came faster than expected!</li>
    <li> love it ordered it yesterday and came in today of course adding amazon prime . Good Brushes Good Quality !!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves them.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes!!!! Great for the price. I have had my set for a few months and use them very frequently, they are still great. The pink cover they come in do have a strong plastic smell but it doesnt really matter since the brushes are what you actually use on your face. I gave it 4 stars because one of the brushes is feeling a little loose but nothing to serious when it come off ill just glue it back.This are great for anyone and super cute!!!! Totally worth more than what there asking.</li>
    <li> a lot of the makeup gets caught on the brushes and is hard to get off, I also noticed they stain quite easily. But they are very soft and a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I love it! It does smells strong, but the brushes are very soft!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, got the brushes before I even knew it. The quality isn&#x27;t anything special. Disappointing actually. The brissels on the brushes come off all over your face and eyes when using them so your face ends up itchy until you get all the little brissels off. I do like the case and the fact that they are pink. I would recommend this product for kids who only use make up once in a blue moon.</li>
    <li> says it was delivered but never got anything. USPS tracking numbers contain 20 numbers the one they give you has 22 and when looking for it says not found. THE WORST SERVICE ! Save your money not worth it</li>
    <li> these brushes are great !! they are durable, the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out, and on the brush handle it tells you what that specific brush is used for ! highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Okay to start, some say there&#x27;s this HORRIFIC smell of plastic and paint or something of that sort. Well, to be honest, IT&#x27;S NOT THAT BAD. People are over reacting completely. Yes, when you open it it does smell. But it&#x27;s not to the point where you&#x27;ll faint or have to air it out forever (if you have a sensitive nose it may bother you, but not much). Some people also complained that they weren&#x27;t labeled. Mine came labeled, and they work great! I will not lie the pink brushes do not pick up product as well as the brown. But they still do their job and I&#x27;m happy with it all. The shipping was fast and everything came nicely wrapped up and nothing was missing or broken. Don&#x27;t get freaked out and back out of this deal because of some of the reviews. The buyer most likely was too aggressive with them. Ive had mine for over 3 months now and they&#x27;re still perfect! :) I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this product but it was simply a waste of money. The brushes are so loose and don&#x27;t hold the make up well. However, if you are barely learning the ways of using brushes and putting on make up then maybe this is an okay purchase. Pretty much don&#x27;t get these brushes instead waste a little  bit more money one other brushes. NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for in this case I think. The brushes are okay...They got here quickly but were clearly cheaply made. There was one stick with no actual brush head glued on, and several heads were loose. The brushes are soft but I didn&#x27;t think they picked up much of my powder products (I use MAC makeup mostly) so it took longer to get the job done. I don&#x27;t recommend these. The bamboo-handle EcoTools brushes are a bit more expensive, but I think they are a way better product.</li>
    <li> Perfection and i love it dearly</li>
    <li> Their ok not the best but i guess they work</li>
    <li> Love it! Only thing is on the first Use little hairs from the Brushes fell off.. So before you use it and get little hairs all over your face, better use a Shirt or Paper Towel and rub the brush in circles first</li>
    <li> The brushes are cool..but some shreds like crazy</li>
    <li> Love love love these!!</li>
    <li> I like the product soft brushes and everything (not the prickly type) which is good. The only thing tho I realized the blending brushes shed a bit, this is the first time i&#x27;ve experienced that but im hoping with future use it stops other than that im good :)</li>
    <li> I have maybe only used 1/2 of the brushes so far, but I think they are great!  The initial smell reminded of some big baby dolls I got years ago. Within a day the smell was gone. The brushes themselves do NOT smell!</li>
    <li> This is such a good product the brushes are so soft and the colour is beautiful and the brushes say what they are for just incase you dont know what they are for. People say they stink those people should shut up every brush in plastic will smell a bit but the smell goes away use your money they are worth it</li>
    <li> Seem great. Not cheap feeling. Bristles don&#x27;t pull out. Very soft. Rolled up case does distort the shape of bristles a though</li>
    <li> Daughter bought this for her makeup artistry. She loves it! Excellent brush set.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Great for makeup starters that want to practice more and for those that love great products that won&#x27;t break the bank!!</li>
    <li> Grand daughters love it.</li>
    <li> I just got the brushes today and they are so cute!!!! I love the pink and the case they came in was amazing, it was packed nicely and came early!!! I give it 4 stars because they do not have any labels however that can he fixed just googling &amp;#34;makeup brush guide&amp;#34;  also the new smell is still there but im sure it will gpoaway&lt;br /&gt;Great product i recomended this to my friends as well</li>
    <li> usually I&#x27;m skeptical about anything under $10 on Amazon but these brushes came very quickly and they feel very soft. there is a bit of an odor but nothing that cannot be handled with a good wash. I think they were a good purchase and I&#x27;m glad i bought them :)</li>
    <li> Not what I expected... Two broaches were broken and some of them have glue.</li>
    <li> Some came broken but overall good price for great brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes came a month early. When I opened my package you could smell paint, and it is very strong. After they aired out for a night they were fine. Only 4 of the brushes (the brown ones) are real hair. The rest are synthetic. Super soft, very little shedding. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it....I love this</li>
    <li> The best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used ! I got to admit I was worried 24 brushes under 20&amp;?! But once I got them there great! So so soft and better then name brand brushes I&#x27;ve ever used . On the plus side there pretty hehe there pink . And didn&#x27;t even take that long either like it said it would it&#x27;s a great wait epically for these brushes I&#x27;m very satisfied (:</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom and she loved it. Plus the bag they come in is perfect.</li>
    <li> be careful when washing they will break but other than that ilove these</li>
    <li> Brushes fall off their handles very easily. Two stars for the bright color.</li>
    <li> the smell is very strong, they arrived in 4 days, very soft, beautiful, good price but smell is very strong very intoxicating but I haven&#x27;t washed or used them yet so I will update once I do</li>
    <li> The hairs are already falling out and the brush handles came with a bad unfinished paint job. I guess I got what I paid for??</li>
    <li> A decent brush set! I wish there weren&#x27;t so many concealer brushes but.. meh. They do smell weird at first but It&#x27;s not that bad if you&#x27;re not a baby about minor things. It went away quickly. Super cute and great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice but they fell apart after a few times I used them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to someone That loves brushes. It&#x27;s such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Came way quicker than expected and the quality is great. I can&#x27;t get over how soft these brushes are! Definitely would suggest to anyone.</li>
    <li> Brushes smelled bad at first. But it can be fixed with soap and water. Good quality, for the price. You get what u pay for</li>
    <li> Love It,  worth the money exactly as shoon on picture</li>
    <li> Ok so I needed brushes but didn&#x27;t want to buy super expensive ones and theses are great quality for the price they have all the brushes u might think about needing they feel just like my Sephora brushes would repurchase anytime LOOOOVE these never buying another expensive one</li>
    <li> REALLY CHEAP, I was using a brush AND MIGHT I SAW VERY LIGHTLY, and it just fell apart</li>
    <li> I really like the Cosmetic Makeup Brush Set it looks nice and they are very soft.</li>
    <li> I really like it I just wish it had a label for each brush what it is used for</li>
    <li> They came in so early but then the brushes are not high quality. They are to soft that it won&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> The brushes are beautiful and I wouldn&#x27;t change anything about them besides I wish they were stiffer. Normally, it wouldn&#x27;t bother me but it doesn&#x27;t really pick up much of my powder foundation. If you are looking for a softer brush then this is your set! I love all the options with so many brushes though!</li>
    <li> Popped these babies out of the bag, did a quick washing and could not be more happy with this purchase.  Brushes can become terribly expensive and there are several brushes here that are better than brushes I have paid much more for.  There were a couple that arrived that the bristles were coming out from poor construction during the gluing process so I do have some concerns about the durability of the brushes but for the price, my expectations are low on how long they should last.</li>
    <li> These stink really bad comin out of the package...my shipping took FOREVER! Almost 2 weeks! Some of the hairs on the brushes were all squiggly and out of place so I had to cut them off...there was a white substance that was coming off the brushes it kinda looked like dust or powder..my first thought was hoping they weren&#x27;t used. Haven&#x27;t used them yet bc I&#x27;m gonna clean them up really good! But I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll like them.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the set of brushes!! They won&#x27;t last forever but then again nothing does these days!</li>
    <li> A bunch broke off when I used, but overall I loved...will be using superglue</li>
    <li> By far THE BEST BRUSHES !!! And the price is amazing !! A MUST BUY !!! :D</li>
    <li> Bag smells, but other then that great brushes</li>
    <li> Love them! would buy again</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes came broken..</li>
    <li> Brushes came quickly and in a lovely case. The larger brushes were protected with a plastic cover and the smaller brushes weren&#x27;t. It did not smell! The brushes are so soft and absolutely amazing. Perfect for every makeup look. I highly recommend this brush set! :)</li>
    <li> comes in an adorable holder, the brushes are adorable themselves and they all work great!</li>
    <li> My wife really loves the options that this pack gives.The case could stand to be a little better, but overall it&#x27;s about the brushes, and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> These are so soft and they didn&#x27;t fall apart at all! I love them</li>
    <li> So cute and has all brushes that i ever needed</li>
    <li> The recipient of this gift was very happy.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> initially loved it but brushes fell apart 4 months later.</li>
    <li> Great set, the brushes are sooooo soft I haven&#x27;t used them as well cuz I just received them but they&#x27;re really soft im happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> This brush set is horrible&lt;br /&gt;Honestly the minute when I first started using them the hairs from the brush fell off . the foundation brush feels like spikes on my face . the eyebrow  comb/ brush came off so easily I had to glue it back on.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend anyone using this , its just cheap feeling and the brushes do a mediocre job for makeup ... Sorry hun :/ its the truth&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying it SO Bad</li>
    <li> I just got it, its so perfect i really LOVE it</li>
    <li> Amazing!  It&#x27;s a must have in any girls collection !</li>
    <li> This broke really easy!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was wonderful, has a bit of a strong smell but for the price, its not bad.&lt;br /&gt;And the odor fades after you wash them and let them sit for a day.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes especially for the price!</li>
    <li> The case is very nice.  Brushes very cheaply made.  All of the hairs keep falling out which is really annoying.  Also despite the fact that so many brushes are included there are no rounded blender brushes for eyes which is disappointing.  A lot of the brushes included are repeats and unnecessary.  Bristles in some of the brushes are also not even at the end.  I Will probably be tossing most of the brushes but keeping the case.</li>
    <li> Verry fast shipping and love the brushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice but they keep falling apart.</li>
    <li> love it totally worth the cash</li>
    <li> Ordered these on Friday and received them on Monday. The brushes smell like plastic but not bad. The bristles on the brushes are super soft. I hadn&#x27;t used them yet and the down side is the brushes are not labeled. I will update after a few uses. For the price great brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful and is well priced. I love it! All the brushes are very soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> They came in very quickly! The brushes are in great shape. The only problem I had was that three or four of them shed a lot when I first used them and the spooly brush came out of the handle.</li>
    <li> I actually love these brushes!! They are very soft and blends perfectly, especially when doing makeup on my clients...</li>
    <li> So PINK and so AWESOME!</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes. I&#x27;ve used them about 5 times so far. No shedding. The smell like a strong paint or something when you open them. Let them lay open for a day or 2.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sooooo in love with these brushes...haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but working on it.  Ppl post about the brushes having a paint smell. Its not the brushes its the case it comes in but if u leave it open overnight the smell goes away. I love them, like someone else said I wish they had the names on them to the now what they are used for. But youtube teaches you alot...lop</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the brushes the hair falls off and even the brush itself falls apart</li>
    <li> One of the pieces was missing how can I get it</li>
    <li> I havent really used them i just got them today, but its supposed to be 24 pieces and i receved 23 im missing the big brush thats half pink &amp; white over all they feel not so great.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. When I first got them they smelled so bad. Almost like wet paint. Also the eyebrow brush (not the spooly) came off where the metal meets the wood. And I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you need heavy make up, these brushes are very light handed. I mean is it worth the money? That&#x27;s up to you and your bank account.</li>
    <li> I like them a lot. I am a new make up enthusiasts so this is the perfect started set for myself. I will say that I did air them out for 2 days to help get the packaging smell out. After that they were ready to use. I am super happy with the set and they look super cute in my glass mason jar holders</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes I ordered them on Monday and got them by Wednesday. I know many people said it had a smell, which it does but nothing serious. I had no shedding with these brushes before and after washing them. They are very soft against my face, and who doesn&#x27;t love pink the color is awesome. The case is great as well, for the smell I just whipped it with some baby soap the same i used to wash my brushes. I would strongly recommend these for people who are now starting out with make-up or looking for some good brushes at a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Great. Super soft brushes</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I have had no issues with it smelling or with bristles coming out at all. I am newer to makeup so the brushes not being labeled was kind of a bother, but nice set for the price.</li>
    <li> Only thing is that the bag came with a paint smell.</li>
    <li> Very great set of brushes</li>
    <li> This was a present for a friend and she loved it. Shipping was very fast (2 days without being an amazon Prime member)&lt;br /&gt;No smell, brushes were clean and ready to use. Of course, this product is not made for professionals.</li>
    <li> love the varity of the brushes</li>
    <li> Nice brushes but they reek of paint fumes at first.</li>
    <li> Basically they&#x27;re all concealer brushes</li>
    <li> Love These makeup brushes awesome quality !!!:) highly recommended</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my brushes they&#x27;re super soft and the color is beautiful!! The pink brush bag smelt like paint but nothing to worry about the smell faded away :) the make-up goes on so smoothly i love my BRUSHES!! 👍😀</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me as a christmas gift. But i find out there is a brush was taken out so i received a makeup brush set with only 23 pcs not 24 pcs ! This makes me angry.</li>
    <li> Love pink so I had to get it. The brushes are soft.</li>
    <li> My first set of brushes ever and they are amazing! I love them! It took 3 weeks to arrive I didn&#x27;t mind that. It did have a paint smell on them but i washed them and went away. So yea I love them!!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and I love the product! Great brushes at a great price! I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> The 6 color cosmetic was all broken but I go my money back immediately</li>
    <li> Love them!!! They&#x27;re so soft and my makeup goes on great!!! Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have to say, for begginers this is a great set!!! Unlike other reviews, my set didnt have a smell to it.. and its a pretty pink!!  the only bad thing I had to say was that one brush had alot of hair coming out while trying to do my makeup but eventually it stopped..deff worth it!!</li>
    <li> Im using my bf account and I ordered these 3 days ago along with other things and it arrived way before the supposed shipping date!! They are so beautiful and have nice bristols . only bad thingwas that&#x27;s  ythe big fan brush had like some glue on it but it was easily removed</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful. There so soft and they don&#x27;t shed on you when applying your make up. I got them for Christmas and I love them there amazing. Been using them every sense</li>
    <li> Based on the price I paid I was not expecting an exceptional product however I am quite shocked at the low quality of this purchase.  It was not properly packed for shipping so by the time it arrived the brush/comb for the eyebrows was broken. Several if the brushes were dishevelled.  I was forewarned about the rancid chemical scent from other reviewers.  Experiencing it personally was quite unplesant.  I would not purchase this product again neither would I recommend it to anyone. If you are looking for low cost but good makeup brushes consider the goat and badger brush set by SHANY. It is a much better product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately 😕 some of the hairs on the brush do fall off. I had the privilege of having some inside my eye👀 I don&#x27;t use all the brushes just some.</li>
    <li> Omg I got my brushes 3 days earlier and I love them they didn&#x27;t have a smell like everyone claims but I still wash them since there going on my face... the only down fall is there not label since I&#x27;m just starting out with makeup so I b went on YouTube so people can describe them more but other then that there awesome n super cute 😀</li>
    <li> Fast shipper great product!</li>
    <li> the bristles fall out on the brown brush tips and the sticks fall off i had to glue them.</li>
    <li> Most of the brushes are falling apart, and I have only had them since October. I really wanted to love these, and at first I did. It took about a month for them to start falling apart. I am super bummed that 8 brushes have broken thus far, I will include a photo of the four that I have yet to throw away yet. I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be the best brushes in the world, but I did expect them to last at least a year, not just a few months. I am very very disappointed with these.</li>
    <li> It a good buy but although some of the brushes are brown and and brush heads fell of the handles.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Perfect. Thank you</li>
    <li> Not the ones from the picture but very similar. They had a weird smell when the package arrive but they&#x27;re ok for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes r wonderful for such a low cost worth the purchase</li>
</ol>
