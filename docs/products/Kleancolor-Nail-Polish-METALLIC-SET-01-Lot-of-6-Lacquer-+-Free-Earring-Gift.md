<li> It is true it can be hard to take off with regular nail polish remover</li>
<li> , I had to wear some strog red on top to forget about my ugly greed nails beacause of this.</li>
<li> Only down fall is the color stains your nails...</li>
<li> less then a week only issue was the green nail polished was not tightly closed when they shipped it so by the time it reached my mailbox</li>
<li> thats my only complaint.</li>
<li> Even when bottle is mixed the color pigment is fairly thin.</li>
<li> , I tried the green one and it lasted NOTHING,, then.</li>
<li> It was a mess!</li>
<li> , my nails stayed green for 4 days!</li>
<li> The smell is nauseating and the Polish is thick.</li>
<li> I would recommend maybe a clear base coat to try and avoid the nails from staining...</li>
<li> For the purposes of frequent use and water marbling, it is one of the worst you can use.</li>
<li> but it leaves a stain which looks ugly.</li>
<li> This nail polish is the worst.</li>

    <li> This product is true to much of it&#x27;s reviews. The smell is nauseating and the Polish is thick. For the purposes of frequent use and water marbling, it is one of the worst you can use.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it is good polish...since I haven&#x27;t used it yet...but the Colors are Stunning and Will be buying more</li>
    <li> Great colors, wish there were more.  Haven&#x27;t used them yet, I picked them up to go into a nail polish kit as a birthday gift for my daughter.  Hope she likes them as much as I did.  I also hope two coats will do the trick.  We&#x27;ll find out soon.</li>
    <li> The polish is beautiful and arrived super-dooper quick. I do plan on ordering more polish really, really soon! The seller responded immediately whenever I had a question. They&#x27;re very approachable. The polish was also packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> The colors stay so well, and I usually only have to put on one coat. They come off pretty easily too, even with cheap nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is the worst. I have ever seen!, I tried the green one and it lasted NOTHING,, then.
