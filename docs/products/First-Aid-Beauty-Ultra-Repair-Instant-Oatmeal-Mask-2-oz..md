      <li>It is really not that great.</li>
      <li>Smell is not bad.</li>
      <li>I put a generous amount on and it quickly sunk in, in my skin.</li>

      <li>However I do think it works fantastically and for me, it is worth the cost.</li>

      <li>Highly highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>What I love about this mask is that not only does it not aggravate my sensitive skin, but it actually soothes the dryness and pain from breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Some masks tend to dry while they are on your face and can be less than pleasant to wear, this is actually stays creamy while on your skin</li>
      <li>My skin feels nice and moisturized afterward but the effects don&#x27;t seem to last past a day.</li>
      <li>my boys have teenage acne, this is soothing to them and because of that they use it more often which has led to less breakouts.</li>
      <li>My skin is left looking calm and even in tone the next morning.</li>
      <li>So I ordered some FAB URC and within a day it started to sooth the PD, and within a week it started to clear.</li>
      <li>Some complaint about the shunk of oatmeal in it, for my part, I love it.</li>
      <li>I wish the bottle was bigger, but really worth your money, especially if you have acne/</li>
      <li>I also use some Kiehl&#x27;s products (cucumber toner and the rare earth mask) but was curious to try out this RAB Oatmeal Mask.</li>
      <li>to&#x27;ve helped clear out a couple tiny acne dots at my chin.</li>
      <li>Aveda sells one but more for the body and did not want to risk making my face even worse</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly, and it ended up causing my face to feel really tight and to burn.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin and dry as well.</li>
      <li>(I am a vain, humble and not unattractive woman who typically has really nice skin, so this was extremely distressing for me).</li>
      <li>I needed a new face mask, because my skin was so dry!</li>

    <li> My skin feels nice and moisturized afterward but the effects don&#x27;t seem to last past a day. I&#x27;m not sure they were supposed to?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a few weeks and it is divine. Very gentle and hydrating -- it&#x27;s almost a little sad when it&#x27;s time to take it off. My skin is left looking calm and even in tone the next morning. If you are looking for a gentle, affordable mask, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the strength of a Paula Begoun review and the price here was half the cost elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it twice and found it to be unremarkable.  The oatmeal is not totally ground so you have to deal with chunks on your face.  It is heavy although you can apply it such that it is invisible and can be left on overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw no difference after using it.</li>
    <li> I needed a new face mask, because my skin was so dry! I read so much good things about this mask, so I wanted to try it, and it really worked on my skin! I put a generous amount on and it quickly sunk in, in my skin. I decided to sleep in it and the next morning when I washed it off my skin was so soft and doesn&#x27;t get so dry anymore</li>
    <li> I find it quite moisturizing, and my skin is brighter immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs fast, so really a first aid when your skin needs the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not sure about long term effects on skin since I only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and rinse away. Smell is not bad.</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  It really softenes and hydrates</li>
    <li> this mask is nice, it&#x27;s the reason I decided to buy the cleanser, eye cream, etc. except .. I hate those!</li>
    <li> I bought this mask because Paula Begoun says it has great contents, and also the price is much lower than comparable masks. I like it a lot, pleasant, smooth, smells nicely, my skin feels soft and hydrated</li>
    <li> Soothing on irritated skin.</li>
    <li> This actually irritated my face and caused a breakout, unfortunately. I followed the directions exactly, and it ended up causing my face to feel really tight and to burn. After using this mask, my face was hyper-sensitive for 2 days. Will be returning and will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> really works when I have some face problems.</li>
    <li> I found this mask on one of the beauty review blogs and it&#x27;s quite good. I find it moisturizing, but just not exactly sure if it provides a long term effect.</li>
    <li> I use the FAB Ultra Repair Cream. When I first discovered it it was in desperation as I was suffering a yucky perioral dermatitis and did not have health insurance to see a doctor. An internet search enlightened me to colloidal oatmeal --- which is used in Rx for perioral dermatitis. There&#x27;s few OTC lotions with colloidal oatmeal. Aveda sells one but more for the body and did not want to risk making my face even worse (I am a vain, humble and not unattractive woman who typically has really nice skin, so this was extremely distressing for me). So I ordered some FAB URC and within a day it started to sooth the PD, and within a week it started to clear. I now use URC every day as part of my skincare ritual. I also use some Kiehl&#x27;s products (cucumber toner and the rare earth mask) but was curious to try out this RAB Oatmeal Mask. After a shower I put it on my face and took a short nap. When I woke, it was mostly dry, though I shmeared on a good amount because I was having that sort of decadent day. I used a washcloth (the French le gant kind) to rub it off with warm water. Toner. URC to finish. My skin glowed and it seams to&#x27;ve helped clear out a couple tiny acne dots at my chin. This is a great product! Highly highly recommend this product. And the price is right.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at a make up store at the mall, price is similar but ordering through Amazon saved me a trip to the mall! And you can&#x27;t beat free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my boys have teenage acne, this is soothing to them and because of that they use it more often which has led to less breakouts. Every product in this line is wonderful!</li>
    <li> It is not as what other people describe it. It is really not that great. Also, this tube is so small and I have to use a lot every time.</li>
    <li> it hydrates your skin and makes it feel good</li>
    <li> it really good for me!t is cheap ,but better than those expensive ones !after it my face fell wet ,smooth!</li>
    <li> I love it. I have a very sensitive skin and dry as well. This mask feel so good! It does really moisturized. Some complaint about the shunk of oatmeal in it, for my part, I love it. Like the smell of the oatmeal, love everything about it and it does not erritated my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself when my skin was very sensitive and easy to have acnes. It works fast,gentle and effective to calm down my skin. My bf even grabbed it from me!lol! I would definitely buy it again, but one problem is that it&#x27;s an add-on product, what if I have nothing else to purchase?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of face masks, but after trying this one, I will say I love this product. Prior to using my skin was red and uneven. This oatmeal mask perked my skin right up. It soothed the redness down and instantly evened out my skin tone. It also moisturized my skin really well too.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is both painfully dry and acne prone.  What I love about this mask is that not only does it not aggravate my sensitive skin, but it actually soothes the dryness and pain from breakouts.  My skin does feel noticeably better after using it.  And the feeling of wearing the mask itself is actually pleasant.  Some masks tend to dry while they are on your face and can be less than pleasant to wear, this is actually stays creamy while on your skin so I don&#x27;t have that urge to wash it off as quickly as possible.  Of course it&#x27;s important to keep in mind this isn&#x27;t a miracle mask and you do need to use it regularly to continue to see results (I use about twice a week) which can add up.  However I do think it works fantastically and for me, it is worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and was looking for a good oatmeal mask (don&#x27;t have time to always make my own). Excellent mask, my skin has never felt smoother! I wish the bottle was bigger, but really worth your money, especially if you have acne/are using acne medication and want to even out your skin</li>
