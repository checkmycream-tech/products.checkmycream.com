      <li>AND YOU KNOW BETTER...</li>
      <li>AND ITS NOT BECAUSE 9M2 JUST HAVE MORE NEEDLES</li>
      <li>I ordered more not monster point at all</li>
      <li>I was not at all satisfied with this product/purchase</li>
      <li>What am I supposed to do with that many of one size when I JUST ran out of all my shading needles expecting this to have shading needles in them??</li>
      <li>will be ordering more from them for sure</li>
      <li>So many inaccuracy&#x27;s</li>
      <li>The needles I got the first time were all one kind and not of a kind the stick and poke artist uses.  </li>
      <li>The mix of needle types was great as well, I didn&#x27;t specify a need for a particular size</li>
      <li>Better then those cheap flimsy needles that come with most tattoo kits.</li>
      <li>pretty fast looks very good</li>
      <li>SPECIALLY THE ONE THAT HAS MOST NEEDLES...</li>
      <li>The packaging was very convenient, each needle came in its own packet with some thicker foam and a sticker stating its sanitized.  </li>
      <li>I could find a similar bundle with the disposable tips as well that would be great.</li>
      <li>But hey they were cheap and they work.</li>
      <li>THAT IS CHEAP.</li>
      <li>FREE.</li>
      <li>(ie) Pay them money &amp; give them free tattoo needles to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure these needles will last me a good while.</li>
      <li>Not only did it come with 50 of the needles, which are high quality and sterile, it also came with this awesome sticker and a catalog.</li>
      <li>It was quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Exactly all my favorite sizes as well..</li>
      <li>Personally, I would have liked to have more liners...</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good Buy None the less.</li>
      <li>you are not allowed to use needles with out the blue test strip any more and you wrote on product description of the product</li>
      <li>They come blister-packed and offer many different needles for both shading and lining.  </li>
      <li>and they came with exactly what they say they would, will order these again from this company.</li>
      <li>My first attempt at piercing involved heating a safety pin then dousing it in rum.</li>
      <li>and they were exactly that I was able to see the blue dot indicating they were steralized</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s not monster point needles, i don&#x27;t know i this items are steriled. don&#x27;t recommend this item to buy :-)</li>
    <li> I received about a week ago and all i had was 1003 size needles. The reason I purchased is because it claims that they will be assorted needles. No variation what so ever. Definately not again.</li>
    <li> These are NOT Monster Point needles and are not EO gas sterilized. yes they&#x27;re a great price but who the hell cares if you can&#x27;t use them..</li>
    <li> My first attempt at piercing involved heating a safety pin then dousing it in rum. Cutting a long story short, my ears have had two little black dots every since. Four years later, I gave these \\&quot;Hollow Peircing Needles\\&quot; a shot.  Its true what they say, once you go hollow, you never go back.  It was quick and easy. Definitely beats using a solid needle.   I pierced my cartilage and earlobe, both only took a few seconds. They bled a little, but the ordeal wasn&#x27;t very painful because it was so quick. (Although, the cartilage piercing was a bit less painless than the lobe...)  A great thing about hollow needles is that you don&#x27;t need to futz with the piercing to get it into the hole - you can simply slip it into the end of the needle before you pull it all the way through and it will slide into place as you pull the needle out.   The packaging was very convenient, each needle came in its own packet with some thicker foam and a sticker stating its sanitized.  I was impressed.</li>
    <li> I just used this product on a tattoo for my father and for the price it work perfectly. The product arrive fast about two days after I order. I recomment this product for the low budge or starting out tattooist. Just wish they had 11 mags add to the assorted pack</li>
    <li> These are NOT Monster Point needles. When I placed my order they were advertised as Monster Point in the pictures and description. What they really are is average cheap needles.  I will add that the price and shipping were very good.</li>
    <li> Monster Point ~ MIXED Sterile Tattoo Needles are a high quality product that has held up and performed well.pre-packaged needles guarantees sterile needles every time.highly recommended</li>
    <li> I was not at all satisfied with this product/purchase and I should have returned it, but instead I threw them in the trash.  Over 3/4 of the needles in this package were bent and in no way useable.</li>
    <li> Came on time and just what I was looking for! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Received the Package of Assorted Needles in a couple of days which is good. They are of good Quiaty and have worked well. I only wish the packages were marked with there needle size... It&#x27;s a good Buy None the less.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, worked great.</li>
    <li> Super fast arrival for sure.. Exactly all my favorite sizes as well.. What else is there to say but excellent product and service..</li>
    <li> This is exactly what i was looking for and they work Amazingly! And the price is awesome too. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Needles were all the same size.... Not what I was expecting. It says assorted but there was no assorted needles.</li>
    <li> The needles I got are not assorted,they are all the same. Also they are a little tough to attach to the nipple. But hey they were cheap and they work.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I wanted. Thank you. It&#x27;s got all the things that I needed and wanted and the needles are great.</li>
    <li> Received  what was expected. Nice price on a starter set for a tattoo apprentice to use for practice. I would never use these for people. I don&#x27;t  have a sheet that can tell me the metals used. And I can see visually these are not the quality you want to use for a clients lifelong commitment or you want for your art. Just use these for pig ears and practice on dozens of them. I bought 2 boxes. Its good to see lower q5ones so you know what to look for.</li>
    <li> FIRST OF ALL ITS NOT A SINGLE STACK FLAT MAGNUMS CAUSE THATS HOW I KNOW M1 SINGLE STACK BUT IT DID SAID M1 ON THE BACK PAPER, THEY ARE DOUBLE STACK WHICH THE 5 &amp; 7 M2&#x27;s(WHICH I KNOW DOUBLE STACKS) HAS A BAD OUTCOME. IT ALMOST NEVER TAKES THE INK INSIDE THE SKIN I DONT KNOW IF ITS JUST ME OR NOT... BUT THE 9 M2 IS GREAT IT WORKS LIKE LOW PROFILE NEEDLES AND IT TAKES THE INK FULLY INSERTED ON THE SKIN... I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND... AND ITS NOT BECAUSE 9M2 JUST HAVE MORE NEEDLES ON IT... 5&amp;7 M2&#x27;s PROBABLY JUST TAKES 20% INK AND THE 9 M2&#x27;s TAKES 85% FROM EACH SINGLE STROKE 5&amp;7 ROUND LINER AND PROBABLY 9RL IS JUST FAIR... BUT THE ROUND SHADER I TRIED THE 5&amp;7-RS I DON&#x27;T LIKE IT EITHER. IT WORKS JUST LIKE A LINER BUT IT HAS A ROUGH FINISH... AND YOU CANT DO A 45DEGREE ANGLE STROKE CAUSE ONLY HALF OF THE NEEDLE COUNT IS GOING TO BE INSERTED OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM BUT SOME ARE REALLY DEEP AND SOME ARE REALLY SHALLOW... SPECIALLY THE ONE THAT HAS MOST NEEDLES...BY THE WAY THIS IS JUST MY EXPERIENCED TO IT... AND PROBABLY A MORE EXPERIENCED TATTOO ARTIST KNOWS BETTER... AND IF YOU READ THIS AND YOU KNOW BETTER... ON HOW TO USE THOSE BAD NEEDLES I MENTIONED, PLS SCHOOL ME...ON HOW TO USE IT RIGHT... THANK YOU...</li>
    <li> you are not allowed to use needles with out the blue test strip any more and you wrote on product description of the product read they were sterizied with test strips, and they did&#x27;nt have them on my order,and the health department requires that blue dot test strip. i don&#x27;nt want your left overs,they are no good, i will have to dispose them.see if you can help me solve the problem. THANKS  CRAZY RICK</li>
    <li> a lot of people say they didn&#x27;t get monster point but i did..and there good till 2016 non of them were damaged either</li>
    <li> Great needles they were in a monster point box with dots the pic started off with a pic of a monster point box an needles then they changed it but what I got was great Shipping was a little slow but im vary happy im buying more really soon ....... part 2 I ordered more not monster point at all they came in a white box with a sticker that said monster point the eo gas mark was in the wrong place and were not bullet tip like most monster point needles are vary disappointed ill just drop a bill and order from the real site this was bs 1 star this time</li>
    <li> I have Purchased these several times. Great Needles at a Great price. I noticed a few people saying the were Not EO Gas Sterilized. Or Did Not Come in a Monster Point box, or did not have a Blue Dot. Mine Came in Monster point boxes, Were Labeled EO Gas Sterilized with indicator strip Blue dot individually sealed needles.  &amp; If you had a problem AMAZON offers a Refund with in 30 days ??? So I find the the bad reviews fishy. Next The Company Piercing Pros is owned by Monster Point. Piercing Pros Monster Steel &amp; Monster Point Same Company. [...] They Manufacturer &amp; are Whole-Sellers, Re-Sellers of Tattooing Piercing Supplies &amp; Jewelry. My orders came from piercing pros, with a Monster Steel Catalog, Coupons for $$$ off next purchase, &amp; a few funny cool tattoo stickers, \\&quot; Warning  Tampering With My Tattoo Equipment May Result in an Ass Whooping, You Will Never Forget\\&quot;. Also a few packs of A&amp;D Ointment. FREE. The Web Site was listed Monster Steel. I even Called Monster steel before ordering. They said Piercing Pro&#x27;s was another one of their company&#x27;s. I felt they gave me great service &amp; a few freebies is a nice touch. The Quality of their needles is companionable with Needle Jig &amp; Mithra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason they are cheaper. Un like Needle Jig &amp; Mithra, they do not Sponsor Tattoo Artist (ie) Pay them money &amp; give them free tattoo needles to use. to be on a team representing them. They do not Sponsor Tattoo Conventions, like the other 2 Nor do they run full page adds in several tattoo magazines each month. &amp; since they are not trying to re sell them to a 3rd party vendor. &amp; thus this vendor marks up the needles. I Just bought 100 assorted needles for $10.25, THAT IS CHEAP. They are great needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I believe I know where these negative reviews are coming from.  \\&quot; That Group C.R. Jordan Cult Follower&#x27;s \\&quot; Who are on his Boards, Never working in an actually tattoo shop. \\&quot; They all drank the KOOL-AID..\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You see Jordan who wrote a book on Tattooing. But does not Tattoo Full Time. He has several Web Sites That have advertisers on them. He promotes them. I purchased his book hoping to use it for our apprentices. So many inaccuracy&#x27;s it was not funny. Examples:  he  has it listed to use alcohol when making grey-washes. WRONG.  This will burn the clients Skin. Witch-Hazel is also an antiseptic like alcohol however it does not create a burning sensation. Next it also helps prevent bruising &amp; promote healing. So with a little Commonsense I hope you grasp this. Next according to The State of NY Alcohol is a No, No. Also Tattoo Ink Manufacturer INTENZE has Publicly Stated for Years. Then you have in the section of tattoo tuning : \\&quot; That a higher rated Capacitor will slow the tattoo machine down. \\&quot; However he does not mention this in reverse for Speeding the machine up. &amp; he should have stateda  higher UF rating cap will slow the machine down  &amp; a lower UF Rated will spped it up.  Same with frame geometry.  he Promotes Disposable Tubes &amp; a different Needle company. This is Why IMO They are advertising on his site. * Huck Spaulding&#x27;s Book Tattooing From A-Z is a much Better Book.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering for almost a year by this seller and i never got the moster point needles,(but they were still good needles) . i continued to buy for this seller and FINALLY!!! a box that said monster point!!! im very happy came with a funny sticker and came pretty fast looks very good ,nothing seems bent and i can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> The needles I got the first time were all one kind and not of a kind the stick and poke artist uses.  He very much appreciated these and they are just as advertized, Sterile, individually packed, and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Good selection of needles at a great price! Sealed, sterile and labelled clearly by size, Also perfect as a top up pack if you only use a few certain sizes.</li>
    <li> When I got my tattoo needles in I had 4 needles that were torn open an not completely in  there sterile packs. But I did get them before the time they were suppose to be here which was a good thing.</li>
    <li> it came like it showed and I am vary impressed with the quality of this product I will be ordering from this company again</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i wanted everything is as it was described in the order im happy with this product</li>
    <li> new at this so i  never have used others. these seem to be ok. there a great price. sterile packaged. and they sent a good variety i actually can use! not a lot off odd sizes an so forth!</li>
    <li> These needles worked amazingly. Better then those cheap flimsy needles that come with most tattoo kits. Best tattoo needles ive gotten so far and im gonna continue to use them.</li>
    <li> Was supposed to be an assorted back but received (50)  5RL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other types of needles.</li>
    <li> Not only did it come with 50 of the needles, which are high quality and sterile, it also came with this awesome sticker and a catalog. I&#x27;m sure these needles will last me a good while.</li>
    <li> Just a small box packed full of all kinds of needles. Its like buying a box of MAAANY different kinds of paint brushes. It&#x27;s good for having variety and a they&#x27;re good quality stuff. Pretty much what I read about it in its product description is what I got. A good uy here.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they were monster point and they were exactly that I was able to see the blue dot indicating they were steralized and they came with exactly what they say they would, will order these again from this company.</li>
    <li> Since when did &#x27;assorted&#x27; and &#x27;10 different sizes&#x27; mean 50 5RL needles??? What am I supposed to do with that many of one size when I JUST ran out of all my shading needles expecting this to have shading needles in them?? Yeah yeah they are sterilized and what not but the fact that they are not assorted did NOT make me happy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m unsatisfied with these.</li>
    <li> Very good service, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The packages I received were not Monster Point brand needles, however they were blister packed, 5 in a row, with the &#x27;Ethylene Oxide&#x27; gas strip present. 50 per box. I&#x27;m not sure how or why the other reviewers stated their needles were not properly sterilized however these certainly ARE with expiration dates around 2016 sometime. I&#x27;ve never heard of a retailer selling needles missing the gas strips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could find a similar bundle with the disposable tips as well that would be great. The mix of needle types was great as well, I didn&#x27;t specify a need for a particular size so I was given: 5-9 RS/RL and 9-14M</li>
    <li> all the needles I got were the same size when on your post it says assorted I was very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Package came in faster than excepted, very good quality needles for such a low price!! NICE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up guys!!!</li>
    <li> needles were just as described and exactly what the pic shows monster needles very happy with my purchase i was a little let down cuz i didnt read it (and thats my fault) but was hoping for some regular flat shaders but this set only comes with round shaders and magnums well worth it though will be ordering more from them for sure</li>
    <li> These were so worth the money. i gave them as a gift to a friend who is a tatoo artist</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 50 pre-mixed needles, and you can use them for tattooing.  It was exactly as advertised, and they work great.</li>
    <li> These are exactly as advertised, but they were packaged in the box a little messily so every time I tried to pull one out, it would potentially tear open a completely different needle. Other than that, I like this assortment.</li>
    <li> Initially I liked these but the more I use them, they seem to dull quickly or something? After buying other brands that don&#x27;t do this I feel some quality is lacking in these.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a smooth transaction. Great product, highly recommend!! 😀😀😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what others are talking about saying they didn&#x27;t get the right needles but, mine were exactly as described with the strip on each single package.</li>
    <li> They come blister-packed and offer many different needles for both shading and lining.  Personally, I would have liked to have more liners...but that&#x27;s the luck of the draw.</li>
    <li> The needle sizes were all there but they weren&#x27;t monster point and some pack didn&#x27;t have sterile strip. They came in a plain white box. Needle work good though.</li>
