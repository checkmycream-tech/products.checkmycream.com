      <li>a great mirror on my desk!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>This one comes with great value and we&#x27;re happy to have it now.</li>
      <li>As others have described, the outer packaging was great (bubble wrap, air bags)</li>
      <li>Yes it looks great and has two sides</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t real satisfied with this mirror.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the picture shows.</li>
      <li>Good Buy</li>
      <li>But the replacements arrived quickly and were in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice mirror for the price.  </li>
      <li>Nice and stable on the bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>They look nice</li>
      <li>Needed a new one and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is a ok mirror.</li>
      <li>Kudos to Amazon for making this an easy return.</li>
      <li>They are made with cheap plastic</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s original packaging as the cheap silver paint was chipped and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because for the short time that it worked, it was a nice size to place on  top of my drawer and use for makeup application.</li>
      <li>Seeing my whole face is important to make sure of symmetry in my trimming.</li>
      <li>I gave it a five star rating because of the size of the mirror which allows full profile of the face</li>
      <li>It gets two stars simply because the mirror itself was good.  </li>
      <li>the mirror itself came in from the manufacturer had adequate protetion.  </li>
      <li>The mirror showed up in far more pieces than were originally intended.  </li>
      <li>Good quality, although a little on the light weight side.</li>
      <li>We just wanted a cheap desk mirror and did not care much about the function.</li>
      <li>At first, I want to return the mirror</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased, overall.</li>
      <li>Slightly larger than I expected, which is a good thing, light weight but not to light that it tips over, easy to clean, and real glass instead of the shinny plastic crap that scratches easy.</li>
      <li>They are also very lightweight.</li>
      <li>If you want to deal with returning this ceiling viewer (no base, it only shows the ceiling.  </li>
      <li>I like the way it sits lower then alot of other vanity mirrors making it more confortable to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it was much more sturdier than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
      <li>The version I received when I ordered this from Amazon is not at all the same in essential quality-- just a cheap copy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a totally OK mirror, but it arrived dirty with clear marks of someone touching and wiping it which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>After a week or so it completely broke.</li>
      <li>Either Swissco has slipped dramatically in recent years or this could just be a knock-off of the real thing.  </li>
      <li>While this mirror is a nice size and aesthetically, it is poorly built.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it of very cheap quality (the mirror itself is fine, bit the base and the piece the mirror spins on that attaches to base are made of a very cheap looking plastic, that&#x27;s been painted with a very cheap looking silver colored paint), but this product was obviously shipped to me damaged: the base was completely severed from the rest, and although perfectly packaged with adequate amounts of bubble wrap and inflatable packaging, you could tell that it had been banging around inside</li>
      <li>Though it was not very fine made, it is a worth buying product considering the size and price.</li>
      <li>but many were broken when I received them.</li>
      <li>It weighs exactly 11 ounces, not 16, so it is substantially less stable.</li>
      <li>The mirror has two faces, one is normal and the other is magnified.</li>
      <li>the mirror is fine, but the frame which made of plastic is broken.</li>

    <li> The mirror has two faces, one is normal and the other is magnified. Though it was not very fine made, it is a worth buying product considering the size and price.</li>
    <li> Was brittle and was broken in transit</li>
    <li> While this mirror is a nice size and aesthetically, it is poorly built.  The center post, which appears to be chromed, arrived badly tarnished or discolored.  One of the side posts was also cracked.  Neither of these was due to poor packaging as both Amazon&#x27;s packaging and the container the mirror itself came in from the manufacturer had adequate protetion.  It gets two stars simply because the mirror itself was good.  Kudos to Amazon for making this an easy return.</li>

Worst case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever seen. Returning ASAP.</li>
    <li> This mirror was practically falling apart when I opened it but it was still usable. After a week or so it completely broke. I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because for the short time that it worked, it was a nice size to place on  top of my drawer and use for makeup application.</li>
    <li> Bought if for my father-in-law who was looking for something to look into while shaving.  He&#x27;s having a hard time standing.  He likes it.</li>
    <li> When i opened the box it was already broken. But i cbf to send it back and get a refund so yea whatever.</li>
    <li> They look nice but many were broken when I received them. They are made with cheap plastic so what can you expect.</li>
    <li> the mirror is fine, but the frame which made of plastic is broken. At first, I want to return the mirror but I quit for the complicated process.</li>
    <li> Needed a new one and this fits the bill perfectly. Nice and stable on the bathroom counter. I&#x27;m pleased, overall.</li>
    <li> Even close up. I use it when I am trimming my beard. Seeing my whole face is important to make sure of symmetry in my trimming. Good quality, although a little on the light weight side. I suppose that might be a problem in some situations, but it has not inconvenienced me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a totally OK mirror, but it arrived dirty with clear marks of someone touching and wiping it which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken,So i threw it away,wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return it,Maybe they will get seven years bad luck.</li>
    <li> It is a ok mirror. Not as good as the picture shows. But you can still use it. Personaly, I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t real satisfied with this mirror. The arms on it do not hold the mirror tight enough to keep it in one place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Swissco mirror pictured here for years and it&#x27;s great.  The version I received when I ordered this from Amazon is not at all the same in essential quality-- just a cheap copy.  This thing is truly a piece of junk and not worth 1/2 the sale price.  Either Swissco has slipped dramatically in recent years or this could just be a knock-off of the real thing.  It weighs exactly 11 ounces, not 16, so it is substantially less stable. The base is sort of hollow, thin plastic rather than solid Plexiglas like the original.  The item described and pictured here is a misrepresentation of the product sold.  I&#x27;ll be less likely to buy from Amazon again.  I&#x27;m tired of seeing one thing, then receiving another look-alike or poor version of what&#x27;s shown-- happening too often lately.</li>
    <li> These mirror stands are very fragile and I ordered 14 of them and had to return 5 of them that arrived cracked and broken.  But the replacements arrived quickly and were in perfect condition.  They are also very lightweight.</li>
    <li> I gave it a five star rating because of the size of the mirror which allows full profile of the face&lt;br /&gt;also I like the way it sits lower then alot of other vanity mirrors making it more confortable to&lt;br /&gt;use and to handle.</li>
    <li> a great mirror on my desk! I can&#x27;t live without it now. Yes it looks great and has two sides</li>
    <li> The mirror showed up in far more pieces than were originally intended.  As others have described, the outer packaging was great (bubble wrap, air bags) the protection inside the mirror package was nil.  The plastic base frame is not the temper of plastic that will stand up to long term use, let alone make it to your house in the desired number of pieces.  If you want to deal with returning this ceiling viewer (no base, it only shows the ceiling.  To it&#x27;s credit it magnifies so the ceiling seems closer) or if you just wanna eat the price, then this is the mirror for you!</li>
    <li> This is a nice mirror for the price.  I was surprised that it was much more sturdier than I expected.  Good Buy</li>
    <li> We just wanted a cheap desk mirror and did not care much about the function. This one comes with great value and we&#x27;re happy to have it now.</li>
    <li> Slightly larger than I expected, which is a good thing, light weight but not to light that it tips over, easy to clean, and real glass instead of the shinny plastic crap that scratches easy. meet my needs</li>
