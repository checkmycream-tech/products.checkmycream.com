### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find one that matches my skin perfectly and that will keep my skin matte all day.  </li>
      <li>This powder, however, matched my skin tone perfectly, and it provides sufficient coverage while still feeling light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This makes my skin look flawless without that powdery appearance or it being to pale(I</li>
      <li>Excellent coverage and perfect shade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very happy with it,</li>
      <li>oily skin looks great</li>
      <li>It has the amazing ability to pick up on the varying hues of my skin color and blend them to make my skin look the best it ever has, from morning to night!</li>
      <li>The brush applicator leaves a lot to be desired, but the powder itself is good.  </li>
      <li>and it still worked good.</li>
      <li>Great to wear with or without basecoat for light covering.</li>
      <li>And this this powder blends, covers and buffs nicely.</li>
      <li>skin is very fair and pressed powder off the rack in most stores rarely works for me.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year and find it to be suitable in any weather.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t sparkly but light-reflective and makes a nice surface for skin to look smooth and nice.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>I am prone to breaking out with most cosmetics, however, this powder does not cause any issues.</li>
      <li>I love Almay.</li>
      <li>I love this powder, it doesn&#x27;t cake like talc powders do.</li>
      <li>What more could a girl want?</li>
      <li>it has the different shades, because when I get a zit I can use a q-tip and pick out which shade hides it best.</li>
      <li>So when so many people reported the light was &amp;#34;too light&amp;#34; I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This powder does custom fit your skin, but its not because of anything special in the powder!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to all women especially older women as it is a struggle when we age to find appropriate affordable makeup/\.</li>
      <li>Most concealers and powders are darker and more yellow than my natural skin tone, and although I can make them work with plenty of blending, they aren&#x27;t ideal.</li>
      <li>I love the Smart Shade line!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice soft light tone and works well on variety of skin tones.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely finishing powder and great for late afternoon shine removal.  </li>
      <li>I love Almay Smart Shade Smart Balance Pressed Powderlight because it goes on nicely and looks natural and doesn&#x27;t cake up.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite powder.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this!!!</li>
      <li>But ok I like almay products because of my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is nice if you want a light cover over any other makeup.</li>
      <li>Almay was right.</li>
      <li>Very impressed by this product, and I will definitely be buying again, and Im eager to try the other smart shade products.</li>
      <li>So, thanks Almay!</li>
      <li>And sometimes I&#x27;ll just use the white in the corners of my eyes to make them look brighter and more awake.</li>
      <li>This Almay Smart Shade Smart Balanced Powder is just that - smart!</li>
      <li>This product works well with the Smart shade anti aging makeup.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the Smart Shade foundation and primer.</li>
      <li>I have seen the almay smart shade stuff forever, and refused to believe it worked.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s that smart.</li>
      <li>I also love Almay&#x27;s loose powder.</li>
      <li>I have very very fair skin, so it is often difficult for me to find makeup that matches my skin tone.</li>
      <li>and I kept it for that reason only because it&#x27;s super smart shade!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this as I use Almay liquid makeup</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use as much</li>
      <li>and I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s on even after I have applied it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>It does not look caked on and the shades are very normal to skin tones.</li>
      <li>Definitely not worth they money no matter how cheap you find it.</li>
      <li>This powder completely accomplishes both tasks.  </li>
      <li>any discoloration differences blend together with this product, and my face matches my neck seamlessly.</li>
      <li>only criticism is that it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of oil control, and by the end of the day my nose and forehead are shiny.</li>
      <li>should mention i&#x27;m extremely pale) and it feels light as a feather.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of pressed powder, so I can&#x27;t go there about long lasting, however, smart shade it is!!</li>
      <li>You have to put it on a little different than other make up, but in a better way.</li>

<li> I use this regularly and have purchase it in stores up until a few months ago when I found it cheaper online and usually with free shipping when I bundle.</li>
<li> Only complaint is it comes with a brush instead of powder puff and not enough room for a puff, so I have to carry another compact just for the puff.</li>
<li> but..this comes with a little brush instead of a sponge..</li>
<li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
<li> I purchased this powder simply out of curiosity, as I had  been unhappy with other pressed powders from other brand names I have been using over the years.</li>
<li> I also thought the application brush was too stiff.</li>
<li> Only thing I am disappointed in is that it has a little mini-brush instead of a round pad for application.</li>
<li> I mean, how could it?</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t bother me terribly, and you can always reapply, but if you want a powder that will really keep oil at bay, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
<li> But unfortunately this pressed powder just didnt work for me.</li>
<li> Well, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve always hated to use make up, but I can&#x27;t keep this to myself:</li>

    <li> This is nice if you want a light cover over any other makeup. It isn&#x27;t sparkly but light-reflective and makes a nice surface for skin to look smooth and nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of pressed powder, so I can&#x27;t go there about long lasting, however, smart shade it is!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the different colors or what, but when I put it on, instead of making my face lighter or darker, it was the same shade and I kept it for that reason only because it&#x27;s super smart shade! I&#x27;m ivory skin and I got light/medium and it still worked good. I think it has tiny computers blended into it it&#x27;s that smart.</li>
    <li> Well, let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve always hated to use make up, but I can&#x27;t keep this to myself: this shade is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;My oily skin looks great everytime I use it! So, thanks Almay! I think I&#x27;ll keep buying this. ☺</li>
    <li> I purchased this powder simply out of curiosity, as I had  been unhappy with other pressed powders from other brand names I have been using over the years. This Almay Smart Shade Smart Balanced Powder is just that - smart! It has the amazing ability to pick up on the varying hues of my skin color and blend them to make my skin look the best it ever has, from morning to night! I have received several compliments after using this powder and plan to add it to my daily regimen from here on!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this as I use Almay liquid makeup but..this comes with a little brush instead of a sponge..and I really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s on even after I have applied it.  No coverage at all even after using a sponge instead of the brush.  Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this powder.  I&#x27;ve used several kinds.  I&#x27;ve struggled to find one that matches my skin perfectly and that will keep my skin matte all day.  This powder completely accomplishes both tasks.  It doesn&#x27;t cake up and lasts all day.  I would highly recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite powder. Excellent coverage and perfect shade. I just wish it came with a regular powder pad instead of the brush.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product after seeing the one star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very fair and pressed powder off the rack in most stores rarely works for me. So when so many people reported the light was &amp;#34;too light&amp;#34; I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It covers well. I applied it over NYC BB 5 in 1 creme (off the shelf at target) using a makeup sponge *just those regular triangle ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it, but yes, it is light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This photo was taken on a sunny day, in the car at 5pm.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and find it to be suitable in any weather. It does not look caked on and the shades are very normal to skin tones.

    <li> The brush applicator leaves a lot to be desired, but the powder itself is good.  I am prone to breaking out with most cosmetics, however, this powder does not cause any issues.</li>
    <li> Like this powder. Cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and have purchase it in stores up until a few months ago when I found it cheaper online and usually with free shipping when I bundle. Thanks Amazon. This product works well with the Smart shade anti aging makeup.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of the Smart Shade foundation and primer. I also love Almay&#x27;s loose powder. But unfortunately this pressed powder just didnt work for me. It doesnt blend well and made my skin look white and chalky. I also thought the application brush was too stiff. I ended up giving it away and will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely finishing powder and great for late afternoon shine removal.  Only thing I am disappointed in is that it has a little mini-brush instead of a round pad for application.</li>
    <li> I have very very fair skin, so it is often difficult for me to find makeup that matches my skin tone. Most concealers and powders are darker and more yellow than my natural skin tone, and although I can make them work with plenty of blending, they aren&#x27;t ideal.

This doesn&#x27;t bother me terribly, and you can always reapply, but if you want a powder that will really keep oil at bay, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Almay was right. This powder does custom fit your skin, but its not because of anything special in the powder! The powder literally has no coverage. All I can use it for now is to set my makeup, and to put on my face to get rid of any shine. Definitely not worth they money no matter how cheap you find it.</li>
    <li> Use as a finishing powder after makeup is applied.  Gives a nice soft light tone and works well on variety of skin tones.</li>
    <li> I love Almay. And this this powder blends, covers and buffs nicely. I like it has the different shades, because when I get a zit I can use a q-tip and pick out which shade hides it best. And sometimes I&#x27;ll just use the white in the corners of my eyes to make them look brighter and more awake. I also like that the brush fits in the back and it has a mirror. Boom. What more could a girl want?</li>
    <li> Coverage is not what I would like it to be. But ok I like almay products because of my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I usually only use powders when I forgot my liquid foundation. I have seen the almay smart shade stuff forever, and refused to believe it worked. I mean, how could it? Well, now I am a believer. This makes my skin look flawless without that powdery appearance or it being to pale(I should mention i&#x27;m extremely pale) and it feels light as a feather. any discoloration differences blend together with this product, and my face matches my neck seamlessly. Very impressed by this product, and I will definitely be buying again, and Im eager to try the other smart shade products.</li>
    <li> I love Almay Smart Shade Smart Balance Pressed Powderlight because it goes on nicely and looks natural and doesn&#x27;t cake up.</li>
    <li> I love the Smart Shade line! You have to put it on a little different than other make up, but in a better way. You really don&#x27;t need to use as much and you blend to the edge of your face. I use a sponge for the foundation.</li>
    <li> Have been using this powder since Almay introduced it. A must have...Only complaint is it comes with a brush instead of powder puff and not enough room for a puff, so I have to carry another compact just for the puff.</li>
    <li> I love this powder, it doesn&#x27;t cake like talc powders do.</li>
    <li> Great to wear with or without basecoat for light covering. Thank you.</li>
