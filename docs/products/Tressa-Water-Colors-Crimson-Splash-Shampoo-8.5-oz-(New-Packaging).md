      <li>The brightness has been neutralized a bit and now it&#x27;s more of a subdued but pretty magenta color in the red highlights.</li>

      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it claims to.</li>

      <li>It is very drying.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tressa has been kind enough to share a comprehensive product detailed PDF file with Everything you want to know including : Multitude of details on different methods if use ( several) :</li>
      <li>However, this really is a great refresher between dyes, and instantly takes my hair back to the proper color.</li>
      <li>price.super fast shipping.love</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It has following attributes:  ^ thickness, deposits lovely, natural shades, ^ shine , improves texture, covers gray (depending on your # uses &amp; porosity)</li>
      <li>the new package its much easier to dispense</li>
      <li>An outstanding shade selection, &amp;#34;Cocoa &amp;#34; is actually my fav on my 3rd bottle.</li>
      <li>(the main reason why I use it) Great to use when hair color fades and you need a little extra color till your next coloring.</li>
      <li>, this left my hair clean, voluminous and NOT dry.</li>
      <li>also use the coordinating conditioner, as well as Pravana Vivid Conditioner to help my hair and save the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>People always ask me why my hair color stays fresh so long.  </li>
      <li>Overall I like this product much better than the previous, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to prolong the vibrancy of their red hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it if you have red hair color that you wish to keep from fading.</li>
      <li>I first tried the Pravana line of pastels, aiming for a bubble gum/cotton candy pink.</li>
      <li>This will stain if you let it get onto your walls or if you have an extremely porous shower, so test it first.</li>
      <li>This is not really a shampoo, since it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of cleaning.</li>
      <li>I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights.</li>
      <li>Although I would say that the later has less rich color than the other two...</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy this at first because I was afraid black cherry would be too dark, but really, the red is not a black cherry but more like a deep burgundy red.</li>
      <li>This really does add a slight tint of bluish red.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this shampoo.  First off, let me say it is for the fake auburn hair, not ginger or fire engine red.  It is very drying.  It definitely deposits plenty of color, but your hair will be hard to comb.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is difficult to keep red hair vibrant any Tressa gives your hair a pop to maintain it&#x27;s vibrancy. It smells good and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Ok product. Does tend to dry hair and did turn pink . Would buy again. Great for a night out to brighten up color.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find a colored shampoo that will help me maintain the process I have done monthly.  This shampoo does just that. Its a good product to use with my daily shampoo</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Maintains red well.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo/color tint to dye my hair, as well as maintain the color. I currently bleach my hair, from medium-dark blonde to platinum w/a toner, then I wash in this shampoo. I first tried the Pravana line of pastels, aiming for a bubble gum/cotton candy pink. The color ended up being a hint of a hue, it was sadly disappointing. I had purchased this shampoo to maintain the pink that I had hoped would take. The color this washed into my platinum was almost exactly what I was going for!! I love the color it maintains with the pigment deposits each time I wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the coordinating conditioner, as well as Pravana Vivid Conditioner to help my hair and save the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The tips are purple as I used to have Blue in my ends)</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to. It refreshes your color and keeps red hair vibrant and beautiful. I absolutely love it and have been recommendimg it to friends and they love it too. I highly recommend it if you have red hair color that you wish to keep from fading.</li>
    <li> Item as Described! Fast Shipping! thanks</li>
    <li> This shampoo really extends the life of my hair color!</li>
    <li> Keeps color vibrant, but dries out hair bad. I do not use more than 2 times a week, They need a conditioner. I mix mine with a moisturizing shampoo and use a really good conditioner.</li>
    <li> I think they might have changed their formulation a bit as well as the packaging. I have used this shampoo for about a year and this formulation is different, in a good way! This one seems to have more color pigmentation in it which helped my color stay vibrant even at 8 weeks post color. The downside is that, as with ALL color depositing products, it stains your hands, finger nails and towels a pink color. Just use gloves and dark towels and problem solved. Overall I like this product much better than the previous, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to prolong the vibrancy of their red hair.</li>
    <li> Great product - have used it for years - definitely keeps the red alive between colorings!</li>
    <li> I bought this in several colors for my medium to dark brown hair thinking it would be fun to bring out different highlights. I bought this based on the recommendation of a YT video review.  I tried each of the colors I bought several times. No color change in my hair at all. Not even in the sunlight. You also need to use a lot to get your hair clean. I was very disappointed and shame on my for not returning them. They YTer did not say she was sponsored but I have a feeling that was the case.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn my hair as red as I&#x27;d hoped but it still looks good. My hair is brown with copper bayalage. So it really only turns the copper to red. It&#x27;s kind of light too.</li>
    <li> This will stain if you let it get onto your walls or if you have an extremely porous shower, so test it first. However, this really is a great refresher between dyes, and instantly takes my hair back to the proper color.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic because:&lt;br /&gt;1) It deposits a lovely shade of red&lt;br /&gt;2) It cleans but my hair does not feel dry or brittle afterwards, but full and soft&lt;br /&gt;3) No sulfates and it smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I have naturally black Asian hair. I dyed it magenta/red using Loreal HiColor highlights after having had some brown highlights in my hair previously, to give you an estimate of how red my hair is. I bought this because not all parts of my hair were red - there were bright pink parts that I loved, some bright red parts I loved, and some faded light brown, brassy highlights that did not get dyed that I didn&#x27;t like. So I thought I would try this to even everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one wash, my hair has improved. The brightness has been neutralized a bit and now it&#x27;s more of a subdued but pretty magenta color in the red highlights. The brassyness has also brightened and looks more red now. I was hesitant to buy this at first because I was afraid black cherry would be too dark, but really, the red is not a black cherry but more like a deep burgundy red. It&#x27;s very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this left my hair clean, voluminous and NOT dry. Artech was terrible in that my hair always felt flat and clumpy and coated after using it. This leaves my hair feeling like it was washed with regular salon shampoo. You will need a conditioner, however, because it&#x27;s not an especially conditioning shampoo.</li>
    <li> awsome price.super fast shipping.love the new package its much easier to dispense</li>
    <li> Love this product and its cruelty free.  (the main reason why I use it) Great to use when hair color fades and you need a little extra color till your next coloring.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!! Great find!! Super fast shipping!! I will definitely be back to this shop for more. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is very very red.  Be prepared to rinse the bottle afterwards, it gets everything red.  BUT with that said, it does revive the red.  I like it for now, I am not sure if I&#x27;ll get another one, I&#x27;m waiting to see what happens.</li>
    <li> These shampoos are amazing. I tried crimson red, fluid fire and liquid cooper and they&#x27;re all great. Although I would say that the later has less rich color than the other two... Maybe my hair color?</li>
    <li> Best red shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! Having more of a purple red it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have an orange base. this one is perfect and brightens up my purple-red tones!!</li>
    <li> Top color -depositing product ever used( I&#x27;ve tried numerous others) An outstanding shade selection, &amp;#34;Cocoa &amp;#34; is actually my fav on my 3rd bottle. It has following attributes:  ^ thickness, deposits lovely, natural shades, ^ shine , improves texture, covers gray (depending on your # uses &amp; porosity) Tressa has been kind enough to share a comprehensive product detailed PDF file with Everything you want to know including : Multitude of details on different methods if use ( several) : mix various  shades, tons of  ways to use the product, gray coverage and even the technical bases if the shades &amp; which ones are compatible to mix and so much more @ http://www.Tressa.com tab on the &amp;#34;Education&amp;#34; icon once you are on their homepage. I honestly recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Awesome product! For redheads make sure to use in moderation or will alter shade of your hair! Awesome seller! Delivered same day, no problems!! Will continue to buy from this seller!!</li>
    <li> This really does add a slight tint of bluish red. My hair colorist&#x27;s advice to wash my hair BEFORE using this was good advice. This is not really a shampoo, since it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of cleaning. It&#x27;s more a foaming tint.</li>
    <li> People always ask me why my hair color stays fresh so long.  This would be why!  I love this product.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t let it get on a floor or tub.  It does stain!</li>
