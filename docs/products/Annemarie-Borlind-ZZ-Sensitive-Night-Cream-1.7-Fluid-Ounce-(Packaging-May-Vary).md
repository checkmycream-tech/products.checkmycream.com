      <li>and so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout</li>
      <li>Not for the better, either.</li>
      <li>and I love that.</li>
      <li>I also wish that it had a flip top, not the screw-on top.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance, goes on smoothly, non-greasy, you can feel your skin tightening.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>great face cream for sensitive skin (night or day)   ZZ</li>
      <li>The cream is basically applicable with smooth glide for better penetration to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product is OK for me, but I don&#x27;t know it will fit someone else.</li>
      <li>Best in sensitive, natural care.</li>
      <li>Luck to find a great product that actually works.</li>
      <li>Fabulously calming, rich and absorbent cream.</li>
      <li>it goes on thick, but absorbs incredibly well into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I wear it during the days well as right before bed.</li>
      <li>This is a great product but what was sent to me was past its expiration date....</li>
      <li>i tried this product an a little gift in my hotel room in Germany this may and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It  seems to work really well.</li>
      <li>After about 2 separate orders where I normally order 2 tubes at time for convenience sake and because I go through about a tube a month, I have found the quality to not be consistent.</li>
      <li>So moisturizing and gentle.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>This is a nice heavy cream for my super dry skin.</li>
      <li>New</li>
      <li>It is now not as rich and more watery, plus doesn&#x27;t last as long (less in the tube?).  </li>
      <li>I was sceptical at first but then after using it every night for about 2 weeks, I could def notice a difference in the overall texture and look of my face.</li>
      <li>and my face appears a little shiny and oily, as well as, the cream has a very mild odor (that soon disappears).</li>
      <li>I have super dry skin that is unusually sensitive to creams and liquid makeup.  </li>
      <li>Recommend for women with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>No reaction for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I noticed on the crimp of the 2 tubes I have now the date 2013 and one of the tubes has an old smell to it</li>
      <li>you have truly sensitive skin,</li>
      <li>My sensitive rosacea-prone skin wouldn&#x27;t get through wintertime without it.</li>
      <li>btw, it says: ZZ Hypersensitive, but it&#x27;s actually: ZZ sensitive  </li>
      <li>The night cream is a favorite - a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for people with dry to normal skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is dry day &amp; night and this product really makes a difference to keep it moist and balanced.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way - I apply it at bedtime and it goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>There are no parabens among the ingredients, and I notice zinc oxide present, which serves as a natural sunscreen if you want to use the product as a daytime protector.</li>
      <li>I have very very sensitive and dry skin.</li>
      <li>However, I use Anne Marie Borlind ZZ Sensitive Night Cream not only at night, but I actually use it as a daily moisturizer under my makeup and it&#x27;s simple perfection!  </li>

<li> However, I use Anne Marie Borlind ZZ Sensitive Night Cream not only at night, but I actually use it as a daily moisturizer under my makeup and it&#x27;s simple perfection!  </li>
<li> I have been using ZZ Sensitive night cream for years and when I recently discovered it on Amazon for about $12 less a tube</li>
<li> My skin is so dry I only use the night cream.</li>
<li> Yet, my skin absorbes the product, does its stuff overnight and in the morning, my skin looks fresh and hydrated - not dry, or oily, or tight, or irritated like some other products I have used in the past.  </li>
<li> I have not had a single area or dry patch on my face this entire winter!  </li>
<li> I have had zero break outs (I&#x27;m also prone to dry skin acne in harsher weather)  since I started using this product.  </li>
<li> It has a faint medicinal, but not unpleasant, odor, which I like.  </li>
<li> I have got is what you expected.</li>
<li> but i&#x27;m not sure if I like it, not bad but not great</li>
<li> This is the stuff that Olay and other store brands wish they could be.</li>
<li> I wish it &#x27;glided&#x27; on a little easier, but that is to be expected in a cream versus a lotion.  </li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;the like about this cream is it is too thick.</li>
<li> I hunted it down on amazon</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way less emollient.</li>
<li> Just a small bit is terrifically emollient and soothing.</li>
<li> I am not sure if it is bad product or just old.</li>
<li> Give this cream at least 7 - 10 days before judging.</li>
<li> thing I don&#x27;t like is the shine, but it&#x27;s a thick moisturizer</li>
<li> and then it started being runny and liquid would come up before the lotion - not a good thing.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that the listing hasn&#x27;t been updated - totally misleading.</li>
<li> My skin is especially dry around my nose and chin during the cold winter months and as a result annoyingly my face usually ends up looking as though it is peeling a bit.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed by this and would like to be in contact with the store who sells these and find out some answers.</li>
<li> Incredibly disappointed.  </li>
<li> Just give it a try you will not be disappointed!  </li>

    <li> This product is OK for me, but I don&#x27;t know it will fit someone else. But anyway you can try.</li>
    <li> great face cream for sensitive skin (night or day)   ZZ Hypersensitive Night Cream 1.70 Ounces, Borlind Of Germany   btw, it says: ZZ Hypersensitive, but it&#x27;s actually: ZZ sensitive  the correct product comes in the mail.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever! Dewey skin</li>
    <li> Good.  Does have a scent.  I assume it is from the ingredients and not an added perfume.  I use the night cream for day and night.  It is no greasy so I can use it for day.  I used to use l occatane Shea and cotton, but they discontinued it.  This is a good substitute.</li>
    <li> Fabulously calming, rich and absorbent cream. This is the stuff that Olay and other store brands wish they could be. My sensitive rosacea-prone skin wouldn&#x27;t get through wintertime without it.</li>
    <li> If you have Rosacea and need a moisturizer that will not irritate your skin this is it.</li>
    <li> It  seems to work really well. My wife loves it and I love that. Cannot recommend it highly enough. It works.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s always been wonderful.  Like buying it off Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have used it for years. I would highly recommend it for people with dry to normal skin.</li>
    <li> Ordered this cream based upon multiple reviews I had read from various different sources. My skin is dry day &amp; night and this product really makes a difference to keep it moist and balanced. A little goes a long way - I apply it at bedtime and it goes on smoothly and my face appears a little shiny and oily, as well as, the cream has a very mild odor (that soon disappears). Yet, my skin absorbes the product, does its stuff overnight and in the morning, my skin looks fresh and hydrated - not dry, or oily, or tight, or irritated like some other products I have used in the past.  Give this cream at least 7 - 10 days before judging. I was sceptical at first but then after using it every night for about 2 weeks, I could def notice a difference in the overall texture and look of my face.</li>
    <li> Best in sensitive, natural care. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! So moisturizing and gentle. Unscented so u don&#x27;t feel its on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shine, but it&#x27;s a thick moisturizer and I love that it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout</li>
    <li> New Review:&lt;br /&gt;The formulation has changed! Not for the better, either. The package now says &amp;#34;Fortifying&amp;#34; and so much is different. It&#x27;s way less emollient. It makes my skin more red after using it, with an uncomfortable tingle. I&#x27;m so disappointed that the listing hasn&#x27;t been updated - totally misleading. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I&#x27;ve let the manufacturer know, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Review:&lt;br /&gt;If you have truly sensitive skin, especially if it tends to dryness, this stuff is irreplaceable. Just a small bit is terrifically emollient and soothing. It really does cut redness after just a few uses. I use it during the day and it keeps my skin looking well-tended without being greasy. Brilliant product that I hope is around forever.</li>
    <li> Luck to find a great product that actually works. I have got is what you expected. Expect the best from Borlind.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!!  I have super dry skin that is unusually sensitive to creams and liquid makeup.  This product is absolutely perfect in everyway.  it goes on thick, but absorbs incredibly well into my skin.  My skin is especially dry around my nose and chin during the cold winter months and as a result annoyingly my face usually ends up looking as though it is peeling a bit.  Until I found this product no face cream remedied this.  However, I use Anne Marie Borlind ZZ Sensitive Night Cream not only at night, but I actually use it as a daily moisturizer under my makeup and it&#x27;s simple perfection!  A Miracle in a tube for me.  I have not had a single area or dry patch on my face this entire winter!  Skin is radiant and glowing and not shiny at all.  No nasty odor that lingers all day either.  I love, love, love this cream.  I have had zero break outs (I&#x27;m also prone to dry skin acne in harsher weather)  since I started using this product.  Although it is a heavier cream it does NOT clog your pores.  Just give it a try you will not be disappointed!  I only wish they made this with sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> I have been using ZZ Sensitive night cream for years and when I recently discovered it on Amazon for about $12 less a tube I was elated. After about 2 separate orders where I normally order 2 tubes at time for convenience sake and because I go through about a tube a month, I have found the quality to not be consistent. I noticed on the crimp of the 2 tubes I have now the date 2013 and one of the tubes has an old smell to it and then it started being runny and liquid would come up before the lotion - not a good thing. I am not sure if it is bad product or just old. I am disappointed by this and would like to be in contact with the store who sells these and find out some answers.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Borlind day and night creams for several years.  The night cream is a favorite - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product but i&#x27;m not sure if I like it, not bad but not great,I will give it more time and update my review.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive and dry skin. This is the only product I have found that actually  moisturizes enough without being greasy and causing breakouts. My skin is so dry I only use the night cream. I got basically a two for one deal through Amazon. I will buy again. Each tube lasts about three months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but what was sent to me was past its expiration date....a lot of money to spend on something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20 years.  Stopped a few times because it wasn&#x27;t easily available in those days and always went back to mail order within a few months because I could tell the difference.  Now 67 and almost no wrinkles.  I got good genes from my mom, so it&#x27;s not just the cream, but I definitely think this cream has made a substantial difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  May 2017  After using this product for 25 years with great results, they have changed the formulaZ  It is now not as rich and more watery, plus doesn&#x27;t last as long (less in the tube?).  After just one tube I could see a difference in my skin.  Emailed the company and they didn&#x27;t even respond.  Incredibly disappointed.  Won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I like it bc it is reach and I don&#x27;t feel it on my skin.</li>
    <li> i tried this product an a little gift in my hotel room in Germany this may and loved it.  I hunted it down on amazon and so glad I did.  it is terrific for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice heavy cream for my super dry skin. The only downside was that it did leave my face with an oily residue on it, but after about 10 minutes it seeped into my skin. It works well and keeps my face moisturized. I wear it during the days well as right before bed.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. No reaction for my sensitive skin. The only thing I don&#x27;the like about this cream is it is too thick.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY MOISTURIZER THAT DOESN&#x27;T BREAK MY SKIN OUT AND IT STILL DOES THE JOB! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Fragrance-free product. There are no parabens among the ingredients, and I notice zinc oxide present, which serves as a natural sunscreen if you want to use the product as a daytime protector. The cream is basically applicable with smooth glide for better penetration to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very satisfied with Anne Marie Borlind Skincare products!</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this face cream.  It has a faint medicinal, but not unpleasant, odor, which I like.  I wish it &#x27;glided&#x27; on a little easier, but that is to be expected in a cream versus a lotion.  I also wish that it had a flip top, not the screw-on top.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Recommend for women with sensitive skin.  Nice fragrance, goes on smoothly, non-greasy, you can feel your skin tightening. great stuff</li>
    <li> nice!!! Happy about the quick arrival!</li>
