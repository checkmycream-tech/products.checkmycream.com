      <li>But when I saw commercials for the Colgate Slim Soft, I thought it seemed like a good design.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that brush my tongue after I am done brushing my teeth and this brush doesn&#x27;t do that well, either, as it is too soft to do a good job.</li>
      <li>Very gentle for gums and gets teeth super-clean - much better than what is in the stores.  </li>
      <li>Very soft and comfortable to use but still effective.  </li>
      <li>When this appeared as a vine option for me, I was excited for him to try it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this toothbrush i have it on autoship. Soft bristles for my sensitive teeth. The bristles are small enough and they are almost like floss.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended!  Excellent for sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> Everything as advertised.  Super Seller!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this Model Toothbrush. It&#x27;s a shame I can only find it on Amazon; Add-On Item as that.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft but unbelievably effective.  It is extremely gentle on your gums, so I feel comfortable brushing longer at the gumline.  The bristles are more narrow and have the ability to get into the nooks and crannies. It&#x27;s hard to believe but when I am done brushing my mouth feels as clean as when I use my Sonicare - and it&#x27;s $150 less!!</li>
    <li> really feels better than any toothbrush I have ever owned. Like a washcloth for you teeth!</li>
    <li> Want to really fight gum disease?  This toothbrush is a breakthrough, especially if you combine it with a dab of immune system stimulating and bad bacteria fighting (want good but not bad) essential oils, like the orawellness.  Another good thing is bee propolis like the Pure Propolis Toothpaste.  These may be pricier than usual toothpaste, but goes a long way and is a lot cheaper than dentists.  I also use calcium carbonate powder and tumeric powder instead of the more abrasives in regular toothpastes, and for the top of the teeth use a different toothbrush (want to protect the fine bristles of this Colgate Slim).  For the gums, just delicately massage the Slim bristles between the tooth and gums, until you can really feel it gently working in there.  Be sure have a drop of the good stuff mentioned above to get down in that gum line.  Goodluck!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing.  Found it in Walgreens and bought them all the next day and now I got one for each of my children.  Soft bristles like a baby hair brush but a bit firmer, doesn&#x27;t make me gag when I brush, and just a pleasant overall feel.</li>
    <li> Always wanted a soft toothbrush, and finally found one. Works great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> Pro: when I use this, my mouth has that just left the dentist clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Con: the super soft bristles seem to wear out faster than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;But my teeth and gums are easily worth a bit more money per year.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched - I have never found a soft brush toothpick until now.  I have not been to the dentist in 20 years.  Thankfully my teeth are in great condition.  But I have scrubbed my gums to the point that my roots are exposed.  The dentist gave me on of these and I love it.  I went to the dentist 3 months ago and the toothbrush is still in great shape.  I brush several times a day.  Who likes the taste of leftover food in their mouth?  Not me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for this toothbrush locally, but could not find it.  So off to Amazon again and found exactly what I wanted at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable to use but still effective.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to toothbrushes that made them all get collectively stiffer, but this is not soft. It was at least a medium.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH! Tap the brush against the gum line and wiggle the brush tips for a great gum massage. Price is great here. Could only find it at a local supermarket and was paying close to $5.00 for ONE brush! At this price I can afford a new brush once a month.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding these brushes so I order them from Amazon.  I love how slender the tips are for getting in between the teeth(almost like a floss but more gentle).</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes on the planet</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what else to say.  You should be using a soft toothbrush so you don&#x27;t damage the enamel of your teeth.  I ordered 8 of them because I can&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I have ever used no matter what the price. It is soft, slim &amp; fits my mouth perfectly. The grip is also the best I have used.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is just as described, it has a very soft brush head and the handle is very slim. I like the way it feels in my hand (my hands are pretty small). I immediately noticed a difference in the feel of the bristles, these are pointy instead of round like most toothbrushes. I like it, I feel like it can get in between my teeth a bit better. My only complain is that the neck of the brush head is a bit too flexible, I wish it was more firm.</li>
    <li> I usually use a Sonicare, but like to rotate with a manual toothbrush periodically because my teeth feel cleaner that way. I love this toothbrush! Its bristles taper to extra fine tips that almost look like a fine paintbrush. They&#x27;re supposed to really get between teeth with a flossing action and they really work! My teeth and gums feel great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it especially nice after a dental cleaning, which always leaves my gums a bit tender.</li>
    <li> We took this Colgate Slim Soft Gliding Tip toothbrush with us on vacation and it worked for the two weeks it was used with no issues. Brush isn&#x27;t harsh and it&#x27;s comfortable to use. We still prefer our electronic brushes for home use but this brush worked for a temporary need.</li>
    <li> As someone who loathes flossing, I&#x27;m always looking for something that will help make the process easier.  This toothbrush really does the trick.  It&#x27;s small and compact, so it can reach even into hard-to-reach places at the back of the mouth, and the bristles are so thin that they can get little bits of food or plaque out that other brushes have missed.  I was really surprised by how much cleaner my mouth felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not saying you should skip flossing altogether, but this would be a great brush for those times when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full floss-and-brush routine, like after lunch at work.</li>
    <li> Thin / micro bristles are actually very good for cleaning teeth.  They get not only between teeth, but also between tooth and gum, where larger bristles don&#x27;t get and where bateria grow.  (Source: my dentist.)  It&#x27;s strong and lasts a long time too.  Nice that I&#x27;ve found a brush to settle on.</li>
    <li> I use an electric toothbrush as well as manual toothbrushes (they both have their strengths and weaknesses), and when I use a manual toothbrush, I usually choose a medium softness. But when I saw commercials for the Colgate Slim Soft, I thought it seemed like a good design. The fact that it didn&#x27;t have stiff, complicated \\&quot;cross-action\\&quot; bristles (and an overly large brush head that barely fits in your mouth and is too large to really do a good job) was very appealing.    Don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t occur to me to search for it on Amazon, as it took me a while to find it in my local stores. Anyway, I bought it and loved the feel. Though the bristles are soft, they&#x27;re \\&quot;springy,\\&quot; and provide a very comfortable but thorough cleaning. The handle is slim, but very flexible, making using the brush an almost massage-like experience. And those slim bristles really do what Colgate promises, making it tempting to skip flossing, even though we shouldn&#x27;t. I think this brush would also be an excellent choice for kids, as the head is compact (making it easier to get into those difficult-to-reach areas), and is so comfortable to use that children might even spend a bit longer brushing.    It seems a bit odd to enthuse over something as basic as a toothbrush, but considering that we generally use one more than once a day, finding one that makes a boring but necessary bit of hygiene maintenance into a pleasurable experience is something to write about. I intend to stock up because I now love this brush so much that I&#x27;d be seriously brassed off if it were ever discontinued. I haven&#x27;t used my electric toothbrush since I bought the Slim Soft, though I still think it&#x27;s a good idea to alternate using an electric and manual brush.day, feeling too funky to attend to anything other than more sleep, I didn&#x27;t get around to brushing my teeth again until later that evening. Normally, one&#x27;s teeth would start to feel a bit furry by then (especially when you&#x27;re ill), but this toothbrush got my teeth so clean (even more so than my electric toothbrush), that they still felt clean the following night. After using this brush, you might be inclined to miss a brushing session, except that it&#x27;s such a pleasure to use that teeth cleaning actually becomes a pleasant experience. &#x27;Bye for now. Clearly, I must go get a life...</li>
    <li> I often find even soft brushes to be irritating to my mouth - not so with this toothbrush! The slim bristles made this one of the nicest toothbrushes I have ever used. Sadly, I took mine on a trip to New York and forgot it behind, meaning I need to buy a new one even sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice, I recommend it to anyone with sensitive gums or mouth.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are nice. They feel a little different than the bristles on most other tooth brushes. These feels like they are very thin and soft. Almost like a soft hairbrush, but for your teeth. Because of the super softness of the bristles, there&#x27;s also no fancy staggering of them, with some being shorter and some longer for scraping around the gum line and such, They are all the same length which is fine since there are many people who prefer this design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the brush head itself seems a little too small for my liking. It&#x27;s the same size as the really cheap toothbrushes you&#x27;d buy if you were traveling and forgot yours at home. With the small rectangular head that looks like it is either cheap or mean for kids, not adults. I suppose it&#x27;s possible that with the kind of soft, thin bristles on this brush, it might not work as well if the head was larger. Perhaps there would then be so many bristles that it would become too dense with them and they may not clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it is a very nice brush, I personally prefer a toothbrush with a bit larger design. But for anyone who like the simple, smaller design and is looking for bristles on a brush that are super soft, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> A nice small head that makes it easy to maneuver in small adult mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice handle making it easy to hold even with tired aching hands.&lt;br /&gt;while great at getting along the gum line does not irritate my sensitive gums</li>
    <li> First floss tip toothbrush i&#x27;ve used,....won&#x27;t buy anything else from here on out, what a difference. Best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever  bought!</li>
    <li> Finally a toothbrush that is really soft, flexible and efficient to use.  Just the right size too.</li>
    <li> There are no fancy gimmicks to this toothbrush; it&#x27;s a pretty standard, straight-bristle brush with a contoured, comfortable handle. This brush does an adequate job of cleaning without all the unnecessary bells &amp; whistles of some of the pricier brushes. All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and tend to get mild gingivitis. This works great and I&#x27;ve notice better results than when I floss. That&#x27;s just me but I&#x27;m a huge fan</li>
    <li> I was expecting blue but got one that&#x27;s purple.</li>
    <li> that made me give up my OralB 40 after 45 years!  This is flat out the best toothbrush on the planet!  Try it.  Your teeth and gums will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> good for smaller mouths</li>
    <li> It is so far the best brush I ever had.  My gums shrunk back which might partly be because the brushes were not soft enough (even it is soft toothbrush).  This was very soft for my gum.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good toothbrush for getting between the teeth. I especially like it because the bristles are not too hard.</li>
    <li> I use several toothbrushes in my daily routine.  I like a slim soft brush to get to the hard to reach areas behind my molars and to massage my gums and also a medium stiffness brush to help really scrub the surface of my teeth with my whitening toothpaste to help[ with stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush features a smaller and slimmer head that is good for maneuvering in the tight spaces around my back molars as well as soft flexible bristles that are thinner on the ends than regular bristles that seem to get under the gumline and really massages my gums without irritation.  My mouth just feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those that want more gum massage and those that want a slimmer head.</li>
    <li> I just received my first Voxbox from Influenster. I received a SlimSoft toothbrush from Colgate and also a few little bonuses (a travel sized total advanced toothpaste and mouthwash). I just used them to brush my teeth after lunch.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the products today and I have to say, I am not disappointed. I was a little skeptical at first, as the bristles are a lot softer than other soft toothbrushes and I usually use a medium brush but that changed as soon as I started brushing. I AM LOVING IT! It feels like a million soft bristles massaging your teeth and gums. You definitely feel the difference with this one. It does exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using it and I will be letting you guys know if anything changes my opinion. But, as of right now, I am sold!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Influenster and Colgate, I have found my new favorite toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this brush to me. Previously I was using a Colgate 360 brush but she thought that it was too harsh, even though I used the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; version. She wanted me to buy this brush because she said that not only is it much softer but that it does a better job cleaning between the teeth. I&#x27;m disappointed with this brush because it is too soft for me. I feel that my teeth are not as clean when I am done. I brush longer when using this toothbrush because I feel that it is not doing it&#x27;s job and yet I still feel like they are not as clean. I&#x27;m one of those people that brush my tongue after I am done brushing my teeth and this brush doesn&#x27;t do that well, either, as it is too soft to do a good job. I&#x27;m not sure if it does a better job cleaning between the teeth. I floss first and then brush and have not noticed a difference between this brush and the 360 regarding that. I&#x27;m happier with the 360 brush.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Price in this has gone up $2. Get them elsewhere. You have to replace this type very often or it doesn&#x27;t clean as well. So the price is ridiculous here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best toothbrush ever.  Feels really good on your gums too.  Makes my teeth slippery.  I&#x27;ve never had that effect with a manual toothbrush before.  I really LOVE this toothbrush.  The only downside is that you have to replace them often.  Like every 2-3 weeks. The blue indicator wears off fast. The bristles are so fine that they wear down quickly and you no longer get the same effect.  But I keep buying them because they are CHEAP!</li>
    <li> Years ago, there was a toothbrush that had bristles that went in between the individual teeth, and, of course, they stopped making it. Then came a decade of incomprehensible toothbrush designs, most of which I can&#x27;t even hold properly while brushing. Fast forward to today, and, hooray, my fav toothbrush is back in fashion! BTW, it&#x27;s great if you have braces...seems to get into those tight spaces.</li>
    <li> I usually go for \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes and when I received this from Influenster a few months ago, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am IN LOVE with this toothbrush. While I&#x27;ve always went for \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrushes, I find that some of them were a bit stiff. The thing I like the most about this toothbrush is that it&#x27;s incredibly flexible. If I go in and scrub my teeth the way I want, I can be confident that it won&#x27;t make my gums sore and irritated. It&#x27;s also small enough to fit in all the hard to reach places. I love the feel of this brush on my teeth and gums!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is... I can&#x27;t seem to find it at any store in my area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free from Influenster for review purposes. All opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> This is a nice standard toothbrush and I liked that the bristles were soft, but I found the handle not to work as well as other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used. I suppose I&#x27;m spoiled but it seemed like it was more work to get to back molars, particularly on the inside.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching forever for a truly soft toothbrush, and this is it.  Holds up well over time as well.  My favorite toothbrush of all time!  I only wish there were a brush this soft for my Braun electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Very soft and dense bristles, the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> It may seems silly to get excited about a toothbrush, but I absolutely love this one.  It feels great and seems to reach well in between my teeth.  It seems also to later the toothpaste more.  This is the toothbrush I have been trying to find for years!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has to be loved from people and it deserve love enough.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has very very thin bristles and also they are very soft so I can remove every leftover in my mouse after meal whatever it is. That&#x27;s why I purchased 20 this item from South Korea.</li>
    <li> Very gentle for gums and gets teeth super-clean - much better than what is in the stores.  Nice compact size and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to do much flossing after brushing with these. Plus eco-friendly--no electricity.</li>
    <li> I have an eroded gumline and the sensitivity that comes along with that. I am overzealous when I brush and probably brush a little too often. I have always used the softest toothbrushes I could find, but have to force myself to brush gently and carefully. This little toothbrush is amazingly soft and gentle on my abused roots. It cleans super well but lets me treat my teeth with the care they deserve. From now on I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I needed something for travel and this worked perfectly for me. It cleans my teeth, gets the hard to reach back areas, and is a good size for the suitcase.</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite toothbrush!!!  Soft yet gets the job done.  It&#x27;s like a massage for the gums!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! I have some fairly wide gaps between some of the my teeth due to gum recession and I feel like this toothbrush does a much better job at getting into all the crevices. It&#x27;s also very soft and comfortable to brush with. My only issue with this is the price almost doubled since I started buying it.</li>
    <li> Really gets into all of the little crevices. It&#x27;s like brushing and flossing your teeth at the same time. I feel like the head is a little narrow, but I am used to Oral B brushes where the head is huge and wide.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Doesn&#x27;t hurt you gums</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few months ago and I adore it! It&#x27;s very soft on my teeth and gums, no risk of scratching my enamel or bleeding.</li>
    <li> Saw the TV ads for this new toothbrush (by Colgate).  I&#x27;ve tried it for myself and am so glad that someone finally came out with a toothbrush that cleans well along the gum line and even can fit between well-spaced teeth.  I&#x27;ll be buying this new Colgate for the entire family!</li>
    <li> Soft bristles work well.  Best toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Everybody should have one.Bye Bye Dentist !</li>
    <li> I love soft toothbrushes so I assumed this one would be awesome. The bristles are so thin and it&#x27;s so soft that you have to use some force or your teeth don&#x27;t feel clean. However, if you use force it scratches the heck out of your gums leaving them sore. My boyfriend got the medium bristles even though he ordered soft. He still gave it a try and had pretty much the same issues. I think the bristles are just so thin they are sharp, if that makes sense. Save your money and stick to whatever you are using as a tooth brush. I have already went back to using a basic Oral B and I love it. Gimmicks are sometimes no more that just that..... a gimmick, which is the case here.</li>
    <li> I love these Colgate toothbrushes.  They are very gentle on my teeth and have soft bristles.  I highly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a manual toothbrush, but when I do, it is this one because I bought several.  Actually, it does get between the tooth and gum and clean it nicely.  And it is two bucks cheaper here than my local store.  Cheap and great for travel.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush gets right into the gumline without hurting. I love it.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than Amazon.</li>
    <li> We really like these toothbrushes... but...  For some reason, we keep getting all the same color toothbrushes in our orders (we generally order 2 at a time).  I know that this sounds picky, but hubby &amp; I use the color of the toothbrush to tell whose toothbrush it is.  For 3 orders, we received only purple and this last order we received only pink.  Since I had 1 purple left over from the last order, we will be ok when we change out the toothbrushes next time, but this time, hubby had to put a label on his purple toothbrush to distinguish it from mine.  This is not a fault of the manufacturer, thus I gave 5 stars for the rating of the toothbrushes.  This is the fault of whoever is packing the boxes, so Amazon, please ask your packing department to pick up different colors in situations like this.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads because it enables them to more easily get to back teeth while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the two designs from this line that I tried, the Gliding Tip has a narrow flat top to it’s bristles and the Pro Tip has raised tips on the end bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me longer to brush with the Slim Gliding brush because it has fewer and softer bristles than I am used to.  I didn’t feel like my teeth or gums were getting as clean as with the Colgate 360 Total Advanced brush I prefer.  But the Slim brush is certainly a better choice for someone with a smaller mouth and more sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> What makes this toothbrush different from your standard toothbrush? The slim soft gliding tips on this one are super skinny (they say 17 times slimmer than a standard toothbrush bristle). I usually get in trouble at the dentist for brushing too hard (and not flossing enough), and although this toothbrush won&#x27;t take the place of flossing, I felt like it did do a better job of getting into tight spaces and cleaning along the gumline.</li>
    <li> My husband hates to shop.  Basically, he tells me what he wants, and it&#x27;s up to me to find him something he&#x27;ll like.  We&#x27;ve had tons of toothbrushes come and go over the years, but nothing was quite right (yeah, he&#x27;s a bit of a fussy one).  He&#x27;s always had very sensitive gums, and his teeth are closer together than most, so he already has a tough time with flossing anyway.  When this appeared as a vine option for me, I was excited for him to try it.  I hate admitting that I was excited to have him try a toothbrush, but hey, I never said life was exciting around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it really works great.  The head is small, and easy to maneuver between and around his teeth and gums.  The bristles are almost floss like thin, and it really does the job.  Even the dentist commented on it a few weeks ago at his checkup, and that was only after using it about two and a half weeks.  Looks like a winner!</li>
    <li> Good brush. Since it&#x27;s a little pricey, I wish they offered a multipack.</li>
    <li> Bought based on reviews, and this toothbrush didn&#x27;t disappoint. There was a learning curve but it really gets your teeth cleaner. At first, my gums were getting irritated but I realized that I was brushing too hard like I had been with previous brushes. With this brush, a soft brushing is all it takes. My flossing has become much more &#x27;unproductive&#x27; but I still do it every day to cover my tooth cleaning bases.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothbrush.  It is funny to be excited about a toothbrush, but this one is a winner.  The bristles are very thin and can get in between your teeth almost like dental floss.  It is soft too, but does a good job cleaning your teeth without irritating your gums.  Good checkup at the dentist too!</li>
    <li> This brush is way too soft.  The impression from the ad is the tips act like floss picks.  The bristles are so soft that they bend instead of getting in between teeth.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is much different than any  I&#x27;ve ever used. The fine bristle ends can reach under the gum line and between the teeth for additional flossing. This is an added benefit when flossing isn&#x27;t done on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works better and gets under the gum line gently and effectively. I&#x27;m so glad that my dentist was thoughtful enough to give me one!</li>
    <li> No better than a cheap generic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush for getting slightly in between your teeth. It does a good job of cleaning your teeth. I wish it had a tongue cleaner as well, as many others do. The handle is nothing extraordinary. It is bulky and will not fit in the toothbrush holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a soft toothbrush and great if you are suffering from any sensitivity as I was when I tried it.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!!!  It is so fine that it can get in places other brushes cannot.  I bought 6 and gave one to each family member - everyone wants to stick with this brush.  Great for people with receding gum lines.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of toothbrushes over the years because I haev a lot of dental work and every other brush would hurt really bad when I used them. I then came upon this brush and decided to order it. I used it just once and was amazed. I never going back this is my brush. I love it. If you have a lot of dental work like crowns and what not this is the brush you want for your sensitve gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> Have been obsessed with this brush for months now. My teeth have never felt this clean. Its simple design makes it feel like all surface area is covered. Love this brush.</li>
    <li> Found a use for this that isn&#x27;t exactly what was advertised.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a flossing toothbrush, but this one is the softest &amp; least damaging one for gums I&#x27;ve come across.  Most of the ones that say for sensitive gums still make gums bleed.  This one didn&#x27;t, cleans teeth, &amp; is a real winner!  I&#x27;d recommend this one for cancer pts. or anyone with gum problems.  The longer, thin flossing tips actually seem to do what they are meant to do.  A great toothbrush for anyone, sensitive gums or not.</li>
    <li> Love the soft, slim, floss.style bristles. Will defitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality toothbrush - handle is sturdy, and the bristles feel like dental floss - feels much better than generic toothbrushes.  It scrubs quite well for the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush. Just the right bristle softness, but strong enough to take my aggressive brushing. The handle is very comfortable. The toothbrush reaches well to the backside of my rear molars  No tongue scrubber on the backside of the toothbrush head which is awesome as I hate that abrasive surface rubbing other areas of my mouth. I love don&#x27;t so much, I put it on Amazon&#x27;s monthly reorder and shipping subscription program. Now I always get a toothbrush when I need it, and I always get the one I want without wasting time searching at my local drugstores.</li>
    <li> Who knew a toothbrush could make this much of a difference? The bristles on this brush are soft and fine. I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but after brushing with this, my teeth feel so much cleaner, like straight from the dentist. It seems to do a really good job of getting deep between the teeth and after a few days of use, my gums feel healthier too. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these in the future for sure!!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush feels different than the others. It is so soft... So soft it makes your gums feel mapmered and your teeth squeeking clean. I am still using my first one, but will definitely repurchase, because I cannot imagine going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this amazing toothbrush!! Try it! Its like a soft extra scrubby yet gentle massage with that post floss clean feeling to follow.  This is my permanent brush no .</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is so comfortable to use because of its flat bristles that get in between teeth and under the gumline just fine. I&#x27;ve always used soft bristles, but my mouth was constantly sore from the multi-depth bristles that did more scraping than brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing. It massages my gums like I think they should&#x27;ve been massaged all along.</li>
    <li> Bristles not as soft as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush..Very soft</li>
    <li> Best bristles ever.  My teeth feel clean like I just came from the dentist.</li>
    <li> Received exactly as ordered.  I purchased these toothbrushes for my family at Christmas and we all like them very much.  Weeks later....After using these for awhile we all really like them and will definitely buy them again!</li>
