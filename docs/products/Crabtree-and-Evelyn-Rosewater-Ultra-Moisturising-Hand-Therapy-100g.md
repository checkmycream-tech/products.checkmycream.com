      <li>This product always seems to bring back some kind of memory (of a relative who had some kind of rose perfume/soap); so fun to see the reaction of the recipients to this lovely scent!</li>
      <li>Do not buy products from this company if you want healthy, natural, and chemical- free beauty products.</li>
      <li>I really love this product &amp; highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>It goes on and does not leave your hands greasy but leaves your hands smooth and soft and is so good for rough, chapped hands.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the original, but this is decent.</li>
      <li>It is creamy &amp; smooth, makes your hands.feel silky &amp; soft without leaving them feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>hands were soft, smooth, and as good as if I&#x27;d used Vaseline overnight on them but without ay of the greasiness that comes with the petroleum heavy lotions.</li>
      <li>The lotion itself is white, creamy, and easy to spread but not greasy.  </li>

      <li>Since it&#x27;s been dry recently in winter, I use it after washing hand everytime, and it works out really good.</li>
      <li>I have very dry hands and have tried many hand lotions/creams.  </li>
      <li>product which is thick, greasy, and makes my hands turn red (although it does smell like roses), rather than the refreshing, hydrating authentic Crabtree &amp; Evelyn product which I can even use on my face!  </li>

      <li>you so much.</li>

      <li>Hands stay soft even after being washed.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like young roses...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love, omg love!</li>
    <li> I have really dry hands. Probably because I wash them 50 times a day at least. To the point that my knuckles start developing white lines and cracks if I don&#x27;t moisturize. Once I get to that point, it usually takes a few days of lotioning up to get my hands looking normal again. Not with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;My hands were soft, smooth, and as good as if I&#x27;d used Vaseline overnight on them but without ay of the greasiness that comes with the petroleum heavy lotions. This hand lotion truly delivers and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. The smell is wonderful as well. It is not overpowering, but a soft sophisticated lingering.  I got a couple of tubes in a different &#x27;flavor&#x27; for my daughter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this line of products was parabens free. That would make it absolutely perfect enough for me to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed in this hand cream.  I had purchased it several times at the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn stores in my area, and this online purchase did not have the same quality as in the store.  It is very watery, and doesn&#x27;t feel as nice on my skin.  I will continue to buy it at the store and not online.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hand lotion!  My hands feel great every time I use this lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy at all.  I would recommend this to every girl out there.</li>
    <li> I prefer the original, but this is decent.</li>
    <li> My friend finds this a very good product. It has an old fashioned scent which is wonderful and she says it does a good job too.</li>
    <li> I really loved the smell and feel of this product, until I read the ingredients list.

    <li> smells great, feels good.</li>
    <li> I love rosewater and this hand cream is excellent. It smells very well and really helped moisturize my dry hands.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands and have tried many hand lotions/creams.  This is terrific - especially since it contains shea butter.  And yes, it does have the nice smell of roses.  That doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I do wish they made an unscented version.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. I love it ~ Thank you so much. I love it ~Thank you so much. I love it ~Thank you so much. I love it ~Thank you so much. I love it ~</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  It is the best hand creme, hand therapy, that I&#x27;ve ever used.  And, I&#x27;m a very difficult customer to please.  I don&#x27;t like spending money on products that don&#x27;t work.  Thank you... And, thank you for allowing a price that isn&#x27;t off the charts expensive.</li>
    <li> Works well,hands soft.Smells wonderful. Gave as Christmas presents also. Friends loved it. Big hit. Will continue to use and give again as gifts.</li>
    <li> Crabtree and Evelyn is a reputable skin product so I was not surprised to feel the benefits of this hand lotion.  Smells of soft roses too.  I highly recommend it for those looking to moisturize hands on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of roses and decided to buy this lotion on whim. It doesn&#x27;t smell like young roses...it smells like old roses. There is a powdery smell in the lotion that is bearable but I just don&#x27;t like it. It smells yucky! It&#x27;s honestly not as moisturizing as I would like my lotions to be but the upside is that there is no greasy residue. I have come to dislike the toothpaste-tube packaging! I need to roll it up like a toothpaste tube to get out all the lotion and the aluminum tube is so banged up at this point it is no longer classy. But, I paid too much for this lotion and am not letting it go to waste. Definitely NOT a repurchase!</li>
    <li> I used to use this hand lotion all the time, but I was diagnosed with celiac disease years ago and cannot use gluten-containing products because they could actually cause tissue damage.  If you, too, need to avoid wheat because of a legit medical concern, please be aware that this product contains wheat and could give you dermatitis herpetiformis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no trouble with wheat or gluten, lucky you - buy this lotion, because it&#x27;s one of the best out there for dry hands and it smells SO GOOD.</li>
    <li> I usually absolutely hate lotion, but I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s the only lotion i&#x27;ll wear. The smell is strong when you put it on but quickly fades to a lovely traditional, natural rose smell - I wish I could find a perfume that smelled as close to true rose as this does. Not greasy, not slimy, &amp; a little bit goes a long way, it soaks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross film. i put it on my feet and wrar socks to bed, and it does the trick better than any other oily, slimy product ive ever tried. Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> Never have disliked any of their produces and this was no exception. The rose scent is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use this every night. It smells great and makes my hands silky soft.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have found in a long time.  It goes on and does not leave your hands greasy but leaves your hands smooth and soft and is so good for rough, chapped hands.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This smells awful. Smells like an old lady, very floral. I do like Crab Tree and Evelyn products just not this scent</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the recommend online, and it proved to be deserve it. Smells really well and work out fine. Since it&#x27;s been dry recently in winter, I use it after washing hand everytime, and it works out really good. Not too oil, but moisture enough.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday just love it  and of all the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products I love the Rosewater best.</li>
    <li> Pleasant not overpowering scent. Pricey for a hand cream but it is a decent size and will last longer too. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Lovely.  Great moisturizer and smells delightful.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tube of lotion after testing the scent at a boutique.  The online cost was over 20% cheaper.  The fragrance is a light, old-fashioned rose.  The lotion itself is white, creamy, and easy to spread but not greasy.  This leaves hands feeling lovely but not slimy like so many hand creams.  Hands stay soft even after being washed.  The fragrance is wonderful for evening use, my husband, who does not like a heavy perfume, seems to like this hand cream much more than others I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Winter weather makes my hands very dry. I tried some of this in a store and had to buy it. Really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I never really used hand lotion, or thought to until a coworker introduced me to this brand. Smells beautiful, and makes hands feel like silk without making them greasy.</li>
    <li> This product always seems to bring back some kind of memory (of a relative who had some kind of rose perfume/soap); so fun to see the reaction of the recipients to this lovely scent!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you can tell from the photo but this is  large lotion. Its fits in my purse just fine but you get a lot for what you pay. It worked right away and the smells is amazing. If you don&#x27;t like roses I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you purchase this, but if you don&#x27;t mind it this is an amazing hand cream.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever had!!! It is creamy &amp; smooth, makes your hands.feel silky &amp; soft without leaving them feeling greasy.  I really love this product &amp; highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love hand lotions by this bran. The smell is wonderful and the moisturizing qualities are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Truly, I LOVE the GENUINE Crabtree &amp; Evelyn product.  I have successfully ordered it via Amazon 2 or 3 times.  The problem is:  This time I did not get it.  I received instead a poor imitation from &#x27;CosmeticBeauty&#x27; :{  What they sent me was an obviously fraudulent (from the packaging to the appearance of the tube: shoddy printing, not matching true product- parts of the tube are unprinted metal!) product which is thick, greasy, and makes my hands turn red (although it does smell like roses), rather than the refreshing, hydrating authentic Crabtree &amp; Evelyn product which I can even use on my face!  VERY disappointed this time.</li>
