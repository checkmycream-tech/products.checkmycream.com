      <li>In love and extremely easy to use.</li>

      <li>These arrived fine from the seller, no problem there.  </li>
      <li>These are made well and are comfortable to sleep on.</li>
      <li>I thought they were smooth.</li>
      <li>These will also be great for curling really short hair.</li>
      <li>Good product and quantity for the price and the quality is better than rods I purchased from commercial beauty supply stores.  </li>
      <li>Does what it suppose to and thought I would need more but they,re just the right amount in this pack.</li>
      <li>Good design and works better than the other brand rods.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The rods were as good as it came after initial use.</li>
      <li>They are good to use like regular rollers.</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable and the rollers fit just fine.</li>
      <li>Arrived quick.</li>
      <li>Construction is sturdy, and the length and thickness are about right.</li>
      <li>I will warn you however that though they do come in great numbers (48 exactly), the perm rods themselves are rather small.</li>
      <li>Absolutely effective and for such an amazing price, you should not pass it down.</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
      <li>They worked great in hot water for my marley hair but if you pul the rubber string to hard it will pop off, you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Overall for perm rods they are ok</li>
      <li>These are the first perm rollers that I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>Definitely buy it and enjoy!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>These perm rods are exactly as pictured and exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these, I remember only seeing them in the hair salon</li>
      <li>These are very small and do a great job.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to use these because they are smooth and have little ridges.  </li>
      <li>I use them for bobbins for crocheting to hold small amounts of yarn when doing color changes and they work wonderful!</li>
      <li>The results lasted me much longer than a flexi rod set as well.</li>
      <li>Probably wont get much use out of them.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to do my whole head</li>
      <li>Nothing much  to say here.</li>
      <li>I use these to curl the very ends of my hair when I do a braid/twist out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty comfortable to sleep in, depends where you place them and hope long your hair is.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for much less than in most beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>These are a great replacement, I only do home perms twice a year, and they will last a long time.</li>
      <li>They are kind of small</li>
      <li>so I like that I have more than enough, especially for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>Very old school</li>
      <li>I was going for a natural look although my hair is relaxed and I achieved the look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural and needed some rods for tighter curls.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m loving these perm rods, I use a little over half for my whole head</li>
      <li>I received 48 (I believe) for one small, fabulous price.  </li>
      <li>my hair is super curly with the long pink perm rods.</li>
      <li>It came very quickly and so far, I&#x27;ve only broken about 2, but that&#x27;s probably more on me pulling way too hard on the head, rather than a fault with the product.</li>
      <li>It took me hours to put them all in my hair, and if you&#x27;re not careful the rubber bands can snap as well.</li>
      <li>At first it was odd to take off the end cap, fold the rubber band material over the opening and then replace the cap.</li>
      <li>These pink rods are relatively small but they are strong and do the job I needed them to do on smaller hairs near the neckline.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been natural for that long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Met my expectations. You get a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> Love these! my hair is flawless every time (but maybe that&#x27;s just all me lol)</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for much less than in most beauty supply stores. My ends come out perfectly curled every time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these, I remember only seeing them in the hair salon and now they work perfectly to curl my natural hair. My hair dries faster and I don&#x27;t need to blow dry. It&#x27;s pretty comfortable to sleep in, depends where you place them and hope long your hair is. Overall I&#x27;m loving these perm rods, I use a little over half for my whole head so I like that I have more than enough, especially for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> The rods met my expectations rations, however the do break easily (the part that links the closing top to the rod).</li>
    <li> Good design and works better than the other brand rods.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. My hair is a little long for these but they work. The value is great. These are much more expensive at the beauty store.</li>
    <li> I was going for a natural look although my hair is relaxed and I achieved the look. I will purchase again ; bigger rollers however, as my hair continues to grow out in length.</li>
    <li> These rods were skinnier than I thought they would be. If you are looking at various websites with styling ideas, these are not the same pink rods. Other than that, they are rods and work as expected.</li>
    <li> my hair is super curly with the long pink perm rods. at first i thought i got the wrong size...but they were perfect.</li>
    <li> They worked great in hot water for my marley hair but if you pul the rubber string to hard it will pop off, you get what you pay for. Its a good deal for the amount i payed</li>
    <li> Used these for my protective style that I did myself. Turned out swell.</li>
    <li> Used them already for one perm. Construction is sturdy, and the length and thickness are about right. Very easy to use too. I definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Several of these perm rods have snapped. I have only had these a year. Why are they breaking already? Use these as a last resort.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my ends when I twist my hair and I love them. The curl holds better when I use these.</li>
    <li> These arrived fine from the seller, no problem there.  Wasn&#x27;t able to use these because they are smooth and have little ridges.  I thought of trying to buy end papers, but with locs decided to just not use them and give them to a stylist.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones sold at the beauty store, for a fraction of the price. We buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> Arrived 4 days after I ordered them:) I used 2 just for the front of my hair, and it worked great! Can&#x27;t wait to do my whole head</li>
    <li> Good product and quantity for the price and the quality is better than rods I purchased from commercial beauty supply stores.  Used them and had amazing results with my hair!</li>
    <li> Love them, love them, love them.</li>
    <li> I love there&#x27;s perm rods! I have pretty short hair, and these give me the perfect curls that I want! I normally just plait my hair, then roll them up with these, take them down later on and my curls start for at least a week. Once I unbraid my hair, it&#x27;s perfect! The only issue with these is that the rubber band popped on a few of them, but it should be fixable.</li>
    <li> Good quality, I needed them because the elastics are breaking on the set I have.  These are a great replacement, I only do home perms twice a year, and they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Snagged my hair. I thought they were smooth. Will not be able to use them</li>
    <li> These pink rods are relatively small but they are strong and do the job I needed them to do on smaller hairs near the neckline.</li>
    <li> These pink rods sold by Marianna are NOT the standard size pink rods. They are tiny and thin, the standard size of the blue just painted pink.</li>
    <li> Nothing much  to say here. They are sturdy and arrived as described.</li>
    <li> love the price will buy again</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly, i was impressed by that. but i after i used them the second time, some of the elastic bands snapped. but overall it is serving its purpose.</li>
    <li> The price is reasonable and the rollers fit just fine.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Perfect. In love and extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so I could do a spiral twishout on my hair.  I twisted my hair first then I rolled the twisht on here.  Once dry I had  very defined twisted spirals.</li>
    <li> They are just how they are on the picture awesome</li>
    <li> The rubber parts tangled with the hair like you would believe. Had to literally cute some of them out. Very old school</li>
    <li> These perm rods are exactly as pictured and exactly as advertised. It&#x27;s all up to the user once you have the in your hands. You either know how to roll hair or you don&#x27;t. :)</li>
    <li> What can you say about perm wave rods.  They do the job that they are suppose to do.  They seem sturdy and I hope to get many years of use out of them.</li>
    <li> These kinds of rollers are hard to find in the stores now. Worked well for my home perm. Just wish they came in a smaller size for those of us with short hair. If they were smaller (shorter) I would give them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are the first perm rollers that I have purchased.  Love the stretch cord that snugly hold the hair.  I received 48 (I believe) for one small, fabulous price.  May order in a larger roll size in the future.  These are sturdy and will hold up.</li>
    <li> This were too small for my long hair so I used it on my little sister and wow the curls came out really tight and curly and they last long time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Works great wonders on transitioners who are going from perms to natural! You get a lot in the package! They are kind of small but it&#x27;s just because if the size I got.. I plan on getting some bigger ones</li>
    <li> I have had these rods for a few months and should have returned them. They were a bit too small my for length but I kept them instead of returning them. My hair kept getting pulled tangled on them. Probably wont get much use out of them.</li>
    <li> I do not use these for perms. They are good to use like regular rollers. They will give the body of a perm if I use them to roll my hair after washing it. These are made well and are comfortable to sleep on.</li>
    <li> I use these to curl the very ends of my hair when I do a braid/twist out. These are very small and do a great job. These will also be great for curling really short hair.</li>
    <li> Claimed to be 4 dozen but only received 12. Heavily disappointed.</li>
    <li> These were great products! Absolutely effective and for such an amazing price, you should not pass it down. I will warn you however that though they do come in great numbers (48 exactly), the perm rods themselves are rather small. It took me hours to put them all in my hair, and if you&#x27;re not careful the rubber bands can snap as well. However my curl patterns were absolutely amazing! The results lasted me much longer than a flexi rod set as well. Definitely buy it and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Gave the permanent and these rods worked. At first it was odd to take off the end cap, fold the rubber band material over the opening and then replace the cap. They worked well and held but I think I like the other style that is just plastic you clip. I would give it a 5 except for the getting used to the closure they have.</li>
    <li> It came very quickly and so far, I&#x27;ve only broken about 2, but that&#x27;s probably more on me pulling way too hard on the head, rather than a fault with the product.</li>
    <li> Great deal, delivered quick.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than i thought but still use them for twistout and braidouts for the ends</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman. I haven&#x27;t been natural for that long and I have no clue what styles I do to my hair, I just improvise. I twist my hair, get a twist-and-loc gel and use the perm rods and they have a fantastic curl!</li>
    <li> My mom always perms her own hair and when she was visiting I wanted to do it for her but all her supplies were back where she lived so i ordered these rods and they came and I was happy to see that they were pretty good quality.  I was afraid that maybe the rubber part would be brittle but these weren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy them again if the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl size will vary depending on length of hair, time it was in the hair, and the type of perm chemicals being used but for us the curls ended up about between 1/2\\&quot; to 3/4\\&quot; in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;The rods were as good as it came after initial use.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to and thought I would need more but they,re just the right amount in this pack.</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  Arrived quick.</li>
    <li> I use them for bobbins for crocheting to hold small amounts of yarn when doing color changes and they work wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great rods, can be used over and over for many home perms. The price was very good for the four dozen rods @ $6.99, I will use them forever.</li>
    <li> Loved them! I need more.</li>
    <li> These are great! They did the job they needed to do and I have them put up to reuse later.</li>
    <li> Great product; produces the bouncy loced curls that I wanted. It&#x27;s just what I needed</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast. Item looked like the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural and needed some rods for tighter curls. They worked great on my hair, but I used them on my sister who hair is relaxed to make curls and I ran across a problem. Her hair kept getting stuck to the rods. Her hair still came out beautiful!</li>
    <li> I was trying something different with my hair and I though these were the rods to use but I believe I was mistaken. Overall for perm rods they are ok</li>
</ol>
