<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The mirror is not as magnified as my prior set.  It serves the purpose, but if it&#x27;s not used in a well-lit area, I reach for my more powerful mirror.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Bought many of these compacts w/tweezers last year for gifts as well as some this year.  Everyone loves it.  Best tweezers ever.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived broken but the tweezers still worked well.</li>
    <li> Seller sent this out very soon after I placed my order.  I had ordered tweezers just like these a few years ago on QVC and they were my favorites so I thought it&#x27;s time for a new pair.  These aren&#x27;t as good quality as the original (old ones really grasped each hair with no trouble), but that&#x27;s a manufacturing issue not the supplier.  Thanks for the fast, attentive service.  I would feel confident ordering from them again!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this product.  It is perfect.  Tweezers are great, and the case is slim and compact.</li>
    <li> I wanted a great magnifying mirror to carry in my purse just is case I needed magnification while out and about.  Good to use if you get something in your eye.  Nice tweezers came with it which is a bonus for me.  Both items were great.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I take this with me when traveling.  The mirror comes in handy for those of us needing magnification for putting on makeup, etc.  Compact size and  convenient to tuck in purse or your cosmetic bag for travel.  Price was great also!</li>
    <li> I am a habitual loser of tweezers.  I buy them all the time and lose them in my purse, around the house, etc.  For this reason, tweezers in a mirrored case are ideal for me.  The case is big enough to keep track of and I always make sure that I put the tweezers back in the case after use.  I did not think that the tweezers would be great quality for the low price, but they are extremely comfortable to hold and are nice and sharp.  The magnifying mirror on the case also makes it easy to spot stray hairs.  Would definitely buy again, but hopefully I won&#x27;t have to!</li>
    <li> only opens to a 90 degree angle. would love if it opened to 180</li>
    <li> My wife is using this all the time for her eyebrows. Good quality, and convenient.</li>
    <li> This is a great little compact.  I had and used one for years until it finally came apart.  I&#x27;m so glad I found one on Amazon.  Really great tool with magnifying mirror for tweezing eyebrows.......and you don&#x27;t have to hunt for your tweezer because it&#x27;s in the compact.  I highly recommend it.  I ordering two of these today!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars for the tweezer alone.  The case and mirror gets 2 stars at best!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom bought three of these sets.  My sister and I both absolutely LOVE our tweezers!!! I couldn&#x27;t imagine tweezing without it; it works much better than ANY tweezer I have ever picked up at walmart/walgreens/etc.  I even like it better than my twice-as-expensive \\&quot;tweezerman\\&quot; tweezer.  The tweezer is very good at grabbing the very short, new hair growths and it doesn&#x27;t break off the thin hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom thinks the tweezers work just ok.... ironically she loves the little mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is really cheap; all three cases cracked at the plastic hinges within a few months.  My mom&#x27;s has since broke off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror would be great... except the case is designed poor.  The part that holds the tweezers sticks out at a 90 degree angle (hitting your nose) so it is impossible to hold the mirror really close to your face.  But my mom doesn&#x27;t have this problem, she tossed the bottom completely and using the top as a little hand held mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO overall: great product if you only want a tweezers... absolute crap if your in the market for a tweezer and mirror product for your purse or suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013 Update:  So I guess I was a little harsh on the case.  I&#x27;ve had it for 6 years now, and the mirror still hasn&#x27;t broken off the hinges.  And I&#x27;ve probably knocked it off the counter at least once a month over the years.  I&#x27;m a total klutz.  ON THE OTHER HAND, my mom, (who takes very good care of her things and is far from klutzy) has gone through three cases in the same amount of time.  And is now having me order three more today (Yes, 3!!! She only need one, but is paranoid Amazon will stop selling them some day). I&#x27;d say she plucks everyday, where as I only every other day.  Point is, I guess it is luck of the draw when it comes to these cases.</li>
    <li> Very pleased; love the product.</li>
    <li> great price the tweezes get even the finest hais ans splinters. I am very satisfied. Thank You</li>
    <li> I was expecting something a little more sturdy.  It will probably be okay to use in emergencies or when something better is not available.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that the compact does not completely unfold. Without being able to see my face/eyebrows in the mirror, I cannot then effectively use the tweezers.</li>
    <li> I really do like the mirror and the style of the whole thing. I wish the tweezers did a good job. They&#x27;re about the same as trying to pluck something with my fingernails!! Maybe I can put another pair of tweezers in this little case for traveling.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave many reviews but I just had to on this product.  The tweezers are the best I have used and the mirror is perfect.  I don&#x27;t think I will need to have my eyebrows waxed anymore because I can see so well with this mirror and the tweezers grab even the tiniest of hair.  Great product.  I am thinking of buying a second one to have in my purse and to leave one at home.</li>
    <li> Good fit traveling- but spring for a lighted magnifying mirror for everyday use!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is the third one I have purchased for myself or as gifts. The tweezers are great in grasping hairs quickly.  The mirror is not the best but for its size it great for travel.  I never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror and tweezers are very good!  I recommend to anyone who needs to see fine hair, chin hair and eyebrows.</li>
    <li> got this set to replace my old one.  i like the magnify mirror  but wished the tweezer was more shaper</li>
    <li> The best tweezers I have had used! I have two sets and will be ordering two more so I always have a set in each room that I&#x27;m in!</li>
    <li> Mirror is just right magnification for me, but the case is very difficult to open.  And I would have preferred just the mirror alone so it would have been thinner and lighter.</li>
    <li> Excellent; everything you need and my daughter wanted mine so I had to buy another for me.</li>
    <li> The floxite is clear and great, but what would make this mirror perfect is if it had a light with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for at least 10 yrs. The case is starting to come off the hindges. I will be buying another one exactly like it. I bought one for my dauther also. I am getting this out to use 5 times a day at least. For make-up, tweezing brows, and checking my chin hair. LOL!!!!</li>
    <li> nice -- a little big for travel but still okay</li>
    <li> I love love love this set!!  I ordered one years ago from QVC for 25.00!  I left it somewhere and ordered 2 more from Amazon because they are fabulous! The mirror magnifies 8 times and if you pluck in the sunlight, it&#x27;s awesome!  I will never be without this again!  plus the price was sooooo much better.  I got 2 sets for what I paid one for!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love the compact case.  The tweezer does a good job and is precise.  I bought these tweezers for my folks years ago and wanted a set for myself.</li>
    <li> Liked the one I had so many years ago, when it broke I was happy to replace it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter.  It&#x27;s a great gift.  If you shape your own brows you need magnification and great tweezers. This set is perfect!</li>
    <li> Received as described.  Just took some time to receive.</li>
    <li> the case won&#x27;t sit on its own.</li>
    <li> Absolutely what I was looking for. Super Fast shipping !!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is too tight to on the case but otherwise OK.</li>
    <li> I use this constantly.  The magnification cannot be beat.  The tweesers are precise and have a good grip.</li>
    <li> This kit is very convienient!! The tweezers are very sharp so be carefulll!!!! The mirror is ok, however they should make the mirror clarity a little better!!! Overall I would recommend this item to a friend!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and I LOVE it. It is fabulous! I would definitely recommend purchasing, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are just OK for me.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> If I would have received this one I would have loved it, but I got a huge one that would never fit in my purse.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are great!  I&#x27;m really impressed with this set, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The only tweezers I will ever purchase. Love the case and the size makes the job easy and the grip makes it better.</li>
    <li> Great magnification, nice tweezers, all in nice portable case that fits in pocketbook.  Bought one for myself and another one for a friend for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these with me at all times!  I have also given as gifts!!  If you have unwanted facial hair or just want to see what your face looks like up close, then this is for you.  Great magnification and excellent tweezers!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I wanted. The tweezers were an added bonus. The problem is the case design. The way the case is hinged it barely opens to a 90 degree angle so it&#x27;s very hard to see unless your nose is pressed right up close to the case. You can&#x27;t really hold it back far enough to see your entire face. The case is also deeper than it needs to be. I was hoping for something more compact. Even with the shortcomings it&#x27;s probably not a bad purchase but this could be fantastic with a redesign. I&#x27;ll keep it in my desk instead of my purse as planned.</li>
    <li> By far the best tweezers I have used.  The mirror makes it easy to see even the tiniest hair to pull out.</li>
    <li> Mirror is no help, but the tweezers are GREAT</li>
    <li> My mom got this for me as a birthday gift several years ago and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve made good use of it! I&#x27;m quite near-sighted and can&#x27;t wear contacts, so tweezing my eyebrows could be downright dangerous without this nifty set. The mirror&#x27;s 8X magnification makes seeing what I&#x27;m doing MUCH easier and the tweezers are perfect! I want to say they&#x27;re sharp but not in a bad way. Just in a &amp;#34;They&#x27;ll grab those pesky strays that are driving you nuts&amp;#34; way. If you can see it, you can tweeze it with them! Sadly, after I&#x27;d dragged it all over creation (okay, really only my apartment, my parents&#x27;  house and a road trip to Ohio and back but indulge me), one of the pins holding the mirror to the case came out. I found it and put it back in, but it kept falling out until one day I couldn&#x27;t find it. &#x3D;( Then the other pin followed suit. I know where it is, but at this point it seems kinder to just retire the poor thing. Of course I saved all the pieces I could find and still use them for now.  It&#x27;s served my eyebrows and me well for many years thanks to my thoughtful and practical mom!</li>
    <li> Great little tweezers, but the mirror went in the trash.  First, I could not get the darned thing open. It was so tightly closed, I thought it must have some tape on it that I couldn&#x27;t see.  Nope.  Then I managed to pry open a crack big enough to jam my letter opener into, then twisted the letter opener and the mirror popped open. Aha!  I thought, I&#x27;d just not close it all the way, and then I wouldn&#x27;t have to go through that.  Picked up the little tweezers, got a makeup light, and went in search of that whisker I can&#x27;t seem to see in the bathroom mirror.  UGH!!  I nearly got seasick trying to look into that mirror.  It was curved, which of course means it will distort.  If&#x27; you&#x27;ve ever been in a house of mirrors, you get the idea.  There was just no way I could hold it or turn it that I could get an image that was not totally blurry.  Useless.  Saved the tweezers, and still in search of a small portable magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t put tweezer back in box.</li>
    <li> Tweezers don&#x27;t line up properly.Unfortunely they need to be fixed therefore I don&#x27;t use them : (</li>
    <li> I love these. Work great at catching stray hairs and the mirror magnifies nicely.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  Without a light in the compact, it is almost impossible to use the mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great little set. The mirror has ample magnification and the tweezers work surprisingly well. Great for your purse and travel.</li>
    <li> Tweezers are amazing, but mirror is too small and hinge on box only goes to 90 degrees, so hard to get a look.  I got this for my daughter since I still love the one I got years ago that came in round compact and hinge opens to 180 degrees.  Wish they&#x27;d bring that one back!</li>
    <li> The tweezers work really well. They grasp small, fine hairs with no problem. The mirror has good magnification, no distortion. No, the compact doesn&#x27;t open flat, but I had no problem using it.  I do think it is too bulky for your purse.  But overall, still a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> bought 2 years ago and husband and son kept sneaking so got them for xmas then my married daughter who got the other said her teen kept taking hers , so turned around and ordered again. then all daughters wanted. too. so ordered again.. ti have never had a problem with mine but some said the case didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
    <li> The tweezers work great as long as there is no cream on my face. The magnifying mirror works a little too well; I never noticed all the whiteheads on my face before.</li>
    <li> It works as expected and is a nice little addition to my purse. The tweezers work great for plucking that unwanted facial hair. The mirror is also as expected and magnifies nicely.</li>
    <li> I have this and love it. I am always losing my tweezers so this is great for keeping them together and for traveling. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is really hard to open the compact. Other than that it is great. I bought these for gifts for my daughters.</li>
    <li> Great tweezer .....terrible cheap case.  The case covering peals off so silver flakes can get on your fingers thus into your eyes.  So if you&#x27;ve got an eyelash in your eye, the flake on your finger can transfer. Why do I like it? The tweezer and mirror are great.</li>
    <li> Love it,have owned in the past and have been looking for new ones as gifts.The recipents loved them also.Great prices</li>
    <li> I carry one set in my purse and have another at home!  I panic a little if I think I have lost them! or if my husband uses them and he doesn&#x27;t keep the set together!</li>
    <li> this product is awesome. Misplaced mine for almost a month and have driven everyone crazy looking for another one. The mirror is evil, you can see evetline!</li>
    <li> The mirror is so magnified that it&#x27;s hard to tell what you&#x27;re looking at and the hinge on the compact broke in three days just from being in my purse. This thing is cheap and useless.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these .. ( one to keep in my travel bag.)The first set was great and the second set the tweezers did not work. They would not pull the hair. Sent them back and just kept the first set.</li>
    <li> This really helps in those early morning hours when eyes are still sleepy from night time slumber.</li>
    <li> Tweezers work very well.  Case latch serves no purpose. It&#x27;s not made to keep case sealed.</li>
    <li> Love this, excellent product, fast delivery &amp; great store!</li>
    <li> The tweezers are the best part of this combo. It&#x27;s a little hard to use the mirror because it doesn&#x27;t open up as far as I&#x27;d hoped. All in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my second set one stays on my vanity the other comes with me in my handbag!!! I may get another.</li>
