      <li>Nice gel polish at home.</li>
      <li>Fast and wonderful shipping as always.</li>
      <li>Great product received right away!</li>
      <li>If nothing else, the light is great &amp; cost-effective vs. most on the market today.</li>
      <li>I like being able to do my own gel nails.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>the results delivered when done appropriately, the price of these gel nails can&#x27;t be beat compared to salon cost.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen is top quality.</li>
      <li>Now I have to spend additional money to be able to use this REFILL KIT.</li>
      <li>Love the Sally Hansen at home Gel kit.</li>

      <li>I love being able to shellac my nails at home.</li>
      <li>I love my gel nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and keep ordering more as my supply goes.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>Love this line....</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s actually still great!</li>
      <li>The wife bought this, but I&#x27;m thinking she said it was OK???</li>
      <li>Hoping this one is more equally filled :)</li>
      <li>And post a more accurate picture of the items she&#x27;s offering up for sale.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait for more colors to become available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You need to make sure you have both a color and an LED light, as this contains neither of those.  </li>
      <li>Original kit with light is still cheaper than two salon visits, and a tip!...</li>
      <li>Found this is easy to peel off my nails</li>
      <li>Except it doesn&#x27;t say that you need the light.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t come with the light.</li>
      <li>These products are for use with the UV light machine, but NOWHERE on the sales page does it mention this.  </li>
      <li>You need a light to use this product.</li>
      <li>Without the light this won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>This refill kit contains the essentials to get the gel manicure with an LED light:  </li>
      <li>Thought I was buying a none light product.</li>
      <li>Glad to be able to find it on line at reasonable price.</li>
      <li>You MUST be able to shake the bead in Step 1, and if Step 3 doesn&#x27;t flow on, the nails won&#x27;t set right.</li>
      <li>and I loved how easy and quick the manicure was to complete.</li>
      <li>I still love how easy it is to change and re-apply, dries fast.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to get these and start doing gelcolour at home.</li>
      <li>It saves so much money, and it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
      <li>Lasts up to 2 weeks- depending on how much I do the dishes :)</li>
      <li>This lasts a full week for me.</li>
      <li>The bottles where not as full as they should be</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and they&#x27;ve all seemed to chip or peel rather quickly.</li>
      <li>They chip quickly.</li>
      <li>The top coat is not as shiny and glossy as some of their other top coats.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very careful to not make contact with my cuticles, plus my nails are in really good shape</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s priced higher right now, I suggest you add it to your cart &amp; and purchase it when the price drops.  </li>
      <li>Look professional, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>but if I want any color I just use regular nail polish on top of this.</li>
      <li>I applied a different color march 6th and still have the manicure in place, love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Before you buy, I&#x27;d recommend looking around or to make sure you actually aren&#x27;t paying more than buying each item individually.  </li>
      <li>Pretty deceitful.</li>
      <li>The top coat goes a long way, I can do almost every finger without re-dipping the brush!</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s worth it to keep these two fresh, as opposed to trying to get the last drop out and losing a whole manicure.</li>
      <li>I have very think nails.  </li>
      <li>They cost twice as much in the store.</li>
      <li>I find the Sally Hansen Pro Gel to generally last as well as salon gels and they look fantastic.</li>
      <li>really like this product from the beginning, but it has literally destroyed my nails.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the whole kit.</li>
      <li>These products really work.  </li>
      <li>I started out with a very demure nail color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with these gel products and especially how long my manicures are lasting without the light.</li>
      <li>I can touch-up one or two without having to get a whole new set.</li>
      <li>FYI, just the top coat used as base coat works great too and peels off without running nail.</li>
      <li>I use a UV lamp; 4 minutes on the 1st layer of the top coat &amp; 10 minutes on the 2nd (final) coat.</li>
      <li>And throw it out and buy new when it gets low and thicker, as it will peel quickly.</li>
      <li>I do love the cleansing pads, but I prefer to use a little alcohol and a cotton ball instead.</li>
      <li>If you use SH gel products from the same line only, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>I felt like the step one base coat wasn&#x27;t completely  full when I received  it, and step two top coat is just OK.</li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you use thick layers of polish it WILL peel off very easily.  </li>
      <li>This polish does NOT wear any better than any other regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>Since this is my first time using it I will need to come back to this review in about 10 days.</li>
      <li>I think I would be able to manage acquiring different colors from the same line and still keep the cost low vs salon.</li>
      <li>We had to play around with it a little because the polish peeled so easily.</li>
      <li>I got this for my mother in law and so far no complaints about the quality of this product</li>
      <li>As of mid-May, this item is nearly $10 cheaper at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The last bottle I purchased the &amp;#34;1st step&amp;#34; bottle ran out much sooner.</li>
      <li>This is decent and gets the job done but only for about a week before it starts peeling.</li>
      <li>The concept of these SH gels is very neat, as long as you don&#x27;t try to mix and use the products with another polish.</li>
      <li>Be careful of hot water, it lessens the duration.</li>
      <li>My nails are now really gross and will have to fall off before re-growing new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are my favorite no-chip base and top coat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen gel for about 1 month now...the gel base coat and the gel polish with NO light, and my manicure is lasting almost 2 weeks! I bring my own products to my salon for my manicure. I&#x27;m thrilled with these gel products and especially how long my manicures are lasting without the light.</li>
    <li> FYI, just the top coat used as base coat works great too and peels off without running nail.</li>
    <li> I like being able to do my own gel nails. I can touch-up one or two without having to get a whole new set. I find the Sally Hansen Pro Gel to generally last as well as salon gels and they look fantastic. I have learned that the base and top coats don&#x27;t last as long as the color. You MUST be able to shake the bead in Step 1, and if Step 3 doesn&#x27;t flow on, the nails won&#x27;t set right. So it&#x27;s worth it to keep these two fresh, as opposed to trying to get the last drop out and losing a whole manicure.</li>
    <li> Look professional, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference than using regular nail polish and it didn&#x27;t dry well.  Also the color on showing through the bottle is not very close to the actual color.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t state that it&#x27;s a refill kit and also says the kit has everything you need. Except it doesn&#x27;t say that you need the light. Pretty deceitful. Now I have to spend additional money to be able to use this REFILL KIT. Perhaps the seller should change what&#x27;s stated in the description. And post a more accurate picture of the items she&#x27;s offering up for sale.</li>
    <li> These products really work.  I use my hands a lot at work during the week and the nail polish definitely lasts Sunday to the following Saturday.  A week of wear is more than what I would otherwise expect.</li>
    <li> You need a light to use this product. It&#x27;s useless w/out it. And you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> these worked perfectly! I would recommend them to my friends-</li>
    <li> This is decent and gets the job done but only for about a week before it starts peeling. I&#x27;m very careful to not make contact with my cuticles, plus my nails are in really good shape so I&#x27;m not sure what is causing it to peel up.</li>
    <li> My nails are very weak and soft.  This is great for hardening them and keeps them from breaking.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Have been using it with my Sally Hansen gel kit for years.</li>
    <li> Glad to be able to find it on line at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It works to help prevent chipping but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I put it on Sunday and by Tuesday night already see the tips are worn off. By Thursday a good 3mm on the side of a nail is already worn off. I use a UV lamp; 4 minutes on the 1st layer of the top coat &amp; 10 minutes on the 2nd (final) coat.</li>
    <li> Love all of the Sally Hansen gel products!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother in law and so far no complaints about the quality of this product so I guess its going well.</li>
    <li> Wrong product can&#x27;t return it.  Thought I was buying a none light product.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  Thx</li>
    <li> Good... just think the bottles hold very little polish..</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get these and start doing gelcolour at home. I followed the instructions to a T and tried multiple times, but the colour always ends up wiping off through the topcoat when you do the final swipe with alcohol, and they are never shiny either, but look pretty dull and un-pretty once you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s for that reason I stopped using Sally Hansen&#x27;s polishes and upgraded to Gelish. If nothing else, the light is great &amp; cost-effective vs. most on the market today.</li>
    <li> I have very think nails.  This Sally Hansen Gel keeps them long.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and keep ordering more as my supply goes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sally Hansen at home gel kit for almost 3 years now with great results. If I follow the instructions the gel manicure stays on my nails for up to 3 weeks. If I abuse my hands with moving or doing a lot of dishes, etc the life time shortens quite a bit to 10 days or so but that&#x27;s actually still great! I now do not own any regular nail polish...&lt;br /&gt;My friends spend a fortune on pro gel manis (we did the math: up to $1000/yr) and theirs don&#x27;t last any longer, we usually end up doing our nails at the same time.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Fast and wonderful shipping as always.</li>
    <li> I knwo nothing about nail polish. The wife bought this, but I&#x27;m thinking she said it was OK??? I know not a real good review...sorry.</li>
    <li> Love the Sally Hansen at home Gel kit. I can&#x27;t wait for more colors to become available.</li>
    <li> Nice gel polish at home. I work with my hands and regular polish lasts a day. This lasts a full week for me. Others might get two weeks, but not with my hands. Be careful of hot water, it lessens the duration.And throw it out and buy new when it gets low and thicker, as it will peel quickly. Original kit with light is still cheaper than two salon visits, and a tip!... great home solution with a good return on time and investment. Also get the foil wraps to remove the polish.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while and needed a refill. I use these two to make my nails a bit stronger and less likely to break but if I want any color I just use regular nail polish on top of this. I don&#x27;t like soaking in acetone to remove the gel but this polish seems to remove easier than some do when I have to remove it.</li>
    <li> Great product received right away!</li>
    <li> I bought two colors and the topcoat. I am very disappointed. I tried one color a few times and it&#x27;s abysmal. Chips in a day or two - worse than regular polish! I am going to return the color that I haven&#x27;t used.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I get a salon-style manicure for a fraction of the cost. Lasts up to 2 weeks- depending on how much I do the dishes :)</li>
    <li> I love being able to shellac my nails at home. It saves so much money, and it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really hate this item since I can&#x27;t use it.  These products are for use with the UV light machine, but NOWHERE on the sales page does it mention this.  So be careful if you are looking for the basics for Miracle Gel.  Not this. Do not buy this.  It cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> I use this product with every manicure.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My family purchased the Sally Hensen starter gel kit from Walmart some time ago. We had to play around with it a little because the polish peeled so easily. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you use thick layers of polish it WILL peel off very easily.  That was the issue I believe that we were having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve purchased this refill kit a few days ago from Amazon and I don&#x27;t know. It seemed as though the polishes had been used. There seemed to be barely anything in there? I sook it up and all, but the brush seemed so dry compared to when I purchased in stores. I&#x27;ve tried sensational&#x27;s gel polish and I love their base and top coat. Today I used a different type of gel color along with this kit, so I&#x27;m hoping that it doesn&#x27;t mess up. I do love the cleansing pads, but I prefer to use a little alcohol and a cotton ball instead.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite no-chip base and top coat. I&#x27;ve tried others and they&#x27;ve all seemed to chip or peel rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Says that the kit contains all you need.... But it doesn&#x27;t come with the light. Without the light this won&#x27;t work. I feel cheated &amp; ripped off by this seller.</li>
    <li> Found this is easy to peel off my nails</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for $14.39. If it&#x27;s priced higher right now, I suggest you add it to your cart &amp; and purchase it when the price drops.  At $14.39 it is a bargain.  You&#x27;ll receive Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel: Base coat (step 1), top coat (step 3) &amp; 6 alcohol wipes. The wipes are tiny and not very wet. I usually use two wipes when I do my nails. To save money, I purchased [[ASIN:B006YCB444 Isopropyl alcohol, 99% 16 oz. plastic bottle, 1 ea.]] and reuse the lint free wipes.&lt;br /&gt;(99% isopropyl alcohol is less expensive when purchased locally)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pro kit also works with Sensationail LED polish. I use both Sally Hansen Pro Gel Polish and Sensationail Color Gel Polish with the Sally Hansen LED lamp and these products. I always cure the Sensationail polish at least 60 seconds for each layer, and the Sally Hansen Pro Gel polish for at least 30 seconds per layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints, but don&#x27;t expect to get the advertised 10 uses out of 6 wipes.</li>
    <li> Love this and it works!</li>
    <li> Nice purchase! I love my gel nails. The last bottle I purchased the &amp;#34;1st step&amp;#34; bottle ran out much sooner. Hoping this one is more equally filled :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the whole kit. I bought the base, top coat and color separately from my local pharmacy. I already had a 36w UV lamp to cure it. The concept of these SH gels is very neat, as long as you don&#x27;t try to mix and use the products with another polish. If you use SH gel products from the same line only, you&#x27;ll be fine. My nails lasted about 10 days chip-free until they got very long and I decided to trim them. I guess that by cutting them I broke the seal and they started to chip away.&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to use SH nail salon pro regular polish and the nails just wouldn&#x27;t cure, got smooshed even after they seemed dry hours after. I also tried to use other brands of gel colors with this SH gel base and top coats, didn&#x27;t work either. They chip quickly. I suppose it must have something to do with gel pH from each brand or something because they just don&#x27;t bond when mixed/matched.&lt;br /&gt;For the results delivered when done appropriately, the price of these gel nails can&#x27;t be beat compared to salon cost. I think I would be able to manage acquiring different colors from the same line and still keep the cost low vs salon. They&#x27;re about $12/bottle and go a long way. Only thing is that this SH gel line seems to have limited colors.</li>
    <li> This refill kit contains the essentials to get the gel manicure with an LED light:  Base Coat, Top Coat, Cleanser Pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy, I&#x27;d recommend looking around or to make sure you actually aren&#x27;t paying more than buying each item individually.  As of mid-May, this item is nearly $10 cheaper at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to make sure you have both a color and an LED light, as this contains neither of those.  The complete kit is:  [[ASIN:B00A3WR5C6 Sally Hansen Salon Pro Gel Starter Kit, Shell We Dance?]]</li>
    <li> Great product glad I ordered!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Get gel nails at home. No more waiting for hours and then finding flaws in your manicure.</li>
    <li> Yup- only thing is the feel like it was used already. The bottles where not as full as they should be</li>
    <li> Love this line....polish stays nice longer.  BUT according to their website you do not need the base coat.  But this ex-nail tech says &amp;#34;yes you do.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Always need these two steps to the gel nail process. Sally Hansen is top quality.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sally Hansen gel nail kit for a year and loved i! Until...I realized it was destroying my nails. The condition is called nail lifting and its when the nail separates from the skin. I think this was caused by the gel reshaping my cuticle and causing my nail to grow out. My nails are now really gross and will have to fall off before re-growing new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product from the beginning, but it has literally destroyed my nails.</li>
    <li> I just used the product on 2.18 and I loved how easy and quick the manicure was to complete. I have a thumb nail that is slightly deformed and the thick gel helps with the appearance.  I started out with a very demure nail color.  Since this is my first time using it I will need to come back to this review in about 10 days. after 7 days the polish started to chip.  I had put the polish on too thin I think.  I applied a new color bit thicker and 3 coats, I will see how long this lasts.  I still love how easy it is to change and re-apply, dries fast.  I applied a different color march 6th and still have the manicure in place, love it.  Make sure you protect your hands if you do any dishes!!</li>
    <li> This was really a great deal for both bottles.  They cost twice as much in the store.</li>
    <li> I love these Sally Hansen products and was worried I would not be able to find the base coat!  This kit was cost effective and neatly packaged!</li>
    <li> great just perfect as it was described nice and fast to home great great</li>
    <li> I felt like the step one base coat wasn&#x27;t completely  full when I received  it, and step two top coat is just OK. The top coat is not as shiny and glossy as some of their other top coats.</li>
    <li> This polish does NOT wear any better than any other regular nail polish. I&#x27;ve tried applying it several times, in different thicknesses in case I was doing something wrong. But every time, I had chips and wear within 1 day. This is way overpriced, over-hyped, and marketed falsely. Don&#x27;t buy into this - it&#x27;s a total sham.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all, the smell was awful and I had to stop and remove it.</li>
    <li> The top coat goes a long way, I can do almost every finger without re-dipping the brush!</li>
