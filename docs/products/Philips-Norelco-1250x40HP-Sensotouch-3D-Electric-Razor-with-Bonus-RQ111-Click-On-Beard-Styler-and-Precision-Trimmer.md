      <li>I think many people enjoy using your products but to the traveler this is an &amp;#34;epic fail&amp;#34; in design.  </li>
      <li>Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix?</li>
      <li>Easily the quietest electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fits easily in the supplied travel case.</li>
      <li>it leaves my face baby smooth</li>
      <li>not charge because it didn’t fit)</li>
      <li>The experience is really comfortable.</li>
      <li>I have a light beard, and there&#x27;s no iritation after using this razor.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also easy to clean and replace the head.</li>
      <li>lol the only part is under the neck.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t even accept it for free.</li>
      <li>to clean.  </li>
      <li>This razor has allowed me to be clean shaven without that</li>
      <li>Clean up is fairly easy and the battery&#x27;s durability is good for those long road trips.</li>
      <li>For me It provides a very close shave and is very smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d prefer to give 3.5 stars for this, but it certainly deserves more than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cleaning is great because you can use it when you are taking the shower because it was design for use in wet environment.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care how cool it looks.</li>
      <li>and I must have been good, as it was under the tree waiting for me to open it.  </li>
      <li>I went to Remington, a $50 model, and much to my surprise, the shave is better than anything I ever got from the Phillips razor.</li>
      <li>After a few days however, I found myself having incredibly close shaves without any irritation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall,though, because it does do an excellent job of shaving, I would recommend it, despite having some serious design flaws.</li>
      <li>The bonus beard trimmer is easy to add on and is very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The SmarTouch, even with new blades, tended to &#x27;pull&#x27; my whiskers when there was more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth.  </li>
      <li>it is a good shave,3D design is so good ,and it used very conveniently，it can used on wet and dry..</li>
      <li>style heads easy cleaning till you need a new replacement head.</li>
      <li>With a sideburn shaver, a crafty charging stand, and 3 easy to clean shaving heads that look like a torture device when you open them up, there are certainly plenty of distractions to play with instead of shaving your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years!</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>My new razor works great wet or dry and cuts better than any electric razor I have ever owned to date.</li>
      <li>The first week I found that there was still some irritation occurring.</li>
      <li>Pop-on grooming head works pretty well</li>
      <li>Got for my husband as a bday gift, he really likes it!</li>
      <li>After his first use he said, &amp;</li>
      <li>I think the actual retail price is quite a bit more.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this razor, I wasn&#x27;t enamored with it.</li>
      <li>Consistently the closest shave I have gotten ever.  </li>
      <li>The first week or two you may find that there is some irritation of the skin.</li>
      <li>I tried the lectric shave and it&#x27;s good but screws up my face due to the high level of alcohol.</li>
      <li>At the beginning it was great, but as time passed by, he had the same problems again when shaving every single day.</li>
      <li>Worth the high price.</li>
      <li>I was nervous as he is very particular about his razors as some pull and hurt.  </li>
      <li>Still, I must say it worked ok when he used it on dry skin.</li>
      <li>When I first got it this particular razor</li>
      <li>It took a couple shaves to get used to considering he had always shaved with a razors but this cuts time in half and leaves a smooth clean face.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer, which actually sort of slides forward, rather than popping up, precisely handles sideburns.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>As a lifetime Braun foil user I was used to a very close shave.</li>
      <li>He said he really likes the results.  </li>
      <li>This lacks any sort of numerical display for the charge, which is really inexcusable considering the price and the fact that it&#x27;s 2014.  </li>
      <li>Quiet, close shave (for an electric) much better than my old Norelco.</li>
      <li>The razor can only be charged whilst cradled in a special stand.  </li>
      <li>Phillips arrives and I at first found the shave not anywhere near as close as the Braun and was going to send it</li>
      <li>Sometimes it is perfect, other times it has left a little patch of hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shiny, has a neat display, and looks the part of a high end</li>

    <li> Quiet, close shave (for an electric) much better than my old Norelco.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product because the battery is working for 15 days and have one line of battery!! Is is amazing how good is the product when you used to shave. The 3d head it is great because it ajust to your face. Cleaning is great because you can use it when you are taking the shower because it was design for use in wet environment. I compare this model with the oldest one and there&#x27;s a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Over priced.... Nice razor as received With flip up style heads easy cleaning till you need a new replacement head. Replacement heads were replaced with a different version and I don&#x27;t like them and way over priced would not purchase again</li>
    <li> It is a great razor and I would recommend it to anyone.  It is very easy to use and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> had it for a while now, and since I don&#x27;t like to use shave cream just water this was perfect. it&#x27;s also easy to clean and replace the head. Doesn&#x27;t get quite as close a shave as i Like but that could be due to the lack of shave cream.</li>
    <li> because of the brand recognition to Philips I chose it, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint me. The noise is low and acceptable. The razors are sharp and close. The experience is really comfortable. it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> My husband had been searching for a new razor for some time when I stumbled upon this little jewel. He loves it. It was different at first and took some getting used too but once you get used to it he said its the best shave with an electric razor he&#x27;s had.</li>
    <li> honestly idk what these reviews are saying... when i use this. it leaves my face baby smooth lol the only part is under the neck. i suggest use a foil one for that part lol but overal great product. i shave every day and im a african american male. from france lol</li>
    <li> My new razor works great wet or dry and cuts better than any electric razor I have ever owned to date.</li>
    <li> It is good qaulity to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Looks very  great and func too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy two more if will sale again</li>
    <li> MAJOR PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  QUIET  -  The ninja of electric razors... you could sneak up on a baby deer while shaving your chin.&lt;br /&gt;  SLEEK  -  It&#x27;s shiny, has a neat display, and looks the part of a high end razor.&lt;br /&gt;  FEATURES  -  With a sideburn shaver, a crafty charging stand, and 3 easy to clean shaving heads that look like a torture device when you open them up, there are certainly plenty of distractions to play with instead of shaving your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAJOR CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THE SHAVE - The core fundamental purpose of this shaver. It does everything you could want, and in glorious fashion, EXCEPT actually cut the hairs growing out of your face. I&#x27;ve made concentric circles, vacuum cleaner parallel lines, Zamboni ice-rink ovals, zig-zag patterns, you name it. I&#x27;ve tried wet, dry, damp, warm, cold, sleet, snow... but I just cannot achieve a presentable shave. I can&#x27;t believe Philips did any product testing whatsoever, or they would still be standing there today smashing the 3 headed monster against their cheeks trying to expose the skin underneath their whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Do not buy this razor under any circumstances. Don&#x27;t even accept it for free. I don&#x27;t care how cool it looks. It&#x27;s a shaver that doesn&#x27;t shave. It should be re-branded as a vibrating paperweight. Or an oblong projectile. I wonder if it skips across a pond...</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin. The word &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; alone was enough for red blotches to appear. This razor has allowed me to be clean shaven without that concern.&lt;br /&gt;Initially when I got it I felt a little bit of irritation. This was just my face reacting to the loss of its beloved beard. The first week I found that there was still some irritation occurring. After a few days however, I found myself having incredibly close shaves without any irritation. I use a little bit of gel for the shaving process and a small aftershave balm to help my skin, but even dry it leaves me with little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this razor. Shave time is very quick and the additional beard trimmer was a nice touch. If you have delicate skin like I do, this is far better than any traditional razor shave. The first week or two you may find that there is some irritation of the skin. After that time, your skin will have completely adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe, however small, is that shaving under my chin is a bit of a gamble. Sometimes it is perfect, other times it has left a little patch of hair. This is solved by going over it a few times, but it is still a small complaint. It does not change my recommendation of this razor.</li>
    <li> It works. For me It provides a very close shave and is very smooth. I would highly recommend it, but as always, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for years.  Finally decided to get a new shaver and I am very pleased with it.  Charge lasts long enough to take on a two-week+ vacation without need for a recharge.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for 20 year old son.  He said he really likes the results.  No more skin irritation.</li>
    <li> it is a good shave,3D design is so good ,and it used very conveniently，it can used on wet and dry..</li>
    <li> The razor came in the box that was sealed and appeared to be new.  The razor itself was in a plastic sealed package and was new.  The rest of the contents of the box seemed to be in order but the razor cover was broken (plastic) and the charging stand was not the right one for the razor.(would not charge because it didn’t fit) In addition the beard groomer was missing.  It’s hard to tell if it was the sellers fault or the manufacturer.  I called Phillips Norelco and they replaced the parts needed and I sent the old ones back to them.  Razor works well now and I like it.  I’m just not sure that buying it from a questionable Amazon retailer was worth saving 20 bucks. Note to manufacturer... I think many people enjoy using your products but to the traveler this is an &amp;#34;epic fail&amp;#34; in design.  Why you ask? because you cannot plug this razor in and charge it or use it without the battery charged.  That means a traveler would have to pack and bring the charging stand on a trip. If you don’t travel and this is not a concern, then this is wonderful product very comfortable shave and the beard trimmer is excellent!  Sorry for the bipolar assessment, but I thought other consumers would appreciate the truth.</li>
    <li> When I first got this razor, I wasn&#x27;t enamored with it. Sort of grew on me and here&#x27;s why. As a lifetime Braun foil user I was used to a very close shave. Getting that close shave was a chore that required extensive mirror close-ups to find all the spots on my face that the Braun conventionally left behind on a day to day basis. Braun took a dump so I though I&#x27;d try something new. Phillips arrives and I at first found the shave not anywhere near as close as the Braun and was going to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As explained above the Braun does a phenomenal job at shaving very closely but the amount of time it took to get those results were annoying. Several areas on my face demanded that I redo them, all the while staring intently into one of those magnifying mirrors, to ensure I didn&#x27;t leave the house with several patches of whiskers on my mug. Phillips definitely delivers a less time consuming shave but not quite as close as the Braun. The big difference is the square footage of the blades on this thing. Covers a much wider swath than the Braun and doesn&#x27;t require going over the same area several times. Yes the shave isn&#x27;t as close but it takes way less time and is completely acceptable as you walk out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting heads get into every nook and cranny and I&#x27;m nailing those annoying ear hair things that you get when your older than dirt so I&#x27;m a happy camper. Clean up is fairly easy and the battery&#x27;s durability is good for those long road trips. Would have preferred a direct plug in for extended absences but so far, haven&#x27;t had it die when I&#x27;m gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the included groomer as well so I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d prefer to give 3.5 stars for this, but it certainly deserves more than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good?  It does a very good job of shaving.  The futuristic 3D Sensotouch head effectively follows all contours for a close shave, even a tricky patch on my neck that my old rotary razor was never very good at dealing with.  The &amp;#34;pop-up&amp;#34; trimmer, which actually sort of slides forward, rather than popping up, precisely handles sideburns.  The hair chambers are very small, so it&#x27;s necessary to clean the razor every day or so, but it&#x27;s very easy to pop up the shaving heads and rinse the razor under the tap.  The bonus beard trimmer is easy to add on and is very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad?  I think I paid about $180 for this which is rather a lot for a razor, and this was with rebates and discounts, so I think the actual retail price is quite a bit more.  This razor doesn&#x27;t seem as substantial as my old Norelco--a little too plasticky.  My old razor had an LCD display showing battery life in number of minutes, and if the battery ran out, the AC cord could be plugged into the wall and then connected to the base of the razor, so the razor could still be used.  This lacks any sort of numerical display for the charge, which is really inexcusable considering the price and the fact that it&#x27;s 2014.  There is only a series of lights that flash briefly when the razor is turned on or off to indicate battery life.  Apparently the fancier $300+ top-of-the-line model does have a numerical display for battery life.  The razor can only be charged whilst cradled in a special stand.  The AC cord plugs into this stand, so it&#x27;s impossible to shave and charge at the same time.  The razor is able to provide a full shave after only 5 minutes of charging, but that&#x27;s extremely inconvenient when you&#x27;re half-awake and rushing to get ready in the morning.  Also, this stand takes up a lot of precious counter space which is not good when you live in a small NYC apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,though, because it does do an excellent job of shaving, I would recommend it, despite having some serious design flaws.</li>
    <li> I have used various Norelco shavers for about 25 years. The 1250x/40 worked well and was easy to clean - until it stopped working after only 2 years! When the shaver did work, I think that the shave was not close enough; I was expecting it to be much closer - more like a blade and less like I shaved 12 hours ago. Anyway, when placed in the charging cradle. the shaver doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I replaced the cradle as well as the cord to no avail - the shaver still refuses to recharge. Does anyone have any ideas regarding an easy fix? Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son.  He loves it!!</li>
    <li> I Got this for my husband for Christmas.  After his first use he said, &amp;#34;wow, this thing is amazing!&amp;#34; He had a Braun before.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I like the product. Like the beard/mustache attachment, too.</li>
    <li> Best razor for your money. The flexible heads are perfect for getting a nice close shave. The razor looks great too.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco for 30 years. Of all that I have owned, this is the lightest and best working by far. The pop on trimmer works better than I thought that it would for sure.</li>
    <li> Birthday present for my hubby. He had been thinking of getting an electric razor, had one years ago. When he saw this one advertised on TV, he said &amp;#34;there it is&amp;#34; and so I surprised him with it. He likes the ease of use, the look, and has not turned back.</li>
    <li> I have been a lifelong Phillips electric razor user. I have psoriasis. The psoriasis necessitates the use of electric razor because a regular shaving method will tear my face to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid a lot of money for this reason. When I first got it this particular razor it was reasonable, not great. I&#x27;ve had much less expensive Phillips razors that did just as good of a job. Over the years these Phillips razors have been going downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads for this razor are a slap in the face to anybody who bought this razor. If you just bought it, you&#x27;re in for some wake up. They stopped making the old replacement heads and replaced the replacement heads with some kind of wacky new made in China heads that are absolutely stupendously bad, and, absurdly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greed of this company has no limit, and they have no shame or decency, nor any respect for their customers whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is corporate greed and corporate filth at its height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy cannot this company. I went to Remington, a $50 model, and much to my surprise, the shave is better than anything I ever got from the Phillips razor. I got the F5-5800.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may check my many reviews on this site. There are hundreds. I do not take a stand against a product unless there is a good reason for. When I speak about this product, I&#x27;m speaking about all of the high-end Phillips razors. They all essentially use the same replacement has. They&#x27;re all over-priced, and the replacement heads use for them are useless. Do not buy any of these high-and Phillips razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put this company out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the corporate suits who thought they could abuse the public lose the stock options, and get on welfare lies, where they belong. That themselves their big houses, and get back there Lamborghinis, the wife will have to do with 500 shoes instead of the thousand, and the chickiepoo on the side will have to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assure you to buy the Remington I recommended, you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more feedback, just send me an email, and I will gladly engage further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is a bad joke by a bad comedian. Stay away.the Remington I recommended, you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want more feedback, just send me an email, and I will gladly engage further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is a bad joke by a bad comedian. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I got this razor as a xmas gift for my husband and he Love it!!! it shaves really good giving that smooth skin feeling when you touching...great gift for the guy that want to shave quick and get good results :-)</li>
    <li> Closest shave ever with an electric. I have a light beard, and there&#x27;s no iritation after using this razor. Worth the high price.</li>
    <li> why the specification I get is 1150X&#x27;s not 1250&#x27;s!There is no receipt either!</li>
    <li> I love this electric razor. I never owned one before but bought this one so I can not really compare first hand. After looking all over the place for reviews, etc. I decided on this and have not regretted it since. I have been using it everyday for 10 months and it still gives me a close shave. The added trimmer is nice to have and can be used for eye brows as well as beards and thinning out sideburns. Would recommend to all, but I am no expert.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very quiet.  Easily the quietest electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Like the wet/dry feature&lt;br /&gt;3.  Pop-on grooming head works pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wet shaving doesn&#x27;t work well as the heads suck up all of the shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;2.  Not a very close shave compared to other top razors and not even close to the Sanyo SV-RX10&lt;br /&gt;3.  MAJOR irritation on my neck after only 7 days of shaving.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Been using for 3 + weeks now. Works well wet or dry. This is my second shaver. Its good but doesnt get as close as I want unless I go over it all 3 or 4 times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco SmarTouch XL for several years (and have been using Norelco triple-header&#x27;s for over forty-five years - or since I pretended to need to shave in my teens) and decided that I was ready for something newer.  So I asked Santa to bring me the new 1250x for Christmas and I must have been good, as it was under the tree waiting for me to open it.  Thanks Santa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my face is already conditioned for Norelco triple heads, but I am amazed at the comfort and closeness.  The SmarTouch, even with new blades, tended to &#x27;pull&#x27; my whiskers when there was more than a day&#x27;s worth of growth.  Not true with the 1250x.  Have tested it with a 3-day growth (or when Mrs. Claus complained about the stubble) and nary a pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Claus says that my face is as smooth as a baby bottom no matter where I might put it! [Blush].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.  Have not tried it in the shower and probably never will.  Just not my thing.  Want my face dry before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I might have is the &#x27;charging cradle&#x27; being necessary for charging.  It folds very compact for travel, but my hope was that it, and the cord, would not be an accessory that I would have to carry along - so certainly not a deal breaker.  Fits easily in the supplied travel case.</li>
    <li> I was using another brand n now tried this brand n feel that it&#x27;s much more superior in terms of quality n comfort of shave.</li>
    <li> Got for my husband as a bday gift, he really likes it! It took a couple shaves to get used to considering he had always shaved with a razors but this cuts time in half and leaves a smooth clean face.</li>
    <li> Consistently the closest shave I have gotten ever.  Great product and worth the money when you consider the cost of all blades and razors over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with edge shaving gel and it works great.  I tried the lectric shave and it&#x27;s good but screws up my face due to the high level of alcohol.</li>
    <li> OK - first off, I am not a great fan of electric razors, they have traditionally never given me the close shave I prefer.  But since I have been on blood thinners for five years (and will be for the rest of my life) I cannot use blades anymore.  I have had a beard for five years because I could not use blades on my face, but this razor actually shaves me close enough, does a decent job at getting all the hair, especially if I let it grow for a few days.  I am now sporting a van dyke.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas 2013.  Almost a year later and going strong on the same blades.  He loves it.  I was nervous as he is very particular about his razors as some pull and hurt.  He loves this one and says it doesn&#x27;t pull at all.</li>
    <li> I gave this Philips Norelco to my boyfriend on Christmas, since his facial hair grows pretty fast from one day to the other,  he said having one like these would not hurt as much as it does with a normal razor. At the beginning it was great, but as time passed by, he had the same problems again when shaving every single day. Don&#x27;t know if it was because of the head lost its original power, or either because is hair is very thick and he has to buy a replacement every two months. Still, I must say it worked ok when he used it on dry skin.</li>
