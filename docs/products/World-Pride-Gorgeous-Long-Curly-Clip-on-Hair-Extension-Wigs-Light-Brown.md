<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The hair was frizzy and the clips were broken so am sad. Did not get to use it. Also the hair in the photo is thick but the product sent was not.  It is super thin, not curly as described and not long enough to cover one ear to the other.  Never buy this!!!</li>
    <li> I love it it is very handy for my trips when i am traveling i would just throw it in my bag and i am ready to go you should try it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved these. The light brown was a perfect match. Excellent price,we will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get over these! They barely shed, if at all. I have shoulder length light brown/red hair. Took maybe 10mins to apply and style. Easy to remove. I used two sets of these (one lower-middle scalp, one upper-middle scalp) just for intense thickness. One set would be enough. I&#x27;ve always used two sets of 7pc clip extensions. This is so much easier. I just ordered two more sets!</li>
    <li> I usually buy $80-90 dollar extentions, but latley I havent had that kind of money so for the price of these i thought what the heck, ill try them. it took about two weeks to arrive and i ordered two sets of them..but when they finnaly got here and i opened them up and i was so happy. they are so soft and thick. They do get tangled easily, but if you brush them out theyre fine.</li>
    <li> Honestly for $5 extensions they&#x27;re not bad. They&#x27;re my first ... I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on something that I wasn&#x27;t sure would look right on me. The blend very well with my hair. Especially in a \\&quot;half up half down\\&quot; hairstyle. I went outside w/ my friends for about 4 hours , came back in &amp; they were still in place and didn&#x27;t frizz up in the heat. All my friends complimented me (5 guys &amp; 2 girls) And said they look natural. My natural hair goes about shoulder length &amp; these fall about 2 inches below my breasts, so it&#x27;s obvious that I had extensions if you know me lol hair doesn&#x27;t just grow over night. But yeah, they got tangled a little bit , but I don&#x27;t mind . &amp; this also looks really good when braided , looks completely natural . The picture is true to color btw . they did shed when I first took them put &amp; a little while wearing them, but not a lot &amp; not noticeable.  They clip in really easily also.  I just ordered another one to see how it works when flat ironed :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and texture.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted longer hair, the color is a bit darker than shown but that was okat, the extensions are thin and tangle a lot but other than that they&#x27;re perfect, I got them a week early and was very pleased :)</li>
    <li> I Am Very Picky About Hair Extensions, And This Is The First Time I Bought Hair Extensions, The Package Came Today And When I Opened It, It Was Almost Perfect, It Is Perfect, Soft And The Perfect Match For My Hair Color. It Does Pull On Your Hair A Little But I Love It.</li>
    <li> First of all, the color of the hair is darker than in the picture. Like maybe 3-4 shades darker. Other than that, these are great extensions. They came super curly, but I brushed them a couple times and it matched how I style my hair daily. Theyre very easy to put in. The more you brush them, the more they look like real hair. Also, you can brush these as many times as you want and it won&#x27;t lose the bounce/wave. I haven&#x27;t tried curling or straightening them, yet, though. Other than the color not matching the photo, these are great.</li>
    <li> I really love theses extentions but I Orestes them before I got ombre hair so the don&#x27;t really blend but when I put them in a braide it looks really good because it looks so much thicker and fuller and I wear my hair in a braide everyday anyway so it great</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, it is pretty good.  It is thicker than I would have expected for the price, which is a good thing.  Unfortunately I will need to find someone to teach me how to put it in my hair.  It is proving more complicated than I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this it didn&#x27;t even Match my hair color but it was pretty with the loose curls</li>
    <li> The color of the hair that I received was a lot darker than what is shown on Amazon. I just redyed my hair to match. You will need to buy two of these if you want to have a full head of hair because one is going to be too thin. The curls where nice and bouncy for about 2 days and then after that the hair became hard, tangled and matted. This is perfect if you just need something to wear on the go or if you need something temporarily. I ended up throwing the hair away after about a week.</li>
    <li> the beauty on that special day which is regulated by the response of all whom travels to that special day is and will always be welcomed when beauty itself is trampled by all whom sees and is welcomed with love</li>
    <li> It is the same color as my natural hair color and it&#x27;s so thick! It looks so nice and holds tight. I gave it a good couple of tugs and it stayed in and didn&#x27;t rip out my own hair. It survived a nice brushing and just looks beautiful. The only thing I&#x27;d say is to buy two. (at this price you can afford to) I may not use a whole two clip ins, (I&#x27;ll probably cut the second in half) but all in all it is so nice. And the price for it is astonishing. I walked into my roommate&#x27;s room and asked her how much she thought I spent. She said forty bucks. It is so worth it.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so I could add a bit more thickness to my hair for my wedding. I was very easy to use we clipped it in without any problems. It was not thin as like other hair extensions I have bought in the past. Will be buying again in my new hair color!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it was going to be and it was all tangled up and I didn&#x27;t like how long it took to get there</li>
    <li> I got one in light brown since that&#x27;s my hair color. I got a light brownish-redish-copperish colored piece. I was very disappointed. It was not what I had expected at all.</li>
    <li> Ok, so let me start off by saying, these took about...two weeks to finally get here. They came in a small grey package, kinda smashed and when I took them out, I immediately noticed it wasn&#x27;t going to match my hair lol. It felt yea like doll hair, but I shook it out, and it looked really pretty. This morning I curled it and man does it look good. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to curl so good, but you dont want to curl it normally, keeping the straightner on low, and take a strand get two fingers (index &amp; middle) together and wrap the strand around them and keeping them in the spiral, slide hair off fingers, and press straightner on it, when warm, scrunch the piece and let fall . This is my first time buying hair online, and im happy with it :) im gonna try and dye a piece of it and not the whole thing. Hopefully it dyes and ill be happy :)&lt;br /&gt;HOW I LEARNED TO CURL THEM :)&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT AFTER HAVING THEM!!!&lt;br /&gt;I started to have trouble with them after one day, it tangled WAYYY too easy, and literally took me an hr n a half to brush it all out and recurl it. I like them, but I don&#x27;t, you cant dye them either....but all in all, take are of them and u could have them for a while. :) i also used dry shampoo instead of actual water n soap.</li>
    <li> The hair was just really knotty. It was soft when I first got it, but then it tangled up upon clipping in. And then if you brush it, you might as well just toss it out.</li>
    <li> Depending on how high into your hair you clip this you might want to buy two of these, it doesn&#x27;t go all the way around so you get this weird chopped up hair style if you don&#x27;t watch it. However I&#x27;ve done many things with this piece and it looks great! However there is a minor detail I want to point out it gets really frizzy and tangles easily.</li>
    <li> very thick blends well with my hair a nice length doesn&#x27;t get in way can also use straight iron on it also when I do not feel like curling my hair</li>
    <li> This is my first hair extention..&lt;br /&gt;The color was a perfect match.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very long.. However it&#x27;s not curly kinda like the picture..&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be straighter.and Itis adds lots of volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is shiny.&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend a shine spray or a leave in counditners or your hair to make it match perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great the product is great. I will be buying anouther one.</li>
    <li> its great i would recomend this to every 1 i know and i will buy another in the future thanks</li>
    <li> Got really tangled when i wore it one time and kind of smelled funny other than that it was alright thank you</li>
    <li> I am in high school and recently had to cut my hair due to damage from flat irons, curling irons, ect. i hate having short hair so i decided to look into buying extinctions, i was skeptical about these because the price is so low so i also ordered from 3 other sellers. they all were supposed to be delivered within around 20 days but these however came after 9 days of ordering! i was so excited when i pulled them out to find that these were my exact hair color, they light brown extensions also seem to have a hint of blonde highlights to them and a little red tint which was a perfect match for my hair. they were curled really nicely and very soft in regards to the people saying it looks shinny and fake i think you received the wrong hair because i get complement on how good it looks almost every day. also if the hair comes and is not your right color they can be dyed and also brushed out, washed, blow dried and the curls will still remain the same, you can also flat iron these and have no damage to them, however once you do flat iron them they can NOT be re-curled so for the price i bought two and left one curly and the other straight. i bought these around 5 weeks ago and they still look good so if you are debating between these and another i HIGHLY recommend going with these! specially if you need them within a short time period</li>
    <li> obviously  it isn&#x27;t real hair so doesn&#x27;t last a long time. But great deal and durable also a great price</li>
    <li> its more of a wavy hair than curly hair. it&#x27;s ok. I like how long it is. It blends in great with my hair.</li>
    <li> Thank You they are great. It was nice to do service with u. I Love the extensions,look great in my hair</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like that its hard to brush through. It got tangly and just it&#x27;s like there is no way to untangle it.</li>
    <li> This items color was tipped in a reddish brown. Not for me, so I just cut it off! It is lightweight and an easy wear. I have thin hair and I can snap it in place with no problem. Comb or brush gently!</li>
    <li> I have a new obsession.. they did come early.. plus the fact that I have medium length hair that is a odd color. I am biracial so I didnt really want to get them because I was a little worried about matching my hair color.. I recommend this product for anyone and everyone they are perfect yes they do get a little frizzy but a little water brings it right back to new. Order 2 mine came up to be $9.66 not bad for luscious locks!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice piece, thick, the color was exactly like it looked online. I would recommend it and it is very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product  my wife loved it it looks real feels real and she says it&#x27;s comfortable to wear and because of the reasonable pricing it was worth the wait for shipping</li>
    <li> it looks AMAZING. I will buy more in the future. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get real hair extensions, but now there is no need!</li>
    <li> The only bad part about this is I didn&#x27;t receive my merchandise. I did like the fact that I was able to email the owner but again when my products were resent I didn&#x27;t receive anything again, and when I asked for my money back I was told to wait a week...3 weeks later and I&#x27;m still waiting.</li>
    <li> This hairpiece is ok but it&#x27;s a little too shiney and too curly and frizzes when you try to soften the curls.  Much curlier than the photo of it.  It&#x27;s ok for the money though.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like it too much it got tangled 2 quick and it was hard to get the tangles out and when I did take them out and made it look yucky it took that soft feel from it</li>
    <li> I just received mine in the mail and they are awesome! (I ordered 2) They match perfect to my hair color. They were a little too long for my liking so i cut them to make them look more natural to my hair. The color is a little reddish so if that would be a problem to you then i suggest not getting them. I ordered 2 just incase 1 would be too thin but I only need 1 so i have a spare! I did brush it out and straighten it. I used my Chi hair straightener on it on 300 degrees and they didn&#x27;t fry up they actually came out how any hair would when you straighten them. Awesome buy and when I need more I will be ordering from them.</li>
    <li> I bought and wore these extensions to prom last year and they looked great, and they stayed in well. They were worth what I paid.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was really good for its price ! I ended up straightening mine &amp;&amp; it didnt fry it ! I wouldnt recommend using heat on it all the time though , then it would get ruined .. The only down side to this is a good majority of hair falls out when you brush it or tug on it so just be gentle with it ! I would definatly recommend this to a friend (:</li>
    <li> Beautiful curls, I like how being synthetic hair the hair didn&#x27;t looks plastic, and the curls are long and wavy</li>
    <li> Its a bit darker and more red than the photo.  It says in place and it is very pretty.  For the price it is great.</li>
    <li> This hair extension does not stay in place well. The way it fastens to existing hair makes it awkward and can be seen.</li>
    <li> Perfect comfortable fit, well made, excellent piece highly recommend</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice if you already have curly hair to match it, but if not then you have to make it match. It does not curl, only straitens. And my straitener doesn&#x27;t go down to 180 so it burne it.</li>
    <li> It was plastic hair claimed it was human hair it was like barbie doll hair.DO NOT BE TRICKED INTO ORDERING THIS.VERY UNSATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I love them! They match my hair perfect. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is how easy they get tangled. Otherwise, they rock! Cheap and awesome.</li>
    <li> Gets a little tangled</li>
    <li> Thank you, this piece has really added a extra touch to my hair, its a lot fuller now. Thakk you</li>
    <li> its really nice for the price it does shed ALOT!! looks and feel real. the shipping took a mth and 1/2 to get here :( good product</li>
    <li> I just received it today and I&#x27;m having fun with it. It&#x27;s much darker than in the stock picture (more of a chocolate brown, instead of light) and maybe not as full. However, I paid only $4.55 and it&#x27;s a great buy. If you want a real set of high quality extensions, you&#x27;re going to have to pay a lot more money. However, this one is not too thin and it&#x27;s very long. It does shed quite a bit and it can tangle easily but I&#x27;m impressed with the quality. It&#x27;s shiny, silky and once it&#x27;s been tamed with a lot of hair-care products, it can become more manageable. If you&#x27;re looking for something to wear once in a while and to just have fun with, this is a great buy. It&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to be upset about if you have to toss it in the trash after a couple of months. It also took about 15 days to arrive from China (I live in Seattle, WA).</li>
    <li> It is pretty, but the hair is messy and it frays. And, it took me awhile to figure out how to clip it in right, there no instruction that come with it. But, for the price I paid, not bad at all.</li>
    <li> too heavy for my head an did not blend well with my hair ! Plus the curls wernt even curled and when I tried it would not curl or straighten! Waste of money even though it&#x27;s cheep</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, looked fake on me. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Their horrible. Just got them and was super excited but my mom didnt believe they were real so I straightened the end and what do ya know it just sizzled under the heat. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Hello to you all,&lt;br /&gt; I have Got this exact same thing from my Mom on Ebay. It is Really Lovely, it is Light, it want damage you&#x27;re hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is really long, awsome! The Shipping was a Great speed. The Curl&#x27;s are really bouncy, good, and fun. It is a cute Hair Extension. I&#x27;am Enjoying it. The Hair is very naturall, real looking, and it is Soft. You can just about do any hairstyle&#x27;s with it, for example, pin it up. Thank You for all this, Great Item, and Great Service! You&#x27;all have a Good One, Take Care, Bye.</li>
    <li> Very cute, but the clips broke after one use. :(</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for, pretty curls and perfect length, but the color was really dark i was dissapointed, but otherwise satisfied</li>
    <li> If you are adding length to your style you can&#x27;t go wrong with this piece!  It was easy to clip in with my own hair and didn&#x27;t require any styling since my hair is naturally wavy.  It got a little knotty, but was easy enough to brush out and get looking good again!  I wore this for a photoshoot.  If you are thinking about using this for a wedding or something where you will be moving around a lot for a long period of time then you might want to use bobby pins in addition to the clips on the hair piece.</li>
    <li> This piece was insanely long, and insanely heavy. I have short hair and like to &#x27;transform&#x27; into long hair sometimes, but this is just unrealistic. I put it in and could feel my hairs breaking where the clips were. Oh, and the clips didn&#x27;t really work very well. Very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know I didn&#x27;t like this product because it was heavy and the clips were bad, but the actual hair that was on there was soft and nice!</li>
    <li> Will need two to look realistic which is not what is advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a great value for what your getting.</li>
    <li> everything was like I expectect really good mi wife says that she will buy again soon and that is good for me</li>
    <li> They got tangled too much! I really dont like them! waste of my money! I threw them away! They suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> they always come late but other than that they are perfect! they Mach well with my sandy brown hair! I&#x27;ve ordered these multiple times now!</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that the item I was ordering was of good quality by looking at reviews and ratings from other people. Upon delivery I realized that it was of very cheap quality and as soon as it was removed from the packaging pieces began falling from the hair piece.</li>
    <li> Love this wig. Worth more than what I paid</li>
    <li> Good for a day or for a nice event but do not flat iron  and not for long use</li>
    <li> This I wear pulled back and it looks great.  I am very pleased with this clip on</li>
    <li> I love that the extensions already have the cips sewed on, it looks really good and was a great price. Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This prouduct is AMAZING!! I would recommend it to anyone you can staighten it curl it braid it and put it in a pony tail! Also I have blonde hair and was able to make the style peak-a-boo!</li>
    <li> Well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything much since it was so cheap , good color , nice and long but the picture makes it look bigger than what it really is not a real half wig with clips on top on bottom it&#x27;s just one line of hair with clips.. ONCE I brushed it, hair came out and it immediately got tangled but once again it was 10 dollar hair lol I won&#x27;t be using it often, jsut on cold days whe I wanna wear a beanie or something I say pass on buying it and get something good quality (:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful hair, after buying my own my nieces like them so much, I bought them their own...they love them.</li>
    <li> it makes me look so saxy, really easy to put on, just gotta take good care of it, as any other product.</li>
    <li> Looks nature, beautiful. Perfect... My only concern is that the hair is way to thin which makes it hard to brush when it gets all messed up</li>
    <li> I tried to dye these to match my hair,left left the dye on for 40 mins, and it did nothing. If they&#x27;re real, they have so many chemicals on them that they can&#x27;t hold color. I don&#x27;t even want to TRY straightening them.</li>
    <li> The company is not serious at all. They sell for that price and you&#x27;ll never get the product. I complained about it and they always said the same thing, we will send another one. Made wait for at least 4 weeks and the nothing happened. This never happen to me before when I bought merchandise through Amazon, but this company really upset my spirit</li>
    <li> I have and will buy from this seller again and again! It is so much life in the hair. Bouncy and flowed with movement, with added confidence in appearance.</li>
    <li> I rated this 2 stars because it&#x27;s a terrible product, it feels like horse hair, it&#x27;s super heavy, and it comes in a lot darker brown than it says. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> Looks great after I learned how to attach it properly. I dyed this to match my hair perfectly and it dyed with ease. Curls hold well and brushes out nicely also. Good value for the price point</li>
    <li> This product is nice for its price. I do not see alot of falling strands either. But it is alittle thin so you may want to consider buying 2 or 3 if you need them thicker.</li>
    <li> To brush this I would make sure to use water and when straightening it, use low heat with your hair slightly damp all over.  To wash it use regular conditioner and shampoo, but leave about 10 percent of conditioner in and use coconut oil in the conditioner. And do not brush it while it is in your hair. Make sure you hold the clip while brushing it, because if you don&#x27;t, all of the hair comes out. Just some tips! :-)</li>
    <li> I love these. I wear them almost every day. Everyone thinks they&#x27;re my real hair. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and they fall down to my lower back. I straighten them on low heat and they react just fine. Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because they shed a bit and they only last a month or two before they begin to get pretty frizzy. But $5 a month on hair is super cheap so. I will definiitely continue to buy more (:</li>
    <li> I got these in like 2 weeks so fast shipping and when I opened them I was suprised they are nice and curly however I tried to dye them with permanent hair dye it did nothing they aren&#x27;t fried or damaged so that&#x27;s good but they are lighter then my hair (a light/medium brown) the extensions are a caramel color also I haven&#x27;t tried straightening them but I will soon also I think it&#x27;d be cute if I did a ponytail and attached the hair extensions over then pony tail with a ribbon, so yeah pretty ok hair extensions I guess but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Unrealistically shiny</li>
    <li> It looks like doll hair, feels like doll hair and when you try to style it, it pulls like doll hair and melts like doll hair... I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it again.</li>
    <li> This did not match my color. Description should state that it is more of a reddish brown instead of light brown. I had to return it. Thank you for the refund!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a little easier to use but my kids played with it and liked it</li>
    <li> These extensions worked great</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t even enough thickness to cover or build up my hair. And when I brished it the hair fell out. But it did make a great halloween costume for my son who went to an 80&#x27;s party and needed a mullet. He clipped it to the back of his head and put on a baseball cap.</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t match my hair at all, its was waaay to long the cap is really easy to apply, but the seams arent all the way stitched because the hair started coming undone at the ends of it</li>
    <li> loved this when i finally got it-took a bit too long for a perfect score-would buy in other colors if offered</li>
    <li> Everything that I have read in previous reviews is pretty true, but I still love them! I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but when they don&#x27;t work anymore, I will buy more. I ordered the light brown which has a reddish tint to it, which is great for me because that is the color of my hair. The hair looks great out of the holder but then starts to look ratty. If you brush it, it goes back to looking nice again. Very weird.. but again I love them. For the price, I think you get what you pay for. They give volume and do the trick for those days when you want longer hair or a fuller look. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product, especially for the price. Just be sure you buy the right color. It is the true color. I will be getting more!</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the quality of this hair piece!</li>
    <li> It was awful. it fell apart and was impossible to style or brush. It was also much darker than expected. it was almost black.</li>
    <li> Received in the mail today. Love the length and quality. Great packaging and I received it before the estimated delivery date. Love the color and everything about this item.</li>
    <li> It was too red and shiny (fake looking). The clips do not hold very well and not as much hair as pictured, but enough for the price in my opinion. Also, extremely staticky!</li>
    <li> Well, I thought it was a one piece but it came in several pieces. The quality was excellent. The color was not light brown it was like a reddish color.</li>
    <li> Hair is gorgeous terrific quality</li>
    <li> this is a piece of crap. it took weeks and weeks to get here and it falls apart when you try to brush it.  it looks and feels fake. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The color seemed to be more of a bronzy redish color than light brown.And I can only get one side to fit snug.</li>
    <li> Was very close to my natural hair color. Was here on time! Awesome.</li>
    <li> awesome for the price ordered mine in august and I have worn it 10 times and it still looks good!</li>
    <li> just got in my order after waiting anxiously for two weeks. the piece is a beautiful color, but has a little more red than in the picture. it doesnt match my hair color, but i want it to, so i plan on going in and getting it dyed in a few months (since my hair just was processed). it really is gorgeous and worth the money.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s decent. Clips were barely sewed on so will need to be repaired before using. Hair has a lot of red tones to it. Doesn&#x27;t feel like real human hair &amp; it falls out a LOT when brushed or even finger-combed. I&#x27;m really scared to try straightening it.</li>
    <li> It was okay quality. Definitely Kanekalon. Was soft at first but became unmanageable with daily use.</li>
    <li> I never wear it... wasnt worth buying</li>
    <li> I did not like it. The hair falls off easily. It is really thin. If someone is going to buy it, you will need  more the one. I loved the color.</li>
