    <li> These applicators are thinner than  I expected, even for a disposable applicator.</li>
    <li> They get the job done.</li>
    <li> they got here fast and I will be able to use them for all my homemade eyeshadows + with the left overs using them with my chalks and paint for my cards...</li>
    <li> These are pretty thin but  if you use once or twice they&#x27;re worth te buy so you don&#x27;t mix colors.</li>
    <li> They are not as soft and I thought they were.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to use, unlike some scratchy ones I had used in the past. Great bargain.</li>
    <li> A really great product. A good price too! I will buy these wands again!</li>
    <li> Great buy....Great seller.....will buy again.....Have to others</li>
    <li> Quality is very poor... For the price NOT WORTH IT..&lt;br /&gt;just don&#x27;t buy it..the cotton on top is off very poor quality</li>
    <li> Great for putting on stage makeup use; they are dispsable good for one time use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I like the packaging these arrived in and that it has it&#x27;s own sort of makeup case to keep them in if you want but the padding on the actual shadow applicators is thin so sometimes it rips through and the plastic hurts.</li>
    <li> They are too short. I will not order again.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these things just do yourself a favor and invest in real eyeshadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I was having problems with my eyes feeling irritated and I blamed it on the built-in sponge tip on my eyeliner pencils.  Even though I washed them regularly, I couldn&#x27;t get them clean.  I found these DISPOSABLE dual sided sponge tipped make up blenders and they are fantastic!  I use these to blend my eyeliner and now I don&#x27;t have irritated eyes!  These are perfect for blending makeup and are sanitary!  Use it and throw it away!</li>
