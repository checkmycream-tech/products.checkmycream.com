      <li>A great brush for overall control.</li>
      <li>and I must say that this brush is so comfortable.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my fiancee he was excited about the purchase.</li>
      <li>Unique shape</li>
      <li>and this is amazing its soft.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a good brush.</li>
      <li>The real fun part is that my son who&#x27;s 11, got jealous now he wants a crown brush.</li>
      <li>Absolutely!!</li>
      <li>The oval shape and curved design allows for better overall coverage during my brushing session and allows for fine detailing that you just can&#x27;t get with a square brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a soft brush</li>
      <li>And medium so you could start with a fresh cut and use it while your wolfing</li>
      <li>It was definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush for a low cut.</li>
      <li>Was it worth the $30 I paid?</li>
      <li>in the time it took for connections to form get one worth every penny ,. .,.</li>
      <li>The bristle combination of the medium/soft is perfect but expect a little shedding upon first use as with any new brush.</li>
      <li>Lays your hair down and gives it a nice shine!</li>
      <li>worth the money it took about a 1 1/2 to 2 weeks to get here which is very fast care packages</li>
      <li>This particular one feels nice on the head, and definitely improves the sides.</li>
      <li>First day I couldn&#x27;t stop brushing my hair...</li>
      <li>Also my right side was just weak (wave wise) and this Premium brush along with my others have strengthened my waves and connections all the way around my head.</li>
      <li>great brush, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
      <li>This brush really helps to get your waves in.</li>
      <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
      <li>I should have taken a star away for that,but this brush really helps to improve your waves.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t even get here that fast</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a fantastic product</li>
      <li>It really does help i just started waving</li>
      <li>I like this brush, but it is not as firm as I would have liked it.</li>
      <li>First of all this was no way the easiest thing going from straight hair to being able to lay it down, but I tried.</li>
      <li>This soft brush really does what it&#x27;s post to do!</li>
      <li>Its like its massaging my hair as I brush, The thing I noticed the most is how my hair lays down as I brush.</li>
      <li>In not even a week in a half my waves were getting  deeper and better connected.</li>
      <li>when I&#x27;m wolfin ( I got the Royal Blue Crown CQP and Titanium White Caeser CQP for that :))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s larger than my other brushes but it fits my hands nicely.</li>
      <li>It even makes your waves pop out a little more.</li>
      <li>Not very travel friendly.</li>
      <li>The old design of this brush was a lot bigger and the bristles were much longer.</li>
      <li>I guess you should expect this with the mixture of medium boar bristles and soft bristles.</li>
      <li>The bristles are too soft</li>
      <li>At 10-15 dollars for a price that should last you several months even to a year, it&#x27;s worth consideration towards naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No other soft brush compares.</li>
      <li>So much in fact that you can forget that you&#x27;re brushing your hair if you have long brushing sessions.</li>
      <li>Natural products are expensive, but there&#x27;s a reason the top wavers aren&#x27;t using nearly as much if any pomades or dollar store shampoos as newer wavers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s something fancy but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s expectation in my eye.</li>
      <li>&quot; It costs a little bit more than the other Crown brushes</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be picking up another in the near future.</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush for my ten year old son.</li>
      <li>I had acquired the medium &amp; soft brushes and felt that the premium brush was \\&quot;the next bullet to add to the clip!\\</li>
      <li>This brush by Cqp does exactly what the makers of this brush said it would do .It lays your waves down as if you had a durag on your head for hours.</li>
      <li>This brush does train your hair and lays it down  exactly as the description suggests.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Use: consistently for a few months</li>

<li> When I went and used this brush after the medium &amp; soft the biggest difference I noticed is how my hair was laying down.</li>
<li> If your hair is thick and nappy, you&#x27;re going to need something stronger for sure, like the CQP Hard.</li>
<li> This is why I don&#x27;t use this as a shower brush because, hey, you already spent 30 bucks, you might as well let the quality last.</li>
<li> compared it to my other one and saw that it&#x27;s bigger and wider</li>
<li> Only down side is the picture show&#x27;s a bag in the background, but it didnt come with the bag.</li>
<li> Less than a couple weeks later I have 360 waves.</li>
<li> For some odd reason, Crown Quality does not sell the burgundy bag on their website, as the brushes typically do not come with the bag, so I just opted for the black one.</li>
<li> It definitely takes less time to get the ways you desire.</li>
<li> Out of the soft medium and hard</li>
<li> Even tho they sent me the green one instead of the red</li>
<li> That let me know that there is a difference between Crown brushes and other brushes on the market.</li>
<li> You can feel the bristles pulling your hair as you brush and this one is fairly larger than the brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> The medium is hard so I only use it while wet in the shower.</li>
<li> But the quality of the brush as far as the paint,and it coming off the brush getting on your hands and clothes really sucks!</li>

    <li> No worth the money. Unique shape</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy on the head. Not very travel friendly.</li>
    <li> It really does help i just started waving and this is amazing its soft. And medium so you could start with a fresh cut and use it while your wolfing</li>
    <li> Thee brush to have when it comes to training the hair. Waves will thank you and continue to wash over the head.</li>
    <li> Awesomness!!!!  Just brought my 3rd brush I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes......(((But I need my BAGS?)))  Great product &amp; my waves are on SWIM!</li>
    <li> This brush does everything cup said it would! In not even a week in a half my waves were getting  deeper and better connected. It was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This brush by Cqp does exactly what the makers of this brush said it would do .It lays your waves down as if you had a durag on your head for hours.It even makes your waves pop out a little more.But the quality of the brush as far as the paint,and it coming off the brush getting on your hands and clothes really sucks! I should have taken a star away for that,but this brush really helps to improve your waves.</li>
    <li> I know the price is a bit steep, but considering I cut my own hair the amount I save on going to the barber shop I figured I could splurge on brush. Money well spent...best brush I have and will ever own. First day I couldn&#x27;t stop brushing my hair...never had anything like it. The contour is sick and a bit larger than expected, but it works as it takes fewer strokes to brush my hair. Only down side is the picture show&#x27;s a bag in the background, but it didnt come with the bag. Otherwise great purchase!</li>
    <li> Even tho they sent me the green one instead of the red I lik it a lot better compared it to my other one and saw that it&#x27;s bigger and wider</li>
    <li> This brush is a quality grooming tool, well put together. It definitely takes less time to get the ways you desire. I will recommend this product to anyone. Well worth the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> great brush, not too hard, not too soft. perfect for  creating and laying down 360 waves</li>
    <li> CQP made a nice brush with good quality, I like my premium for great depth and control ranks right up there with Phillips,Kent and my favorite Diane. A great brush for overall control.</li>
    <li> My waves have gotten way better. It&#x27;s more of a soft brush but it brushes great</li>
    <li> This brush is absolutely terrible. I absolutely hate the new 360 gold premium brushes. The old design of this brush was a lot bigger and the bristles were much longer.</li>
    <li> This brush really helps to get your waves in. When you&#x27;re brushing, don&#x27;t brush too hard, but it&#x27;ll tell you everything you need to know when you buy it.</li>
    <li> After hearing good words from the 360 wave community, I decided to give this brush a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#x27;s get the negatives out of the way. For some odd reason, Crown Quality does not sell the burgundy bag on their website, as the brushes typically do not come with the bag, so I just opted for the black one. No biggie. Also, although I&#x27;ve yet to experience this, I&#x27;ve heard the logo will come off and the paint will chip with water. This is why I don&#x27;t use this as a shower brush because, hey, you already spent 30 bucks, you might as well let the quality last. In the end of the day, the bristles get you waves so if you&#x27;re not big on the paint or logo, have at it. Same also applies when you wash the brush. Wash only the bristle area if you want to preserve the logo and outer surface. When it comes to the price, you get what you paid for. Dianes, Annies, CQP&#x27;s, and all brushes will you get waves: some are just more efficient than others. Same with shampoo. Natural products are expensive, but there&#x27;s a reason the top wavers aren&#x27;t using nearly as much if any pomades or dollar store shampoos as newer wavers. At 10-15 dollars for a price that should last you several months even to a year, it&#x27;s worth consideration towards naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on the positives: This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve made towards brushes. You can feel the bristles pulling your hair as you brush and this one is fairly larger than the brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past. I&#x27;m in love with the bristles and this will forever be my go to brush when I get a fresh cut and my finisher when I&#x27;m wolfin ( I got the Royal Blue Crown CQP and Titanium White Caeser CQP for that :))Take my word for it. Give CQP a try and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical about this brush. I just cut off all my relaxed hair and decided I wanted to try out some brush waves. First of all this was no way the easiest thing going from straight hair to being able to lay it down, but I tried. It worked. Less than a couple weeks later I have 360 waves. I didn&#x27;t even have to brush a lot. I just brushed in the am &amp; before bed. &amp; of course I&#x27;m a woman so I&#x27;m not walking around with a brush all day. The real fun part is that my son who&#x27;s 11, got jealous now he wants a crown brush. Lol. He&#x27;s not touching mine.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this one along with the medium. The medium is hard so I only use it while wet in the shower. But they work great &amp; get the job done</li>
    <li> Im in Afghanistan and just received my C.Q.P I like everything about it like people said before in their reviews it lays your hair down and it doesn&#x27;t make your scalp raw at all I just started getting serious about my waving because when I&#x27;m not working I have nothing but time on my hands my wave pattern and connection looks great and I only use it here and there because I have a wav enforcer brush its well worth the money it took about a 1 1/2 to 2 weeks to get here which is very fast care packages don&#x27;t even get here that fast so I give it a 5 out of 5</li>
    <li> Best product for waves it is amazing if u have the budget buy this brush it will get u the results</li>
    <li> This soft brush really does what it&#x27;s post to do! Lays your hair down and gives it a nice shine! CQP is the best brushes around! Don&#x27;t just get one! Get them all!</li>
    <li> Out of the soft medium and hard this is definitely the finisher.  It&#x27;s great for forming and improving your connections, its definitely a PREMIUM brush,  outstanding quality.  I would recommend this to people who already have waves but are looking to better their connections.</li>
    <li> If your serious about waves this is a start, believe it not all brushes react diffrent to hair textures and waves on diffrent lengths cqp has played a big role in my wave development</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my ten year old son. He doesn&#x27;t need mommy to brush his hair anymore  :  (  He loves it . It fits perfectly in his hand and his hair looks great. He achieved waves in just 5 days. Will be purchasing a couple more just in case he misplaces it.</li>
    <li> I had acquired the medium &amp; soft brushes and felt that the premium brush was \\&quot;the next bullet to add to the clip!\\&quot; It costs a little bit more than the other Crown brushes but I totally understand why. When I went and used this brush after the medium &amp; soft the biggest difference I noticed is how my hair was laying down. By this time it had been about 3-4 weeks since I had cut my hair and usually around that time my hair would not lay down the way I desired. But I instantly noticed that the Premium brush eliminated that issue. Also my right side was just weak (wave wise) and this Premium brush along with my others have strengthened my waves and connections all the way around my head. I just finished my 7th week of wolfing and my hair looks like I&#x27;ve been wolfing for only 2-3 weeks. That let me know that there is a difference between Crown brushes and other brushes on the market. The bristles feel real good. So much in fact that you can forget that you&#x27;re brushing your hair if you have long brushing sessions. Was it worth the $30 I paid? Absolutely!! I am a supporter &amp; user of Crown brushes. The only one I have yet to get is the Hard brush. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone but my waves have gone to another level.</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong brush with the handle the was open and everything seem like someone use the brush alreadi</li>
    <li> To soft and the website never has anything online not worth the money</li>
    <li> This premium is the best all around brush it lays my hair doen at all stages from fresh.cut to 6 to 7 Weeks wolfin I saw a incredible Change in my pattern and in the time it took for connections to form get one worth every penny ,. .,.</li>
    <li> Great brush bristles stand the test of time and it defines your waves  I use nothing but crown quality brushes</li>
    <li> Bought it for my fiancee he was excited about the purchase. He is still considering purchasing another brush. He stopped his daily use of wave builder based off his barber advice and strictly brush. The waves aren&#x27;t as prominent as they were before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: consistently for a few months</li>
    <li> I like this brush, but it is not as firm as I would have liked it. I guess you should expect this with the mixture of medium boar bristles and soft bristles. This brush does train your hair and lays it down  exactly as the description suggests.Overall this is a good brush. Be prepared to wait after ordering it took approximately 14 days to arrive</li>
    <li> Just got this brush a few days ago and I must say that this brush is so comfortable. Its like its massaging my hair as I brush, The thing I noticed the most is how my hair lays down as I brush. No other soft brush compares. Shout out to crown quality products.</li>
    <li> I expected more from this product. It&#x27;s something fancy but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s expectation in my eye.</li>
    <li> My son has use better brush it&#x27;s not all that.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush for a low cut. If your hair is thick and nappy, you&#x27;re going to need something stronger for sure, like the CQP Hard. This particular one feels nice on the head, and definitely improves the sides. I&#x27;d recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary of the CQP logo on the brush, it will come off within a couple days of use, if not less.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve owned to date! It&#x27;s larger than my other brushes but it fits my hands nicely. The oval shape and curved design allows for better overall coverage during my brushing session and allows for fine detailing that you just can&#x27;t get with a square brush. The bristle combination of the medium/soft is perfect but expect a little shedding upon first use as with any new brush. Overall it&#x27;s a fantastic product and I&#x27;ll be picking up another in the near future.</li>
