<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They came way before it was actually going to come , it came in good , looks perfect</li>
    <li> Love this stuff ... I think it blends great</li>
    <li> Amazing product.Its only 3 dolldollars.I will buy a few more . I love it.</li>
    <li> I am not happy, it appears online that you are getting a lot of product, but after a few uses, it concealer was used up!</li>
    <li> awful. didn&#x27;t even come in the mail. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but that is not my problem. My problem is the colors are not the same as in the picture &amp; are not ideal for my skin tone. &amp; the product is very oily.</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT FOR BEGINNERS ! not as opaque as I though it would be but it&#x27;s pretty good for highlighting- I still don&#x27;t understand the glitter ?? but either way it&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> Good amount of colors the only problem is that it was super small... way smaller then what i expected!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE ITS LIKE A PASTE NOT EVEN RIGHT TEXTURE</li>
    <li> Very greasy and clogs up pores but other than that great colors</li>
    <li> Smaller then I expected but it&#x27;s alright</li>
    <li> Very satisfied!  Just opened it; nothing broken, packaged securely. I&#x27;m gna practice highlighting and contouring now.  I&#x27;m so excited! !!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. This product really covers well. I love love love it!</li>
    <li> Came all melted and colors bleeding together</li>
    <li> This product came on time. Note: it is a cream based concealer palette.</li>
    <li> My wife loved the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good size palette, love it</li>
    <li> The quality was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Its my first day using it but it made my dark circles disappear alttle bit more.</li>
    <li> What is the ingredient lisf???</li>
    <li> Really thick and goopy.  I should have read more closely it&#x27;s from China and it&#x27;s not clear what the ingredients might be.</li>
    <li> Seems pretty decent, will be using it for my Halloween costume. so we will see how it goes</li>
    <li> I seen this item on a YouTube video. I wanted to try it out and I am happy I did. I love it but it does take a long time to come.</li>
    <li> use this product as a high light under my brows and cheekbones. Love it, but shopping took a while.. Worth it though</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even use the pallete, when I finally received my order I was disappointed that they were so oily and looked very unnatural on the skin.</li>
    <li> Its good for contouring under foundation to keep certain blemishes on your face hidden.</li>
    <li> Just received this palette! Its sooo amazing and it looks so pretty im inlove! The color selection is beyond amazing! Great seller and super fast  shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wide variety of color I love it for contouring and highlighting and great for covering acne and blemishes it is medium coverage and needs a setting powder also tends to increase if u don&#x27;t use a primer overall a nice product it gives a flawless effect when contouring and highlighting</li>
    <li> the colors have a nasty gray undertone , well the darker colors . does NOT look like the picture</li>
    <li> Nice little camouflage concealer, my niece takes it everywhere in her little purse, she loves it</li>
    <li> A longer wait but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love, love this concealers!! i already ordered two more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay color are hard to blend and all look the same &amp; have a grayish under tone wouldn&#x27;t re purchase or recommend</li>
    <li> sort of dry, streaky on face however really good for eyebrows do make them sharper still do not know what the sparkly one is for they last a good time</li>
    <li> Did not go on good too oily</li>
    <li> No Complaints Here! Does the job well :)</li>
    <li> i will tell my frends to use it</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;They were actually alot bigger then expected i have been able to use all colors and im white. Very good very very good! The only down is that it took like 5 months to ship.</li>
    <li> Great product makes eyebrows look natural !</li>
    <li> It was cheap so basically I got what I paid for. I don&#x27;t always use it and there isn&#x27;t much to use.</li>
    <li> It works great, just runs out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a little long.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Received it in perfect condition. At first I swatched it and it seemed a little oily/greasy on my fingertips, but it didn&#x27;t stop there. I decided to try and contour and highlight with it. &amp; IT IS NOT what it reviews say it is. It&#x27;s very thick and hard to blend with. It has a sticky feel to it so it makes your face feel nasty, you would need to set it with a matte powder or translucent powder to stop the shine look of it. And you would need two brushes because highlighting and the contour colors would just mix together. It&#x27;s decent for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing again but it takes a LONG time to receive and it&#x27;s very small.</li>
    <li> AWFUL! Buyer beware. This concealer has sparkles in it. One is just a glitter gel. I contacted the seller and have yet to hear back. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed because the colors they have appear very pigmented but once applied to face every color looks ashy ( btw I&#x27;m a brown skin complextion ) I&#x27;m not sure if people with lighter skin will experience this as well , but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone dark skin .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER the shipping did come very fast and the packaging is very nice.</li>
    <li> Love the creamy texture</li>
    <li> Creamy but not very pigmanted and not much in the pods probably about 5 uses for each pod</li>
    <li> not good at all, white color was just a clear shimmer</li>
    <li> Really nice and fast shipping</li>
    <li> very oily for my skin type, it melts and sticks very easily to Clothing</li>
    <li> I told myself when I bought this concealer palette that if it sucked I would only be out $6 and well I&#x27;m out $6.  The green corrector shade has the consistency of lip gloss...it just makes my face look like I&#x27;m putting oil under my eyes (not cute at all).  The other shades would be ok to use but they are so oily.  I have oily skin and all i see is me ending up with a big zit after using this palette. I didn&#x27;t cover any of the hyper pigmentation on my face and made my matte foundation feel greasy.  So it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me</li>
    <li> the colors don&#x27;t seem to blend easily.</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for the perfect concealer (to cover dark circles that I inherited - Thanks mom/dad), and have yet to find it.  I am not saying that this concealer set isn&#x27;t good, but as a fair skinned person, I think they should offer a fair, medium and dark set, because there are some on here (a lot) that I will never use, no matter how tan I get.  So that seems like a waste to me.  As far as coverage goes, it gives me moderate coverage, but I have a few others that do better.  I will keep searching, have a few more to come in and hopefully I will find the perfect one.</li>
    <li> its perfect for every day wear gives you a beautiful glow and looks great on darker skin tones as well and even to use as eye shadow . love iit</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer  good price and it didn&#x27;t take very long for it to get deliver.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this pallet and like all of the different shades to choose from</li>
    <li> This product took a long time to come in the mail, I forgot I even bought it. Just so you know what to expect. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product though. The colors look completely different once you dip your finger in. It&#x27;s just like a false first layer. The colors are extremely orange, you can even see streaks of orange pigment in some of my colors. Too bad, cause I had high hopes for this from the good reviews. Stick to a drugstore concealer if you want to save money, or go with a high end palette if you really want something like this. This poorly made product will just end up in the trash.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great delivery time!</li>
    <li> Works great. Price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> well after i gave my first review of a 1 do to how long it takes to get my email was blowen up my the owner to remove my comment and.ratin. but it did show up sooner then i thought so thats good.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not enough product, but for the price, you definitely cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> It is as pictured on the website.  It has many different shades.  It covers fairly well.  It did not come with a tool to apply it.  I have been using a new lipstick brush, which works reasonably well.</li>
    <li> It reeks of chemicals but hey if you want it on your face go for it.</li>
    <li> I just received my palette. It&#x27;s terrific. I was getting a a little worried about the delivery time but it came early. I&#x27;m so impressed. I&#x27;m 53 years old and my skin isn&#x27;t the way it use to be.  I have also bought a foundation brush, etude house brow pencil, 10pair eyelashes and blending sponge. Terrific products. I am ordering different products and I will be reordering when I get. Low. They have so many wonderful things to buy. Thank You Amazon.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and a great product.</li>
    <li> the circles are smaller than they look in the picture</li>
    <li> I love this Palette!!! The Prime-Shipping is an additional bonus that makes this just a steal! My palette came wrapped nicely with bubble wrap in the box and it wasn&#x27;t melted or imprinted in any way. With this palette its hard to tell from the picture but in addition to the skin color concealer shades, there are also corrective shades a pink, green and golden yellow. I do have to say the concealer colors in this palette are more on the warmer side. Just a warning to the lighter skinned girls: I have very fair skin with blue undertones and the lightest shade was still a shade too dark/warm for me (then again it is winter as I&#x27;m writing this review, should be fine in summer). I was surprised to find a silvery shimmer color which makes a phenomenal highlight if you plan on using this palette as for highlighting and contouring! These concealers are creamy to the touch and have awesome staying power! A setting powder is definitely a must or the concealers will break down over the coarse of the day/night as your skin produces oil. Overall a great buy for $7 with free shipping, I couldn&#x27;t purchase all of these colors even at the drugstore for even a $100 to have the versatility this palette has. Get it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Came faster then expected. It was just as described. ..</li>
    <li> I liked the color palette . Very easy to blend.</li>
    <li> super cute and very creamy. love it</li>
    <li> Worked sort of well. Felt cakey though and smelled like cheap plastic. I left it in my car in the shade in a makeup box and it melted all over everything! I guess it would work if you had good powder to go with it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these but unfortunately the color wears off quickly and the pigmentation is not as intense, I was hoping for a good contouring palette and I was a bit disappointed, the coverage is thin and wears off almost instantly.</li>
    <li> this is a must for a makeup kit, good for all types of skin colors, good price too!</li>
    <li> I love the color works great</li>
    <li> I did not receive the case I ordered. I ordered the one with six neutral colors, and I got one with around 15. They are cream and the case they came in is tiny. Overall not excited about this product.</li>
    <li> I like. I contour and highlight with this pallet</li>
    <li> Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes the product.</li>
    <li> Love these concealers!!!! I use them everyday!</li>
    <li> Colors are all very sheer. Don&#x27;t plan on using this as any sort of concealer. Equivalent to the quality of children&#x27;s play make up. Also very greasy when used on eyelids.</li>
    <li> I really like this item however its very very small.</li>
    <li> I use this as foundation and this product conceals everything leaving a wonderful porcelain looking skin</li>
    <li> I love these concealers. I&#x27;m able to contour my face flawlessly.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used one of the colors. Not bad for the price. Very creamy!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture of this product I thought it was going to be more of a powder and not so much as an oily product. I don&#x27;t really regret buying the product because I have a new date with my actual make up I just tried it on but I am considering on buying a powdered can&#x27;t work it because I think it would be more useful. And the sender was fast considering that they are from China so it did come earlier then the delivery date</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover like the expensive brands but offers many blend able options!!!</li>
    <li> Really good product and good seller.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and blends nicely but after a few hours it starts getting thick and muddy moving around on your face..even after powder ... Its good for pictures I suppose but not all day wear</li>
    <li> PERFECT for contouring! I am outstanded by this! I will definitely be ordering again once I run out!</li>
    <li> It was alot smaller than it was portrayed its about 5 by 3 but for the price I can&#x27;t be upset</li>
    <li> The circles are about the size of a quarter. the pallet is smaller than i expected but it the actual product is not bad. It its creamy, not strong pigmented but for the price it is not the worse. I do not regret this purchase. I used it for the first time today. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed for no break outs.</li>
    <li> I havent received anything! They ripped me off aaaaand.. They will not respond back to any of my emails!</li>
    <li> Wonderful concealer pallette :) It covers my acne scars nicely!</li>
    <li> Horrible very cheap low budget very sticky</li>
    <li> A great concealer palette--it also has yellow, green and rose corrective creams and a really subtle highlighter. Wow--months later and I still keep finding uses for this palette.  Great for highlight and contour, concealer, the pigments can be used as subtle eye shadows.  Again, a really amazing purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found a concealer palette that I love! The colors in this palette are really amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, I&#x27;m pretty acne-prone and tend to break out when I&#x27;m using makeup products that cover my face (like foundation, concealer, BB cream, etc.), but this doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are highly pigmented cream concealers, and they last the whole day upon application. I actually bought this set because I&#x27;m starting to experiment with contouring, and this is perfect for that. These are very easy to blend and glides onto my face easily. I don&#x27;t have clear skin, but the concealer does a good job of masking that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted a cheap set to play around with before I become good at using make-up, but this is pretty good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, it only took two weeks to ship to me.</li>
    <li> So creamy! I love it so much!</li>
    <li> it barely works! barely shows up. sucks.</li>
    <li> Very cheap case and cheap makeup. Does not cover well.</li>
    <li> I like the colors but it kind of looks cheap but again what can you expect for 3 dollars..</li>
    <li> Works well makes my face a tad oily but I just cover with powder foundation</li>
    <li> came earlier that expected. this palette is great. use it everyday</li>
    <li> Very creamy and easy to use pallet. I seriously use this all the time to contour and hide blemishes. For those of you that don&#x27;t knw, the green is to hide red colors, the yellow is to hide purple colors and the pink is to hide brownish colors. There is also a shimmery shade which I like to use along my check bones during the summer. Gives U a nice glow effect.</li>
    <li> Great starter case for new concealer users!</li>
    <li> Great learning kit. Creamy product, so be sure to set with powder; unless you want a dewy finish. BLEND, people! Blending is okay to do.</li>
    <li> I love this palette so much i had to get me a back up.. it came on time works out awesome for me..👍💕💕</li>
    <li> Absolutely am in love, it came a lot faster than expected (about 2 weeks). The colors are great! Really creamy and smooth. Blends really well. Priced awesome!</li>
    <li> Not very creamy/blendable but you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> very pleased with everthing p</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Concealer Pallet,  I pictured it to be Big though.  It didn&#x27;t bother me one Bit I love it sooo Much.  I WILL be ordering another when this one runs out. It also came before Delivery Date which is a Plus :)</li>
    <li> It is a horrible product I do not recommend this to anyone. Has no pigmentation i can&#x27;t even get it in to my brush. Its dry and it has a nasty feeling.</li>
    <li> The white was not that white and they didnt blend well enough</li>
    <li> good coverage and lots of colors to blend together to match your skin throughout the seasons.  Just make sure you order a few weeks ahead of when you need it since it takes a few weeks to get here.</li>
    <li> Not really pigmented and kind of oily for my skin. Great for corrective concealing, just use more powder. Prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> Product works nicely but is quite small.  I used one of the shades once and can already see the bottom.</li>
    <li> It has this many color and it&#x27;s pretty cheap. Good to use as well.</li>
    <li> Has all you could ask for.</li>
    <li> Cannot get enough of this stuff its just amazing how you can cover up breakouts or just use it as a every day aplication i have gotten more comments and compliments then ever before i just cant live without this stuff i allways make sure to keep a extra one just in case</li>
    <li> Just as I expected..  great variety of colors and good consistency.</li>
    <li> got it for mixing with liquid foundation but it evidently doesnt work well on my skin combination. i&#x27;m pretty oily in contouring areas so im sure this will work with everyone else?</li>
    <li> it is too much of a paste it doesnt even last doesnt cover blemishes or scars well</li>
    <li> Camouflages dark spots, pimples, acne. You can also contour and sculpt with this product. It really makes the skin look airbrushed and flawless</li>
    <li> This palette is wack! The colors are not the same as pictured. They don&#x27;t have the dark colors pictured and the colors are not pigmented at all. The deepest color is like a grey color. They&#x27;re extremely greasy andthe remind me of tinted lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture.</li>
    <li> The only reason I out this concealer kit as 3 stars is because of how I received it. I live in California, which is known as a generally hot place to live, but nothing like this has happened to me before. When I received the kit I noticed smudges of the concealer around and on the top, which was odd. Then, upon opening the kit I saw that ALL the concealers were completely melted, dripping out the sides of the container. They were all liquified and disgusting. Many concealers had been mixed together. I salvaged the concealers as much as possible and let them cool in the fridge overnight.  All of the concealers had now spots of different colors, and some of them were still not useable. Besides all the obvious issues, the concealers to have medium/good coverage and are great for conturing and highlighting. I just wish I had got them as they are shown in the picture. Not really worth it.</li>
    <li> The colors are darker and not very good for fair skin and also tend to be very orangy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  Goes in smooth. doesn&#x27;t blend easy.</li>
    <li> Thus stuff don&#x27;t work very well for conturing</li>
    <li> Item was pm time but product not what I expected.</li>
    <li> More like paint than makeup</li>
    <li> Poor quality suggest to invest in something rather than this</li>
    <li> Great colors.. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> The quality and or pigment is to thin n light. It has no coverage ability. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great colors to work with when trying to hide little imperfections.  Just ordered two more sets.  This goes a long way but don&#x27;t want to ever run out.</li>
    <li> Those dark brown are not in the pallet at all. More of like a charcoal grey</li>
    <li> I love this product, I just wish I knew what was in it. Does anyone know if its harmful to skin?</li>
    <li> Never got this s*** !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale so this kit is all too dark for me lol. I think the quality is pretty good for what you pay. I didn&#x27;t like how artificial the cream contouring looked. I think I&#x27;ll stick with powders. Also I&#x27;m cool skin toned and thus was very orange on me.</li>
    <li> The colors are awful and unnatural looking also the consistency it horrendous. Pay a little more for a quality palette set this one is an absolute waste.</li>
    <li> Good price for the product.</li>
    <li> This thing is a disappointment the make it look so BIG on the picture but its not obe color is already gone of how small it is imagine a quater (the coin) that is tye soze of one color please dont waste your money on this !!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S useful, but its a little grassy</li>
    <li> Love this, and how it has many colors, for a good match</li>
    <li> Honestly for something this cheap to work the way it does, its actually a good value, Is it the best product in the world no, but it definitely does its job. I even used the color corrector and it work great, no complaints Also super cheap. Shipping was decent too</li>
    <li> Its great but i didnt use all the colors they didnt look good with my skin color.</li>
    <li> Does what is suppose to</li>
    <li> I love this product with all the colors it blends very well but i do have to apply twice a day but i don&#x27;t mind .</li>
    <li> Hard to get the first layer of color off but once you do, works like magic.</li>
    <li> Great coverage worth the money</li>
    <li> Just got it today, a week before i thought i would, and love it. Exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> This product has some red undertones on the darker colors, which I&#x27;m not a fan of, the beige colors don&#x27;t look the same on skin as they do inside palette, they look really pale on skin, the product is super thick &amp; greasy so I limit my use with it but does the job for the price I guess.</li>
    <li> Such a great product ! Why waste a lot of money on brand name products when this does the work.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter she liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> It was good it is very greasy and a little oily but I use it to contour and highlight it is good if you mix it with a oil free moisturizer  and set it with a powder . It came pretty fast considering the estimated delivery was a month from the day I ordered it I&#x27;d buy it again for the price you just have to find ways to work with it</li>
    <li> Very good for the price! It blends nicely</li>
    <li> This concealer is amazing. Though I am not dark skinned I can use it as a contour. I love the color choices and use a variety of the colors daily. The make is nice and creamy when you warm it up with your finger. It is super blendable</li>
    <li> Ive ordered this product before and it was amazing. so I decided to order 2 more, one for my mom because she loved it so much and another for myself. I was very disappointed. It was a different formula than the one I purchased previously :( It doesn&#x27;t give you good coverage and falls into the creases easily. Wish I had something better to say.</li>
    <li> Recived earlier then expect so that was a plus , nice quality alil goes a long way</li>
    <li> The darker shade is too dark there isn&#x27;t an in between for my particular skin tone ... I have to mix to get the proper contour darker shade I order to contour correctly</li>
    <li> Nice and compact however it was smaller that I thought it would be. But the product and coverage is great!</li>
    <li> I think the only thing wrong with this was, I thought it was going up be a buffer pallet but it was a bit small. But, you can&#x27;t beat 5 dollars right? Coverage is pretty good. I use it to contour and it works great for that</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was the lowest priced contouring makeup I could find. And it was worth it. I don&#x27;t wear it that often so the small circles will last me awhile.  The product casing was cracked. A peice was actually broke off. But I still give it a four star because it came from overseas and that is a lot of traveling and getting throwed around. That did not damage the actual makeup. It was not melted as I was afraid it would be. I&#x27;m still very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Irritates skin.... Left red rash on my face... I&#x27;m not sensitive to racial products either</li>
    <li> Everything is blurred, damaged box, several colors emerged completely.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Please give me back my money.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the nice color pallet. I tried a few colors until I&lt;br /&gt;found the best combination for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;It works really good, especially, if you first apply the green color to&lt;br /&gt;neutralize your imperfections and then apply the color or mix of a few&lt;br /&gt;colors that is the closest to your skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
    <li> 2 star for me as I am very light complected.good for olive and darker</li>
    <li> This product is not real.  There is no such con sealer like this.  This product should be removed from shelf. Bad bad bad</li>
    <li> Omg i love this It last long great for contouring and highlighting 😘😍😍</li>
    <li> Came in time. Packed properly. undamaged. And the product works great!! Just a tad oily, pigments stay in place wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The colors are much darker than expected.  The consistency is good though and with blending they go on very well.  I just wish there was a palette with a lighter scope of colors</li>
    <li> To greasy for my complexion and not so pigmented but overall ok</li>
    <li> These concealers are really oily;product rarely stays on the face. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Shipping did take a little while.</li>
    <li> Umm, I like this product, and it&#x27;s creamy and easy to apply. But...you get what you pay for, I ran out of my fave colors in about 10 days, but great to test out colors.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice as a starter piece kit to play around with but all in all the creams are dry and can be difficult to spread. I use as accents with my regular liquid concealer as a base.</li>
    <li> This broke my face out almost immediately after applying.  I will say that I do have sensitive skin, but I don&#x27;t usually feel and see the effect so rapidly.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.  Aside from all of that, I didn&#x27;t like the consistency.  It felt cakey and a bit greasy to me.</li>
    <li> The product was smaller than expected, and had melted and resolodified in the shipping. Quality of product is similar to cheap Halloween face paint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dark skin so I thought it was a little darker but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Hated this. All of the colors made me look like ghost.</li>
    <li> its good for the price. highly upset on how long it took to get to me it took a moth for this item to get to me. its really oily  but if you have a powder foundation it will make it decent looking on you. wouldnt recommend this for skin of color....black people....and i think ive broken out on my face from using this.</li>
    <li> This is insane! Why would they mail me an item that is fully melted ? I was so excited to try it out but I have like nothing to try. Don&#x27;t buy this product because this might happen to you too.</li>
    <li> Okay so it&#x27;s a little smaller than expected,  not a huge deal however. BUT I can say the white is NOT white it&#x27;s more of an iridescent and the fact that there are zero instructions for a rookie is uber irritating. Product does however appear to go on smoothly if nothing else.</li>
    <li> Piece of u know what!!! Shame on y&#x27;all for selling this war paint!!!!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the delivery and the concealer satisfied with it all</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, was completely melted and all the colors were mixed together. Immediately went in the trash!</li>
    <li> Loved it has all the colors you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> Creamy, not cakey, doesn&#x27;t build up, covers well</li>
    <li> The color blends and is easy to apply but it does not stay nor show up since it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into your skin. Once blended there is hardly any color left. It feels smooth if not a little oily or moisturizing so maybe good for dry skin types. But after the effort of applying it I would like to see the result. Will try another brand.</li>
    <li> ITS really oily do not use if you are looking for something to last only thing I use this for is to highlight my brows nothing other than that</li>
    <li> I bought this for contouring and maybe concealing. Contouring worked pretty well but not good for under eye concealing. Product lays into your fine lines and looks very cakey. I will still use it but a little disappointed on quality.</li>
    <li> i liked it at first but it made me break out really bad... there are no ingredients anywhere so i dont know if i am allergic to any of the ingredients</li>
    <li> Loved it long lasting great product it matches my skin prefect great great great great love it great great hear</li>
    <li> Love this pallete. Works amazing! Just wish there was like one less flesh color and another yellow concealor in its place.</li>
    <li> Really greasy. Reminds me of play makeup I got as a kid.</li>
    <li> The colors are not the same as reflected in the picture and seem a bit darker than what I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> A little bit oily but perfect when you throw some compact powder over the top :)</li>
    <li> Horrible, not the makeup in the pallette that is shown.  It is very caked up and leaves your face dry and &amp;#34;old looking&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great, but small amounts of each color.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I need to order me an other one!!</li>
    <li> Definitely not what was in the picture!!! packaging is super cheap, my cover arrived cracked already... but the product itself is pretty good if your considering the price. lol They are creamy the smell is not very great it smells very plastic or latex... will definitely Not be purchasing again, this is more for practicing contouring, if you are a pro I recommend just saving and buying a prestige brand</li>
    <li> I use this for contouring and its amazing</li>
    <li> These do not conceal anything..their consistency is exactly like tainted lip glosses.</li>
    <li> It came so ealry.  I don&#x27;t really care about the size (other reviews said it was too small) Great :)</li>
    <li> was melted, came from china I live in Florida, Not sure if I will use it.</li>
    <li> This is ok but i can only use a few colors. color correctors are too light for me.</li>
    <li> These cuties are easy to apply. They&#x27;re all lightweight and I didn&#x27;t have a hard time mixing the colors to cover up the flaws in my face and that also includes the dark circles under my eyes. Great product for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Had no idea it was going to be as good of a pallet as ot was.  I had to order it again.  I like these concealers more then my loreal concealer.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just got it and have been practicing. It is small but perfect for beginners like me. Thw product is creeeaaammy! If you have oily skin this may not be the best kind for you to use. Good color variety especially because youre able to kind of blend a couple of colors together to get the ideal shade tou need :)</li>
    <li> Coverage not so good and left my face looking kind of grayish..</li>
    <li> I love the pigmentation of the corrector also has an excellent price</li>
    <li> The product looks cheap, not professional usage. Also there is no brand name or direction on it. I do not want to ruin my skin . I threw it away immediately when I got. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Or this being a 3 $ item I was worried about the quality.  I read alot of commentsabout It being greasy or not pigmented. I recieved this in a week and opened it right away. when you use your fingers you will not pick up very much product. I used a firm concealer brush and it worked beautifully. Not oily. Blended smoothly. Lasted all day. The only thing I wish they would change is that there are no directions or anything at all anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it great product well worth it</li>
    <li> Love this product. Many colors to match different parts of your skin. It has great coverage and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I like it. I&#x27;ve used it on top of my makeup because it isn&#x27;t very heavy but I have also used it under my makeup. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused me any breakouts. There is NOT very much in each circle container, its very shallow. The compact doesn&#x27;t have any information that reveal ingredients or ounces of weight. Great for 1st time contours, like for weddings or plays. I will order more!</li>
    <li> Poor quality, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap product. Its sitting at the bottom of my basket. I only use it when I&#x27;m doing someone else&#x27;s makeup.</li>
    <li> This makeup is awful. Greasy, blotchy, very unnatural. Very sticky. No girl wants to smear sticky lipgloss-like goo over their face..</li>
    <li> Amazing!! &amp; the price is even better!</li>
    <li> Very shallow pots. Not for the professional or the light skinned person. (not if you plan to highlight /contour) But look at the price. Star off for shallow pots, star off for a month long delivery time when you could warehouse in US - or be honest about ship times, depending on location in China. It&#x27;s not /that/, random, I have regular suppliers in different areas and they&#x27;re always consistent based on location.</li>
    <li> Very useful. Has many good uses for make up concealer.</li>
    <li> I really love this concealer palette! I use it everyday as a contour kit and cover up.  I only wish that the pans were bigger and deeper, each pan is about the size of and American quarter if that helps determine the size.  For the price I paid I&#x27;m more than satisfied! I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
    <li> Colora are not te same as it appears !</li>
    <li> very waxy texture and clumpy looking when applied</li>
    <li> very thick almost feels like the children s face makeup that settles in your pores for Halloween. Not loving it.</li>
    <li> Not as much coverage as expected. But leaves a silky smooth texture I like.</li>
    <li> Lovely pallet a little greasy. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage it gives and all the colors you would need to cover up any flaws.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR PRACTICE PRICE AND AMOUNT FOR PRACTICING CONTOURING. GREAT STARTER.</li>
    <li> This beauty product is nothing but gel. It has no pigmentation at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it, might as well spend more money on a product thats worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest  I loved it at first, it&#x27;s creamy and a little  small but the consistency is really  great, it won&#x27;t wipe off like boom, and I love using it as concealer and contour. But okay I literally  only have had around 2 pimples in NY whole life and I always try to take care of my skin, I almost never get ancne and this product MADE ME BREAK OUT really bad. And im sooo dissapointed, I bought  this to boost up my confidence  cause you know  makeup. But this just completely  brought  it down. It&#x27;s so upsetting, I would say &amp;#34; I got what I payed for&amp;#34; BUT NO I seen the same product for around  80 cents!</li>
    <li> For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. The quality is great and it&#x27;s become a part of my daily makeup routine. I usually set with powder afterwards and my makeup looks great all day. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it! :)</li>
    <li> I liked this pallete a lot however it will finish way to early. Plus they need more lighter colors :)</li>
    <li> obviously for it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s not going to be the best concealer. when I got it it came nicely packaged, when I opened it, it looked fine but when I used it, the product was stickey and the colors come out a lot lighter than what they look like. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. I was looking for something cheap and that would work until I could get something nicer but for me, I&#x27;d rather go without concealer than use this product.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE VARIED COLORS.that way my sisters and friends can use them.it goes it s on smooth and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.i&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t run whe you sweat.I don&#x27;t have to reapply it.I don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it  will last a long timze</li>
    <li> Very very nice and its what i expected!!! Use it everyday now..recommend this product to anyone!! Thanks! High quality .</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying that I ordered this item September 25 and I just received it today, October 16. I think that 28 days is a little bit too long, especially since I&#x27;ve ordered stuff from China before and it took 5 days at the longest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the product is a little bit smaller than I thought it would be but for the price, it&#x27;s fine. The colors seem to be okay, not extremely long-lasting, but hides dark circles under your eyes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 2 stars because I was disappointed with the slow shipment, otherwise I would probably give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This was the worse concealer EVER It was thin more like a greasy substance jus was of 4bucks don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> To small the pallets were damaged</li>
    <li> Really amazing product for $3 ! I would have gave it 5stars but i feel like the concelour shades look all the same. Im happy mine didn&#x27;t come melted no complaints ((:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine..got here fast and looks as it should. I&#x27;ve only used the green so far but it feels fine on my face and isnt greasy or anything. Good buy for the price and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was completely melted when it arrived, all the colors mixed together. I&#x27;ve ordered this before and it was excellent so I will just try again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has all I need in one convenient perfect size makeup palette. Since I have limited space in my restroom to put all my things I appreciate the small size of this product. Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this concealer. Great shipping and price. Love the colors they blend perfectly and stay put all day.</li>
    <li> Great and smooth for skin. Also has a good amount of shades to choose from</li>
    <li> Great palette took long to arrive. Only downfall</li>
    <li> Wonderful palette. I am very light skinned so it is wonderful for contouring more so than concealing. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> shipped quick and is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Real s***ty. Once you blend the dark colors there not even there. Doesn&#x27;t work for contour.</li>
    <li> Not good at all its cheap and sticky.</li>
    <li> It does cover things... but it is definitely on the cakey side as far as concealers go. It does blend... kinda. I&#x27;d say this is decent for a cheap concealer palette.. but make sure you&#x27;re using good quality brushes and have good lighting.</li>
    <li> Never again...never again...nnnnoooooooooooooooooooooooiookkkoooooooooooooooooooo you get what u paid for I guess. But I wont get again. Nooiooooo nooooo nooooo noooo</li>
    <li> I give this 3 stars cause it is greasy but I guess u get what u pay for at that price right. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again &amp; the packing was good but very small:(</li>
    <li> Low cost and works fine with some added primer. Good makeup for every other day. They had tones of shades.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeed it! Although it&#x27;s a bit small,(why I rated a 4) it goes on great! :) I love the shimmery white, I used to on my upper cheekbones for a jlo look and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I LOVE this concealer palette because I can customize the color to match my skin tone exactly. This will be a permanent part of my make up collection.</li>
    <li> The product didn&#x27;t apply well, it didn&#x27;t blend, the green color showed through my foundation, and the concealer didn&#x27;&#x27;t conceal anything.  The packaging on the product is really good and sturdy, but the products are awful!  I recommend getting a powder or a more liquid type of concealer and/or corrector.  The dark colors I used to contour and they worked really well, but didn&#x27;t blend very easily.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality for the price. Loke the variety of colors to mix and match. I bought this palette because  i prefer cream instead  of powder since its easier  to blend. They apply smooth into skin and blend well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the packaging. Was just a simple gray plastic envelope and the palette came a little bit broken on the bottom. This is a point for improvement.</li>
    <li> good price! good product i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Well, when I opened the packaged, it wasn&#x27;t ruined, it came with a film covering the product. I tried every color out just to see the texture and if I could work with the product.... I can slightly work with it with my brushes, I have to try my beauty blender later.. This product is very very verrrrrrryyyy oily.( This could just be my palette cause I&#x27;ve read others weren&#x27;t oily). Also I have to mix a few colours to get my complexion as I am mixed(black and white). For the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have had a high expection, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy this again when I run out, I might just go ahead and buy an expensive palette. Apologies for the horrible pictures, I would have taken them with natural lightening but, it&#x27;s snowing and dark where I am.</li>
    <li> It was a gift that meets expectations</li>
    <li> The first time i bought it i loved it blends very well but the second time i bought it it had like black spots of makeup on all the colors and it ruined the palette i was mad</li>
    <li> Just old fashioned grease paint in different colors, folks. Keep ur 4$.</li>
    <li> Works well, I had to mix colors to correct some of my blemishes. The product is a little chalky. Does its job.</li>
    <li> It was not very good. Like putting creme eyeshadow over your face. Each shade had the exact same coverage (light and pasty)</li>
    <li> Ok I didn&#x27;t get mines yet but ppl it&#x27;s concealer not powder u should really read stuff before you buy that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s oily concealer is for you to cover up dark circles and others so this product maybe deserve 4stars because it looks like it messes up the palette but still it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cover much but its good for cream contour.</li>
    <li> If you are new to makeup and want to buy that&#x27;s okay buy it it does conceal you imperfections , but during the day its stars to fade.. overall I like the product its creamy and good to handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to see me use this Click the link down below&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/_Oz8wCXaUA0</li>
    <li> Thank you very much , pleased with everything</li>
    <li> This wasnt good at all. Came so small and barely smudges. It doesn&#x27;t work well, horrible to blend. And it came SO late. I was very displeased with this kit.</li>
    <li> The colors of this product are perfect for my skin tone. Easy to apply, I would recommend to any one :)</li>
    <li> it is exactly what i expected and works great. i will consider returning for another order of this concealer.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> Concealer is very oily, makes my face shiny even after setting with my mac powder. Under eye it creases badly.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Smell funny too.</li>
    <li> This is cheap, and awesome when it comes to contour and highlight but nothing breaks my face out, this product does!</li>
    <li> I got this product a few months ago and it is an everyday go to for me. I did not expect the product to be creme based but i was pleasantly surprised after the first use. I use this kit to completely contour my face and conceal my mild acne. I swear by the green shade that covers all my red spots, and mix and match the other colors to conceal. I use the lighter shades to highlight and darker to contour my face and not only does it blend easily, it lasts through my entire busy day. I also live in San Diego so it gets warm here during the day and I don&#x27;t even sweat this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations for using this product are to moisturize, prime, or use a bb cream before you conceal, and contour with this kit. To apply the products I have used sponges and small concealer brushes, and then to eliminate the creasing underneath my eyes I smudge the product with my finger tips to allow the product to soak into my skin, then i use a large flat foundation brush to buff my entire face, topped off with powder and i am ready to go!</li>
    <li> Never used... Must have lable on product. Not the box....</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty pigmented, though it is quite oily on my skin. &amp; it does seem to last a while. pretty good for the price :)</li>
    <li> This was just okay. It very thick. Reminded me of theater makeup.</li>
    <li> Great colors but not much product in each pot. Disappointed in the amount of product each color has :(</li>
    <li> Excellent for covering up bruises. Know that sounds awful haha but I&#x27;m so fair skinned and bruise prone, that I like to cover them up for my cosplays. I takes a few applications to cover, but it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I just received my lil contouring kit way before the actually shipping date which is a total plus! It&#x27;s really good quality and very pigmented! It is small but it&#x27;s totally worth the price. I&#x27;m very happy with it and love it. Will be ordering from then again for a while! I highly recommended it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. For the price it worth a try and it&#x27;s just as good as those expensive one!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition. Came early, Love it. Thank you</li>
    <li> only issue is they&#x27;re a bit small and run out quickly. I haven&#x27;t had it for a month and am almost out of the couple of colors I use daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars instead of 4 because it took so dang long to get to me.  I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and still haven&#x27;t achieved the flawless contouring I expected.  Part of the problem could be my relative inexperience wit contouring, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to blend well with my foundation.</li>
    <li> Definitely not something for beginners but it&#x27;s better quality than I&#x27;d been expecting.</li>
    <li> Fun for starters to play with, but really poor quality and extremely long shipping.</li>
    <li> this is great I love the colors</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Everyone&#x27;s complexion varies slightly in color from season to season. There are even different shades on different parts of your face. This pallette covers it all!  The concealers are just the right texture too! Not too dry - not too greasy. I particularly like the white sparkly highlighter. There is so much you can do with this set. And it&#x27;s perfect for travel. All you really need for the face. I bought a second one just to keep in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Bought this kit before and this time I bought two of them! And the first time the cream was creamer and easy to get on the brush! This time around wasn&#x27;t as creamy! Still does the job! Didn&#x27;t care for how long it took to arrive! I knew it would take long! Packaged well</li>
    <li> The coverage and color is better than expected! I didn&#x27;t have high hopes given the price but I am loving this thing. I use my concealer brush to apply it and it lasts all day; plus, I can use different shades for different areas of my face and they all match perfectly. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing once I am done (but a little goes a long way)!</li>
    <li> Wonderful  item would order from again</li>
    <li> liked it, it was easy to practice on how to used lput on makup so i will recommmend this product to everone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very potent. Alot has to be used in order to show on the face. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I originally confused this product with another one I had bought and gave them a bad review!!  I apologize for that!  I took a picture of the other product and will attach!  This seller did a remarkable job in getting in contact with me, when he thought I had a problem!  I would definitely buy from this seller again!  Great product but a sample product...it is small!!!</li>
    <li> They colors are too watery. They come.off right away and dont cover anything...they do not blend in with your skin. I can use them for very small touch ups but thays about it.</li>
    <li> When contemplating this purchase I looked at several options and landed on this one. Dont get me wrong, it does the job, however the colors are lighter than they appear and tons of product to conceal. After finally building up the color to right consistancy it tends to make my skin look patchy. Wont re purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. They can be blended together to suit your needs. I am still experimenting with them. As a former makeup artist I had to replace a lot of my stuff. Sad and bad to say this but everything I had was old.</li>
    <li> Goes on creamy. I love that I can mix and blend the colors to my liking. Definitely good for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this set and the price is amazing! I haven&#x27;t worn it in the humidity yet, but I go to Vegas in 2 months so I guess I will test it then! But yes, it is worth buying!!</li>
    <li> If you are a darker skinned woman than only like 1-3 of the bins will work for you. For me I primarily use one shade and occasionally use one other. The compact came in the mail already broken with a screw missing so that the two black plastic parts were separated. For less than $4 I just sucked it up. The one concealer that I use is good and that is why this product gets three stars. Also it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Im a teenagers and im getting more into makeup.i couldn&#x27;t find a concealer my color and didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for a more expensive concealer. for it&#x27;s price it&#x27;s good,im not an expert but this is great if your just starting off with makeup. it covers up blemishes really well.</li>
    <li> Although I am using other concealers at this time. I still use this palette for spot correction.</li>
    <li> It conceals Everything.  I should of bought more than one for the price.  This Concealer pallet is Amazing.  It covers even what you don&#x27;t want covered.</li>
    <li> I really hate this palette. first its so tiny I cant even.. not worth your money even if its only 5 bucks.. worst palette ever. its safe to say that I will never be purchasing this again or anything from this seller..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to blend, takes a lot of time to work with... It still covers a lot</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Excellent!</li>
    <li> Colors are too light. Dont blend properly. But a contouring palette in this price, this was expected</li>
    <li> Works well time to change my look Hollywood style and for such a good price</li>
    <li> new to concealer products still experimenting</li>
    <li> very creamyyy and are very easy to blend definetly worth the price will be buying again i ordered two.! plus the packaging is really good its bigger than i expected it .. i expected it to be as big as the elf bronzer/ blush but its bigger .! :)</li>
    <li> Great pallete works just like any other expensive cream pallete</li>
    <li> I though It was more big</li>
    <li> Melted during delievery, beyond unusable.</li>
    <li> I dont recommend at all. Super super oily. I never used it because im scared itll cause me to break out since its so oily.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent highly pigmented and smooth. It was broken but didn&#x27;t affect the makeup</li>
    <li> I know this would have been very nice. But sadly I did not get the chance to use it. :( it was removed from the mail.</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer, I am just in love. Great product and for the price like yassss 😍😏💎</li>
    <li> They seem to be oil based but the colors are ok for medium skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage.  I was hesitate because it was so cheap.  I didn&#x27;t have to reapply through the day either</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! These concealers are just straight grease, they dont cover anything at all. I have dark circles under my eyes that I usually just dab a couple spots of concealer on and am good with these the coverage is so thin because of how oily/greasy the product is that I had to dab/blend then powder so many times that I just ended up with a cakey nasty mess. I ended up throwing it away as I would not even want my daughter to put this on her skin to play with!</li>
    <li> Best $3 I&#x27;ve ever spent on makeup!!!! I use it on myself and all my friends. Shipping was fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I hope they keep selling it at this price.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, I was very surprised at the quality of this product. Would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool concealer and is easy to put on. I really like it and the shipping was fast. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> For the money you really can&#x27;t beat this palette.  Unfortunately I can only use less than half the colors because I&#x27;m so fair. If your a makeup artist this wouldn&#x27;t be great!</li>
    <li> Only get like 5 uses out of each pot. Kinda disappointed! Wish it came with directions or tutorials.</li>
    <li> Not what I expect it.</li>
    <li> The concealer is a bit thick and hard to spread. At my age, I need easy to spread concealer that does not require a lot of pressure. I think this would probably be good for teenagers or even 20 year olds who are not dealing with wrinkles. The colors are pretty much true to the picture.</li>
    <li> Received it 2 weeks before delivery date so that was good...it was in perfect conditions and works very good can&#x27;t complain for the price I should of ordered two .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but it&#x27;s not really worth 5 bucks. It has a 3 dollar value. Also it was smaller than what I expected.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.  I was unable to use the Professional 15 Color Concealer as the colors had melted into&lt;br /&gt;each palette.  Very disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> the only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it runs out fast. I hit the tin after 3 or 4 uses. I have no idea how to get more of the one color. but I love the concealer it works great.</li>
    <li> Personal opinion these are just oil base concelers when I would apply my face would look oily where I would applied but if u think it would work for you go ahead and buy it, it is a cheap price so you do get what u pay for</li>
    <li> Love it! It arrived right on the date it said. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. Definitely ordering some more. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I paid for my palette two months ago and never received it! These people did not even message me back when I asked where it was and I had waited 3 months for it! You would be smart to stay away from this company and look elsewhere. Worst service I have ever encountered in my life and I never plan to buy anything off of this company again!</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. I loved this product, definately could be better the make up can be less oily but other than that i really like it.</li>
    <li> very soft and a little too transparent when applied, but not bad</li>
    <li> This palette was amazing. Although it is very small, the colors are so creamy and pigmented. I would recommend it for someone with dry skin. What a great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone else, and she loves it. she said it was thick, but she wasnt use to using it. But i followed up with her and now she says its great, and has great coverage, Thanks  :)</li>
    <li> You should buy this if you like Orley skin and acne.</li>
    <li> Just not for me! Makes my skin look very oily after an hour of it being on, even with using a matte finishing spray.</li>
    <li> This concealer is really small and it doesn&#x27;t work good..</li>
    <li> it came quicker than expected! i love it and reasonable price!! very happy I purchase this item!! I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Not pigmented enough at all. The darkest shade was actually way too light once the product was applied.</li>
    <li> So far, I love it! The package is kinda small but for the amount of money I paid. It&#x27;s totally worth it. My boyfriend gave me some serious hickies and it covered them up PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is super creamy and very light feeling.</li>
    <li> love it going to buy  more</li>
    <li> It is a cream base. A sponge needs to be used when applying. I love my pallet.</li>
    <li> love using this for contouring. Good for beginners. It will help you play around with shades you want to use. My only concern was that it did something to make my skin break out a little. Not huge and drastic, but enough to make a comment. Still love.</li>
    <li> This is greAt product love it</li>
    <li> HAHA! Maybe it&#x27;s because I bought it spontaneously, bought I failed to realize that this palette is smaller than the picture depicts. But it&#x27;s alright, it works just fine. I&#x27;m a happy camper. :)</li>
    <li> We are under a heat advisory I was so worried that it was going to be a Hot mess because it was so hot but I was perfect.</li>
    <li> I loooove this palette omg. Looks great on me &amp; it&#x27;s easy to apply. They&#x27;re isn&#x27;t a lot in the palette, but s*** it was like 3 bucks I ain&#x27;t complaining. I&#x27;m most definitely gunna buy this again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this three times and I love it!</li>
    <li> Colors not what I expected more gray then brown</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this for anyone darker than Beyoncé. Literally every single color but the 2 darkest ones look white on me. I am not even dark skinned! I comprehend that these are concealers but there is so reason that the colors should be that light. Pale women have fun :)</li>
    <li> I really like it. It has everything I need and it&#x27;s compact. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I may order another</li>
    <li> Very good product to start with. Especially for first timers. very hydrated and easy to apply to skin.</li>
    <li> a bit small but the order came in earlier than expected!</li>
    <li> Horrible customer service and melted makeup!</li>
    <li> Very small not what I expected at all! The colors are very off and the texture is greasy. Not worth it don&#x27;t waste your funds</li>
    <li> Came to me melted wow!</li>
    <li> I just got mine in the mail after about 2 and a half weeks and when I opened it, the darker brown had melted and smeared around the row it was in and some on the case. :( what a mess! Have yet to use it...</li>
    <li> These are extremely oily and sticky when you apply them to your face. I do not have oily skin either. I had to wash my face several times to remove the stickiness feeling and putting powder over them doesn&#x27;t work either. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightest color isn&#x27;t light enough for my pale skin, which is okay, I&#x27;m used to that but if you&#x27;re extremely pale -- this won&#x27;t highlight your face at all. The darker colors are highly pigmented and I did play with them for a little bit - they work good for contouring.</li>
    <li> No problems with this product. Was exactly how I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> As soon as i recieved...I had to throw it away because it was too dry.</li>
    <li> This is a really great palette for the price.</li>
    <li> I was excitedly looking forward to it, but it came completely melted! What a big disappointment! ! It was no use to me so I just trashed it. Didn&#x27;t bother for a $5 refund. :-(</li>
    <li> I recommend buying this concealer pallet from this buyer... You get a variety of concealer for cover up or conturing; I like the package or case as well!</li>
    <li> I like this concealer palette, it is creamy , it conceals well. After doing my eyebrows I can use it as a highlighter. I would buy this product again, however I probably will choose another buyer, because it took to long to receive in the mail.</li>
    <li> Cheap makeup and it took months to get it.  It comes from China and you have to go to the post office to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette with good quality concealers. I like the variety for lighter colors in the winter and warmers colors in the summer.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, works decent and blends well. Not high end quality but good for someone on a budget</li>
    <li> I think this is a pretty good palette for the money. Some reviewers have reported it breaking them out but I haven&#x27;t had that problem so far.</li>
    <li> As cover creams go, I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands spanning the spectrum: From \\&quot;JANE\\&quot; to Channel. This product is superior in terms of quality, natural looking, with AWESOME coverage.</li>
    <li> Very creamy and blendable formula.  I was able to use more colors than I expected.  I have fair skin.  This is perfect for covering blemishes and contouring.</li>
    <li> The palette is just what i was looking for. I have seen similar ones for twice the amount. Price and shipping fees are ideal. I bought two more since my first buy and they make perfect gifts. HIGHLY Recommend !!</li>
    <li> Just the perfect size and the colors are great to use under your eyes or under your eyebrow will order them again.</li>
    <li> The palette is the smallest thing on earth!!! once I received my package I opened it and applied make up on to see how it was going to look, the texture of the makeup is really chalky and dry.:(</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping for. Palette small, makeup doesn&#x27;t last long, had black speckles in it when I initially opened it up. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received mine about two weeks ago and have used it several times but it wasn&#x27;t really what I was expecting. The product is very oily and with my oily skin it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. I ordered this for highlighting and contouring but I can&#x27;t contour with this concealer. My skin instantly breaks out if I put this below my cheeks. However, I am able to use it for concealing/highlighting underneath my eyes. I also used this on a friend with very dry skin and she absolutely loved it. It made her skin very smooth and covered any blemishes that were present. She said it was very moisturizing on her dry skin and looked nice on her face all day. I would not recommend this palette for anyone with normal, combination, or oily skin but it might be okay for you to try on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great value I LOVE it</li>
    <li> Not definitely what I expected when I received and starting using it. The consistency of the concealer is very oily and not matte at all. It has okay colors but I&#x27;m very dissatisfy</li>
    <li> this concealer is great.  it covers without a whole lot being applied to your face.  I love that it has different colors for you to try out.  it is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Received this way before estimated I got it on the 18th of November and the estimate was the. 6th of December so I was super happy when i got it yesterday. It is small but I was expecting that after seeing YouTube videos. I used it on both my sisters and it&#x27;s nice, the colors are on the lighter side, especially when mixing. I was only disappointed that the white color is actually grey and is very shimmery. I was expecting it to be whiter to use as a highlight but the yellow tone works just as well. Just smelled it and it does have a specific smell to it but it&#x27;s not tat bad.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!I  LOVE THIS PALETTE. THIS HAS GREAT COLOR, AND WORKED VERY WELL FOR THE MAKEUP LOOK I CREATED. WORTH THE MONEY</li>
    <li> Great make up! I like it. It was supose to come on December BUT I got it faster then the speed of LIGHT. ITS AMAZING</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. It arrived from Japan or Hong Kong. Has no name. No instructions on it and quite frankly scared to use it. Not sure what it is as even though the description on the site says concealer the package does not say anything. The package has no name. I would not recommend this product to no one.</li>
    <li> i use it for costumes and cosplay.</li>
    <li> The Professional 15 concealer camouflage makeup palette.  Would recommend this to others.  Great beginner set for the younger generation.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! For a beginner, this concealer is great! It goes on easy and lasts all day. I even use it as a primer on my eyes for long lasting eyeshadow. I definitely recommend this. Shipping was great and it really does the job!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Great price. Highly recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these concealers. They are so creamy and there are so many different shades to choose from, which I l love. Very good product for the low price that is asked for.</li>
    <li> I really liked this palette I thought that it would be a little bit bigger but with this a little goes a LONGG way. I will be purchasing another palette soon.</li>
    <li> Price was awesome but the quality sucks, I guess you pay for what you get, might probably only use it for fx makeup, shipping was good thou.</li>
    <li> This concealer palette Ruth&#x27;s pretty good, it weighs just add well as the ones must of us purchase at MAC, Sephora etc. I love it. You girls should totally buy it.</li>
    <li> if you are planning to begin contouring, this is your best friend! It works so well! I&#x27;m actually almost done using it! It&#x27;s been over a year I&#x27;ve had this product and it doesn&#x27;t cause me acne at all, it makes my face look flawless. It is a bit oily but with a bit of setting powder, you&#x27;ll be fine. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re trying to learn contour and highlight. Has plenty of shades!</li>
    <li> This product is good for the money. The pans are small,but luckily you dont have to use much product.They come in a slim black case.  The coverage is pretty good. My palette wasn&#x27;t oily like most customers complained about which was a plus.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all. Bad quality.</li>
    <li> To small so brushes do not fit in the circle.</li>
    <li> Im training as a mua and this product was just perfect for me because its very small and the colors are just perfect. A little oily buy it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I use this EVERYDAY and it works so well ! So happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> The shipping time was about 3-4 weeks, which seems fair for being from overseas.&lt;br /&gt;As for the palette itself, it is smaller than I expected, but for the price point it&#x27;s still a great value. These concealer shades are cream-based and nicely pigmented. They have decent coverage but are also surprisingly blendable! The consistency is silky, but not streaky.&lt;br /&gt;As with most cream-based products, you will want to set them with powder to ensure longevity. Also, if you&#x27;re oil-prone, they may not work as well for you. But for dry or combination skin types, I think they&#x27;re fantastic. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakouts while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also add that I use this palette for contouring, not concealing. However, I do like that it comes with green for reducing redness and pink for undereye circles/dark spots. So while I don&#x27;t know that it would be the best concealer, I really like it for the purpose I&#x27;m using it for.</li>
    <li> I loved it it has everything I need</li>
    <li> This product worked well, I was hoping for it to be a bit bigger but that&#x27;s OK, it was very easy to apply and blend which was the most important thing. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> WARNING: Broke me out like a mad man!</li>
    <li> Ok but not very thick and have to use it a lot more than what I thought I would</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Natural colors and so easy to blend</li>
    <li> This is very creamy and leaves oily residue on the skin. I broke out a lot while using it. It works though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy so far with my pallet I bought it the end of July, and it said that it would come mid august but I received it early, it was in a package and it has film covering the pallet, it also was broken in any way. This product is very good for coutouring , i  am dark skin and I have a few blemishes and it covered them. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s great for contouring and highlighting and also is a great concealer</li>
    <li> Ok set. I needed to get some makeup for a bridal party. I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and it was great! A little oily, but all in all it worked good for what we needed it for.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! Works just as well as the pallets sold for nearly $100! Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Really good colors , they do come off a bit chalky but with the right foundation this stuff is reasonable. You get what you pay for .</li>
    <li> the picture lead me to believe the concealer was more yellow based  but they all have pink undertones. good pigmentation</li>
    <li> Great product, with so many colors.</li>
    <li> I found this to be like child&#x27;s makeup, but I wouldn&#x27;t give it to a child, greasy and does not applie  nice would not recommended.</li>
    <li> Cheap price and get a flawless looking finish!! I love his pallette my 2nd time ordering one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this makeup, complete coverage of any areas that need it. I like that it offers the different shades which you can blend together to create your perfect shade.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It arrived 5 days earlier. Nice quailty. Good price. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Decent for the money.</li>
    <li> Omg....Soooo I have NEVER used concealer before and I was a worried about but this off Amazon, but I&#x27;m Soooo freaking glad I did....works great and I have been getting soo many compliments about my makeup. So I def will b buying again when I run out!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you, i recieved my palette</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a highlight and contour for my make up class. It doesn&#x27;t have great coverage, but I don&#x27;t mind because that isn&#x27;t why I got it. There is a good amount of product although it goes quick. They always seem to be really creamy or maybe melted but either way it works well. It can be a little drying, maybe flaky, but once the foundation is on you can&#x27;t really notice. I would repurchase. I received it in 3 weeks, which was great because it said I would get it in 5.</li>
    <li> Got it ahead of time, nothing was damaged. Seems very nice. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I am super excited to try them!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS OK. IT WAS TOO THICK FOR MY TASTE.  ALSO, THE COLORS THAT I REALLY LIKED DIDN&#x27;T HAVE MUCH PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> it is a good product for the price. little smaller than expected but still worth it. I like the color variation that it has.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Very pigmented, but a little smaller than i thought it would be. The green is amazing at covering acne!</li>
    <li> might as well call it play makeup its too loose and not thick enough to cover anything.  So sad! Total waste! If you want to have doll makeup then this is it to maybe train uour kids how to apply contour</li>
    <li> Great texture with a range of shades that would suit any skin tone. Creamy feel and goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;Blend blend blend and this will be a great companion to your beauty routine.</li>
    <li> So getting a hold of the seller was a nightmare, I had to handle all final business with amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally received the palette it was hand size and the product inside looked like play makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something you would give child because it doesn&#x27;t actually WORK.</li>
    <li> I got this December of 2014, i was a little disappointed at first because i though it was going to be bigger, but it actually turned out to be a great size because it is portable, it can fit in my purse or a make bag if the size is decent enough, i still have concealers colors left. I would recommended to look up what each color is for. I know that the blue is to hide redness and irritated skin like red dots from acne, The lightest shade you can use under your eyes and on your upper lip. The highlighter you can use under your eyes to highlight and the top corner of your eyes and or under your brow line as an highlighting eye shade. It all depends on the color of your skin. I highly recommended this product. If i want to do something quick and easy i just conceal and wear face powered and its all good, or if i want to to do the works, it is also all good.</li>
    <li> Great amount of variation. Wish there was more in each pan. Have already hit the bottom on a few after about a month of use. Dark shade great for contouring. Some what hard to blend.</li>
    <li> i receive Professional 15 Concealer Camouflage Makeup Palette BuyinCoins and its very very nice thanks a lot . . ./</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s perfect just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Really like it. Easy to blend</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to receive. It was exactly how I expected it to be. Natural looking and easy to take off. I love it thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The color palette is great!  I use both the light concealer&#x27;s and dark for shading and contouring.  The feel is good on my skin and I can use the product with brushes or my fingers.  Works equally well with either or--I do finish with blending sponges and finishing powder...very nice and economical!</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality. Very much like children&#x27;s costume make up that you get from dollar store or something.</li>
    <li> You get so many colors which is why I love it.  I can use it and my niece can as well.  I use my finger to put it on and you can see from the first touch that this actually covers the darker area under my eyes perfect so much to the point that I&#x27;m amazed and have to step back from the mirror to see if it really is as good as I&#x27;m looking at because I can barley tell I have anything on it matches my skin so well. The only problem I see is that it doesn&#x27;t tell you what the color is that you&#x27;re using so there&#x27;s no way to re-order just the concealer color you need but then again the price is so cheap you don&#x27;t care that you would re-order the full pallet just to get your color again.  So when I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m planning on giving it to my niece who&#x27;s a make up artist to have your use the other colors for the difference tones she needs.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit. When it&#x27;s brand new it appears waxy. Once you mix it a bit with your brush it&#x27;s perfect. Blends and sets in to skin or over makeup very well. No breakouts and it lasts allll day. I will continue to order this as long as it&#x27;s available. I love it!!!! If you know how to contour, this kit is perfect for EVERY skin tone!!! Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> It was so tiny, I assumed it would be larger</li>
    <li> I NORMALLY SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON EXPENSIVE MAKE UP AND THIS WAS SO CHEAP AND SO GOOD I WANT ONE MORE BUT THE DELIVERY WAS AWFUL TOOK LIKE ONE MONTH TO GET I EVEN FORGOT I HAD ORDERED IT</li>
    <li> very good product and very affordable</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this. For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much. But this actually exceeded my expectations by far. The pigmentation is great, and covers a lot. This would be more for fair skinned/lighter skinned girls, though. I use this palette pretty much everyday with a damp beauty blender, and it comes out looking dewy-which I love. You can always use a mattifying powder to achieve a matte look. I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 weeks and has not made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took about 2 weeks, which I was fine with. It came in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this. Thank you so much for the awesome product.</li>
    <li> Blends well with a beauty blender, use a drop of oil once to make it creamy and it works well! I will order again! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love it got in time and it&#x27;s not melted at all when I got it.</li>
    <li> Do not busy really oily and its small</li>
    <li> I wanted to try contouring, and I have olive skin than tans in summer, so I am always different shades throughout the year. I dont wear a ton of face makeup so this was perfect because of the color palettes I can blend and perfect the color I need. I also like how they included the shimmery highlight and the light blue and pink for concealing imperfections. The compact is small, but I think its perfect size to not be obnoxious in your make up area, or for traveling. The makeup is creamy and goes on smooth and blends nice. This has been great for me to try and experiment with without breaking the bank, and is better quality than I expected.</li>
    <li> Its just ok. I thought since the better more expensive brand looks exactly the same, I figure it might be manufactured from same company, I guess not. It was ok for some face discoloration but under eye it does not cover...it looked grayish.</li>
    <li> Came right on time as expected. The pigments are not as vibrent on your face when you put it on so it takes a little patience to get it how you need it. I&#x27;m new to contouring and this is my first kit, so I need practice.</li>
    <li> Love this product, easy to use and blend. It works just as well as some of the other prestigious contouring kits. I used a cheap beauty blender from sally&#x27;s  to blend in all the product after I applied it. Also the product did not come melted and it was delivered in 102 degree heat and was in my mailbox till 6 pm. If you know how to apply make up or watch a couple tutorials you should have no issues with this make up kit! I also love the color correcting colors in the kit as well to help reduce redness and baggy dark circles under your eyes. There are different shades to choose from as well, this kit will work for any color skin type. Even if you have oily skin, this cream is not so oily that it will make you break out either if you wash your face every night and remove your make up, but you should do that with any make up anyways. I did set it with a translucent powder afterwards and a make up finishing spray to set the makeup. Today it&#x27;s over 100 degrees again and I applied my make up at 7AM it is now 1 pm and I worked out at the gym and the makeup did not melt or come off. This is a great kit, and you don&#x27;t need a ton of product to achieve results, so in my opinion there is more than enough product, This kit I am guessing should last me 6 months with 5 days out of the week full face make-up use. I have included a pic of me with I call my paint by number face then a pic of it all blended in. It looks very natural. You can choose to make it a bit more dramatic by adding contouring powder on top of it. But I am happy with the creams alone, I can achieve many different looks with this kit. Oh I will also include a pic of the kit after my 1st use and the cheap beauty blender from sally&#x27;s beauty supply that worked wonderfully as well!</li>
    <li> Smells like chemicals. Doesn&#x27;t blend and I honestly think it might be paint. No labels, and a few Asian symbols on back. Untrustworthy. I wouldn&#x27;t trust putting this product on skin what so ever. I instantly threw it away. I don&#x27;t understand how people are actually using this on their face. You have no idea what it is.</li>
    <li> This is so great!!! I love the highlights but the bronzer isn&#x27;t as dark as I expected it to be. I still use it every day though.</li>
    <li> I am finding that I can use so many different colors on my skin for many different things. Thanks for the product and great prices!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to return this item. But when I revived it in the mail it appeared to be melted or something. There&#x27;s 4 colors I won&#x27;t be able to use  and thoughs are the colors I need. I would like a new one but I can&#x27;t figure out how to return.</li>
    <li> THE PORTIONS ARE SMALL</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ll  buy it again if I need it.</li>
    <li> very thick makeup. I can feel my skin trying to get air. Would not recommend to anyone. Very unhappy with product</li>
    <li> This product is great !!! It conceals and highlights and does what i need it to do !!!!! Under five dollars cant beat that!!!! Customer service was excellent!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so worth your money. They are neutral colors that are rich and creamy. Easy to blend and most of all very nice looking. Also it came in about a week in a half before the estimated arrival date.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I expected. But that does not take away from the quality of the product. This is a very good buy!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for basically  the colors kinda of takes time to blend just not good but for 4 dollars can&#x27;t really complain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen this on date line and it was giving women really bad headache and making them sick scary</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s a creamy concealer, got here quick. Love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be as good as it is! Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> It got here in one  piece and it was here early.</li>
    <li> best thing i have ever bought</li>
    <li> I am super excited!!!! I received this in the mail today and I cannot wait to try it out later today!!! It came waaaayyyy before the date that it was suppose to which is already a plus!!! The only down fall with this is that it is VERY tiny so I know that it will not last long so I am going to order another one,  and the colors are a lot richer in person than what the picture shows which in my case is a plus!! But all in all its not a bad product at all and I WILL be ordering more...hope this helps someone!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried using it and it is good for everyday use however the packaging and set itself looks cheaper made of China product. My face isn&#x27;t so sensitive so it tolerates irritation but my sister applied it and it caused her problems :(</li>
    <li> It came in early and they are so creamy and easy to put on....I do wish they had darker shades than the last one because I have to use the grey one and it doesn&#x27;t go well</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected. It is a good buy for the price. It ships from out of the country, so allow extra time for the trip thru customs.</li>
    <li> These concealers are very creamy, however the pots are very small. This would be great if you are a makeup artist and you work with all different types of skin tones. For me, I personally didn&#x27;t go crazy for it. But for $4? Still a pretty good product for and even better price. I gave it to my sister, and she LOVES it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Not sure why others are saying its small Bc its not. Its perfect size.nthis is a little oily but using matte powder will help with this. It even has a shimmer in one of the circle which is great to highlight cheek bones</li>
    <li> It works perfectly on my pale skin. It  covers very well didn&#x27;t make me break out and I have very sensitive skin. Would definitely buy again, also it was delivered a lot earlier then expected</li>
    <li> I order this and the arrival was pretty fast I love this product and It&#x27;s pretty small to have it in your purse ...it&#x27;s good.price</li>
    <li> very cheap made, you get what you pay for, this is a cheap product, spend some extra money for a better product</li>
    <li> So far so good . I like it a lot but it has its negative sides... For the amount of money its good</li>
    <li> These are some really good brushes for the price.I am going to be ordering more....Love themm!!!</li>
    <li> the product got some strange flavor.... smell like some chemical flavor...</li>
    <li> Dark brown colors aren&#x27;t even brown! Not happy</li>
    <li> Not my fav, oily, and not enough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really thin layer of makeup, not worth your money unless it&#x27;s just for a one time thing</li>
    <li> Mmmm It&#x27;s okay. only problem i had was that when i put it on me it felt really greasy :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this item FOREVER and am just now running out I love it and I am going to order another.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> 1. Best price&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t blend well&lt;br /&gt;3. Same as other that looks like this, don&#x27;t expect much from it. But was my first concealer pallet&lt;br /&gt;4. Too light to really conceal&lt;br /&gt;5. Darker color may be okay but light ones barely show</li>
    <li> With this product it has great coverage but it is way to oily for my liking you have to dab to get some of it off so it won&#x27;t look oily</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it stinks so bad like paint ): i don&#x27;t even think its safe  for your face&lt;br /&gt;plus it took forever to get to me almost a month long !!!</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is really hard to apply because it sort of goes on as a powdery finish. But not a good powdery finish because it looks like it falls into the cracks of the skin and I have no wrinkles so I don&#x27;t understand this. I wish it was a little more creamy. I have to mix it with a little bit of my cream or foundation. I also sometimes like to put a large amount of cream on my face before I apply this. But over all a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> i recumbent this product to any body bot i will kip in mine that this product is small it look big on pict bot personal is not big</li>
    <li> The package was smaller than I thought But this product is great!!! Arrived sooner than seller stated!!!</li>
    <li> horrible! it&#x27;s like you have a mask on your face.. not to mention the ugly fine lines it creates</li>
    <li> The palette contains large creamy shades that mix easily and great diversity of shades.  High quality for an amazingly low price!  Blending is simple and they go on smoothly and stay on without gathering in the creases.  Cannot go wrong.  The container is sturdy and latches firmly, yet is not a struggle to open!  I love that.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible purchase and sent between their delivery dates posted.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, will purchase here again.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great price,  I&#x27;m still learning how to blend.</li>
    <li> I love it. great for all face types. you have to try it&lt;br /&gt;did great for contouring. and for natural looks</li>
    <li> Im a bargain hunter...I was skeptical of the price but I fell in love with it.. worth the money in my book</li>
    <li> I like all the different colors, however, they are more like samples. It is on the oily side but that is nothing powder can&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> not much coverage they melted and were really dewy, but I guess I cant complain it get what I paid for :(</li>
    <li> Wife likes it, she&#x27;s all getting into makeup now and all it does is cost me more money.  :/  She says it&#x27;s good for middle of the road stuff.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it&#x27;s in very good condition straight out of the package. I have semi oily skin and this product is very oil based and creamy.</li>
    <li> Blends well and colors are very pigmented.</li>
    <li> For as cheap as this is, it was definitely worth the money. The make up looks great on, and I&#x27;m not a professional or anything, so for a novice - it still did the job. It&#x27;s creamy and blends well. There are so many colors, I have olive skin and they worked for me. I would recommend this for a starter palette. Especially if you are just starting to get into this, this is a great one to start with.</li>
    <li> Creamy concealer very nice size perfectly shipped took a while but came will buy more soon</li>
    <li> What I wanted its amazing it came really slow it took mabey 3 months which sucks but I would say it was worth it.</li>
    <li> The colors were accurate but it was very oily like sunscreen</li>
    <li> THE ONLY PALLET I ORDER, VERY PIGMENTED, CREAMY TEXTURE, A LOT GOES A LONG WAY, I USE WITH THE SPONGE EGGS TO HELP BLEND, I USE IT AS WELL WITH A POWDER PALLET BY EUBUY FOUNDATION CONCEALER MAKEUP PALLET,  THIS GIVES ME AMAZING COVERAGE AND I GET PLENTY OF COMPLIMENTS, MY BIGGEST SUGGESTION IS MAKE SURE YOU BLEND COMPLETELY FULL FACE AND CHIN AND NECK YOU DON&#x27;T WANT LINES OF DISTINCTION! IT WILL LAST ALL DAY AND WILL LAST THROUGH SWEAT, DOES NOT CAUSE ANY BREAK OUTS.. I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER AND REORDER</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. I only gave it four stars because they are a little oily and the highlighter is glittery and not pigmented as I expected. Despite those things this works great! Every color except the highlighter is very pigmented and works like a charm! I have awful dark circles under my eyes and use the pink along with a different brand of highlighter, BB cream, and powder matte highlighter and the dark circles are completely gone! The green is awesome for red spots! I use this product more to contour but recommended using other products along with this. Definitely worth the money. Came before expected and packaging was completely in tact and makeup was as shown.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST CONCEALER EVER!! I STARTED USING IT LAST YEAR AND I WONT STOP! IT&#x27;S A GREAT PRICE AND COVERS WHAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED ON YOUR FACE FOR A GREAT PRICE!! I&#x27;M ONE HAPPY COSTUMER!!</li>
    <li> this product is very very oily and the color isn&#x27;t true to form. This product is not a good purchase.</li>
    <li> The product itself is 😊amazing...the only problem I have is the size and portion.... didn&#x27;t last long😒</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon. I have used it everyday since it has arrived and I am so happy that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I got mine today and it is melted and there is barely any of the white color left.</li>
    <li> Maybe because i am new to this makeup world, but this concealer kit wasn&#x27;t what i expected. The colors shown on the picture are off from what you really see once you have received your order. They&#x27;re also extremely dry, you will have to use our finger or blending sponge to get enough product. I even had to spray some setting spray so that it can make it a little more creamier and it would make it easier to apply</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as deep physically as I thought they&#x27;d be. By that I mean there isn&#x27;t as much product as I thought, but maybe I&#x27;m just using too much. I do have sensitive skin so I broke out a bit even with primer and proper face care but again I do have sensitive skin. Be aware of that if you do too. It was nothing major, I still really like the product and it makes a good starter contour kit!</li>
    <li> I really didnt like it , i expected more and the quality wasn&#x27;t worth it I shouldve bought mac better</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot it has all of the colors that I would need. my only complaint is that it is a lot smaller than I would have expected.</li>
    <li> This gives good coverage and is a must have if you are in theater or anything of the sort. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> I adore this palate. It&#x27;s all you need for any type of travel whether it&#x27;s a day trip or a long  vacation because it has your concealer, bronzer, and highlighter all in one. Blends beautifully and is light weight. Professional grade quality and really brings my make up to the next level. 10/10 would buy again, but be prepared to wait for a month for it to arrive, shipping is extremely slow.</li>
    <li> Love it . best for beginners though</li>
    <li> I like it :) It&#x27;s very thick do but with the right amount it looks really nice. Not to mention that it came faster than expected ans the dark colors are very pigmented</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try my hand at contouring without making a huge investment.  This product is perfect!  The price &amp; quality are good and especially for a beginner contourer.</li>
    <li> love the colors and the smooth feel of the make up great on skins awdome for blending</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Came in 2days!!! The size is fine for me because I don&#x27;t use make-up everyday just for outings... but if want to use everyday it&#x27;s going to run out fast...but I love it!!!! I don&#x27;t know how to add a pic but everything was in tack!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not that good in quality</li>
    <li> I like it. But one problem I have its to greasy and it leaves creases on my eyelids. Wish it came with instructions so I can know what each color is used for.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very oily guys so be careful. I was still very oily even after I put powder on. Its good for practice though.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed this item.. very cute and i didnt have to worry about using the same color consealer i can change it up.</li>
    <li> For some reason I was expecting powder and not cr&amp;egrave;me, its not a bad product just not what I was wanting.</li>
    <li> Decent not bad for 4 dollars you get what you pay but if you looking to do a little contouring they definitely will help out a bit</li>
    <li> Okay, so i ordered this palette almost 3 weeks ago and i received it today and i was surprised considering my estimated delivery date wasn&#x27;t until the 6th of June. I opened the palette and was so disappointed to find two of the puts were loose and fell out when i opened it. But it&#x27;s okay because i just took some super glue and glued them back in place and they look fine. I tried this palette as soon as i could and man, was i pleased. First, the green is used to cover pimple/redness, so i used it on my acne that NEVER gets covered with other concealers but this one covered it right up! I was skeptical at first because it is green and i never played around with green concealer but it actually looked really good after i put on my foundation. I used the white color for my highlight on my eyebrows and it looked really good in my pictures. I have VERY dark under eyes so the yellow concealer really worked for that area too. Besides the shipping and the loose pots, this palette is fantastic for the price, ORDER IT, FOR SURE!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s disgusting, goes on too thick, smells awful, and is like children&#x27;s play makeup. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Someone recommended me to get this but I do not like it at all I would not buy again I gave mine away</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very oily but the colors are nice n easy for blending. I put a powder finish over it to help with the oil shine look. Overall can&#x27;t beat the price and didn&#x27;t take to long to receive.</li>
    <li> I loved how it looked after application, but not too long afterwards experienced burning and itching.  I am hopeful that it was just temporary since it really looked very nice and professional for someone who has only been wearing full makeup for around 11/2 to 2 years. I will provide an update at a later date.</li>
    <li> It  applies so smoothly to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like this palette. I definitely order more!&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and worth money.&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors</li>
    <li> Great colors and coverage! I would recommend this pallette! Small &amp; compact to fit in your kit, as a MUA you are looking for great products!</li>
    <li> This makeup doesn&#x27;t apply well. It doesn&#x27;t blend well and doesn&#x27;t work well with my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> I love this. If you know how to use it it&#x27;s amazing but i want a bigger quantity of it but I haven&#x27;t found that yet. Took a little while to come but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get here as soon as it said it should. Still waiting for it to come along with another product.</li>
    <li> Real oily.  Did not blend well at all.</li>
    <li> In the picture you would think this was a big pallete but it can fit in the palm of my hand.... If it&#x27;s not the same size as my hand it&#x27;s a little bigger. It did come faster than expected but not fast like 2 weeks and it&#x27;s mine type deal. Product is a bit oily</li>
    <li> I have been using this ever since I have gotten it. Nice coverage and matches all different areas on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette, the contour colors are amazing and I love that it has a highlighter and some color correction options as well. I just wish the tins were a bit bigger! I use the yellow for under my eyes and went through it pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that its great! Awesome consistency and blends into the skin great.</li>
    <li> Cheap flimsy oily and all in all nasty.</li>
    <li> Great concealer pallet, and cheap. Took awhile to get, but is still good. Especially for the price, will order again.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot ! My husband got it for me and I fell in love with this product . The choice of colors is very nice , the powder doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face and I can apply it easily and it doesn&#x27;t smudge ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also very sensitive but this product did not cause any negative reaction !</li>
    <li> Not at all exited about this colors. They are too oily!!</li>
    <li> Has the consistency of costume or halloween makeup. Works but not as well as I had hopes. Will do for now or if I ever run out.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but the colors seem nice has somewhat of a creamy consistency. Wrapping was tight making package safe. Ty for that. No breaks. So far I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> wonderful product and the price wow!</li>
    <li> The colors dont apply as they look, they go on a lighter shade . The highlighter didnt seem to work at all for me.</li>
    <li> the colors are a joke. definitely not natural colors, there no orange for color correction, the deep colors are weird and using the lighter shades don&#x27;t really highlight, they make u look rusty.  although I love the creamy consistency, the product itself is just garbage. I would just pay the extra for the coastal scents palette. very unhappy. I will probably keep the case and toss the fake concealer and put shadows in.</li>
    <li> It was what I wanted , the color was perfect.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this contouring pallet it is sticky and cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your 3 bucks</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, i mean the texture is great, its easy to blend. I have dark skin, so i was disappointed because the darker colors leave a weird tent behind.the darkest leaves a purple behind, and the second leaves a red tint.Since concealer is used to get rid of those colors, i was a little unhappy.One more thing, you will need to blend to find your shade, that plastic separator that comes with this product will be your best friend.This product isn&#x27;t bad tho.I&#x27;ve pulled off countless looks with it, and don&#x27;t regret buying it.The product itself is great, just finding your color will take allot of time, and concealer.</li>
    <li> Just staring out as a makeup artist and the prices are great for starting out , I am working on a make up kit so amazon has what I need</li>
    <li> Palette is very small.  I should have known with the price.  Also the colors look all one color, except for the obvious green, pink, white and dark.  I am very disappointed.  This is the true example of you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I needed this product because I wanted to learn to do the contouring. I thought the price was ok so I decided to buy it. The thing is that it is really thick and is very hard to blend. I have used this palette just 3 times and I bought it like 6 months ago. The colors are fine but you have to be very patient and do your makeup with enought time ahead because you are going to spend some time blending the product.</li>
    <li> This product bleeds and looks like its the cheapest makeup on the market. do not use if you are highlighting, your concealer will bleed/crease</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re kinda dry but once you warm it up with your fingers it&#x27;s like an oily creamy type. The only down side is that it doesnt dry so it settles in my fine lines. But it&#x27;s perfect for contouring i like them a lot</li>
    <li> this palette is good for a starter.. with summer coming you&#x27;ll need a good primer. Otherwise it will be dewy and pasty on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a good color scheme</li>
    <li> I bought this product despite some discouraging reviews I had read. Maybe cos it was cheap. It does what I want it to do which is contour and highlight. It&#x27;s quite creamy though so if you have oily skin I won&#x27;t recommend this product. One thing I noticed is that the darkest shade is not as dark as expected. I&#x27;m what you&#x27;d call rich caramel. So if you are darker than that you won&#x27;t be able to contour with this palette. But it&#x27;s perfect for professional makeup artistes though.</li>
    <li> This make-up is way to oily on my skin!  I know alot of women would think the same thing!  I wish I could get a refund on this because I&#x27;m not happy!</li>
    <li> I wanted something for the very dark circles under my eyes.  I have olive skin that is quite fair.  It&#x27;s tough to find any kind of make up to match.  So, I thought I could blend from this and make it work.  Plus it has lavender, yellow and green...all of which help with the camouflage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s from China.  I didn&#x27;t read the ad well I guess.  It smells horrid.  To me.  I&#x27;m an HSP and I can&#x27;t deal with any strange smells.  I don&#x27;t know what the smell is and maybe it won&#x27;t bother a normal person, but it is something I can&#x27;t even use.  Plus, there is no color fair enough for my skin.  It&#x27;s a very dark palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shan&#x27;t be using it.  The price was very good.  But in my case, it&#x27;s money wasted.</li>
    <li> I give Professional 15 Concealer Camouflage Makeup Palette Buyin Coins five stairs because the first time I applied it I receive the greatest compliment.  It covered the dark circles under my eyes without a thick makeup look.  It is smooth, applies well and looks great on me.  The many tones and colors aids in designing multiples beauty looks.  The price of the product is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Small amount not what I thought I was getting but the product was good just wish it had more product</li>
    <li> Love this!! Works great for contouring. It blends out great the green it comes with is excellent works for redness in face or a sudden breakout cover.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette. It has many colors  to choose from and the colors are very creamy and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I dont think this is a good product at all! It comes on very blochy! Its not a smooth aplication. Very disappointed but it was just 5 dollars so oh well. Great customer service though! I sent an email an had a reply in no time (this was before the product was even shipped. Was asking about shipping, which took forever!)</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! This palette is so versatile, complete and give me many options for an affordable price. I recommend! Great product!</li>
    <li> I like that it have so many shade color for apply every spot even a little scar on my arms</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cream concealer where as I thought it would be a pressed type powder. Delivery was long but happy once I received it. Overall nice product just wish it had more. Ran out of a lot of shades quickly.</li>
    <li> This was a present for someone.</li>
    <li> Exactly at was expected, took a little longer than expected</li>
    <li> I do not wear make up much, so I am not at all experienced so I did not want to invest in expensive brands just to try them out. This works for my purpose. I do not know enough about make up to talk about its quality though. Obviously it is not top of the line, but it covers well, though it does not stay on all day. Maybe it is normal though, who knows...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very nice . Mine just got here . Only thing that sucks is they all melted all over the place :(</li>
    <li> Nice kit has good coverage without having to use a lot!!!</li>
    <li> Horrible smell, I can&#x27;t even use this product the smell Is horrendous. When I felt this product it was very thick and hard to spred. I would never use this on my face... To scared!</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! Such a great concealer for such a cheap price!! I won&#x27;t be using all these colors but if I want to do other people makeup, this will come in handy!!</li>
    <li> there could&#x27;ve been more in the palate</li>
    <li> just got it today, love it, work good going to buy another one soon... didnt take long to get it !!!!! have to buy one!!!!!</li>
    <li> well the price of this palette was cheap much 9 of the same colors are the same the palate is OK but I wish they could differentiate more of the color</li>
    <li> Terrible product... Would not recommend or buy again. This product is not professional quality at all. Description should NOT say professional</li>
    <li> product took 20 days to show up but understandable ... worth the price!  smaller than i thought but still worth it</li>
    <li> obviously you get what you pay for in the world of makeup, but this compact is a good choice when starting out.</li>
    <li> This concealer was a total miss for me. With a thin consistency and a long ship time I don&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this being used for cheap beginner contouring but that&#x27;s the only thing I could imagine it being good for.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s alright. I didn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s really oily and it cakes up if you&#x27;re trying to cover up something. My mother likes it, but she likes all the makeup. It took awhile to come in through the mail and I got it with a few other products. I just wasn&#x27;t too impressed and wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Looks awful when you take a picture, makes you look like you sweated :p</li>
    <li> Ignore all the bad reviews! This is a beautiful, pigmented palette and it has a nice creamy touch, but not too creamy at the point where it will crease. It makes my skin look so soft, and pretty much completely covers my eye bags and makes me look ten times less sleepy, and it makes my face look lifted. I&#x27;m 17 years old, and I&#x27;ve been doing full face makeup for myself and others at least 3 years now, but years before that I&#x27;ve been just an eyeliner person. This is perfect even if you aren&#x27;t wearing a full face of makeup. I know I&#x27;ll get long term use out of this palette, and I most definitely will order again! This is my new go-to concealer! And it is perfect for anyone just starting out with makeup. The palette is a little small, approximately 7\\&quot; x 4\\&quot; without a ruler but trust me, it&#x27;s the real deal for five dollars? Whaaaat! If you pass this up, you&#x27;re a fool. Get this and you will be very impressed because I know I was!</li>
    <li> PROS: Different color ranges for your type of skin color. Decent packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: It&#x27;s a sheer concealer so it doesn&#x27;t help with concealing whatsoever, especially if you need extra coverage like me. The texture of the concealer feels like cheap quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone because it doesn&#x27;t work like a concealer.</li>
    <li> It settled into my pores and made them look dirty!  I feel like when I go to blend it in the darker colors do blend well they sink in your pores and the color goes on kinda purplish. I like the lighter ones.</li>
    <li> This is the worse thing I ever bought it&#x27;s a waste of Money.  The concealers do work at all.</li>
    <li> I was able to match my tone perfectly and thus reduced the need for base and powder. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> *. I really love this product, even though so far I&#x27;ve only used one color. The delivery was long. The product stays on my skin for the whole day. I just wish it had more than just a quarter size of product.)</li>
    <li> Glides on so smoothly very pigmented easy settable with powder. Blends easily very nice for contouring instead of foundation or on top of it. WIll be buying more. And it lasted me 3 weeks daily use. Ofc didnt need all the colors but nice selection.</li>
    <li> I received the palette faster than I thought. These creams are easily to blend. I am fair skinned so this is a perfect palette for me. Note: each shade is actually lighter when applied than it appears in the palette.</li>
    <li> it is a great product but i thought it would be a larger palette, I was a bit disappointed but the colors are great</li>
    <li> This is the best contour pallet I have ever used, it goes on flawlessly and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This is a bit ridiculous. I would like a refund.</li>
    <li> This contourn palete doesnt work!!!</li>
    <li> The pink, green. and white don&#x27;t show up very well. All of the colors are a little greasy. They work great as eye primers but aren&#x27;t the best concealers. As eye primers, I would probably give it 4 stars, but because that&#x27;s not the intended use, I give it 3 stars.As for the price, I give it 4 stars because it adds to my makeup collection and it works. Overall I give it 4 stars. I like it, and for the price I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Some of the pallets were cracked but there are so many tones that anyone can find and achieve their perfect contour and coverage, even comes with color correction blue and purple + highlighter</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is a must for the early mornings.  Everything right in front of you!  Awesome.</li>
    <li> it works pretty good.  I prefer using my fingers to apply  this product than a brush.  bonus is you can custom mix colors for a custom concealer color!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup novice, so this was very helpful to have.  The concealer is very creamy and easy to mix.  I didn&#x27;t get a lot out of the highlight and the green - I didn&#x27;t think they showed up at all, but the rest of the colors are great.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is using this for her drama class at college.  She is very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this initially to use the darker shades for contouring and the lighter shades for concealing. However, this product is quite oily and didn&#x27;t mesh well with my already oily/combination face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this palette! I would recommend this for a starter.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product at all this might as well be children&#x27;s make-up the coverage isn&#x27;t that good and it leaves this ashy look too it. The only plus to this was the first delivery</li>
    <li> This pallet is very creamy. Great quality, blends very nice and smooth. I would definitely order again. 5 stars indeed</li>
    <li> Quality seemed good but all the colors were melted and strewn all over the package</li>
    <li> Really good for the price offered its a small palette with various colors perfect for contouring and highlighting. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Nice concealer even though I received it two months late</li>
    <li> I give it five stars&lt;br /&gt;Cus I put it on and it looked natrually and I cud even mix !!!&lt;br /&gt;Thnx it feels thin and I love natural make up jus to hide some few black spots of acne&lt;br /&gt;Is not sever but I&#x27;m also get to Rid of em Lil by Lil</li>
    <li> I really like this set because I&#x27;m just now learning to contour and play around with it. This set is small and just enough to where I can play and figure it out. For some reason, I thought this was a powder set and it is not. It&#x27;s a wet set. And there isn&#x27;t a whole lot in each color but for me, it was okay since it is a starter kit.</li>
    <li> I did read the reviews prior to purchasing, saw some of the complaints and the praises so I said what the heck just get it. I am extremely happy that I did. Shipping was estimated 17-25 since it was coming from China but I received the package less than 10 days after placing my order. Despite the palette&#x27;s slight oily nature which can be saved using a powdered foundation, it blends perfectly. It is definitely worth the buy! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> For such a cheap price, it&#x27;s fun to use just to mess around with or experiment but I wouldn&#x27;t use it too often for events since I don&#x27;t know the ingredients in this kit. I like how creamy and smooth the palette is and i like how it was so cheap! for under $4, this is a steal. Just be careful when you wear it and make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to it first. I may order again once I go through this set.</li>
    <li> I got it 2 days earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice hard case.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are all a decent size, and a nice creamy consistency.&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly the way it does in the picture. :3</li>
    <li> You get what u pay for save ur money unless u need something cheep I used it for my sfx used it 2 time an tossed it out</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I thought, But its a great product and has all the colors and correctors you need to cotour your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried other concealer palettes, so I can&#x27;t compare this product to other products, but I liked the variation of colors the palette has and the creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d say the only thing I had a problem with was the fact that the second time I ordered this palette the colors were different. Most of the colors seemed to have warmer tones; i did not get those ashy browns that I got the first time I ordered the palette.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else has had this experience but that&#x27;s what made me rate it the stars.</li>
    <li> Some pointless and not so useful colors.</li>
    <li> This product is very good considering the price. I&#x27;ve used all of them on my self and they work amazing! I got it on time and it was not melted or anything, which I was surprised since I live in Florida and it&#x27;s summer right now. But there is one thing I wasnt as enthusiastic about , the highlight on the palette (which is the white one on the left corner) does not show any color what so ever. It is more clear with some shine in it. But besides that every thing is great!!!!</li>
    <li> I loved the correcting colors in the palette, and wanted this product mostly for concealing. However, although the shades are nice, the makeup is a bit on the oily side. I&#x27;m not going to complain because the price was nice, it just means that I&#x27;ll need to invest in some shine-free powder.</li>
    <li> I really liked the concealers I recommend this pallet for contouring. Price is really really good for what it is</li>
    <li> The colors are a little similar but they have good coverage.I use the darker colors for bronzing and contouring since im lighter skinned. I love how the white has a little shimmer it gives me a nice glow. I would repurchase this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this dec 18th and it arrived today (Jan. 2nd). I wasn&#x27;t expecting it and it came before the estimated date. The concealers are nice and creamy and very easy to blend. They also have my perfect skin tone shade. They are a little small but nothing too scary. Love it! So happy thank you</li>
    <li> had to build a little for contouring</li>
    <li> Better quality than expected for the price. Love it for contouring and highlighting. Good consistency, isn&#x27;t super oily or dry like other brands</li>
    <li> if you know how to use this makeup it is a must have to every make their kids I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> not as dark as the picture</li>
    <li> My darker color are all melted</li>
    <li> Not wat I thought it wud b! Extremely disappointed! I wudnt mind a refund! I swear..... Well it was cheap so I guess u get wat u pay for!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised! For the price I was not expecting much.  Product is very creamy, thick, and full of pigment. With proper technique it definitely does the job. I would not recommend this for someone with oily/combination skin. Also the colors compliment my skin tone (cool) quite well where as someone with an olive complexion might not be to happy with the results. It arrived a whole two weeks early!!</li>
    <li> Wow, so I&#x27;m a total beginner at contouring and highlighting but this little palette works really well for me! It&#x27;s very creamy and blended nicely. The only reason I give it four stars was because one of the colors came slightly melted over one edge, but it&#x27;s 107 in Southern Nevada so it&#x27;s to be expected with such a product. Really impressed with the fast shipping time too, this actually arrived BEFORE products shipped from America that I ordered on the same day!</li>
    <li> Not exactly as pictured. If you are of an ethnic background this is not for you. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to have a variety of colors but these aren&#x27;t opaque and are a bit greasy.  I have combination skin and I don&#x27;t use this on my t-zone.</li>
    <li> Came I&#x27;m perfect condition on a 100 degree weather</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve guessed by the price that it wouldn&#x27;t be great quality, and it doesn&#x27;t come with anything that says what each is used for.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! Great price!!! Getting the rest of my girls started on this product so we can order in bulk.  Love this seller too.  FAST SERVICE.  FAST DELIVERY.  GREAT PACKAGING!! Will continue with this company!!!  My 17 year old gave this a double thumbs up approval as well.  She is a hard sell when it comes to make-up...so that says a lot!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, it&#x27;s definitely what I expected and I think it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is crap! It&#x27;s been 3 months and I haven&#x27;t received it , I really hope you guys think before you buy. It&#x27;s not what I paid but the fact that I feel like I got robbed .</li>
    <li> Actually really like it allot!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the palette it does what it claims and then some. I really like the different shades you get to choose from for highlighting or just cover-up. The make-up it self spreads nice and stays a long time without smearing. The only problem I had was the amount of time it took for me to get I had to wait about a month for mine to arrive. I would recommend this palette to those who use highlight make-up or cover-up. thank you</li>
    <li> Great for conturing, I have fair skin so I mainly use the lighter colors. IF summer ever comes back to northern Wisconsin, maybe I&#x27;ll get to use the darker shades. Easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t made my sensivite skin break out.</li>
    <li> crap item. doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> They are smooth and light.</li>
    <li> Not as big as it looks in the photo at all but the texture and colors are good. Get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This makeup pallette is very easy to apply with either your fingers or makeup sponges! I suggest the water drop shaped sponges for only 2 or 3 dollars. I love this makeup to cover up imperfections or even my skin tone.  You can look up online what the various colors are used to conceal.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the colors run out fast if you tend to use the same one every day.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, a great buy for you and maybe a friend! I got one for my mother for mothers day and another for myself.</li>
    <li> Really really nice. The green concealer is amazing for covering up red, and the rest are mixable so that you can find the perfect skin tone. Its amazing!</li>
    <li> Not very satisfied. It&#x27;s a good practice palette for learning how to contour and highlight but I would never use this on anybody I was doing make up on. It&#x27;s very oily and gritty feeling. The pigmentation is sheer and not very build-able. Would only recommend this for practicing.</li>
    <li> You know I read the comments about the product and choose to buy it anyways so really its my fault. I wanted to practice blending with different skin tones but I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot. And it smells horrible, its very oily. I broke out within an hr of putting it on my face. And where I did a &amp;#34;test sweep&amp;#34; on my arm to match skin tone I even got an infected pore. And I hardly ever break out anymore. So buy at your own risk. I wasn&#x27;t going to use on other people. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> It feels greasy and heavy</li>
    <li> For my first time wearing concealer, I really like this palette! Great colors. It is a little oily but my powder helps with that.</li>
    <li> love it. the only thing is that theres not much of each i used it up in like a week.</li>
    <li> I product was melted when I receive it.</li>
    <li> good product over all!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Little but too oily for my use. But for the price out was worth the try.</li>
    <li> I was really worried this would make me break out like crazy since it was so cheap but so far it&#x27;s been fine. I love all the different shades and contour and highlight. Will def buy again</li>
    <li> I just order it and I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it I&#x27;m so afraid is gonna be melted :\</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made and a terrible product!&lt;br /&gt;If I had to order this product again, I would not!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in the beginning of April and I didn&#x27;t receive it until the middle of May. Now granted when I purchased this item Amazon told me it was going to be awhile for it to arrive because it was coming from over seas. It took so long I totally forgot I ordered it lolol. But they did meet all their obligations in their description, so if it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s fault it is mine for not reading the fine print. So if you need this item ASAP I would suggest that you get it somewhere else. The product itself is ok. I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the product. It just took a little long to get here.</li>
    <li> Love it, but not enough of. The colors. I use</li>
    <li> The concealer arrived on time! The packaging is really light But it was what I was expecting. The concealer is a bit oily an there are a lot of colors to choose from but the change when you put them on the skin. My skin color is medium an I&#x27;m almost using the darkest shade to conceal with. Overall the product is okay I use it everyday an I use a primer on my face! Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Very nice! Its nice and creamy. It came earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> this product was definitely not my favorite. All of the shades in the second and third row are basically pure white. None of the shades in the third row are different colors. I am very pale, and i have to use the fourth darkest shade in the whole pallet. Also, this is tremendously hard to blend in. The highlighting color on the top left does not even sow up at all. Overall, yu get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This cute, small pallet is great! Easy to carry around &amp; very creamy concealers. Love that there are a few shades to choose from &amp; you can mix them if you want.</li>
    <li> There is not much product in the containers, but all in all it is a good product and worth the price....</li>
    <li> received my concealer palette today and I&#x27;m highly impressed for the price you get what you pay for the concealer is of good quality but there&#x27;s not much conceal it in the canisters so maybe in a couple of faces done of certain shade I will be having to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much and I would like to buy this make up again ! It&#x27;s very smooth and nice ! Although it&#x27;s pretty small but come on , it fits the price hahaha , I would recommend to buy this product your gonna love it more if you have a dry face like mine. My face usually dry and no matter what I do for my face too look perfect with makeup it looks awful , but with this makeup concealer It really solved my problem and my face looked perfect , you just need to be an expert to know how to use this product correctly on your face lol but amazing ! But it now ! U won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I received this pallete as a gift, I love it!  Very creamy and easy to blend! I hope this product doesn&#x27;t ever go away!  The price is perfect!</li>
    <li> I use this for just about everything xD i use different shades for my face and for concealing my eyebrows. i also fill in my eyebrows with this. it&#x27;s good. i&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;re not a person who obsesses over extremely good quality makeup and higher end brands.</li>
    <li> Its okk for like a 2 time use only</li>
    <li> The product was melted and all mixed together! Very bad purchase</li>
    <li> great but smaller than how it looks.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer</li>
    <li> creamy and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Decent is all I can say for this product. Don&#x27;t let the picture fool you, it is a lot smaller than shown. The concealer did wear off as time went on and went into my fine lines. Does need retouching. But, good for the price.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and blends beautifuly in with other make up. I love it and will be getting more!!!!</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews on this and they were so mixed that I wasn&#x27;t really sure what I would be getting but I decided to try it anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did. I ordered it at the end of July in CT so it was quite warm outside. It came packaged in a plastic bag but it was in a box with some other items I purchased. When it came I was stuck at work late so it sat in the sun for a solid 9 hours before I got it but it was in pristine condition when I opened it. Now regarding texture and application, I have dry skin and this worked beautifully for me. It is very creamy and blends nicely. I did not find it greasy or sticky at all but I can see how it might be a problem for someone with oily skin. I am also very pale and find it difficult to find foundation light enough for my skin and one of the colors in this palate was even light enough for me to use as a highlight. As far as highlighting and contouring goes I actually like it better than the contour palate I bought from Sephora. I prefer a more matte look with a little brightness and this does exactly that. I will most likely order again. I&#x27;m anxious to see how long this will last.</li>
    <li> The color are fine, but are very grease in my face.</li>
    <li> Watch tutorials using this palette</li>
    <li> Way to oily I ended up just throwing it out</li>
    <li> For a price like this, this product is wonderful. Easy to apply, stays on all day, and does not look oily at all on my really oily skin. However, in this case, a little does not go a long way, and with some colors you may need to get a bit more application then some of the other colors. I will be repurchasing because it is good quality for concealer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really waxy and oily, it covers blemishes really well though.</li>
    <li> Works well but is small.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> very good product, arrived later than expected but for 5 dollars the quality is not bad at all.. easy to apply and lasts all day. i would rebuy this product</li>
    <li> This is not the best concealer in the world, but for $3 its pretty good. It gives me better coverage then the concealer I got in the NXY waiting for tonight palette. Since I have light skin I am going to try to use the darker shades for contorting.  I got it right on time. I will say that this palette is smaller than I thought it would be. Its my fault though because I did not really pay attention to the size when I bought it. I saw it was on sale and purchased it while I was getting another item.</li>
    <li> They are a nice velvety cream to the face, go on natural and with all the colors to choose and mix this really is quite the steel.It helps to cover dark circles, blemishes, and help to highlight. Really surprised by this product. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for a kid who you don&#x27;t want to get makeup on themselves. Because literally you will never get any amount of this product on.</li>
    <li> this palette is so perfect. it blends just like my expensive make up that I use for my highlighting! love it</li>
    <li> great coverage, but the tree dark shades dont actually look like that, so if you&#x27;re African American and want to use this to highlight and conceal, don&#x27;t buy!!! the one in the middle is about the same but the two ends are wayyy lighter.</li>
    <li> it was super small I thought it be a lil bigger or something I wasn&#x27;t expecting a tiny small one</li>
    <li> I used this concealer, and it creases like nobody&#x27;s business. I have used a lot of concealers in my time, and this one is by far the worse I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This arrived wayyy earlier than it said it was going to which was awesome. The concealer is a little waxy, not as creamy as I wanted it to be. I think this would be good for like halloween or a party but not for everyday use. I gave it to my 4 year old to play with.</li>
    <li> its very, very oily. its almost like pastels, really.&lt;br /&gt;you can tell just by the texture and constancy that it can, and will, clog your pores which causes break outs. it&#x27;s like those barbie make up kits for young kids, and i wouldnt consider this product. sorry, but no. plus, you literally have to play around with the shade of color your skin is. thats a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> The palette is beautiful. ITs creamy &amp; build able. I compared &amp; this goes for WAY MORE than I spent for it here. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I am no makeup guru, but I love this product! It is definitely a deal! The price is so minuscule for what the product has to offer! The makeup is a cream-like substance and goes on very smoothly onto the skin. I love using it to contour my face, and even use some as an eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> The colors of this are totally off from the picture, everything is darker &amp; brighter.  Instead of a salmon corrector it&#x27;s hot pink.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> just got this today and i love it. its great if you have a make up collection. the colors are pretty nice as well,im happy with my purchase just wish it was bigger but still good!</li>
    <li> This is a very small set. It make my skin oily when i use it. But the customer service is very good and nice</li>
    <li> Very good product. The bright colors show well, however the dark colors are not as pigmented</li>
    <li> i like my concealer palette but i have my I have my doubts about the smell.... it&#x27;s weird, i don&#x27;t like that... sorry!</li>
    <li> Do not buy my palette had bits of hair on it and was also had used scratches</li>
    <li> Very Nice and smooth textured palatte. Very good and especially for the price. Of course, this shipped from China so it took days to get to me. But oh, when I got it, it was on. I use the darkest brown for contouring. I am still trying to figure out which color I like to use for my highlights on my dark skin. But its definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product . it&#x27;s simple. The concealer is good at covering my improfection on my face. I really enjoy.</li>
    <li> I bought this palette because my other palette wasn&#x27;t coming in. Not to long after maybe a day or so I message the seller saying to cancel my order and get a refund. I didn&#x27;t notice the refund was for only $.65!!! I paid $4 and Im only getting $.65!!&amp;#62;? ?Um I know dang well I should be getting more money than that. I want my $3.34 regardless if its a couple dollars.</li>
    <li> relying on her she said put all stars she loves--but she also like bieber soooooo take her advice for what you will</li>
    <li> I like this item, product goes on easy and smooth on skin. I would have to say med. coverage at best. I will reorder...</li>
    <li> This is a really nice palette and great for the price.  I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not the best concealer I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and will probably continue to use it until it runs out of product, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Ok... so literally this is my concealer, bronzer,  and highlighter palette.!!! The concealer is great!! I don&#x27;t use a brush because it doesn&#x27;t apply to my skin very well... Tap it on with find and then pat until blended properly.... my skin is acne prone and I have alot of acne marks and this covers it up!!! Plus, there are soo many colors so you can just mix 2 shades together to match skin/foundation!! As for the highlighting part, I use the yellow shade, and the lightest shade to do my undereyes, bridge of nose, cupids bow, and above my cheekbones!! It is so dewy and makes me look sooooo awake... As for the bronzer, I again use my fingers and i dab my finger in one of darker shades, start at top of cheek bone and drag it all the way to where it is level with the outside of my eye... I dab it until it blended the way I want and it looks amazing!! It is sooo easy to control, and make it look right.. I was never good at applying bronzer to my fair skin but now I am able to!! This concealer palette is more than a concealer pallette.. It is sooo cheap, and the crazy thing is, it is one of the best purchases I have ever made on makeup.. There only 3 things I can say I am crazy about... My foundation by Estee Lauder, My beauty blenders, and this concealer pallette!! I will buy this again and again, I am about to run out, I hit pan on alot of the colors, and I have had it for awhile too, but I will be buying again pretty soon. Love love love (:</li>
    <li> I found that the colors are very... Beige... On my pale skin tone. I&#x27;m not too surprised, as I am quiet pale, but once my tanning resumes I am sure that will be resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not pro quality, and anyone thinking they will be for under $10 is gonna be disappointed. They are good for practicing on (like I am) but the formula can make them a little difficult to layer, as it can become quiet oily very quickly. This makes them easy to blend, but once you begin to layer they begin to melt. I have noticed a strong primer and blotting papers will help the formula stay on your face for more than 5 hrs before it all mixes and it just looks like foundation.&lt;br /&gt;It does have very good coverage though!</li>
    <li> This was a flop for me the product is sooo oily and in my option these are note true to color iv been doing make up for 15 year and this was one of the worst concealers iv ever had just my opintion.</li>
    <li> The variety and quality of the tones are great. Coverage is perfect. I would recommend this to anyone great&lt;br /&gt;Reduction.</li>
    <li> The concealers are oily, they don&#x27;t transfer color either. I have to put on a ton to see a difference, and then it slides all over the place. I tried to set with a powder but it did not conceal anything. I plan to try applying with a sponge to see if it creates a difference. This might be good for newbies to play with, but does not look natural or clean on my face.</li>
    <li> This palette  is VERY small. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this palette. Its very oil consistence aswell. I actually no longer use it</li>
    <li> I like my palette so far.  Very smooth on skin.  I haven&#x27;t  tried all the colors but the ones I&#x27;ve used I really like.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> I like the colors and it has a nice pigment to cover up the flaws on your face. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do. We need to have it in order to cover the flaws on the skin or just to even out the tone.</li>
    <li> it never came n i cant give no star that sucks i waited a month n no show&lt;br /&gt;sucks big time</li>
    <li> This product does not have any coverage. When i put it on to make my skin color it just kept smearing off, very annoying, and not to mention it comes from Hong Kong so of course took forever...</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer palette just to give it a try and i was really amazed on how good coverage this concealer gives! i have redness and blemishes and this gives me full coverage and the dark colors i use it to contour and it works great! i use my matte bronzer to set it. Gotta buy more for the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> Loved it! It came perfect! The only thing is that it&#x27;s smaller then what I thought and it is very light but perfect for that price.</li>
    <li> Good palette. Creases easily and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Works great for contouring although I did break out a lot . So I just use it for special occasions now</li>
    <li> Been waiting for this product for to long now and I think I paid for nothing because I dont think its coming</li>
    <li> I ordered this and they were are light and nothing matched my skin tone and the pallet was way to small. The dark skin tones are a green tone it looks muddy. I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and none of these work. I contacted the seller for a refund and they were nice at first but then offered me a dollar back. I said no and asked for all my money back. Never buy from this company again it&#x27;s a waste of time and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nothing to get excited over.  It&#x27;s a camo kit.  It actually breaks my skin out, as it&#x27;s a little too greasy for me.  But it works.</li>
    <li> i thought it was powder and it is not i dont care of this type of make up</li>
    <li> I got four of them for Christmas presents.  What a great deal and the colors are beautiful and match my eyes perfectly.  Can&#x27;t wait to give them out as Christmas gifts this year.  15 different colors but just know this is a creme so it is a little different for oily skin.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, but it will clog your pores like no one&#x27;s business. Seriously. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it, since it made me break out. :P</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. The colors are all extremely light and don&#x27;t blend at all. I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> 2 months still haven&#x27;t gotten it and I&#x27;ve tried to email and they won&#x27;t take my email. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
    <li> This is a very creamy. It will last me half of the day but other than that is okay :)</li>
    <li> Good for the price. I wish they had a bit more full coverage, but you can build it. They&#x27;re a bit oily also, so it tends to crease. But I can overlook that for the price.</li>
    <li> It never came in. They took my money fast tho. Disappointed.not cool and u should be ashamed of ur self</li>
    <li> Poor quality dont waste your money</li>
    <li> I was not able to use this product, the makeup was melted when I received it. There is suppose to be 15 colors in this palate, there were only 9. This was a waste of my money!!!!!</li>
    <li> it just came in the mail today and it looks juat like the pix! its a little smaller than i expected but it looks so wonderful and is creamy and soft ❤️ i cant wait to use it!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable price in my contry</li>
    <li> Truly a great purchase</li>
    <li> Took a long and i meanLONG time to arrive!!! And once it came i was so excited to see it but was so disappointed! :( all the colors came in MELTED! And empty obviously so it was hard to even try but the ones i was able to get a bit of are great.</li>
    <li> It is a very small pallet</li>
    <li> This concealer would&#x27;ve worked better for me if I had a slightly lighter or darker completion. I had a hard time finding the correct shade for me. I mixed a few of them and it worked wonderfully. This blends amazingly. I absolutely adore it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Especially for the price! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. . I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I JUST Received this palette and soo exited to try it out hopefu it works lol</li>
    <li> Small, compact and lots of product!</li>
    <li> I need many skin toned concealers to contour my face for certain characters and this has a great selection! Not too waxy, doesn&#x27;t wear off easily! 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> One of the best consealer pallets I have used! It blends well, mixes with other products, and cleans up easy! As a make up artist, I would never leave for a job without it! Much better than some super expensive pallets i&#x27;v used and it is a really good price! Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> The make up melted it was horrible I would want my money back</li>
    <li> This product is not as big as i thought. Just a lil simple palette. Overall, its decent.</li>
    <li> The set was smaller than I expected, but very useful. The item arrived in new condition.</li>
    <li> i love them,they are super smoothe on ur face,the pigmentation is awesome you just have to set them with powder other than that they are amazing,so recommending them to my friends,ooo and they arrived before the estimated time and for the prize you get a good amount of product</li>
    <li> SHIPPING 2 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Took a long time as expected since it was shipped from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY 2 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Creamy, but way too shear for a concealer. The colors easily fade including the darkest shades. On the skin, the colors barely look like what they do on the palate. Not very pigmented at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Super cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;You really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I was not sure at first since it appears pretty oil based but after a few times using it, WOW. I love it. It makes my skin look perfect and the contouring makes my features pop. Highly, highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I got my concealer palette right on time, 2 days after I ordered it on prime. When I got it, it was smaller than I expected but still good enough. Each concealer round is about the size of a quarter. The quality of the concealer isn&#x27;t amazing but it&#x27;s doable. The only problem I had was the depth of the concealer tin. There wasn&#x27;t much in there so in a month or so I might have to order another one. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> A very cheap product it doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star . It is much oily and the colors are like a chalk board!</li>
    <li> Not a great palette. very thin with no coverage. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. Spend a little more money for a better result.</li>
    <li> I love it....it woks great with my powder foundation...gives me that natural look and adds a good look to my makeup. Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have expected more. I paid like $3 for it.Its fun to play with the colors, but if you&#x27;re looking for a heavy coverage concealer this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even try it on it looked to gross, I didn&#x27;t want it on my skin.</li>
    <li> i thought the concealers would have a bit more product then they did, but it works good if you apply it a few times during the day.</li>
    <li> This is my travel size make up concealer. I love that I have all the concealer in one container and not all over the place. The shipping was really fast as well. I received it within a week of buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good colors to blend together if its not the right shade you want.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the pink and green color options in this concealer set. Covers great and stays all day! I was pleased with my purchase and will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> ordered and paid for in jan. still havent recived it! totally angry an upset its been paid for but i never got it</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer palette, which I bought to conceal under eye circles, highlight/contour, and color correct.  This absolutely does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any other palette, the colors can be combined to create your signature color, and with a primer, I have found that this lasts all day.  I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> For some reason when you look at the color on the compact, it seems dark, but upon application its actualy quite translucent which doesnt make for a deep color. I bought this to use as a contour/highlighter kit, but with med brown skin; im only able to highlight. Id honestly love to see anyone with fairer skin whos tried it to contour. I just dont think the contouring shades are very deep, &amp; id be interested in seeing how someone else actually used them, no matter their skin tone...The lighter colors are fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product we i need more i will reorder with them came quickly and just as described... Awesome</li>
    <li> Super stoked i got this a week early! I&#x27;m very happy with what i received. If covers flawlessly. Who can beat the price?? Will definitely be buying this again</li>
    <li> They take like forever to get to you !! i don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!!! YOU will be disappointed for reall!</li>
    <li> i was skeptic about this at first i can&#x27;t lie, but i now use it everyday!! i love it i think it gives great coverage and is not oily or idk wierd? lol its a great product! :D</li>
    <li> For the price you cant beat it, it applies beautifully and there are so many colors so you can use it for coverage or for highlighting and contouring or both(: I love mine(:</li>
    <li> Love it. Happy and satisfied</li>
    <li> Very good product, however it took about three months to receive. First it got lost in the mail twice.  No one bothered to call me to let me know. I had to do my own follow up.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE It smells dangerous. Something is not right about it</li>
    <li> Its really waxy and doesn&#x27;t cover very well. The reason I gave 2 stars is because it works good as face paint for my kids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over 3 MONTHS. DO NOT BUY, you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Worth the money :). The browns work great for fillin in eyebrows</li>
    <li> I just love this concealer</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! They have really stepped up their game. Its not as full of a coverage as i thought it would be,  but it does just fine with covering up small imperfections.  It does work wonders with contouring, eyebrow creme, shadow base and even undereye brighteners. Will definitely repurchase!! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I need a new one already!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Useful in many different ways I suggest using a finishing powder bc it&#x27;s a bit oily but it has a nice finish</li>
    <li> Really haven&#x27;t used this much to be honest. Pretty much comes as described; case is smaller than what I thought it would be though. If you&#x27;re looking for a variety of concealers this is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Great concealer just a little too thick</li>
    <li> Shipping took a whole but I&#x27;m very happy with the product! I would recommend this product if in need of highlighting and conturing concealer</li>
    <li> Amazing packaging . &amp; I&#x27;m a begginer so I have to work on applying it right on my face . I would if like it better if it wasn&#x27;t a cream type .</li>
    <li> It works well.  A little cakey but nothing horrible.  I live in Arizona where it reaches 120 degrees so I was afraid it would be melted.  Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t. I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is sloppy it doesn&#x27;t conceal anything and its oily I hate this product</li>
    <li> How do i use it ? I mean it feels like rubber do i apply water to make it moist to easy apply to my face ?</li>
    <li> Great set for a great price!</li>
    <li> I never recieved this product! Ordered it like a year ago!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s to greasy in my face!!</li>
    <li> Smells kind of weird and a little oily but overall good. Also hard to blend</li>
    <li> Factoring in price, quantity, and quality I give the makeup 4 stars. It&#x27;s gives effective coverage, is perfect for contouring your face, and lasts longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the product is a bit oily, so if you have particularly oily skin or perspire a lot this might not be the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, obviously not all these colors match my skin tone. So I feel bad about wasting what I don&#x27;t use. However a professional MUA wouldn&#x27;t have a problem using many different completions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end though, it&#x27;s a great deal at double the price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Its working very well.</li>
    <li> Quality is great and I recieved it exactly when they said i would</li>
    <li> This contouring kit is awesome! I purchased two of them! It&#x27;s affordable and it works amazing! I&#x27;m so glad I invested.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the product. The portion sizes aren&#x27;t very large but the selection is really nice for doing different skin tones or even more intense contours.They go on and blend very nicely. They are pretty thick so it provides decent coverage, they are oil based so probably not the greatest for use on oily skin consistently.</li>
    <li> So oily.. should&#x27;ve known by the price that this was gross but I was cheap so I figured why not.. won&#x27;t ever use these, I have dry clear skin but I broke out horribly and it was so greasy</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s not that good, they work but not for long. I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of makeup but I know what good and not&lt;br /&gt;Good is. Not bad for the price but not very pigmented or anything, I mean it&#x27;s not like MAC or anything it wouldn&#x27;t be its like 6 dollars but it&#x27;s not super good. Runs out quickly. Very small. Most of the negative images are fake. It comes very nicely with all colors intact. 3 stars</li>
    <li> I love how I&#x27;m able to contour without having to pull out twenty million makeup.  It&#x27;s easy and it glides on smoothly.  I wore it the night I went out and it didn&#x27;t budge or smudge.</li>
    <li> This provides GREAT coverage love it!</li>
    <li> I cant really give a full review, item was melted when it arrived but it looked like it would have been ok?</li>
    <li> Great pallet! Love all the colors included. Great selection It was exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> i have a lot of dark spots on my face and it provides a medium coverage and works well.... for the price its worth it and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I usually use this to hide my undereye blackness and it works wonders</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good for me and the price hello is a cheap product. ... it does cover the imperfections</li>
    <li> These concealers are creamy but they tend to crease, even when powder is used to set it.  The colors cover a wide range of skin tones, which is good.  They are easy to blend to get just the right shade.  But you get what you pay for.  They seem kind of greasy rather than truly creamy.  They slide right off my skin after just a few hours.  For someone who needs to find the perfect shade of concealer, I recommend the Graftobian palettes.  They cost a bit more but many YouTube makeup gurus recommend them.  Also the RCMA foundations can be used as concealer.  These are better options.  I don&#x27;t recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> Delivery took a little longer than expected but when it came it was worth the wait!!!</li>
    <li> Small and compact I like to use it for higlighting some areas and contouring. Blends well with other make up and alone. Satisfied with purchase and price.</li>
    <li> i cant wait to use this ive been waiting for 31 days now</li>
    <li> Great contour starting kit. I just feel like the colors when on bold but when blending didn&#x27;t leave any shading or highlight</li>
    <li> Not used yet looks good</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product but was a little disappointed. The consistency of the product is not as thick as a concealer should be. Its very light and you need to use a lot to get the coverage you want and if you want to use this as a contour ... it wont work for that. So disappointed in the product but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It melted in my mailbox. The colors looked nice though</li>
    <li> Its smaller than what the picture shows. The formula is sticky, almost like a lipgloss. I actually thought they got my order wrong because they had the consistency of lip gloss. okay coverage but weird consistency.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors to choose from, only I thought they felt to greasy but ultimately it does get set with powder.</li>
    <li> so bad....to light on my skin</li>
    <li> the texture is very waxy and does not blend easily. However, it provides pretty good coverage. Good pick for the price.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this in the mail last week &amp;&amp; I absolutely love it!! I highly recommend this product especially if you&#x27;re a makeup artist, this is the perfect item for you. I&#x27;ve only used 3 colors so far but I can&#x27;t wait to see how the other ones turn out. Another plus is I got the product 2 wks early which I was extremely happy with :) I have a feeling I&#x27;ll have this item for awhile but once I run out I will definitely be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> Has a really fresh smell to it actually, really great for the price, looks a bit weird when first applied but if you let it set in it looks super great! Love!</li>
    <li> Considering how cheap this is compared to branded concealer palettes, I think this is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the cream is really pigmented and how the concealer stays on your skin. I love the pink for blush and the green for highlighting under my eyes. Great for contouring and highlighting. Just need to practice on my technique...</li>
    <li> I mean it was just ok. The concealer could be a tad bit thicker. It&#x27;s really thin! That&#x27;s all :-)</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented and come in a wide range. Although they are a little tough to blend. Just use a primer to soften it up a bit and set it with a setting powder, because they do seem to be a bit dewy on the skin. Otherwise, for the price is pretty good.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what i expected, but I will be able to use it for the purpose I bought it for and maybe even more than that. It took longer than I would have liked it to but at least I finally got it.</li>
    <li> Still not 100% on how to use it, but it&#x27;s got every color for every person, and every area. The texture for the blue/green one is different than the rest, but they all apply nicely!</li>
    <li> It blended really well with my skin...but then it started to really break my skin out. I have never had acne problems and I immediately stopped using it. Then it doesn&#x27;t even give you any ingredients or anything in the packaging. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is really nice full coverage makeup and it is long wearing with out caking. However, I&#x27;ve noticed that it tends to break me out. So I can only use it for very specific events.</li>
    <li> I think that i expected more when I purchased this product because it looked bigger online. The product is not enough in my opinion, too little in those little pots. Came on time and customer service prompt and friendly.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for cheap junk. It was greasy and awful pigment.  I bought to use as a contour palette and the colors disappeared on my skin, zero coverage.</li>
    <li> It covers ok but could be a lot better, works well for the price you pay. However I&#x27;ve only used it twice because it smells so strongly of acrylic paint. It also doesn&#x27;t blend the greatest. This would be good for someone who is beginning to use makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. The set comes with many different shades and purposes of camouflage and corrective makeup and I&#x27;m happy I bought it. It&#x27;s creamy and blends easily. The price is amazing and the quality is very good. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product. It&#x27;s not amazing. It&#x27;s a little lighting than I expected it to be, so if you have skin any darker than a light brown or a really strong tan, I&#x27;m not sure this will work for you. It&#x27;s great for cosplay or stage makeup purposes, but it can be used for everyday too. It&#x27;s more than what you pay for, but then again it is very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It comes with no brushes or applicators</li>
    <li> Very cakey, and almost 0 pigmentation.  It was very small and did nothing for me or any of my clients.  Do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this pallet because it was a great deal and I did not own a concealer pallet and the pallet does have pretty good coverage but then I seen a news story about the different harmful ingredients these no name pallets can contain so I ended up buying a coastal scent concealer pallet and it is actually a bit better quality. No I can not say for sure that this pallet has any harmful ingredients in it but I am not willing to chance it</li>
    <li> Pretty good product I love how it blends. Good price and a lot of uses</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for light contouring and color correction and it works, it&#x27;s just not the best. It has a very thick consistency however, it smears off easily and doesnt provide a lot of coverage. I find myself reapplying multiple times throughout the day(which inevitably leads to a bad case of cake face). it was a fairly inexpensive product so not a lot was expected, it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did find to be mildly irritating was that one of the flesh colors was empty when it arrived.</li>
    <li> 2 stars because there was a distinct fingerprint in one of the pots, and another had obviously been touched/smudged. For the price it wasn&#x27;t worth returning in my opinion. I have used the undisturbed pots a few times. This isn&#x27;t a high end concealer by any means. The texture is almost chalky in some of the pots, while greasy in others. Blending didn&#x27;t work out great either. I pretty much knew what I was getting for the price but decided to gamble. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but I do occasionally use it.</li>
    <li> Only a few concealers survived but everything else was melted and empty. It&#x27;s basically useless. I&#x27;ve wanted this product for the longest.. so disappointed</li>
    <li> Little bit thin and takes a few coats but great for learning how to contour!</li>
    <li> WTF? You guys are selling colors. Like wax!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but a nice pallet</li>
    <li> So great!! I don&#x27;t know how people are receiving damaged or melted product because mine is perfect</li>
    <li> I love this product, it arrived on time. Good condition. Great cuallity.</li>
    <li> Too greasy, and not good quality, waste of money ladies.</li>
    <li> Great contouring starter kit, small samples of each color for a great price. Purchased to try just a few times before purchasing more expensive &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; contouring kit. Standard shipment arrived as promised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
    <li> It came in two weeks early and I love all the shades</li>
    <li> I thought it be bigger but still happy reasonable price</li>
    <li> okay product....somewhat fits every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
    <li> Feels very thick on the skin, has ok coverage, for the price you can&#x27;t beat it though.</li>
    <li> I received a melted mess. half of the container was melted ands smeared on the lid</li>
    <li> I do like this product and for the price it can not be beat. I bought it for contouring purposes and would do so again. The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected to be compared to other similar products, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am medium skin toned and this palette didn&#x27;t work for my skin color because only the darkest 3 worked since the rest are too light. Also the light colors don&#x27;t have much difference, they are all nearly the same.  I thought the palette was a lot bigger which was the downside but the size is good to carry around.  One thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the colors don&#x27;t stay on so you need a good primer and you have to work your way into building the color/look you want. For the price overall I guess its what you should expect.</li>
    <li> On TIME! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Nice creamy and blendable. Pigmentation not strong enough for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product the concealer is thick and creamy it feels amazing on my face I highly recommend it 😃</li>
    <li> For the price you pay it&#x27;s definetely worth it !</li>
    <li> thank you!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> my wife doesn&#x27;t complain. so she does like it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Beautiful colors as expected!</li>
    <li> Received much faster than expected -- thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product. There are many different shades for you to blend so you can perfectly match your own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller provided a great product, fast shipping, and a price you can&#x27;t beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy and greasy, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for a full foundation, only contour [which is why I bought it]&lt;br /&gt;It is well pigmented and although I didn&#x27;t like using it on my face, since it&#x27;s greasy like I said, I used it to contour my breasts for costume purposes and was quite pleased with the way it stayed and blended. I recommend this if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking to do. I chose the &#x27;darker than expected&#x27; option because I expected it to be hard to apply and not heavily pigmented, but the color it is is the color that goes on your skin. When I used it to contour my face, it looked nice but it made me feel very oily and uncomfortable so I immediately washed it off. I am light-skinned, I&#x27;m not sure how this would work for someone of darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a cheap makeup set and you get what you pay for. I was going to give less stars, because I don&#x27;t think it works for what it&#x27;s advertised for [face] but I did really like how it worked on my breasts, and for a $4 set that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> even tho it caused irritationto me, i really liked this product and applys and blends very well.</li>
    <li> Very oily. Not very fond of this product</li>
    <li> Awesome product, worked as intended</li>
    <li> Terrible product for people with sensitive skin. I purchased this product and it irritated my skin and caused rashes. I would not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> This Makeup Palette comes in a sturdy plastic case. This Contouring Makeup Palette has 15 cream color selections. The shade variety is perfect for contouring. The makeup goes on very easily. I applied the makeup with a brush. I used a blending sponge to smooth out the lines. The lines blend very easily. There&#x27;s no cake finish or clumping. I applied a transparent matte powder to complete the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Blends very easily&lt;br /&gt;No lines&lt;br /&gt;Perfect blemish and dark spot coverage&lt;br /&gt;Color variety for many contouring techniques&lt;br /&gt;Washes off easily&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts post application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Has a slight sticky finish even after applying matte powder&lt;br /&gt;Rubs off easily when touched&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings (Out of five stars):&lt;br /&gt;Color variety: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Easy of blending: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Blemish coverage: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Dark circle coverage: *5*&lt;br /&gt;Value: *5*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating: 25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contouring pallet is cheaper than the competition but it also has a longer shipping time frame. Check the ETA before you order and make sure it meets your needs. If you need this more quickly you will have to pay for express shipping. My daughter liked this pallet so much I bought her one as well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Came in melted and I have yet to have a response for returning it</li>
    <li> This product is not true to the color. It&#x27;s too orange for my complexion. I have to mix several colors together and it&#x27;s still too orange.</li>
    <li> I for one did love using this I only use this if I go out to special events, and if you have oily skin you have to realize this stuff does have oils in it thts y its cremey but I do love this I will definitely come.back for.more wen mines alll gone :)</li>
    <li> Soo creamy  easy to blend :) and came 2 weeks early soo that&#x27;s good overall i love it so far </li>
    <li> GREAT it&#x27;s not cheap-y it&#x27;s the real deal and perfect</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but the colors feel good&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t seem greasy like others users said&lt;br /&gt;but we&#x27;ll see once I finally use it.. next time&lt;br /&gt;packaging should make the palette so that it sticks&lt;br /&gt;to the make up... why does it have to be removable?</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. really great for contouring! I thought the dark ones would be to dark but it was perfect!</li>
    <li> product was very small... it just was not what we expected to be...&lt;br /&gt;buy my daughter kepted any ways...very cheap</li>
    <li> The coverage is amazing and the pallete contains great colors, it is somewhat smaller then the picture but totally worth what you&#x27;re paying. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! Great quality!! This palette is amazing, don&#x27;t regret buying it at all. Will order more.</li>
    <li> Not much product. More like sample sizes. Melts if it&#x27;s too hot</li>
    <li> I ordered this concealer pallete and when I finally received it instead of getting what I ordered I got a bright purple dildo.  it was the most embarrassing moment ever.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Not as creamy as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, product feels greasy to me, good coverage.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, great</li>
    <li> Very fun it your starting to learn how to contour your face. It&#x27;s good as a starter kit for practice</li>
    <li> I like it... it jus has this glossy look tho.. but ain&#x27;t nothn a little powder can do...</li>
    <li> Only some colors work. Very waxy. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Not that great , you can&#x27;t see  no different after apply it , not worth buying , save you&#x27;re money .</li>
    <li> Wonder concealer goes right with my skin and clumps and last all day will buy more</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE my contouring kit! It&#x27;s my first one and I found it very useful :)</li>
    <li> I order this product come quick and with no damage...I love it and i use this everyday, its very easy to use. I will recommend this to all my friend.</li>
    <li> Very oily but I love it</li>
    <li> i was so afraid to buy this because of the reviews, they were either really bad or really good. the price is INCREDIBLE not even ONE concealer costs you so little so i bought it. i am a warm skin tone, and this is AMAZING. i dont use the first row because i dont really know how, how ever the second row i use for under eyes, third i use for my face, fourth and last are usually for contour (varies on ehwther its forehead, cheekbone, or nose shadows) and the very last color is WAY to dark, but i use it to fill in my eyebrows, its not the BEST quality meaning it wont last alll night nor do i recomend for a night out, obviously but its great for an everyday purpose and the shipping came in sooo quickly! LOVE</li>
    <li> really great for any skin tone, im tan amd they blended in really well</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved  it!!!!</li>
    <li> works great for highlight contour and color correct not a lot of product in each pot but inexpensive</li>
    <li> Nice product shipping  no damage.</li>
    <li> Very good value. Great for contouring and highlighting, as well as decent coverage. I was impressed. I use it on myself and clients</li>
    <li> This is a nice product</li>
    <li> I got this 2 days short of a month after ordering it. It&#x27;s very compact. I&#x27;d say about the size of a small children&#x27;s book, or half the size of an iPad mini. The packaging is sleek. It says in the product description that the pan diameter is a few centimeters, so I was expecting a small palette anyway. You have to swatch it a little to get the oils off the top, but after that it&#x27;s fine. The white color has glitter shimmer in it &amp; I assume it makes a very lovely highlighter. Overall, very happy to have received this product. I look forward to using it on my cake-face days! Deducted one star for the shipping, but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m very impatient.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Good selection. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This was not really what I was looking for. Case it much smalled then you would think and not alot of make up cames with it. Also when I got my case there was a finger print in one of the concealer already, as if someone had already used this.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a nice product, for being so cheap and the good reviews. I got it in good time, but when I opened the package the concealer was melted EVERYWHERE. All the colors mixed together and I had to clean it off. I&#x27;m not happy, this is unacceptable. Not buying anything else from you ever.</li>
    <li> The pallet is small but it&#x27;s nice. Some other colors look all the same but I make it work for me. I just mix it with the concealers already have to make the color that I need nothing crazy nothing serious just a minor defect. But I can say it&#x27;s a little streaky but I have my tricks to fix that but overall the product is cool with me.</li>
    <li> This got here so fast ! i wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality but i was wrong. i reach for this more often then my coastal scents concealer pallet. it has great coverage for my freckles that i cover up &amp; these blend like you would not believe. love love love this pallet! i recommend it to all my makeup junkies !</li>
    <li> So amazing for under $4 ! I love it !</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had to throw it out it made my face itchy and allllll red</li>
    <li> It totally matches my complexion... It last all day.. This is all I have to say about the product bottom line it&#x27;s great buy it!!!</li>
    <li> Came right on time. No damage. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I got in the it mail and I it works. I going it for my sister wedding and it will work.</li>
    <li> Thought they will be small and ordered 2.. hahaha the best decision I took!! The product came sooner than I expected!!</li>
    <li> Love it! They go on smoothly and are pretty easy to blend out! I have only used the green, purple and yellow myself and a bit of the darker shades to contour.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, goes on nicely, easy to blend, lasts for hours, couldnt ask for more especially for such a low price</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ordered the Concealer Palette, I LOVE it! I would definately recommend this product! And for the price it is worth it.  Received it sooner then I expected also.</li>
    <li> It came by the date and i was surprise how small the palette is but it actually covers up my blemishes really good so i&#x27;m happy i purchased this.</li>
    <li> My order came in a week before estimated date.  So far so good, applys smoothly and easy to blend in.  So far used as a contour and highlight an I love they way it looks.  Although the dark colors show up lighter on skin still works for me.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even come to my house 😒😒</li>
    <li> Works well and is great quality! Good consistency and blends well. Perfect for&lt;br /&gt;my clients. I will definitely continue using this brand.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEE this pallet although it isn&#x27;t name brand the concelers are great their smooth and goes on just the way I expected . I use this everyday .</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Packaging is sleek and actual product has great pigmentation and consistency. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s  ok,  you can find multiple uses for it.I wouldn&#x27;t use for darker skins ( if not blended right with other products,  you will look ghostly). its to shiny as well :-( I had to use powder to tone the shine down.</li>
    <li> Let me first just say this concealer is so creamy and thick. It wirks wonderful,  instead of spending tons of money on expensive concealer please give this product a chance. Its worth it I loveee it:-)</li>
    <li> none of the colors are as seems. They are like children painting palettes...cheap! Seriously better to just pay the xtra $ and get mac</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very small, oily, but it was only $3 so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> THIS is an exellent concealer and highlighter for your eyes. also you can mix and match the color to match your tone !😍</li>
    <li> The pigmentation is not all there. The darker colors do show up better than the lighter ones, as the lighter ones all look to be the same white-ish color. You do have to warm up the palette a bit in order for the color to show up regardless of the tone. Overall, this is a very very basic palette. You&#x27;re not missing much if you don&#x27;t buy or if you do. Cheap in price and in quality. I would rather have splurged to get the BH cosmetics camoflauge palette.</li>
    <li> I love the different browns so that I could find the perfect color for contouring. The product is a creamy texture, blends well, really cute.</li>
    <li> Very good. Especially for the price you&#x27;re paying.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing I love it so much! It works so well and does exactly what I want it to do!</li>
    <li> i love this palette!! its creamy goes on smooth, and has great coverage</li>
    <li> very creamy, staying power isn&#x27;t amazing but good for the price</li>
    <li> Yesssssss i lovee thissss,this is perfect i had my doubts about it but its creamy,doesn&#x27;t smell weird. I just love it ♥</li>
    <li> just as described, I really like the product.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller then I expected</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t true to color, but it does the job:)</li>
    <li> Too sheer, not very bendable. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Last school year, Orchard Park High School put on an award winning show, the show was Les Miserables. We were presented the award by Shea&#x27;s, a theater in Buffalo, NY. I was lucky enough to be in this show. The make-up was everything from scruff and grime, whoreish caked on makeup and sophisticated elegance during the wedding. I can say this product lived up to the show, doesn&#x27;t come off with sweat, doesn&#x27;t stain costumes, easy application. Overall great product. Will need to buy more for Anything Goes in a week.</li>
    <li> 2 thumbs up.  Amazon sale $3.90 and free shipping.  I read the reviews but was not expecting much for that price. Yes, it took a while to come. But really $3.90.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.with all concealers and contouring makeup. Stays all day if you layer and set it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts all day if you layer. Big bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I would not pay full price $29.99 for this product. But worth more than $3.90.</li>
    <li> the concealers are great they camouflage imperfections. enjoying them on a daily basis</li>
    <li> Small pans hardly have Anya products</li>
    <li> does not work. its a waste of money. all colours come out the same. I have dark skin</li>
    <li> I just got it in the mail it came 4 weeks early (1 month) and there so creamy . A little small but its so worth the money , if your thinking of getting it , you should , I like it</li>
    <li> Enjoying my purchase so far. Only issue is the white has glitter in it. I&#x27;m not sure why a concealing product would feel the need to replace white with a glitter white. Again it is a good buy unless you need the white.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t  at all what I expected 😞😢</li>
    <li> Love it but it took forever to come</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend.  The first time, it never arrived though it showed as being delivered.  They refunded my money.  The second one was great and I think this is kind of an amazing product for the price.  ($3.79)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matte black finish on the outside looks and feels sleek and modern and she uses this almost every morning for work.  I can&#x27;t really speak toward the feel of the product on my face as I don&#x27;t use it, but this looks and feels in your hand like a higher value set of makeup.</li>
    <li> Hardly any product in the pots as all.  3 of mine were melted when I finally got it.  I&#x27;m in Atlanta and it hasn&#x27;t really been that hot yet.  I got this in early May simply mailed in a bubble envelope inside a thin, cardboard box.  There was a plastic sheet over the pots so it caught the melted product so it was not stuck to the top of the case.  The darker colors don&#x27;t seem to blend very well ... well, maybe they blend TOO well, because it disappears.  Anyway, I&#x27;m not blown away.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s amaizing I would buy it again it&#x27;s a very good product and excellent price. I was affraid of ordering with such a cheap price</li>
    <li> Great size for the price ... well worth it for the low price ... I will be buying another in the future.</li>
    <li> Good forma the price.</li>
    <li> This is great for medium skin tones. having all the choices allows me to cover up all the things I&#x27;d rather not show the world. after I use this then put on my foundation my skin looks great. I would recommend for everyone that has multiple skin issues to cover.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome  concealer pallet it offers great coverage and if u can even use it for contouring and highlighting which is a plus. im always experimenting with all concealers and this is a win and i will definitely look forward to getting another one.</li>
    <li> They are oily and I basically use only two colors to shape my face.</li>
    <li> You can beat the price! Works wonders if you know how to blend. Just take note that the lead time can be up to 3 weeks if your in the states. I just reorder mine in advance so I receive right when I need it !</li>
    <li> Good for costume or stage makeup, otherwise kinda of an odd oily feeling and smearability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very new to conturing the colors are great. I&#x27;m excited to try blending the shades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been finding it difficult to contour my face anymore lately and I bought this with full hopes and aspirations for this  to work and not make me break out. It&#x27;s very oily and kind of melts so keep it in a room temperature room like if your traveling and it might sit in a hot car on a hot day, it will most likely melt. This product is amazing. I came to buy it again, and decided to write a review☺️</li>
    <li> Does its job well! I love contouring and highlighting my face features. I have sensitive skin and I have yet to experience any breakout problems. It&#x27;s a cheap price, and great product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy never got the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this. I had high hopes dumb enough but I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s too waxy. It feels like a melted crayon and like I&#x27;m using play makeup for little girls. It helps to rub your finger onto it and warm it up but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I wish it was thicker like other concealer palette&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s just very thin and waxy. The pigment isn&#x27;t good either.</li>
    <li> This s*** never came in bunch a crap don&#x27;t purchase</li>
    <li> The product came all melted and out of the case.&lt;br /&gt;It has been difficult to return due to personal issues.&lt;br /&gt;PLM</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am charmed with it cover every blemish in my face, have a very soft texture</li>
    <li> AWESOME COVERAGE LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Creamy and Blendable. Comes in variety of colors for different types of skin tone. Perfect for contouring or using as a concealer.</li>
    <li> Color selection is great. Good coverage too. However, it creases realllyyy quickly... :(</li>
    <li> Greasier then I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re way too creamy and greasy. Colors are not true it&#x27;s darker on the top and as soon as you did your brush the color looks faded and light. But I guess you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something so cheap and low quality.</li>
    <li> Although this palette took a month to arrive, it was well worth the wait! Fifteen perfect concealer shades packaged in sturdy, sleek packaging, this product is an affordable necessity for every cosmetic aficionado. The product itself is light-weight, non-greasy, long-lasting, easy to apply and easy to blend. The color options are great and run the full range for all skin tones. Accidentally ordered two by &amp;#34;checking out&amp;#34; twice and am so glad that I made that mistake. Have purchased concealer products that cost 20x as much as a single shade in this palette that delivered only a fraction as well as this product. Very, very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I received it melted ! the packaging was bad... there is no brand or any details on the palette!&lt;br /&gt;the concealer is very oily and not covered any thing....this is cheap kids makeup !!!</li>
    <li> Very low price for decent quality. There are no surprises here. Easy to apply colors, great for contouring. The only issue with this product is that, sometimes, when you are ordering an item from another country, it can come surprisingly quickly, while others arrive at a snail&#x27;s pace. This item in particular, took quite some time to arrive, but it came before the estimated delivery time. I definitely plan on ordering again.</li>
    <li> This product is a good size and has nice packaging. It took a really long time to get here though so if you&#x27;re in a hurry to get this it&#x27;s probably not the purchase for you. As far as the product goes it&#x27;s okay. I tried to use it by just rubbing my finger on the different concealers but nothing really showed up pigmented or anything, just really oily. If you actually mix the product into a paste which can get messy it works a lot better. Overall for the price it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> This is horrible cheap oily stuff. I could not wear any of them at all with out my face looking oily and discolored wouldn&#x27;t purchase again!</li>
    <li> Works amazing? People said it was too small. It is not small at all. It is a normal palette size. Coverage is amazing</li>
    <li> I use it to conceal, purple to brighten, fill in my brows, contour,&amp; highlight!! I have acne prone skin and no breakout with this product</li>
    <li> I love the color selection but I wish the formula was better! These concealers have to be warmed up quite with your fingers before you can use them. They also are not very opaque so much product is needed if you want to conceal or contour.</li>
    <li> Great price for this nice little set!</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve tried all the high end ones and they&#x27;re good, but nothing compares to this one. I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!</li>
    <li> I wish I could leave the stars BLANK this product is so awful I used it once and it will be my last I have no problem sending this product back i want my money . ASAP thanks</li>
    <li> So it took over a month to get here but When it got here it was all broken up. So I had to basically  thow this away what a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Ya recibí el reembolso después de infinidades de reclamo. Por favor, un poco mas de cuidado en estos casos. Es desagradable pasar por esto. Gracias</li>
    <li> Came sooner than I thought it would, this one was for my mother.  How well does it work, well i ordered another one to see if it is awesome, the palette looks small but who cares?  For the price it is fantastic~I hope it works well with my skin, I shall make another when I get the other and use it myself, I also ordered the lipgloss set from the same ppl, it works extremely well.  The colors are true and they last.</li>
    <li> Came quicker than expected, blends nicely, dries nicely and not too oily, covers really well, and also has not bothered my skin or made me break out (which was my biggest worry because I have sensitive skin especially to cheap products) all in all I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 if I could:)</li>
    <li> Disappointed big time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a concealer palette to use for different makeup looks, but without having to spend namebrand prices. This palette works well so far. I haven&#x27;t used all the colors (since my skin is very light), but the darker ones work well for shading too. Very happy with this purchase. The highlighter is pretty cool too!</li>
    <li> the makeup felt sticky didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I really like this concealer! My daughters (18 &amp; 19) and I use it religiously. With moisturizer or a primer it goes on smoothly otherwise it might enhance your pores. I know this because I use a magnifying mirror because I&#x27;m blind otherwise! I&#x27;m fair skin toned and I use the darker colors to contour my cheeks and nose and blend and blend. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I will definitely be ordering it again, and soon because it takes some time to receive and we&#x27;re almost out :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this concealer Nov 10th 2014, I was thinking it&#x27;d be here Dec 24, 2014 like it said...but nope! Very upset that i couldnt wear it on christmas. Not a very good buy!!!</li>
    <li> Colors are very sheer. But I guess u get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Oily! These are just too oily and you would have to blend like crazy. Find another brand, manageable but if I had the choice again I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep away from heat. They melt! It was in my car and melted everywhere.</li>
    <li> Did not recieve my oder</li>
    <li> Best concealer ever and I love contouring with it. I&#x27;m ordering A few more due to the quality and price of the product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I received my palette today, November 13th, 2014- and Amazon&#x27;s estimate was November 20th, 2014. So, I received this earlier than expected! There was no damage or smudging as some people have said. The seller&#x27;s contacted me within the hour of me writing each time. The only issue I had was that Amazon said it had tracking, but never updated the tracking information, and when I went to track it with the number, I had no results. The sellers reassured me that the parcel was on it&#x27;s way. As for the product, the concealers go on my skin rather faint, so I did have to go back over with another layer or so. You will want to moisturize before this product, as you should with any makeup. I would also recommend using a beauty blender to blend it it. You can use this for contouring, but not so much for highlighting. The white shade that you see in the picture is shimmery, while the other colors are matte. So keep that in mind. The concealer does not have a strong smell. The darkest shade isn&#x27;t really as dark as it looks, because they concealer spreads thin as I said above. Over all, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this kit,it has colors from fair to medium/dark skin tines and has worked very well going on evenly each time I have used it, it is smooth and blends easily without leaving lines. Would buy again and recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I gave this item a four star because it took a long time to come in and I couldn&#x27;t track it. Besides that, I loved it. It was every thing a was looking for and more. The picture stays true to the actual colors. And for the price you couldn&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Good selection of colors for highlights and contours. I was expecting it to be bigger and last a little bit longer im already running low on my higlight color.</li>
    <li> its heavy concealer. great for pictures or everyday wear. love the many shades and even corrective shades. i love it.</li>
    <li> My first time trying this product and it worked for me in certain areas....I&#x27;m not use to using concealer so maybe I need to keep experiencing different products....but this one was okay for me.</li>
    <li> I dont recomend this product  I wanted it to highlight and in my opinion its not good</li>
    <li> hope you not in  a hurry get this it takes forever to ship but it is well worth it thanks</li>
    <li> This is something a little girl would play dress up with. I don&#x27;t understand how people say this works. It looks and feels like Barbie lipgloss my daughter has. It smells awful too!!!</li>
    <li> love it. buying another  one again soon .</li>
    <li> this product is greasy and shiny and slimey and stupid and it doesnt cover well and it makes me look sticky and not a good glowy</li>
    <li> I love it. It absolutely blend with my skin really well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty OK for the price</li>
    <li> I like this concealer palette but it did not provide me with shades dark enough to contour my whole face.  I was only able to fill in and highlight my eyebrows .</li>
    <li> It was a little to oily for me but good coverage plus it was for a great price point I would buy this again !</li>
    <li> This s*** is the best with contouring</li>
    <li> This product is definitely usable and pigmented. I like the consistency of the product. The product didn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but reapplying is not difficult. I say that it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love the pallet.  The price is right.  I ordered two of them. I will order again.  There are multiple colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal  and a lot cheaper than purchasing it in the stores. Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love this makeup</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive product! Beautiful muted colors that match any outfit! Inexpensive but superior product! Love Love Love</li>
    <li> Better then others I have tried and you literally can&#x27;t beat the price! It&#x27;s very creamy, blends well and stays on. Wish ther was more in each circle because it takes a month to get a new one from China!</li>
    <li> It works great I&#x27;ve never looked so good! (: I will be buying this again when I run out. I would recommend this to other as well!</li>
    <li> Very nice colors big compact fast shipping very happy</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I need to buy another !</li>
    <li> Ok item. You get what you pay for. Can&#x27;t expect a perfect item for $3 dollars! But it&#x27;s OK I guess.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier and in good condition. I used it for first time and i loved it!! The texture is soft and blendable.</li>
    <li> very crappy colors and go on like halloween paint. ugh</li>
    <li> I like the colors in it, it came sooner then expected, which is good. I don&#x27;t have any thing bad to say about it. I really like it, its good for a beginner</li>
    <li> Not overall thrilled with this product, but not bad for the price. I made a video review! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8RkhhrIapPA&amp;feature&#x3D;youtu.be</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I am using this case every day, the colors are just right for my skin.  I shall buy another once this one is empty.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected and not as pigmented as I would like but still good for minimal touchups.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it everyday. It&#x27;s not cakey and applies easily.</li>
    <li> I would enjoy it a lot more if it wasn&#x27;t melted and smeared all over the place.</li>
    <li> It took 20 days to arrive from China which I think is not too long. I was really excited for it and it finally arrived. I was afraid it would arrive melted because its been 90-100 degrees here in California. It arrived perfect, no colors were melted what-so-ever. There are other reviews where the item is melted but mines came perfect as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product comes in a cute black box that makes it look professional like make up. Anyways, on the box it comes inside of, there is a list of chemicals that are used, most of which are poisonous/deadly/cause cancer if the chemicals come into contact with humans in a daily basis so looks like I&#x27;ll be throwing it away. I love make up but I won&#x27;t be using any that are known to cause cancer.</li>
    <li> very poor quality of product. They all come out glossy with no color. Had no problem with seller or arrival time of the item.</li>
    <li> This compact seem used. The outside of the palette was soiled and marked even though it was in a box.</li>
    <li> Feels very heavy on skin and its extremely oily, doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes, redness etc. I guess you get what u pay for, I&#x27;d rather pay more &amp; continue going to Ulta for my concealer &amp; foundation.</li>
    <li> Though the packaging is cheap looking, the product is amazing. I have never used cream products I found them easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love the concealers it works well.  I will be ordering another pallet soon.</li>
    <li> Really really nice good texture and smooth finish</li>
    <li> Wish this was a little creamier, just a dry cream its a little hard to spread on .</li>
    <li> Pigment sucks I&#x27;m a light medium skin tone and it barley shows on my skin</li>
    <li> I do enjoy this product. It gives me that fresh look and very sharp. After a while from wearing it though I feel greasy and blotchy. Therefore I don&#x27;t really care for this product. Maybe I need other products to even this one out.</li>
    <li> I love it. And I received it early then the shipping date</li>
    <li> Ive always wanted this product im 13 and this plallet is soo small its not bog and its like hard to put on your fingers and can put it on your face right but i mean ill try it out</li>
    <li> pretty good concealer set has a little bit of a paint scent to it, just like most make up foundations. Need a primer before applying</li>
    <li> Makeup does not stay on the skin. All the colors do not match the human skin tone to well.</li>
    <li> Came way ahead of schedule. I bought this because I thought it was a &amp;#34;white label&amp;#34; dupe for the Morphe contour kit; it is MUCH smaller.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get in, but it&#x27;s really good! Great color payoff</li>
    <li> Great product excellent product for the price with an aray of shades that you can mix and match</li>
    <li> The pallette smells bad. I&#x27;m not sure if I got an old one.</li>
    <li> Also some of the colors aren&#x27;t blended so you get streaks of black when you use your brush. Cheap product, cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> product was very nice</li>
    <li> Love love love this makeup! It is great for contouring and concealing. Will def buy again. Shipped faster than I expected and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Small but worth what I paid</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors.  Great coverage and save use of my more expensive foundations.  works great as a base to eye shadow, rather than wearing off by noon, my eye shadow stays in place much much longer,  Worth the price</li>
    <li> I received this a little less than a month after ordering, and I have to say that I am very satisfied, especially for the price.  The consistency is very nice.  It&#x27;s smooth and I like it because it isn&#x27;t dry.  The colors are a lot more vibrant in person than they are in the picture, and they are very effective on my skin (I am somewhat fair but I have dark circles and some discoloration).  I recommend patting the concealer on your face rather than rubbing it in so it&#x27;ll look nice and blended.  I think this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because this product was so cheap. Not sure why, because it&#x27;s just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s perfect for contouring, and the coverage is just perfect. Yet, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s caked on either. I&#x27;ll be buying more once mine has run out.</li>
    <li> This product is oily, it cakes on your face, and it does not conceal anything.... Now, like I said in my previous reviews am new to the make up scene and not sure if that&#x27;s how all concealers are but I was not happy about it.  Also, the product had a strong smell plus the concealer palette was loose that it fell out and you could see the white glue trying to hold it together.</li>
    <li> I like it it looks good on my skin no breakage either</li>
    <li> I was really. Hoping this would be a good product but you get what you pay for the darker color has a little more color pay off but everything else in the pallet is basically Vaseline with tint. Wipes right off does not set with a powder. Shines thru foundation. Could be used as a highlighter but will cake and run off. Do not recommend. Definitely more of a child&#x27;s makeup than for adult or professionals.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive and in shipping I&#x27;m not sure if it got hot, or what happened, but it was separated. It had little blobs of oil on the top and the bottom was kind of dry. The colors look dark, but go on a much lighter. Its hard to get any on the brush,  so i have to use my fingers.  They do seem to blend ok and so far no breakouts. I love the concept of such a diverse palette for such a cheap price,  but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not so great. I had this in my bag in my car with me. It was 40 degrees out and we barely had the heat on and when i got he to put spme on it had melted all over.</li>
    <li> I am SO beyond upset at this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT order this... they ripped me off for the last time and will not respond back to me. They wont ACTUALLY send me the item I PAID for.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to have this before my wedding. I read the reviews, of course I knew it would take a long time to ship, which is why I ordered AHEAD of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been contacting the selling politely asking them what is going on. They will not respond.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this in NOVEMBER. And it is now going into April.&lt;br /&gt;They responded one time with a &amp;#34;we resend it, if you not get it in one week ill refund you&amp;#34; 2 months ago. Now they wont respond.&lt;br /&gt;STILL NOTHING. I have, and I will be writing them every day... and letting everyone know how they ripped me off until they refund me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just $5???!?!? I don&#x27;t have much money.... and to me it&#x27;s not just $5.... I&#x27;ve wasted months waiting on this item, I really wanted to try it out. And I am beyond disappointed. So much time wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always read the reviews and sometimes they are all so diff, I think how can 10 people rate them a 5 stars and then others a 1? Always curious if the product is good or not worth it.... let me tell you guys something, someone who rips people off... ITS NOT WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> Ehh, pretty cheap. Doesn&#x27;t cover well and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i love it its great for contour the colors are exactly whats on the picture i did get what i paid for im more then satisfied with the product n truely recommended</li>
    <li> Great product! It is perfect for face sculpting!</li>
    <li> Received my palatte today and when I opened up my package all the colors were melted together. Very disappointed. I was waiting over a month for this and now I can&#x27;t even use it!</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered the same thing at a more expensive price.  This took longer to deliver but was the same product and 1/3 the price.  Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Took about a month to arrive and honestly, kinda sucks.</li>
    <li> Super blend able and affordable great for beginners</li>
    <li> Melted during shipping, but its an OK cool concealer.</li>
    <li> It got here before the estimated time wich was AWESOME!!!! Because I&#x27;m so impatient. LET ME TELL YOU ALL THAT THE COLORS DO COME DARKER. I don&#x27;t recommend this for light skinned but more of a caramel color. But they are nice to my skin and they look great on my skin.Remember we all have different skin types of skin this for me is perfect. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> This is really nice. The case is nice too. Will make a great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Poor quality as i was expected. Cheap product from china.</li>
    <li> I feel so professional! I have no idea what I&#x27;m going to do with the other colors,but the pallet work great for my complexion</li>
    <li> Great item. It was what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Really love this to highlight and conceal. Deff going to purchase another one when this one runs out. I use the darker shades to contour and to fill in my brows. It does leave a shiny finish, so it&#x27;s best to use a powder finish over.</li>
    <li> AGAIN MY YOUNG DAUGHTER LIKES THESE COLORS.</li>
    <li> Great for price. Except, took too long to get here.</li>
    <li> not only does it have lots of shades for concealing but also has a highlighter.  Good deal!</li>
    <li> It came together so amazing , very sealed up. Nothing broken. Colors look amazing. They are cream, not power. They feel amazing on skin. Would deffinatly buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very good makeup the only problem I have is that I break out with this stuff since I usually tend to only use acne medicated foundation.</li>
    <li> For the price and how long it would take to get here i didn&#x27;t expect much but honestly the product was amazing!!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but the colors are very creamy and blendable.  Worth more than the $3!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, it works well if I mix it with products and use as a concealer/contour. Otherwise, it has a strange tone that might suit some people, but not my middle eastern skin tone. Makes a nice base, but only a substitute till I get something better.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because the price was so low. That&#x27;s exactly why I purchased this to begin with. I&#x27;m new to highlighting and contouring so, I didn&#x27;t want to sink a bunch of $$$ into a really expensive palette. I was so pleasantly surprised by how blendable these are. I&#x27;d recommend using a beauty blender sponge with this for best results. Though it works well with fingers too, the blender just looks more seamless.</li>
    <li> I love this palette because it&#x27;s good for highlighting and contouring as well as concealer. It blends really nicely into the skin and isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really like the formula they used its so watery. Packaging was great though! wish the product was a s good as the packaging.</li>
    <li> I thought this pallet was a powder pallet but I can make it work for the price I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day for contouring.  I use it on myself even though I actually bought it for high school theater productions.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price. It only took a month and a half for me to get it.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed!</li>
    <li> took forever to come in but for under $5 it&#x27;s really not bad, like I can&#x27;t complain. definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> good range of product, doesn&#x27;t last long.. not a lot of it to be honest. no wonder it&#x27;s so cheap haha. but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
    <li> They arrived when scheduled and they were creamy.... However, they smell awful and the green is already kind of dried out</li>
    <li> So many colors this is a great kit!!  This is a great starter kit for learning to contour and highlight.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when it was the 15 shade palette. I purchased this since it was a cheap, affordable price for a cosplay. The shades are great and smooth on really well... Make sure to soften it with your finger first by warming in up in a circular motion. I use this palette for contouring with a brush and it always leaves me with great results. Make sure to use it sparingly; a little goes a long way. I rarely ever use the pink, green, and white one though. They are used for covering up dark spots and red spots- if you&#x27;re mainly buying it for that I would spend your money else where because those three don&#x27;t blend well. The only con I found to this palette was that it is kind of oily and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for oil-based skin. It also is pretty heavy.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s made of lead paint. I&#x27;m terrified to use it.</li>
    <li> Great idea .... Just way too greasy.  It wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> I had already read most reviews before purchasing this product but felt the need to share mine as well. The creams are very smooth but don&#x27;t blend very well if you apply a shade that&#x27;s too dark. The consistency on my face was rather oily and moved around a bit too much for my taste. The highlighter is a TRANSLUCENT color with lots of sparkle. I liked this due to already being relatively fair skinned but was disappointed it&#x27;s already almost gone after only a handful of uses. This is really what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE HIS CONCEALER PALLET .. AWESOME .. MY SECOND ONE</li>
    <li> It was to small &amp; it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to br</li>
    <li> This product came all melted &amp; smeered. Not good &amp; cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned, so finding colours that work with my skin can be problematic. The darker colours work wonderfully for contouring, and the colour correcting green helps cover blemishes and red areas. I have naturally very pink skin, but I imagine the pink would work wonderfully for more yellow skin or if used to cover us dark shadows from stubble for drag makeup. The colours go on quite nicely, and work wonderfully for cream contouring and concealers. It&#x27;s also a great price for what you get, and I will certainly purchase another pallet when this one runs out. The only reason is does not receive 5 stars is that the lighter colours are a bit too sheer, and I have to use quite a bit to get them to show up.</li>
    <li> Really really good 👌 I really like it ! Im planning on getting another one!</li>
    <li> I loved this item and i believe i purchased one, then two. Now going for two more. I love it so much. I highly recommend. It is so creamy and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Good range in shades. It&#x27;s a liquidy kind of texture and not so easy to blend with a brush. I use my fingers and it looks just fine. It&#x27;s very much worth the price and I will probably buy it again when I run out</li>
    <li> does not blend well, looks cakey in daylight.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried i wouldn&#x27;t like this based on some cap reviews. It blends beautifully  and hides all my blemishes. Leaves skin silky smooth. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not stink. It isn&#x27;t like  face paint.</li>
    <li> smaller palette than expected, you get what you pay for sums it up.</li>
    <li> Amazing concealer. Shipped within a week and completely covers under eye circles. Great deal. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The product came when it was supposed to. I am a beginner with makeup so I don&#x27;t really know how good it is yet. It is not powder it&#x27;s a cream which I prefer. I would recommend this to a friend. Price was good as well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! A little goes along way..Great lil concealer...Great also for blending eyeshadow and blush..highlighting etc...you can mix with foundation or concealer as well...very creamy consistency...you can blend with fingers or with high quality brushes..Would purchase again...Very nice seller as well..</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the colors, it gives you many options for different looks. Also gives you colors for high-lighting. Would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> very oily but pigmented</li>
    <li> The product just arrived it took a long time to come . The product doesn&#x27;t do the job I guess i get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> The palette came earlier than I had expected. It&#x27;s very small but really good! I was kind of worried because many reviewed it as bad, not it&#x27;s not. If you need a concealing palette, get this one.</li>
    <li> If you have oily face avoid .. However this product is very creamy and it really does it&#x27;s job i use for contouring and highlighting  with the light cream .. The only thing i dislike is that its a very small pallette and contains not much of the product so if you wear make up alot or Are mua this product is not for you .. I rarley use and and im out of the hilghting product and i only had it for a few weeks .. But the price says it all</li>
    <li> Just some greasy cheapo makeup, as was expected. Just wanted to take a shot and see what I could get on the super-cheap! Bought it for $4 or whatever, took one look at it and I&#x27;ve been a little afraid to put it on my face. I think I tried a little bit of the darker makeup, and it didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin. Has the quality of CVS halloween makeup or something, so it&#x27;d probably be useful for that kind of thing primarily. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend putting it on your face every day.</li>
    <li> It is really great for what you pay. Arrived super fast. It works amazing as a base for eyeshadow. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but when this came through the mail, it was not only late but it had so many disgusting bubbles and I didn&#x27;t even bother using it.  It smelled funny, too.</li>
    <li> Great for its price..smaller then it looks...great for contouring!</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but nice 👌</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable, high quality product.  I didn&#x27;t expect much, and am very pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of basic foundation and camouflage to blend or try alone. Nice mixture of tones, handy sizes and wonderful pricing.</li>
    <li> I came early and are exactly what I expected. One of the colors melted unfortunately. But it was the white which had a lot of glitter in it anyways so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used it anyway. These are creams btw I know some pole didn&#x27;t think they would be.</li>
    <li> not to happy with the shades</li>
    <li> The color scheme is good but the only issue is the ease of application. You have to really dig your brush into the product to pick up color.</li>
    <li> There good im a makeup artist and it works great for contouring.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love it. I will be ordering it again!!!</li>
    <li> I received my makeup very fast. The colors range from light to dark. They&#x27;re very creamy. Great for people like me who are just beginning to play with more makeup.</li>
    <li> coverage is sheer and you have to build it which was bad for my oily skin</li>
    <li> Colors appear as shown. Smooth application, good pigmentation. Blends well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They are Exactly the same as the picture</li>
    <li> 100% recommended excellent product</li>
    <li> I think these are made from candle wax! The color doesn&#x27;t come off and you would have to dig some out with a spoon. Steer clear, this stuff sucks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. I&#x27;ve used on a couple of clients and it has looked phenomenal. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great buy for the price. None of the colors matched my medium skin tone well but it is great for covering dark marks and contouring. The product it small and would be great for travel.</li>
    <li> awesome product fast delivery</li>
    <li> works amazing.. Hint&#x3D; a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Good products for the money.</li>
    <li> Nice colors my girl was really happy</li>
    <li> Not the best more like kids makeup</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay not good not bad.</li>
    <li> wonderful colors to work with</li>
    <li> It covers up all my blemishes and it looks very natural on my skin. It also last for a long time!</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure it would have been awsome if it wasnt melted!</li>
    <li> Really great, has a great variety of colors. As a makeup artist, I definitely recommend this product. Very very useful.</li>
    <li> This has every color you need. The texture of this is amazing feels like silk when its on your face. I also used this to cover up tattoos and it did a great job. Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 and they are AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I purchase this concelar pallet in September 5,2014 and receive it on September 27 2014 of today, so as you can tell it did took awhile to get here but over all im glad I receive it knowing I was moving out the next couples days. The size of the concelar pallet is small but works perfect. I can fit it in my purse or makeup bag. The pigment as I swipe on my hand is pretty sheer but if you keep applying to it, it will most likely give you the medium cover dewy look. Other then that I glad it got here before the actually date. Over all I&#x27;m happy and love it&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price!  Makeup actuallyblends well, and stays put all day:)</li>
    <li> I was really happy with it, great Product :) this is something that I have been looking for for a while.</li>
    <li> The colors were A LOT lighter than pictured. I am a darker skin tone and none of the colors would work for me</li>
    <li> Product was poorly packaged without a protected cover and no application sponge brush. The  makeup was unappealing in looks and very scanty in volume. .  Concerned about the hygienic quality, the two ordered were discarded.</li>
    <li> I started using this to contour along with pressed powder. My coworkers and clients noticed a change in my appearance and complimented my skin. Well, I put on moisturizer then contoured with this and set with powder. You don&#x27;t need anything else. So fun!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin look so flawless. It makes my complexion look beautiful and feel very smooth. I look so much younger. I need to order more need to find out how to order the exact same thing please help.</li>
    <li> I really thought this was powder concelear not cream concelear so i was kindda disapointed but i have it already so might as well use it</li>
    <li> Too oily for my already oily skin. :/ but you get what you paid for and I bought this as a beginners kit for me to start off with something to contouring.</li>
    <li> I got mine in the winter in Minnesota so it came frozen and now it&#x27;s summer and I use it every now and then and I apply a cream to my face before using cause I have a bit oily skin but I have used this to contour.</li>
    <li> Hated it, poor pigmentation, the color came on much lighter, the consistency was not creamy at all. I guess you get what you pay for, but i figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> All purchases excellent</li>
    <li> Other than it being super small, it is actually perfect for me. The price is nice and it conceals my blemishes quite well. I had to do a little bit of research because I didn&#x27;t know what the green, white, and pink were suppose to be for but once I found out, I found the combination to be quite effective.</li>
    <li> Concealer isnt as dark as it appears in picture, but with a little mixing it truly does serve its purpose</li>
    <li> Very dry once i put it on it caked up and made my skin look flaky and very nasty. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Made my skin oily, very poor quality! after all you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this off tophatter for $15... im now mad that i could have gotten it way cheaper but whatever. I still like it and its defiantly worth it. It doesnt look cheap on me, but the packaging is a bit cheap. but it does its job. good buy whether its $5 or 15 i still think its worth it</li>
    <li> Excelent concelear good for profesional makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Even tho this is low price doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work ! You need to no how to use it so You can see the result ! I love thiss</li>
    <li> The concealer was too thin and oily and they dried out after a while. But you get what you pa</li>
    <li> i am a beginner in concealer so this was a good cheap option because it has the highlighters and different tones of concealer for my brown skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was definitely pleased with this product. Even though I am not skilled in applying makeup as of yet....I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> No instructions on how to use this product.</li>
    <li> Its AWESOME for contouring but I started to break out really bad after using it and had to stop.</li>
    <li> For those who asked me.. I finally recieved mine. YES.. all are cream.. not powder. Great assortment of shades.. but I was expecting it to be larger. But, still worth the small cost. My biggest dislike is the long wait.. but over all.. I am pleased!</li>
    <li> Is so creamy and the cover is good. For this price is perfect. A little small but is ok for me.</li>
    <li> This product is of standard quality definitely small but does the job for a quick contour....</li>
    <li> Perfect, got to me in 3 days. A lot of people are complaining that it&#x27;s cheap and streaks. Yes cheap but it works great for the price, also it won&#x27;t streak if you use the right brush. It also helps if you know how to use makeup. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t work well for me or blend too well so far....</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t cover my blemishes very well and was kind of flaky</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette ! Although I am giving it 4 stars due to the size.</li>
    <li> ITS TO LIGHT N HADE TO APPLY MORE THAN ONCE</li>
    <li> YOU HAVE TO SET IT WITH POWDER. ESPECIALLY FOR UNDER EYES.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still wonderful and i use it for concealing and contouring.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast. Came within a week.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Got this in the mail and melting. And try to swatch it almost all colors are same color! Not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> This pallet is great to cover some  face flaw and make a even tone skin. Help to cover under eyes dark circles and acne marcas .</li>
    <li> I was surprised to with this product. I wanted something to practice contouring, so I figure it would not be all that greatbdue to the cost. I was wrong I love it. The product is great.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for what you&#x27;re paying</li>
    <li> All the concealers are very hard to get out of the container...and it&#x27;s tricky when you apply. Hot really have to rub it in,  in order to blend properly. I felt like I was rubbing my skin off. Like it needs to be warm enough to be just pliable enough to use. The coverage is good though when you do get it on.</li>
    <li> I started liking it untill it made me break out :(</li>
    <li> I recieved my product Aug. 10 , and Ordered it Jul. 29 the expected delivery date was Aug 21 so that was a bonus. My product was securely wrapped and came in a black box with ingredients included. My product isnt melting or broken up like other reviews ive read. However the quality is a 4 out 10 . Its really greasy and lightly pigmented but its worth the 3$ i paid for.</li>
    <li> I tried a few colors until I found the best combination for my skin tone. It works really good. The pallet has a wide variety of colors to choose from, depending on your needs.</li>
    <li> Its small but its very lovely. Don&#x27;t get this if you use concealer a lot</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for and in this case it&#x27;s greasy non-pigmented garbage! Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money or time!! Absolutely horrible and smells awful too.</li>
    <li> Very nice, as described and quick delivery</li>
    <li> it was destroyed when it arrived</li>
    <li> I received the package todayi understand you can&#x27;t expect much for such a low price but come on. The package was not only broken the colors in the palette came in completely melted!</li>
    <li> This was a good concealer it has the dark redish brown that is good for covering up pimples, bruises or whatever, and the green that is good for covering up scars or whatever and your basic colors. This was an affordable concealer although, it ships rather slowly. The customer service representatives are very kind and quick to respond.</li>
    <li> The lighter color concealors are NOT very pigmented. They appear &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; on Medium to Darker tones. However, the darkest shade is very pigmented, and I use it to Contour.</li>
    <li> The colors change once you touch it. They get a bit darker.</li>
    <li> I love these! I ordered them for my sister, and she loves it a lot. They came in very professional and clean looking as well. I&#x27;m thinking of buying myself the same one, because they are so lovely.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this concealer it blends well , after i removed it my face felt smooth . Great product !! oh it also arrived early</li>
    <li> This is too oily and it doesnt cover a lot, its a very light coverage, well for me it is</li>
    <li> I love these concealors. They are shipped from china so u are expected to wait for a while before it arrives. My item arrived 2-3 weeks before expected. These concealors are very pigmented and creamy. I use these for dark circles, contour, highlight, and eyeshadow. Will probably order once I run out</li>
    <li> The quality of the concealer isn&#x27;t what I expected, it wasn&#x27;t a good consistency. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheap but at the end of the day it does the job</li>
    <li> For $3 I was not expecting much, but I was surprised with how good they were. The green shade is really good at counteracting all redness and the variety of contour shades are really good as well. Easy to blend, really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I find only one color works for me as a contour color. The darkest color in the palette is terrific, but the other darker shades have too much of an orange hue to them. So I only really use 2-3 of the colors, but the ones I do use I love! I was very excited to start using a contour method on my face, and since I&#x27;ve never done it before, it took me a few days to figure out the best way to apply it but now I have a perfect routine. I find it actually works best using just my fingers. I tried using a face sponge but didn&#x27;t like it as much. First let me say, I am not using this as a concealer or coverup, I&#x27;m using this solely for makeup contouring. So I apply my moisturizer first to a clean face and then use a tiny bit of my concealer (NARS All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation) all over my face. I then just dab the color I wish to use in this palette, on my finger and dab it gently on to my face. Because I don&#x27;t rub it in with my fingers and my face is already moisturized, it spreads nicely where I want it. I apply as much as needed and then rub a bit more moisturizer in my hands and gently dab/pat my hands on my face. I hate the look of chalky or caky skin so by doing it this way my face glows all day! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my new makeup. I really think dabbing this stuff on is the key to having it look perfect! Will buy again, just wish I could buy the colors I use the most, since the others are a waste. But for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I thought it would be bigger that what I got but I&#x27;m ok with it....though it looks like a sample case.</li>
    <li> It looks exactly like the picture, the feeling of the product is a bit oily and not very pigmented</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this on your bare face if you have sensative skin, this made me brake out alot</li>
    <li> Really oily. Doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> For the price, its what I expected.</li>
    <li> The pallet is awesome! Love it</li>
    <li> I really love this product; it really helps with highlighting and contouring and it actually makes my makeup look better. Have to practice a little more in finding the right shade for under the eyes; would like to find an affordable palette like this but it being foundations.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great. I wish it said it was a gel though. I wanted powder not gel. But can&#x27;t complain for the price! I&#x27;d buy again. I am running out and i only used it like twice and minimal.</li>
    <li> I suggest you buy 2 cuz it is so good you&#x27;re going to it a lot</li>
    <li> The palette is small. And the white color is actually a VERY shimmery silver.&lt;br /&gt;But you can still use a yellow for contouring.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy about receiving my package 2 weeks earlier than the expected delivery date was.</li>
    <li> This item is oily and greasy and smudges when you touch it and leaves your face looking nasty.</li>
    <li> Matches every skin tone and I can mix the colors for the perfect shade. Love, love, love!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and came on time. I use this pallet for contouring and concealing.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product because it seemed like good quality and it had decent reviews. I ordered this product in August, it has now been two months and I still haven&#x27;t received it. This makes me RATTLESNAKE MAD &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> I love this! Received it sooner than expected  and I love it!</li>
    <li> Still Waiting On The Product!!!</li>
    <li> Great product better than what I expected and the price was unbelievable just love it</li>
    <li> They are a lot smaller than expected! But for 3+ bucks what do you expect? I tried contouring and they are highly pigmented. They are creams, so if you are oil proned, avoid this product or use milk of magnesia on your face prior to absorb oils. It came right around when it said it would. Ice attached photos. It&#x27;s a little bigger than an iPhone 4 size. Will I order again? Possibly</li>
    <li> The product is cheap but so is the price</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Impressed with the quality especially for the price. And all the colors match any skin tone.</li>
    <li> The smell goes away people. Yes when you get this be prepared for a nasty chemical smell but it goes away in 7 days. Yes chemicals are in this and every other makeup out there unless you go more natural approach. The colors are wonderful. They seem dry at first but I warm up my concealer brush in my palm and that helps with smoothing it on. It would have scored higher if they could offer a larger size.</li>
    <li> ok product concealer dosnt really stay at all i ended up just using the darker colors as a bronzer.... product is very oily too</li>
    <li> I see all this good reviews on this product which make me think ive must of gotten a &amp;#34;bad palette&amp;#34; but i hated mines! Didnt even used it once! Just tryed it, it was really cheap/sticky left u with a yucky feeling in ur skin, just horrible went straight to the trash!</li>
    <li> Great make-up. Love the different shades. Only wish that it also came with a built in mirror &amp; some powder shades</li>
    <li> I am EXTREMELY unhappy. They also said my item was so called, &amp;#34;LOST&amp;#34; in shipment. Even if it was they should have contacted me! It&#x27;s been almost 2 months since I made the purchase! So, they refunded me my money, but I expressed to them that I wanted my item. In no way, did they try to find a solution for me. I have worked in sales/retail my whole life and I don&#x27;t know if I have ever experienced such dissatisfaction!</li>
    <li> They are a bit sheer, but the colors are amazing! Definitely using as a contour palette. I recommend MAC&#x27;s Prolong Wear Concealer if you&#x27;re searching for full coverage.</li>
    <li> Honestly in this case you get what you pay for. Not my fav because they crease but then again pretty much all concealers crease on me. The coverage is build able but you can get to a point where it gets cakey looking.</li>
    <li> Omg ! i was so excited !  it got here 2 weeks earlier than its delivery date :) it works great &amp; i lovee it♥ DEFINENTLY recommend Thank Youu Sooo Muchh ! :D</li>
    <li> This concealer are very helpful for my professional make up business they are solid and very nice I will buy more soon.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 2 because It is cheap I dint like the fact there&#x27;s no name so there is no telling where this came from. I def want to per chase bh cosmetic pallet so I can compare but it looks cheap and feels cheap. If that&#x27;s all you can afford then it&#x27;s ok for the time being but I would get a better pallet . My saying is always and has always been true . You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is very good and worth for money :-) good buy</li>
    <li> Only reason I give it four stars is because I thought it would be bigger, but I really don&#x27;t mind for the price. For my first concealer palette, I&#x27;m in love! Colors are very easy to match and it last all day. When I run out, I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing. Thank you!</li>
    <li> looks not bad, but I opened it and it smells not good, even don&#x27;t sure can I use it or no</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected but I still use it everyday. It&#x27;s pretty good quality for its price. I would suggest this to friends.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s fine. I ordered it by accident but what can I say. The palette seems a lot smaller, although it&#x27;s still a decent size, it just seemed bigger. It&#x27;s not bad, but yeah, it is a bit like children&#x27;s fake make up, but you can&#x27;t expect high quality for the price. It may work for some people, but not for me. It streaks a lot as well, still it&#x27;s not bad. It works pretty well. There weren&#x27;t many bad reviews, but It seems really odd seeing that many people seem to be over exaggerating, making the product sound better than it actually is. The concealer I already had works better than this.</li>
    <li> WHAT CAN I SAY, IT COST A FEW BUCKS SO I DIDN&#x27;T EXPECT MUCH. I PURCHASED THIS FOR THE DARK BROWN TONES BUT THE DARKEST ONE ACTUALLY LOOK GRAY WHEN APPLIED AND THE NEXT DARKEST IS MORE RED THAN ANYTHING. THE CONCEALER ITSELF IS GREASY AND DOESN&#x27;T REALLY BLEND WELL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT IT JUST TO PLAY AROUND WITH.</li>
    <li> omg i am inlove with this consealer pallete! i ordered on xmas and received it with in 2 weeks! way earlier than my expected derlivery date! love all the colors very pigmanted will be buying this item again!</li>
    <li> I needed dark colors to contour I bought this befor Christmas it came last week took a little long but maybe because the time if year anyway love it it&#x27;s creamy easy to blend and affordable love it I would defiantly recommend of  :)</li>
    <li> Perfect palette for the price! I found it small ,however, I used it to learn how to contour and as an on-the-go traveling addition to my make up essentials so it worked for me. I really enjoyed the variety of tones/colors and I feel it&#x27;s a great tool for anyone who wants to get their feet wet with contouring because you can experiment without investing too much into the unknown. The product quality is very good, fresh, creamy and with the variety of tones/colors you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price. If you think about how much you would pay separately for every color in this palette, you know it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Awesome for contouring</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this is a great product.  I like how smooth the application is. It arrived before expected and it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product back in January and when I saw the delivery dates, I freaked out! But the product arrived today in the mail so I was pleasantly surprised that I was receiving it so early. I felt like I was waiting forever, though. The purple concealer seems more violet than purple and the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; concealer looks suspiciously sky blue...I gave this product 4 stars because it was packaged nicely and I like how sleek the packaging is. It&#x27;s too bad there&#x27;s no mirror, though. I&#x27;ve yet to try the product [which is also why I gave 4 stars instead of 5] so hopefully the product works well.</li>
    <li> The pallet is not heavily pigmented but the shades are JUST what I need for my Makeup business! I work with a lot of different skin tones and I love the coverage the cream concealer gives! You never have to use a lot because it&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
    <li> It works well IF you will not be taking pictures, I like the variety of shades, and the shimmer is nice to apply as a base when using a silver eyeshadow. The packaging is simple, sturdy and clean, which is ideal for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could just dip my brush in the product but this really needs to be applied with the fingers to heat it up and get the product to slip well. It does have great coverage but 1 - It flashes back in photos, I find that I have to apple foundation directly where I applied the concealer and BLEND for the gods! 2 - It looks cakey after a couple of hours, almost as if it could flake off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and I can say that I like it, I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted but so far so good.</li>
    <li> perfecttttttttt!!!!!!  absolutely perfect!! HIGHLY recommend! thank you! will order soon . Just wish there was more!</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette it has all these different shades it perfect for of course concealing but also to contour and highlight your face and it&#x27;s also good for makeup artist I just love this palette I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it arrived on time and it looks super smooth and nice. I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> NEVER CAME IN THE MAIL. Don&#x27;t even waste your time.</li>
    <li> I bought it a year ago, it totally ruined my face, I got really big black bumps in my face. It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
    <li> Works well very affordable worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Liked the variety of colors, but was not what I expected at all. Had absolutely no coverage.</li>
    <li> Good, they are very small so it does not last long. Mine came a little melted but that was my fault for ordering makeup in the summer in AZ!</li>
    <li> Beautiful products and colors, great consistency. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Very decent concealer I use for my eyebrows and works great!</li>
    <li> Better than I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I. LOVE. THIS. PALETTE. It works for all of my drag looks as well as for everyday wear. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> made with oil or something pigment even the darkest one when applied was too light and had to add more n more of product to even see a color change. because of it being oiled based it will clog pores and cause you to break out in the area on which you apply it.</li>
    <li> Does everything you could possibly do, great for hiding spots or scars. Has so many uses to highlighting and bring out great features.</li>
    <li> I will leave a five  star as soon as it arrives</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, Good Quality, Good Price</li>
    <li> Horrible ! It&#x27;s taking forever I wanted it as a Xmas gift &amp; it&#x27;s been 2 weeks already  not happy at all</li>
    <li> the color awful...the pigmentation awful...the formula awful....the price ok...the packaging ok...overall dont buy this please and a beauty supply store or drugstore product will do more then this</li>
    <li> The colors are as shown but when you put them on, they are almost transparent, even the darker colors and I&#x27;m a red head so I have pretty pale skin.</li>
    <li> The colors are good but they seem a little light weight.</li>
    <li> At first I was kinda thrown off that they were like a gel, but I love this pallete, I need to buy another</li>
    <li> looooooove this product!  wish it would have lasted me longer but I WILL be purchasing another soon</li>
    <li> Ok, I accept the blame for being cheap. I knew I was getting something that cost just a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I want my money back! This took so long to get here! And on top of that its fake! It doesn&#x27;t give any color what so ever, it looks like lip tick instead I do not recommend it. Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t powder like I thought it would be.  I&#x27;m not sure why I thought that but I am happy with what I got</li>
    <li> Very poor quality and not very pigmented.</li>
    <li> this is great for the price and contouring but if you have greasy skin like i do i wouldnt reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Awful. Please don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> This is a good set of cream colors for coverup and contouring. My only problem is they are a little dried out or just not creamy enough. Have to use oil with them or they are very hard to apply. But the colors are great for neutralizing sallow or ruddy complexions, contouring and highlighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very inexpensive and came sooner than expected. Just a little dry, or they would&#x27;ve gotten five stars.</li>
    <li> Shipping takes forever...I&#x27;d actually forgotten about ordering this by the time I received it! The feel of this make up is really oily and slimy feeling. I did not like them at all and gave them away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s a little bit in there I was expecting it to be a lot bigger there so tiny</li>
    <li> I did not check the size of the product.It is a little small , but still, I liked it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! i am brown skinned so the darker shade worked perfectly on my face it created the perfect bronze look i was looking for. The only mad thing about it is that its a bit greasy and finished quickly but overall verrrry good product will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I did break out where I applied the darkest shade for contouring and it is really greasy but for the price it contours perfectly. Just pooowwder up after! (And wash it off every night!)</li>
    <li> Use these all the time for my brows except the purple and silver</li>
    <li> As someone who highlights &amp; contours their face for daily makeup this pallet comes in handy. It wasn&#x27;t expected to get to me until Dec. 23 at the earliest &amp; Jan. 8 at the latest. It arrived on Dec. 12. So shipping is much faster than I expected. 😀 also I&#x27;m in love with the packaging, the pallet arrived clean &amp; damage free. I love the creaminess of the colors, I would definitely say this product is comparable to higher end products such as MAC. This pallet will definitely work for a wide range of skin tones. I love the corrector colors, I love the coverage. Ugh! I could go on &amp; on! 👍👌✋</li>
    <li> good product looks exactly what you get it lasts forever</li>
    <li> i love this. it took awhile to come in  but worth the wait. the price was really too.</li>
    <li> This applies so smoothly to my skin and contours so well. It took a while to get here but that didn&#x27;t bother me. It came A LOT sooner than the estimated date (it came 4 weeks early). I recommend!</li>
    <li> oily made me breakout wasnt good quality</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. She has purchased 2 of these in the past year and Im sure she will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Got the item fast. I use it daily. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Good deal, arrived a bit faster than expected. Nice colors.</li>
    <li> I liked it , it works really nice I just wish it came with a brush or sponge.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> The darker tones have a lot of red pigment</li>
    <li> Mine came a little melted but they are creamy amd still havent used but will and if this works ok ill buy again, took about 3.5 weeks</li>
    <li> Very nice variety of concealer.shades of skin colors you can blend to fit your shade. Always blend to a slight lighter shade then layer powder foundation and blend with your brush. It took a long time for shipping but it&#x27;s international shipping.  So it&#x27;s a winner if you can wait a while so order ahead of time. And you will be pleasantly surprise. Your case is a great size and in a plain black case. Just perfect and inexpensive. I have slightly sensitive skin and had no adverse reaction to the concealer on my skin. This is for any skin type and color. 5 star</li>
    <li> Because it makes my face feel good its a very good product thank you..for giving that opportunity to me. And the others.</li>
    <li> They are good! You get what you pay for and I like the variety that it comes with. Mine broke way to easily though! Maybe I didnt care for it enough but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much! I would recommend this for beginners :)</li>
    <li> I use this for contouring and for theater makeup. It&#x27;s perfect with matte foundation. If you want to learn how to highlight and contour with makeup, this is right to buy. A little oily, but use with a matte makeup or matte finishing spray and it works the same.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and more. Makeup goes on smooth and blends well, and you can&#x27;t beat it with the price!</li>
    <li> This is like a concealer dream. They come with a variety of shades so everyone. I would highly recommend these! Especially for someone like me who has just recently been introduced to the concept of &amp;#34;concealer&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This Concealer pallet is small and cute it&#x27;s not name brand...it&#x27;s small and light....the Concealer does not cover dark spots it&#x27;s kinda oily and slides off...... I only would suggest using this to define your eyebrows..</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this concealer palate. PERFECT is the only word to describe this product.  Again it just took so long to get to me. It was almost a month and I needed it several times over. But the packaging was sleek and nice. Great packaging and every color concealer was in the palate for me to use dependiing on what makeup I chooose. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> This was alright it works it&#x27;s pretty hits bad parts on face cheap love it buy it it&#x27;s good yay</li>
    <li> it so oily and takes forever for it to color your skin . for people who liked it im not sure how you guys worked it but it terrible i wouldnt buy it</li>
    <li> Good coverage and all are easily blended. I love the variety of all the colors, easy to highlight and contour. Does seem a bit oily but overall good.</li>
    <li> well its $5 so dont expect it to be the best palette ever.&lt;br /&gt;its kinda oily and you hit the pan after almost 7 uses</li>
    <li> I received my product way earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Kudos to the company for that, however: I also received the WRONG product. Instead of getting the 15 concealer palette I was hoping for, I instead received a tiny 12 concealer palette. To make matters worse, the concealer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-had black bits of what appears to be chipped plastic all over it (yes, on top of and IN the concealer)&lt;br /&gt;-packaging was bad in the sense that the palette never closes. Will not be able to take it with me for travel (which is why I bought it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIP IT!</li>
    <li> I was becoming sooo inpatient after waiting a whole month for my order but it finally came and looks exactly like the picture, haven&#x27;t tried it out on my face yet but it feels creamy and the colors are true I can&#x27;t wait to high light and contour, thanks for your service</li>
    <li> The color look great. I bought this for my niece who like makeup. She likes it a lot. Though I wish it were bigger. Its gonnna run out real quick.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve finally master how to blend in the colors i need to achieve the concealer color i want without looking ghostly. they take well when using a primer and they dont appear chalky under my foundation, which is powder based. I&#x27;m AA and I have sensitive skin and the product doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, the easiest way for me to rinse all the product off of my skin is to use St. Ives scrub (tea tree) ...it takes it off beautifully, i tried using my basic soap but it almost had a melted crayon feel as i was washing my face...no bueno, other than that, the product is nice, very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> The yellow concealer is amazing! And the brown ones are perfect to contour the face, very recommended and too ship.</li>
    <li> Concealers were too orange for my skin type and the dark concealer was way too dark for me. Or maybe I am mixing colors wrong?</li>
    <li> I love it and when I run out I will order some more it not messy and it holds all day</li>
    <li> Its great. My daughter use the make up more than me she love it also. I am soooo glad I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to get this , and there is not very much of it.</li>
    <li> Although I have not used it yet, I find to love it since it was a good deal and very functional!</li>
    <li> I just love this. Ouse it every day. It does a good job of covering marks on my skin, and it is so easy to put on.</li>
    <li> The shades are good for contouring, but I found them to be too thin and left my skin feeling too oily. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this usually causes a break out. I think it&#x27;s best to buy a higher quality contouring kit.</li>
    <li> After seeing many women getting this palette on youtube I decided to take the risk and get one too. I&#x27;d say its okay. I&#x27;m african american and would say that this product would probably be best for lighter skinned women. I do use some of the lighter tons for highlighting. I don&#x27;t use the darkest color for contouring because it doesn&#x27;t really show up on my skin and I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m dark skinned but I am darker.</li>
    <li> I was so worried thewy would be melted being in texas, but noipe!! it came in perfect condition and SUPER fast. im so happy with this concealer! works wonders with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t &#x27;received..it !!!!</li>
    <li> I read on here that the concealer came off a bit clear and that the flesh tones were kind of off, but i was actually happy with the product. The colours were good and the palette fit perfectly in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors to use daily.</li>
    <li> smaller than the picture .this item took one month to receive i haven&#x27;&#x27;t tried the colors on me but i do like it so far i will give a update soon</li>
    <li> The colors in the picture do not look like what I received veryy dissapointing. I know ot was cheap but please use a photo that is relivant to what the product actually looks like</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not like me and don&#x27;t have acne scars then this review may be misleading. I have darkish acne scars that I try and cover so I decided to try a palette with multiple different colors. The size of this palette is perfect, it&#x27;s a handheld palette that fits very nicely in the hand. I applied this product to my skin with my regular concealer brush and it just didn&#x27;t seem to cover anything, at all. It just made my skin a very odd sparkly tone. I like the variety of colors but it just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me nor my acne scars. Also the colors are very close to each other so my stippling brush was getting into multiple colors at once, I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I finish my morphs brushes concealer palette and I thought this would be the same but is not , this is horrible it doesn&#x27;t have coverage at all the consistency is super greasy it almost feels like lip gloss and the palette is really small&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this</li>
    <li> wish i would have found this years ago. everyone is asking and telling me &amp;#34;who did your make up you look so good..... i tell everyone to get this, it should be a must have product....</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I like that it&#x27;s light and creamy so it does not feel too heavy on my face. I could use a few lighter shades (the lightest was still darker than my friend&#x27;s skin) but otherwise, it was perfect for contouring myself. The green color works wonders, and really reduced the redness of my nose. Overall, I really like the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> goes on smooth covers well blends well</li>
    <li> Much rathered bought at store instead of the waiting 2 months. It is a great price but not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This concealer works very well for me. I use several shades to even out my skin tone and some of the darker shades for contouring. The makeup itself is very creamy and blends really well. The pallet it comes in is hard plastic and seems very sturdy. It&#x27;s a great buy and I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! Very pigmented</li>
    <li> I like it small but I it&#x27;s still works great</li>
    <li> I bought this for me, but all the colors ended up being waaayy too light for me. So, I gave it to my friend who is as pale as a ghost and it worked wonders for her. It stays on for quite a while and if you use primer or oil, it stays on even longer. The eye shadow is oil based, so if you are wearing light colors be careful. You can also use your fingers to apply or designate a brush for your oil based eye shadows because it does sort of mess up the bristles.</li>
    <li> This is okay but not great. I really can&#x27;t use it. I have to try Nars</li>
    <li> I just believe its smalller once you get it. And its too oily but i still like it for some everyday highlighting.</li>
    <li> Yes just as advertised</li>
    <li> Its super waxy , not really pigmented doesn&#x27;t hide any blemishes. I mean I get the point for the price it was a nice try but to get a more visual point its like putting candle wax with baby oil mixed together on your face.</li>
    <li> I was just expecting it to be bigger. Its kinda too creamy and heavy on the face when you apply it. Other wise its ok coz it wasnt that expensive. reasonable for the price.</li>
    <li> great price. works perfectly and very easy to apply and blend</li>
    <li> This gives me life full coverage only thing I will say is it has a red undertone in the darker colors not very ideal for women of color or men but in all a good product :)</li>
    <li> Just received this. This set is smaller than I expected but the quality of the makeup is very good. Good for concealer and contour as well. I will use it for both.</li>
    <li> Yes for the price is great.but the product has more oil than pigment .I actually took the colors out and am using the compact for all of my refill cosmetics. The compacts for the refill cosmetics are kind if pricey.so I got good use out if the packaging anyways.</li>
    <li> It was good but too shimmery.</li>
    <li> This is the second time ordering this product and I must say I love it!! I couldn&#x27;t pass up on this price and the quality is actually much more than I expected.. My mom and sister both loved it so I&#x27;ll be ordering extras for them as well :)</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, fun for experimenting with contour &amp; highlight but not for daily coverage.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I need. Full coverage! I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for oily skin though. It is a rich creme base. #flawless</li>
    <li> Thanks for the product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Got this item pretty fast and I like it very much. Thank you</li>
    <li> I dont use all the shades but they work great and for the price , its surely good</li>
    <li> I love this tray.  It&#x27;s a really good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Not good for darker skin tones. The not as pigment as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> ok so&lt;br /&gt; i  just received my makeup today&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;okay so since its Friday night and wanted to use it so i did&lt;br /&gt;when I finishing my makeup no longer than 5 minutes later  my fase started feeling  itchy  and burning  sensation. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend  this .&lt;br /&gt;I guess  in this case  you get what you paid for! !</li>
    <li> This is cool. A little greasier than I had hoped. ALSO TOOK FOOOREEVER to get to me. Almost 2 months. But good for the price</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time ordering :)</li>
    <li> Product is poor quality. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pretty small but works great</li>
    <li> I like this product. Reordered this product and never received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> Love my concealer ! I add more glow to my make up</li>
    <li> Though it is a smaller pallette than what is shown in the picture, you can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality of the product. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping hate not having tracking info</li>
    <li> Super oily, smells disgusting, &amp; looks like halloween make-up or play make-up. Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> The first kit I got was nice I ordered another and it was crap. Won&#x27;t take my chances on a third.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these, they are amazing, and the products look really natural, depending on how much you use, of course.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it a lot and would buy it again. You can&#x27;t get this price anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Love it... a must try for the price !!!</li>
    <li> awesome! toobad i dont know how to use the full pallette</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! When I first got the concealer, it came in a little silver bag with a black box, came almost  month earlier than was said to be delivered! Bought two, one for me and ine for my sister, the actual box to the product has a really strong plastic like smell. Other than that, this is a great product and I love using it for special occasions. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> ongratulate all the logistics that have to make the product arrives on time and in good condition, the correction is for my daughter tells me that despite not having a globally recognized brand, is of very good quality, wide coverage imperfections, dark circles, now the test will take courses in makeup</li>
    <li> Really good! Good quality and good price</li>
    <li> It has a dry texture, gets into small creases under my eyes and stays there.</li>
    <li> Great in a pickle. I&#x27;m a drag queen and I buy this to have a round just in case I forget anything. I wouldn&#x27;t do an entire face with this, but, like I said, if I forget a certain makeup at home this palate will cover for it.</li>
    <li> I was going to give this palette two stars because I don&#x27;t like the word hate.  But....I didn&#x27;t like it for two reasons. One is that the pigment is very transparent. It isn&#x27;t a rich creamy formula. Also, I used one color about 3 times and I can see the bottom of the palette. No Bueno! The old saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; definitely applies in this case. It also took really long to arrive.</li>
    <li> They are verry oily. So instead i use them as nude lip balm! :) not bad. I enjoy them.</li>
    <li> These concealers were surprisingly great and did a great job of color correcting. The only downfall is that the dishes shown aren&#x27;t very deep so they do finish quickly; however, for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain. For those of you who take their make-up on the go between school, gym, work, etc. be warned: it easily melts in heat so be careful! Overall, would recommend to those who want decent concealer for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super creamy and very pretty</li>
    <li> The texture of the concealer has a creamy feel and is very good for covering blemished areas. I mainly used it for covering the dark spots under my eyes and for contouring my face. It lasts through the day and makes your face look awesome. The only thing that I wish was different was the size of the concealer. The size of each color is about the size of a quarter or a little bigger, will need to buy another soon.</li>
    <li> I love this palette !  I could never have found such a wonderful palette like this one in the USA for this price.&lt;br /&gt;The colors blend nicely and look flawless. Very creamy .... I am so impressed.&lt;br /&gt;This should last for quite awhile but when it does need replacing, I will gladly order again.</li>
    <li> This product is not very good to be a concealer.  It does not come off the color that is on the palette and conceals nothing!  All the colors seem to come off a white ashy color.</li>
    <li> This makeup works good to cover up my acne and after u use it for a week or so it starts to improve how smooth ur face feels and it makes ur skin clear up.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette, soft creamy and variety of colors for everyone. Very nice price also....I recommend it!!!! Hurry get one :)</li>
    <li> Very small palette, the product is super oily, it reminds me of one of the kids makeup set from when I was 7, I think we&#x27;re better off with wasting a couple more bucks for a better actual &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; palette.</li>
    <li> Not actually what I thought they would be, But they came in as expected. I thought this would be a concealer but more as a mineral based color</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. Coverage was good when I would contour my face but when I would put on pressed powder for a matte finish it would flake off</li>
    <li> Although my first order was lost in delivery. When i contacted the seller out of concern, he responded quickly and corrected the error by sending me another concealer palette and i received it in two days. Awesome customer service. And the palette itself os ok not the best quality. But good enough for the price needless to say i will continue to use it for daily use. Not for professional use.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I use it almost every day it looks and feels great. No problems yet. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greats I use all the time when I go out just started wearing make up so I didn&#x27;t really kno what I was doin but it comes on great wash off easy and didn&#x27;t make my face itch or breakout</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this concealer because it was wayy too oily to even be considered a concealer especially for people with skin that is already oily such as mine.</li>
    <li> I personally did not like this product.  The concealer was very oily. At first glance I thought it was a lipstick pallet.</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome pack of concealers I have seen in a long time.  I will recommend this to my friends and family</li>
    <li> The size is smaller than i thought but. Its a good product.</li>
    <li> I still did not get this Concealer Platte it&#x27;s been at this 3 weeks now!!  I&#x27;m upset because this is what I really wanted first before my nyx jumbo eye pencil</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s very small and compact. It&#x27;s not the best thing in the world, but for what it&#x27;s worth, it works great. I would recommend this for beginners use since it&#x27;s very light and rubs off if you aren&#x27;t using the right applicator. It doesn&#x27;t give a strong look, which is great for learning how to contour. I do wish the pink and blue concealer did more coverage for under the eye bags. It gives a very light coverage. But it works!</li>
    <li> Great buy for makeup Guru&#x27;s, Really surprised at quality- planning to purchase again as I am running low</li>
    <li> This pallet is the best !!!!! Its has all the shades I need and it blends well.</li>
    <li> I wish I can rate it a Zero! Im so sad &amp; mad that My Pallete Melted &amp; Literally Have NO colors.. Its everything is like melted &amp; its just a pan tray. Im so dissapointed I was really excited to use it.</li>
    <li> This concealer is very smooth and creamy which is good. my only problem is the really brown colors change color once you put them on your skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased these concealers. They work very good and are so smooth when you put them on and not hard like other concealer I have tried. I would repurchase again.</li>
    <li> Perfect colors. .perfect texture...light and smooth.completely bendable</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received the palette. The makeup had melted and it was a mess.</li>
    <li> Well, first off  I was a little surprised at how small the dishes were. About the size of a quarter? Maybe a tad larger? Not necessarily a bad thing considering how there&#x27;s not a tight seal on the casing, so you run out before it dries out. But I LOVE how creamy the consistency is! I just bought a similar palette from a competing brand, and was expecting something closer to this formula than what I had received, so I&#x27;m happier with this one. shipping was very slow, but I still received it 2 days prior to the estimated date of arrival</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my wife. As a man I know nothing about this things but my wife said me to write review here because &amp;#34;it is a best thing what she has&amp;#34;. )) So i giving a five stars.</li>
    <li> TooK awhile to get here colors are not as dark as picture kind of hard to contour when the darkest is your skin tone but you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> So great for blending and for many skin tones. Definitely a must have for all you beauty gurus! Love it</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few palettes in the past (from other sellers) and never had an issue until this recent one that I received. The colors have a noticeable red tone and I pretty much have no use for this palette. All the colors are the same color, nothing like the picture shown. Not useful for contouring.</li>
    <li> It really is a great product and blends in very smoothly. A little oily, but for me having dry skin, it worked out. It did take over 2 weeks to get but, that is to be expected when it&#x27;s coming from Japan. Overall, pretty decent product</li>
    <li> Not bad for what I paid for it.found some tutorials online to guide me, all in all, I was pleased</li>
    <li> You can experiment witht the different colors to create different looks depending on the colors you are wearing.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the pallette.</li>
    <li> This concealr is the worst which I have evrr purchased. As a woman of colour it does nothing for my face ot dont even cover up some of my datk spots which from acne scaring. My recommedation is this is a complet waste of money.</li>
    <li> This concealer palette works wonders. The colors are very glowing. They aren&#x27;t too pasty for your face. As a makeup artist it&#x27;s always hard finding a palette to match all types of skin tones and this hasn&#x27;t failed me. It&#x27;s great for color corrections and contouring</li>
    <li> I love it! The makeup is super smooth. Took a while to get here, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday I wish I had ordered to I use the browns, and tans a lot my clients love it . makes my eye brows look amazing</li>
    <li> This is worth what I paid for it. I wouldnt pay more then 5 dollars all in. Its a creme based concealer set that has good pigment but is oily and wipes off easily. It works great for contouring (I&#x27;m really pale) But as far as coverage I wouldnt hold my breath. Professional? eh.. thats debatable</li>
    <li> I just received this 2 minutes ago. It came 3 hours early, I like the case and boxing it came in. It doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap! I will update the quality when I try it!</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a BARGAIN! Blends easily, nice coverage and doesn&#x27;t settle into lines.  Better than most of the high dollar concealers I have purchased over the years.  I will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> The palette is great. I was truly under the impression that it was bigger but it&#x27;s okay, Ill just have to purchase another one a lot more sooner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product for cheap</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s okay but I find that it&#x27;s not as creamy of a texture as I&#x27;d like. I have to mix it with another concealer to spread under my eyes because I find it too dry. The highlighter is good for above the cheeks, it&#x27;s not too shiny. I have medium skin tone and use the darker colors as a contour/bronzer for my nose &amp; cheeks. I also use the darkest color to outline my eyebrows. Overall it&#x27;s a good deal if you&#x27;re looking for something inexpensive, which I was.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really oily and thick. Also it looks shiny under powder and cakey. Good For spots but not if u want to cover ur whole face coverage is ok</li>
    <li> I only use when I have to go to school, but if I have a really long day ahead of me I use my other one because its thicker and it holds longer now if you need a concealer that is light I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> After two sparing applications, two colors are almost empty. There is very little product in each color, making me think they are sample sizes.</li>
    <li> The texture leaves a lot to be desired, but it serves the purpose.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat this for the price! I can&#x27;t find anything comparable. Good variety of colors and decent amount of product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my older daughe. She loves makeup so the just added this. To her collection.</li>
    <li> This palette is perfect for contouring your face. I has all the colors that you would need and you can mix the colors to get the correct shade for your skin color!</li>
    <li> This is my new best friend!</li>
    <li> There are so many choices to choose from easy to apply, if you need to mix two different colors works well</li>
    <li> This is my first concealer palette and I&#x27;m in love with it!!! It&#x27;s cheaper than the others but it works the same</li>
    <li> you get what you paid for. very oily and doesn&#x27;t cover up anything. maybe this would look for people who have very light skin, i have asian skin -- very tan and none of these colors work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 15 color cream set and a 6 color powder set just to see the difference. Each came quickly and the colors are as expected.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the cream set, there is hardly any product for each color and they blend out to nothing. I can definitely feel it on my face, But can&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is easier to use for building that contour. And there is much more product actually in it.</li>
    <li> VERY CREAMY I WORK AT SEPHORA AND I BOUGHT THIS TO TRY FOR COSTUME MAKEUP BUT WORKS SO WELL I USE ON MYSELF</li>
    <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because it was cheap (to purchase) and my girlfriend and her sister both loved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. The casing broke after just opening it from the package. But the product itself was good.</li>
    <li> I super super love this concealer palette highly recommended and the shipping was so fast which is good😆 2thumbs up👍👍 I will order em again😄</li>
    <li> This make up caused me to have serious breakouts. You get what you pay for. I guess. I&#x27;m going to try anastasia next</li>
    <li> Doesnt come with info on how to use</li>
    <li> The consistency of the concealer is very blendable. The colours have a lot of potential but for me it doesn&#x27;t have enough coverage. I have a nyx concealer and I thought this would be better but after a few hours my flaws are visible. Not cool.</li>
    <li> Blah!!...its good for backup I guess. Not really for women of color..</li>
    <li> I love it ! It was amazing !</li>
    <li> constantly buy and use! wish it had more product ):</li>
    <li> Was so excited to received this pallete and never ended up getting anything in the mail.</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money. These are no different than the pretend makeupyou buy for your kids. extra creamy, extra oily, &amp; have no room for blending. you either cake it on or wipe it off- NO IN BETWEEN. I have only done swatches on my arm so far &amp; after this experience, I wouldn&#x27;t DARE put it on my face. Just a disaster waiting to happen. I&#x27;ll probably end up giving this to a young family member to play with or keep it around for Halloween. Other than that, this is trash.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this using it for a cheap contour color. She says its a cheap alternative to her expensive Mac stuff she has purchased. But, doesn&#x27;t use it every day. Just once awhile for work.</li>
    <li> This makeup palette looks ok, but its a no-name product so you get what you pay, you better find a brand name to be sure it won&#x27;t harm your skin.</li>
    <li> Feels a little oily for my skin type. I have oily skin already and its just 2 much shine for me. Plus it doesn&#x27;t conceal blemishes that well.  Personally , I just don&#x27;t like it!</li>
    <li> My esthetics teacher even purchased this one for her own personal use. This is great to figure out how to use and what skin tones need what.</li>
    <li> too creamy for me not recommended for oily skin</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, it works very well with all colors of skin! I love it! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> If you have the right make up brush and supplies to apply this it works great</li>
    <li> This is a very good concealer. I even use the darker tones to contour. I&#x27;m just not sure what the sparkly/clear one is used for? Anyway, it&#x27;s a great concealer for a great price. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Conceal your pimples in no time! if you&#x27;re attending a  special occasion and you don;t want others to see your pimple stricken face, this product is a BIG help!</li>
    <li> never owned much make-up, but this caught my eye and came in just as it was shown online. no damage.</li>
    <li> These concealers concern me a little because of their oily constancy and the smell, I&#x27;m a little hesitant to see what they could do to my skin, but if you are looking for something to add a dewey finish with contour and highlighting, not necessarily and under eye concealer, Its a decent buy for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oiliness does add a nice sheen to the cheek bones when used for highlighting, but I imagine it would crease really badly or just not stay put. The color payoff it pretty decent, good pigmentation and and wide range of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $5 I cant complain, even if it gets used once a month, its a handy palette to have.</li>
    <li> Ive wanted to learn how to contour so I decided to practice with this.. Im NOT an expert on which palette is the correct one but thats what experimenting is for right? Anyway, It came in the mail 2 weeks after ordering it which was cool and with learning how to contour with it, the palette is pretty cool.. i see the difference and ive been getting compliments so I must be doing something right.. Being that I have sensitive skin, my face didnt break out which was actually surprising..  The reason why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because the picture makes the product looks large and its not.. but with that price, i think its pretty cool...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering again..</li>
    <li> Nice but very small in size, it works great, very rich and creamy. Just close to a quarter USA Coin. .25.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too dry for my skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tiny, purse size. I think it will work fine for what I am looking for, the right color for dark areas on my face.</li>
    <li> I have this pallete and I only use for my eyebrows to clean up. I use this sometimes to cover my small freckles.  Reading the reviews, some of them say they use it for contouring, I&#x27;ve never try that. So I am going to try it:) the white, green and purple I just don&#x27;t know how to use them or what those colors for.  Knowing that the green color is for redness, now I am going to try them as well. We&#x27;ll see if it works...</li>
    <li> I feel greatly mislead probably because of my own stupidity but I thought it would be powder not whatever this is. And I hate it and I wish I never brought it.</li>
    <li> This 15 Concealer Palette is fantastic. The quality of the concealers is very similar to high end concealers.  Would recommend this to anybody!</li>
    <li> This is my 1st concealer palette so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one.  This is great for the price you pay and I love all the color options for highlighting, contouring and concealing.</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price. I am very dry so the oily texture of this concealer works well with my skin. As long as i set it with a powder it does not crease, but if i am not very hydrated before i apply it i can appear cakey in some areas.</li>
    <li> i love the fact that has different colors you play around with. i always want a contour kit i absolutely love. this helps cover the less not so flawless areas on my face. i am looking forward to order another one of these. amazon keep them coming.</li>
    <li> I Received this earlier than estimated and the seller contacted me right away. Great product I love it!!! Very creamy and brightens up your dark circles wonderfully</li>
    <li> Does not sit on skin well but blends under foundation ok</li>
    <li> I Love All The Color Options In This Set! For The Price It&#x27;s Good, Took About A Month To Come But It&#x27;s Well Worth It. The Concealers Are Creamy &amp; Easy To Blend(:</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it worst product ever sucks !!!!!  Gave it one star cause I have to ... When I used the only way to get off was with a lot of soap and hot water...... Don&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really greasy Concealer. It does crease and slightly fades. Other than that it&#x27;s goods,for beginners. Try it if you want to</li>
    <li> Great price for a nice product! Creamy and well pigmented, this pallet is super useful! A must have for anyone that does their makeup</li>
    <li> For the price with free shipping this was a good deal and my palette arrived 10 days early!! Perfect for contouring and touching up blemishes</li>
    <li> I gave it a three star for now till I get the product .. I don&#x27;t get it why it takes so long to get it deliver to you ..</li>
    <li> Only really have trouble when I&#x27;m at work and sweating all day, but great colors for a photoshoot or short term wear. Using a secondary product like a finishing spray or a setting powder definitely helps!</li>
    <li> Was so excited for this to come , when it came I used it and tried all the shades and they are very transparent , they are like very clear like Vaseline is mixed w/ little color, very disappointed .</li>
    <li> Cheap make-up at it&#x27;s finest...do not buy. I would spend a little more money and just buy the drug store brand</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I am just starting to get into contouring and highlighting. This palette seemed to come with all of the colors appropriate for such things. It is obviously made of cheep material; for the product and case. When I opened the palette it had a bright green-blue color and a bright purple color.... That is not listed in the description nor in the picture. I&#x27;m actually 100% positive that they sent me the wrong product because this is supposed to be a 15 concealer palette and I got a 12 concealer palette. All in all I knew I was going to get a crappy product because of the price and I will not buy from this seller again. I would send it back and ask for my money back or for the correct palette but seeing as it took them over a month to deliver it, it Is just not worth the effort....</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It took a little less than three weeks to arrive, and was actually bigger than I had expected. It has a wide range of colors for all skin tones, although it looks darker than it really is aka when you look at it it&#x27;s super dark but when you put your finger in it and rub it around, it&#x27;s like a shade or two lighter. It works really good and provides really good coverage. Totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> This palette is nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great. I gave it 4 stars because it IS extremely cheap, so I didn&#x27;t expect great quality. I use the darker colors as a contour, which I love, but I didn&#x27;t feel like the lighter shades, which I use as concealer really covered up my acne scars that well and it also wore off really quickly. I would apply it underneath AND on top of my foundation to get the coverage that I want and the green shade, which is meant to color correct looks white when applied and blended out on the skin. However, I feel like for the price it is a fairly good product, especially if you&#x27;re one who loves to contour your face.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love it. i wish i could order another before i go out o town but can&#x27;t but i do love this&lt;br /&gt;it does give you that hollywood finish great stuff i mostly use it for my eyeshadow though :)</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist i use this pallete on myself and my clients . All i have to say is wow these concealers are sooooooooo good. They are natural 100% looking on your face and they apply smoothly. They last all day, some of them allow you to highlight , cover spots, dark circles. I will buy 6 more because their so good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this pallet and wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price(very inexpensive). With that being said this product is actually awesome the concealers dry matte and don&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. You even get two correctors and a highlight. Packaging was a lil cheap but again for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I&#x27;m will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T REALLY USED THEM YET BUT THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this product because the rating was good but i was disappointed !! It did not cover my dark sport not even a bit.</li>
    <li> Very good conclealer pallet, especially for the price! The portions are small but they have lasted me for a couple months. Great customer service as well! I will definitely be buying this pallet in the future.</li>
    <li> No where does it say what it contains but hey you get what you pay for and well it was to harsh for my skin, made my skin dry and irritated but over all very good coverage</li>
    <li> The darker tones shown aren&#x27;t actually very dark. This pallet is definitely for lighter skin tones. Quality is ok for the price. Coverage is average.</li>
    <li> All I gotta say is this is very helpful and if you love makeup and all you&#x27;ll love this, it works great!! It comes smaller than you think but it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I haven&#x27;t even gotten it, and it&#x27;s been forever! And from the reviews, I don&#x27;t want it anymore! I just want a refund.</li>
    <li> Its not what expected but it resolve for some ocation</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. Bad make up</li>
    <li> when i got this in the mail i was SO EXCITED, its doesnt really cover and just makes my face look cakey.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!!! Covers up blemishes well and contours very well. It is very pigmented but will blend out very well with the proper hand.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cream contouring thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great as a primer too</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the colors they are lighter than they look in the picture and they come up on my skins all types of nasty...I&#x27;m very disappointed and I don&#x27;t even use it because it is so bad</li>
    <li> I read alots of good comments on this product but however when I try the product I notice that when I put the product under my eyebrows im breaking out. so im not happy this is the first this happen .</li>
    <li> Wonderful --love the colors</li>
    <li> I hated it was so small and the color don&#x27;t look right on my skin</li>
    <li> The product was fine but it took exactly a month to get here. This is the longest a product has ever gotten. When I received it, it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait. It is literally worth $4.00. It&#x27;s okay but the wait really diminished its value.</li>
    <li> Was oily. Did not do the job as the regular concealer.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten anything! Its been more than a month.</li>
    <li> Um, it&#x27;s been over a month and it&#x27;s still not here. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Go to walmart.</li>
    <li> Good variety, but it has a pretty thin consistency.</li>
    <li> This came earlier than expected, I tried it out last night for a party, and it looked good, but it felt very thick and heavy, kind of like face paint or something. But over all im happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Came in two weeks early love the shades</li>
    <li> Its ok but not quality wise</li>
    <li> i absolutely adored it! it was more then what i expected AND it was quick delivery! most definitely will i order this again &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I liked the product but a couple of the makeup colores were not moist,fast shipping I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It shipped really fast, and I didn&#x27;t pay extra for shipping. Its also a very nice product! I love using the lighter tones for a highlight on my face.</li>
    <li> Oily and terrible it was like something for a child</li>
    <li> I have found this concealer palette to generally COVER BETTER than any of the more costly name-brand concealers I&#x27;ve purchased previously, and from such cosmetic giants as Cover$Girl and Lauren$Hutton.  (That last comment may really tick Lauren off, so let&#x27;s just not tell her -- why spoil her day?  I think Cover Girl can take the shock, don&#x27;t you?)  Even though only 5 or 6 shades will work for me, at this price, the 5 that I will use are still a steal, especially considering one little pot of a single shade would likely equal the cost of this entire palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  When I purchased this from Amazon recently, unfortunately, the 90 degree weather was responsible for its arrival as a melted mass of mess!  As usual, Amazon took care of it in a tick, and I reordered the same 15 pot palette, timing the delivery for the cooler weather we had for a few days.</li>
    <li> This is my second one...I do not need all of the colors, but there are at least four that I really like.  The price is good so I purchased another.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I bought these to practice contouring. They seem to smear more than blend. They lay VERY heavy on the skin, but provide hardly any coverage. It takes a few extra minutes to get the pasty feeling to wash off. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> This product is great!</li>
    <li> This item is decent for the price you pay. if you are looking for full coverage concealer then I would purchase another.</li>
    <li> I don’t know what this is supposed to be! It doesn’t provide coverage at all. It’s like buying kids makeup. I was thrilled about the price, but when it arrived, I was just disappointed. I think I have to apply the whole tray on my face before I could see any results. In other words, you have to use the whole thing for one application. I don’t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best concealed ever, its oiled based and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I just love love it need to order more . Must say best concealer ive ever use. its just perfect. Cheap an better than any  other expensive products. .</li>
    <li> This make up goes on easily, we used a makeup sponge, it&#x27;s creamy and light. The colors change when you apply them, nothing drastic just small changes. The purple gets a pink color to it. It comes in a case that easily opens and closes keeping stuff out of the makeup when not in use. There isn&#x27;t a whole lot in the little circles but it is also not an expensive makeuo to buy so I didn&#x27;t really expect it. My daughter absolutely loves this and after trying it out with me today she promptly took it to her room, I guess that means it&#x27;s hers now lol. We were both please with the application and they way it turned out. It did not feel greasy or sticky and washed off easily with soap and water. I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday because it takes time to apply but I&#x27;m sure my daughter will.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that this doesn&#x27;t come with a makeup brush!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad for a first concealer palette, my only thing is that once you begin to blend it completely blends to the point you cannot see it, also needs darker colors. Shipped perfectly though</li>
    <li> Its was ok. I like the pigment tho.  Its a little too creamy for me, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> (Wifey) I am accustom buying makeup palettes&#x27; on amazon and usually they came in bubble wraps. Unfortunately when I open this concealer box, I saw in the clear plastic wrap which hold the palette showed a white substance. On opening the Palette I saw that the concealer had melted. I was soooo disappointed pointed by the poor packaging which had ruined the product. My first Concealer Palette from excited to disappointment.</li>
    <li> I still have yet to find the right product to cover my dark circles, but this one is the closest so far.  I start out with the yellowish color and then use the one that matches my skin pigment. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find something someday, but this is a great and cost effective choice for now!</li>
    <li> Will not use all the colors.  Interested in pale to medium blend.  Covers well.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buyin this kit, it lasted me such a long time lol and the second kit came just in time!</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer i&#x27;ve used so far. The price is so affordable. There&#x27;s a lot of youtube videos on how to use this product. Give it a try. It definitely concealed my blemishes and dark under eyes. Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I really love it!! It is cheap and perfect as described</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller then I expected but I love the colors. They&#x27;re really pigmented and perfect for contouring! Mine arrived within 2 weeks. Loving this kit</li>
    <li> This is totally works if you know how to use them. It is rich and creamy. I like, it! cause, it does makes your skin looks flawless. Although, the oil factor is there but, i think it varies on different skins. But, It totally works on my skin. Like, what I said, It does looks good if you know how to use them properly.&lt;br /&gt;But, other than that. I have no complaint with this product at all! I like it! But, I am not an expert so Just check out the ingredients.. Just to see if it is harmful on your skin. Other than that. I like it.. But, i don&#x27;t usually wear this kind of thing. So, Yeah I like it..</li>
    <li> Love it, bought it to play with shading. The colors are easily mixed and blended.</li>
    <li> Too pasty and cheap made me break out</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it make me look pale and spreads very sheer I would say really light coverage.</li>
    <li> Great amazing size! Takes about 15 days to deliver</li>
    <li> I use mine almost every day! It is awesome for contouring and covering blemishes. It blends well with skin but not always powder foundation.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time, the product was creamy and blended well. You have to play with the colors to get an exact match.</li>
    <li> Really cheap I never use this product and the only time I did i didn&#x27;t like them, bad quality</li>
    <li> Purchase, purchase, purchase! Great for people that are unsure of their appropriate color pallet to use on their face. Last all day!</li>
    <li> fast shipping! love the concealer</li>
    <li> Great products and sellers definitely recommend ( except make-up not mine )</li>
    <li> Im a new comer to makeup and I gave this item to my daughter she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> Very oily, don&#x27;t like, no staying power. It took for ever to arrive, not happy at all.</li>
    <li> My package was broken when I received it. The colors are nice but they were melted &amp; broken.</li>
    <li> got them in 9 days great ...</li>
    <li> Love them! The only bad thing is that its to small but other than that I love love it! Recommended it 100%</li>
    <li> Quick service and the item is awesome. I will be ordering more&lt;br /&gt;for my daughters in the future. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.</li>
    <li> The colors are very nice! All of the colors minus the white, pink, and green all apply to my skin very easily. The white, pink, and green hardly show up at all however.</li>
    <li> Great quality one of the best things I bought for like 5$ I was really suprised there awesome for contouring</li>
    <li> I found that I didn&#x27;t like using the white, green, or purple in this pallet. They seemed very different from the other colors. Although, I do like the skin-toned colors. They are oily but they do act as a great cover up for my dark circles and redness. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this again but it was a semi-okay product.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I&#x27;m a bit worried what might be in it that might damage my face but other than that it&#x27;s really great for it&#x27;s price. It applys ok I guess though I imagine moisturizing your face will help a lot with that problem. And for those who don&#x27;t like it.....just don&#x27;t give a review because nobody in there right mind would be expecting a high quality item from something this cheap.</li>
    <li> i used this to cover my red acne, dark circles, and use the dark shades as a bronzer, I would buy this product again when my current one run out</li>
    <li> Never got it! Not worth it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain to much the product did the job of covering and concealing it just didn&#x27;t look very natural. The make up has a hard to blend oily texture. I would go for something a little more trustworthy for major coverage.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this palate because I saw it had arrived melted for some people. It came early which was nice and I really like the variety of colors. Overall a really nice palate and it has good pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Went on my face smoothly and was easy to blend. For the price its def worth buying. I plan on purchasing this again!!!</li>
    <li> As someone who participates in indoor and outdoor colorguard I love this palette for contouring my face for shows.</li>
    <li> These colors are very gorgeous! I use the darker ones for contour and filling in my eyebrows and the lighter colors for highlighting. The makeup feels very light on my face and doesn&#x27;t get cakey. It covers good. Feels nice on my skin. Very affordable!!! Five stars for the quality and price. Definitely not a waste.</li>
    <li> I bought this camouflage concealer to do my contouring with my makeup and I absolutely love this product I bought it twice! The colors are perfect and match great with any skin tone. I didn&#x27;t have an irritation or problems. You can apply with finger or I preferably use brushes and it lasts hours on end. I may do occasional touch ups, but that&#x27;s normal with makeup obviously. Love this!!!</li>
    <li> This is just want I needed for my darks rings under my eyes and my shine on my nose and forehead. Thank you!</li>
    <li> LIKE PUTTING COOKING OIL ON MY FACE!</li>
    <li> makes your skin darker after a while</li>
    <li> Great colors that blend with all skin types</li>
    <li> The concealer seem dark from the picture, but the colors are lighter. Whats pictured would fit my complexion but what i got does not at all.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this pallet because it&#x27;s very cheap and so are the concealer colours. Complete waste of money do not buy unless you want it for practice makeup for Halloween.</li>
    <li> Not sure why their are so many bad comments for this product. I thought it looked great on my skin! Yes of course you need to know how to properly use it, but once you get the hang of it then you&#x27;ll enjoy it while you can.</li>
    <li> It is really good product.</li>
    <li> It looks nice at first if you know how to use it. But if you have oily skin forget about it, it wont look nice.</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because my package didn&#x27;t arrive but I emailed the seller and got my package quickly and I am in love with this product. Has options for different skin tones and works extremely well will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that good but you have to consider how cheap this was</li>
    <li> took a little while for it to be shipped to me. product works okay. i do put powder over the concealer because it makes around my eyes a bit greasy through out the day.the palette has lasted long. i probably wont purchase this again just because it doesnt last all day. i have to re apply and i dont like toting around a palette of concealer.</li>
    <li> This compact has a nice range of colors, including a nice pale green that helps negate redness (like over pimples) so you can cover up without caking on the concealer. There is also a nice pale pink that really reduces undereye darkness by cancelling out the blue. There is a rather sheer glittery color of some sort, which I can only assume is meant to be a highlighter of some sort. It&#x27;s not the best as a highlighter, but it&#x27;s a kind of fun addition. The other shades cover most every skin color I can think of and would definitely work on European, olive tone, asian, middle eastern, and hispanic skin tones. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough options for people of african descent, and if you have ebony skin (super dark brown- basically looks black) there is no color that will work for you at all. There are two reddish shades that could work if you have strong Indigenous ancestry, such as a native American or Mayan or some other aboriginal group. There are plenty of options but I think most everything would actually be too dark for a really fairskinned person, such as a really pale redhead or someone who stays indoors a lot. Basically this covers light to dark medium tone skins, without covering any super dark skin tones and perhaps not the best choice for insanely super extra light skin either.</li>
    <li> Horrible concealer doesn&#x27;t cover anything waste of my money</li>
    <li> 15 concealer colors are great. Down side is they are sheer colors and don&#x27;t stay on for long.</li>
    <li> I love this products it works very well.</li>
    <li> very very poor quality</li>
    <li> They have a variety of different skin tones . A makeup artist best friend , love it &amp; for the price why not .</li>
    <li> Great price great product</li>
    <li> Okay not for dark skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good makeup but runs out very very fast :(</li>
    <li> The colors are a little deceiving. I was excepting more of a light brown to dark brown shade. But got totally different colors. Either way I manged to work with what I got and it&#x27;s not a complete disaster.</li>
    <li> great product. love all the options. i have oily skin and use a light dusting of powder over the color. my skin is light and i have been able to achieve a flawless contour look with each shade.</li>
    <li> Really not that impressed. It&#x27;s not creamy at all &amp; very difficult to blend. It does okay for the price, I guess, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> GREAT CONCEALER WOULD RECOMMEND IT 100%</li>
    <li> The palette is smaller than I thought , however the concealers do the job well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found use for this don&#x27;t like the consistency of product feel</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s a small palette and the concealers don&#x27;t have that much product. Other than that, the colors are great and they are very smooth to put on and don&#x27;t look cake-ish. Very natural looking.</li>
    <li> It is good deal for the price. I wish I could have more amount each colors though!!</li>
    <li> It looks really nice I haven&#x27;t really got to use it but it arrived really fast my only problem was it is smaller than I imagined</li>
    <li> It came melted with hardly any of the colors in the palete it was very heavy and oily waste of money I&#x27;m so pissed</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s only $4.00, but it&#x27;s the worst $4.00 I&#x27;ve ever spent</li>
    <li> Honestly this concealer palette isn&#x27;t the best. The good thing about this concealer palette is that it does give good coverage and you can blend easily. There are more bads though this palette smudges your makeup, and also has a cheap lipgloss texture and when I put it on it has a major shine to it on your skin not a good look!</li>
    <li> Really good quality, I use it mainly for highlighting and contouring. I am african american and it works really well for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Great pallet it just took a bit long to ship</li>
    <li> Ehhhh reminds me of okay make up and smell like water paint</li>
    <li> STILL HAVENT RECIEVED OVER 3 MONTHS LATER</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as creamy as I would expect it, but either-ways,for the price. it&#x27;s a steal :)</li>
    <li> Recieved item and quality isnt good.</li>
    <li> im a little new in the Concealer department, the colors really do stay on and keeps my eyeshadow viberant and no smudges. for the price, i will buy again. I would like to use all the colors. just have to take baby steps and learn the tricks of using concealer.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Too greasy.</li>
    <li> You can make it natural or dramatic. I love it</li>
    <li> great assortment of colors lasts all day definitely can&#x27;t beat the price I will have to order more! It does well with hiding dark circles or any blemishes.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for contouring. I am highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> The product is oily and some of the the colors aren&#x27;t true to color. I lost the palette on a trip, and I&#x27;m not going to repurchase it. I guess it will work for beginners.</li>
    <li> As always this is a great pallet! My 2nd one and I use it everyday and they last a long time. I use it when I&#x27;m filling in my eyebrows and need to clean it up.</li>
    <li> love it!!!!! even tho it&#x27;s shades on there i will never use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking a star away because I felt the size of this palette was badly represented, but for the price, I&#x27;d buy it again. I did notice an earlier review saying that the ingredients were not listed, but it&#x27;s the first thing I saw when I opened the packaging. It&#x27;s on the box it comes in, not on the palette itself. Nothing atypical that I noticed.</li>
    <li> This pallete is so freaking cute and for the price wow Im gonna have to order some more. Perfect for first time contouring</li>
    <li> Everything perfect. Product and delivery</li>
    <li> Greasy doesn&#x27;t work well for oily skin.......</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The green is perfect for covering up the red shades in my pale skin and the darker colors are wonderful for contouring. Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for but it is usable. Honestly don&#x27;t think I would reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Only if it came with instructions</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palate! I use it to contour.  I will definitely order it again in the future.  I would suggest ordering more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> I love it just can&#x27;t mix with a certain foundation . but great</li>
    <li> The product looks exactly as shown in the picture, but the texture is terrible. It feels like Vaseline or lip gloss on your face. I guess it&#x27;s good for practice. I used it once and just tossed it, but then again you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Not the best concealer</li>
    <li> Great value! I don&#x27;t use all the colors, some are way too dark. But overall, worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought it to play around with the color palette before I buy a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the colors are decent and usable, others do nothing. The highlighter is barely visible. I am caramel toned.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend if your looking for cheap stuff to play with.</li>
    <li> They are sort of greasy so they need to be set with a powder and they will collect in creases without a powder. After you use each one like twice it gets much creamier and easier to apply. Otherwise it&#x27;s really great especially so because it is soooo cheap</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Product was way too oily for my liking. Not the best quality.</li>
    <li> good item, good seller</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any instructions on how to use concealer.</li>
    <li> OMGOSH THIS SUCKED 😣😣😤. It toook fooorever to get here &amp; the concealers smell REAALLLY BAD. The highlighter which is the white one, made my skin break out. Sooo not worth the money, should of saved it so later i could get a name brand palett.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product smooth to the skin and easy to come off when needed. Definitely recommend .</li>
    <li> it covers quiet good. the price is right. good for light skin. use it under liquid make up. Takes a long time to get, 4 -7 weeks</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t good quality , they just sit on your skin.  No blending</li>
    <li> Wow. I just recieved the package today and i already love it. I ordered one originally for $3 and some change, but it is taking a month to get here. So i gave in and bought it again with amazon prime so i could recieve it faster. It was smaller than expected, but a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are so varied that you can change your look every day but still have a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;The colors blend so beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product and even happier that i have another on the way. 😊</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Took ages to be delivered and the product itself is very bad quality, very hard to apply.</li>
    <li> It was crappy. The colors don&#x27;t blend well, and they are useless for concealing things. I would not recommend this. Instead, I would recommend taking a liquid foundation and mixing it with lipstick to get the exact shade you need in concealer, then using that. It would be cheaper, and much more effective than this.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a really good product! I didn&#x27;t think it would be so oily, but besides that, the colors are all different shades and are pretty. The grey is actually really glittery and shimmery. I didn&#x27;t expect that, but it works.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! I love the coverage for concealing as well as the highlighter... It just took forever to come in the mail!</li>
    <li> Made me break out and not even baby oil could get it off junk really horrible</li>
    <li> I am truly surprised. Received yesterday and I can not wait to use. Love the packaging. Glad I ddecided to purchase.</li>
    <li> My palette arrived today and it cool I did my mom makeup using the Concealer and its fine im gud with makeup so I can make anything work if u use Concealer and the right powder foundation on top u will be fine if u dnt have sensitive skin couse everyone cant where cheap. Makeup .. but I use Mac Concealer and smetimes nyx I will try this pallets for me and my customers .... I will recomend it:)</li>
    <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold well. You can try this also:  http://goo.gl/qYSwID  if you want to learn and practice contouring. It comes with easy instructions.</li>
    <li> they are very creamy and dont show up at all dont buy!!! they are cheap but they show up clear on the skin and not because it matches the skin so well they dont cover up at all please dont buy!!!</li>
    <li> Im still waitting for my product and still nothing it is been almost a month  this deservs 0 stars but it donsent alow me so  i have to give atleast one star</li>
    <li> really small but then again its less than $5 so it was a deal</li>
    <li> REALLY greasy, almost like grease paint but okay after it is blended really well.</li>
    <li> Feels exactly like vaseline. Its like putting tinted vaseline on your face n the color barely shows up. I guess thats why it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this! I did have to get a replacement because UPS left my original order in the sun. The seller was in no way at fault. It was worth my money.</li>
    <li> Late Shipping but great quality love it !</li>
    <li> Great price, and works okay.Very cakey/thick, and makes my skin sticky. Caused me to break out. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I like this pallets. I prefer the creams rather than powders, just feels like they stay longer with setting powder. This is good for the price,runs out quick.</li>
    <li> The 8 that I use are wonderful. The other 7 I will not use! It would be great if I could have just bought the lighter colors. Otherwise the ones I use are great. They cover my dark circles under my eyes wonderfully, and works great on blemishes. Fast delivery from China. Seller shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to get mine in the mail!! 😆</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Terrible the colors shown is what it look like but when you use it the colors change. I use it as cream eye shadow now because I might as well get my money out of it.</li>
    <li> I Love it. And it came early</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. The colors were light and muddy like</li>
    <li> i really like this kingmas professional conseler i apply this on my face everytime i put make up on and my break out face is covered i really love it thank u amazon</li>
    <li> Loved it I will order again.</li>
    <li> Amazing concealor at amazing price every girl should have this..</li>
    <li> I only use two or three of the colors but they work and last all day.</li>
    <li> I love this It works perfect it&#x27;s small but with the right brushes you can make it last. It came earlier then it was supposed too so that was a big plus 😄</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad but not the best either. But as I said for the price it&#x27;s good; however, I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> The shipping had a lot of errors. The product is as expected. I&#x27;d give the product a 5 and the company a 3 due to the issues I had with receiving this product .</li>
    <li> This is a small concealor palette and can be carried in a purse.  Its like a 6in. x 4in. in size.  It was smaller then I expected but, its alright with me since, I am not a makeup junkie.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. It is too wet and when applied on the skin, half of the colors look exactly the same. After rubbing my finger in the product, oil gathers on the surface and it&#x27;s disgusting. The darkest brown color has a gray undertone when blended out. The white highlighter feels like glitter glue. It&#x27;s pretty much Vaseline with glitter in it. Overall a terrible product. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> The product was not what I expected. Works okay</li>
    <li> I received this product fairly quickly. I didn&#x27;t get to use it right off due to my hectic schedule but I did use it during the last week. I use it to conceal (under the eyes, hide blemishes, and to blend hyperpigmentation /dark spots) and to highlight. I do have to mix the dark browns with the light brown and tans to find to right color to conceal. That was my main reason for purchasing this palette. I almost purchased a palette like this from Coastal Scents but I am so glad that I found this one first. Any customer should know to use a primer on your skin to help set or &amp;#34;cling&amp;#34; to product to the face. The product has a very soft and creamy feel without being overly &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; which I like. I do not like, however, how this product creases and &amp;#34;runs&amp;#34; on the skin overtime. I found myself having to use set my face with powder heavily than I do normally. I also appreciate the note that the seller inserted into the package making the overall experience very personable. Overall, I feel like this product was worth the money and as someone who loves beauty products and makeup application; if I hit pan ... I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product.It came really fast and good quality.Thanks so much.I will be purchasing very soon.I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! It&#x27;s made for children to play in. This product does not cover any flaws, its like putting vaseoline on your face. Its greasy and tacky. This was a waste of money. I have given this product to my daughters to play with.</li>
    <li> I have a oily face and these are not matte, they&#x27;re kinda oily. Doesn&#x27;t not last all day. Good for price. They&#x27;re okay.</li>
    <li> I love it! It works great with covering my blemishes and dark spots. It also has A great assortment of colors for any skin color.. GREAT FOR ITS PRICE.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love. It</li>
    <li> This concealer is very good! although when i first tried it i thought it was oily but now after mixing and using proper tools to apply the concealer, It works and looks great on my skin! I love this because the makeup last all day for me</li>
    <li> I got this item and they were melted and all run together.</li>
    <li> it is ok...not sure I love the quality of it...</li>
    <li> Not the best for full coverage</li>
    <li> Okay for mix and match, I will still however still use my regular foundation.</li>
    <li> The palette was melted when I received it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a greasy feel that will cause you to breakout. I&#x27;m now worried that based on the price, of the chemicals probably hurting my skin.</li>
    <li> It came in so so early. I would prefer use a powder contouring than this.... its not a concealer nor a contouring. They are so sticky! Not a very good product.</li>
    <li> very poor quality. Really hard to explain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really stiff to work with. Every time I try to use it, it feels like I&#x27;m using tar on my face. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy make up off the internet again.</li>
    <li> the pans aren&#x27;t as big as pictures and I&#x27;m running out of product quickly but I&#x27;m not complaining since it was only $3.73. Very creamy to the touch and easily blendable. Very useful for contouring. Not a wide selection of deep shades so may want to look elsewhere if you have a deeper skin tone (I use the darkest shade to contour my cheekbones and nose). Overall a decent product.</li>
    <li> Doesnt give any coverage</li>
    <li> I was blown away. I thought for the price, it would be you know, just okay. I was very wrong. When i received it, i dived right into it like a kid on Christmas. The colors are very very pigmented. It might be that  i am very fair, but the colors of the concealer where turning out great when put onto my skin. My favorite colors are the pink, which is the third one down on the first row, and the light cream color under the yellow in the second row. Wow. Just wow. I have some red splotches on my face and a annoying half dark circle under my right eye. I applied the pink concealer first then blended it out, then i used the light cream color over it and my god it canceled out everything. I couldn&#x27;t see any red spots and the dark circle was gone!. I usually put on a thin layer of foundation on, then my concealer but i was just playing around today, and decided to just use the concealers. I worked out so well, and i am so impressed with this concealer palette and this exceeded my expectations. I love this palette and i am so glad i took the jump and got it.</li>
    <li> I really like this palette. It&#x27;s great and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily either.</li>
    <li> The palette is small but it works perfectly</li>
    <li> The palette is good and comes just as promised; however, the concealer goes on weird. It doesn&#x27;t blend evenly to your skin (I may have to retire my brush and invest in a foam blending tool), and when you do apply it it grabs ahold of your foundation, making for uneven application of foundation (I used powder foundation). But these things can be remedied, by using a foam blender or putting on the concealer on top of your foundation. Long story short, for minor dark spots and the occasional pimple, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Good product and nice packaging.</li>
    <li> This is ok for a starter. Not full coverage but descent enough. Good for anyone on a budget.</li>
    <li> Great for the price but I find it difficult to blend with my fingertips, beauty blender or brush especially for the under eye area.</li>
    <li> I love how they made the palette it looks like coastal scents. I think this is the original one before they send it to coastal scents company to put name on the product because if u read the description of coastal scents it said that its made from china. And this product is from china but dont have name. If u have SC products and u have this this is really thecsame</li>
    <li> i took the bad reviews with a grain of salt because every person&#x27;s skin is different. I received it very quickly and was excited about trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creamy thickness of the palette made it seem like it had great coverage but once applied and slightly blended it disappeared. I tried leaving it a bit thicker and using my foundation to blend it in but I saw no visible difference of coverage compared to only using my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am half Filipino and Irish. It could be the wrong makeup for my skin type. I felt like a clown with this stuff caked on and more so when it started settling into lines under my eyes and around my mouth. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend Tia product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This thing is a lot smaller than I pictured.  Other than that, it took a while to get here since it came over seas.</li>
    <li> Package came in broken, makeup was melted and everywhere! Package was SUPER SMALL, and not what I was expecting at all... Will not purchase ever again... Should have just went to Ulta.</li>
    <li> It ships from china so it took a little longer than most products I bought . If you watch how to contour your face on utube and need a product to mimic this technique then this is a great product. Coverage is great. Last all day. I dont uses it everyday and I also don&#x27;t use all the colors. But for the price it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m going to send as gifts!</li>
    <li> This concealer pack is very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this product&lt;br /&gt;But it leaves your face feeling really greasy ?</li>
    <li> The concealer was not smooth at all, made it difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Really nice, they were creamy which I think was a plus! Would repurchase. Shipping was fast, came within a week or two.</li>
    <li> It does not really cover or &amp;#34;conceal&amp;#34; anything. coverage/pigmentation is not the greatest. Colors are very light even though they look light. I don&#x27;t know what im going to use this for yet...</li>
    <li> Very excited to give to my daughter for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I gave three stars only because it took two months to receive. Other than that, its pretty good. Very small though.</li>
    <li> for me personally it was not pigmented enough. that however could be due to the fact that im not much of a makeup person. maybe i didnt know how to use it. but it wasnt for me.</li>
    <li> Would have been a 5 star had it came with a mirror 😞</li>
    <li> It liked to my sister. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Greasy and barely pigmented</li>
    <li> Yes it didn&#x27;t meet my requirements thank you</li>
    <li> It blends so well with my skin and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or cake-like. It doesn&#x27;t take much product for me to blend it well. 10/10</li>
    <li> It was delivered before the date schedule, actually, way before! Good product and is good gift to give and not expensive.</li>
    <li> My palette arrived UNDAMAGED, the others may have just gotten a bad one. DEFINITELY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS ONE. I was scared to buy it even though it was so cheap, because of the bad reviews but I decided to just go ahead. This is a cream concealer, it did NOT HAVE A SMELL. The concealer is a bit oily but after a while I think it stops being that way, it just depends on how much you put on. And to get rid of this you can add powder to set it. I love the silvery one as a shimmer for my highlight on my cheekbones. The darker ones are perfect for my contours, I love it. I don&#x27;t use it as much as I used to though only because it&#x27;s a bit heavy since I&#x27;m not used to wearing concealer, but I definitely will once my translucent powder comes in.</li>
    <li> At the moment i opend the package,I just throw it away ! very bad !&lt;br /&gt;bad experience !</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors I&#x27;m a beginner and I&#x27;m learning to play with them</li>
    <li> This was a horrible product, after using it i started breaking out. Colors did not shwn very well</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and for a price you can&#x27;t beat! Blends nicely and gives such a natural look, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great condition and exactly what it said it would be!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well as concealer. I like it as a highlight and contour kit, though. Just beware, the darker colors are harder to blend.</li>
    <li> Kinda made me break out a bit but its pretty good for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Great concealers and highlighting colors. Do not buy big name brands. This is just as good.</li>
    <li> Okay, so a lot of people new to makeup may not realize that you need to get under the first layer to get an easier application. Dip a smooth blending brush in some water, then smear the brush around to break up and activate the cream. This helps so much. I almost sent it back before I did that.</li>
    <li> This Is So Amazing I Love My Pallete I Contour And It WOrks Perfectly!! VEry Good Quality</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette about a month ago for my mom and she loved it. But just recently she noticed black and red in them. At first she thought she had accidently mixed or spilled eyeshadow on them. But no she scraped one and saw that it was in the concealers making it hard for her to wear it now since its too dark or red now.</li>
    <li> Well this took about a month to get here, I forgot I had even ordered it. It&#x27;s not exactly the best quality but because it was so cheap, i got what i paid for. It&#x27;s very hard to blend and leaves spots like a crayon. The darker shades i use to contour my face ( even the darkest brown) look more like a reddish brown in sun light. The only color I use mainly is the yellow, and even that is hard to blend. Overall it is okay and not the best quality.</li>
    <li> More like a paste, very hard to work with.</li>
    <li> I ordered this once and loved it so when I ran out I orders a second one. The second one came and had different colors than what was pictured and what I got originally.  The darkest row of colors were not dark at all and the darkest brown color was purple!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim after seeing the great price.  I was pretty skeptical of the quality, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how good the kit is!  The white color is shimmery, but sort of a grey-white.  I use the green (I have a lot of redness on and around my nose) daily and it&#x27;s enough to cover the redness without looking green-tinged (like a lot of green concealers do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorites are the second and third darkest brown tones -- these are great for contouring and shading!  I apply the green, then the browns, then a different white/light concealer for highlighting, then apply a light layer of foundation over it.  It comes out perfect.  The yellow and pink concealers are also great for battling undereye bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is definitely worth the money -- it comes at a fraction of the cost for namebrand kits.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product, will purchase again in the future! Thank you :)</li>
    <li> Use for stage/performance  makeup and find it is a great concealer that holds up well to the lights and heat. So it should hold up for you too at dinner or a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for hd video production makeup and find that it will cover just as well for hd close ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good color range and selection that blends well. Maybe better for European/Asian/Caucasian skin selections than darker tones like african american tones, but it is made in Asia so what would you expect!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ships from overseas but pretty darn quickly and for a great price at under 4 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pallet is normal size for concealers and entire case is 6 inches by 4 inches so don&#x27;t let the image without a scale reference trick your brain into thinking it is huge. 6x4 inches so each pad is about 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5 stars recommended.</li>
    <li> there is such a small amount of product thats its more like a sample than anything</li>
    <li> I love this its great</li>
    <li> The palette itself has nice shades, however you don&#x27;t get many uses from them. Maybe 3 or 4 before you see them start to wear down to the bottom.</li>
    <li> This is great to have all the concelers in one compact ... Great price</li>
    <li> it doesnt have a smell to it like others have said, its creamy, but it blends really well. i like it</li>
    <li> On time delivery and great product</li>
    <li> This was my fault  I have wrong color  I wish  in description  they  would tell  you  what  skin typeand cocomplexion  works best</li>
    <li> More like a cake paste</li>
    <li> Love it will purchase more!</li>
    <li> It is okay. None of the dark colors work for my skin tone but, I know I can give it to someone else.</li>
    <li> Not super helpful. Maybe I don&#x27;t really know how to use it but overall oily and not good coverage.</li>
    <li> Came on time. I think I figured the picture was shrunk to fit all the colors, so it&#x27;s actually as small as they seem, no big deal. The texture is a little hard to work with, not as happy with that but I&#x27;m using different brushes to try and blend. It ends up taking me a bit longer.</li>
    <li> So happy with this! Now I can contour better</li>
    <li> Really Great deal for price , a little smaller then I thought but still as creamy and pigmented as a concealer</li>
    <li> Very small , messy , and low quality.</li>
    <li> So much more professional than I expected.</li>
    <li> purchased this thing last dec 14, till now i haven&#x27;t gotten anything.</li>
    <li> I love this. Took longer than I expected but I love it</li>
    <li> Great coverage, nice colors but none exactly as light as me.</li>
    <li> great price for so many colors</li>
    <li> awesome product for very good price! thank you</li>
    <li> Oil based. I was hoping for something closer to powder but this is very very creamy. Not what I prefer.</li>
    <li> It fine for your prise</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered at least six of these pallets.  I love them!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like using it this product ..</li>
    <li> I got this exactly how it came on the picture not melted or destroyed and works awesome for concealing will buy again</li>
    <li> i like all the color&#x27;s  it fix my need.. very nice</li>
    <li> This is a cream based product so if you have combination skin, a little goes a long way. I have been using it regularly for the past 2 weeks in place of my usual concealer. Pro tip: Buy blotting sheets with this, you may get shine throughout the day. Other than that, this is a great, low-cost buy!</li>
    <li> Not  what I was expecting , but still good.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin bust out in red spots all over my face and irritated my skin really bad!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. I am an esthetician by trade and this is the most disgusting product I have ever seen. Never in my life has my skin broke out like it did after using this. It started burning, followed by itchy skin that lasted for days and red streaks (20 min after applying). It doesn&#x27;t have an ingredient list attached so BUYER BEWARE. It is from CHINA. I don&#x27;t think this product is safe for skin!!!! The quality is NOT creamy, it sinks right into the fine lines and is not cosmo grade quality. It&#x27;s absolutely horrible I can&#x27;t even sell this at my garage sale I&#x27;m afraid to get sued!</li>
