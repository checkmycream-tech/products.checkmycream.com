      <li>Smells great and holds very well.</li>
      <li>I do have to use quite a bit more than most people say to use, which is a bit of a bummer.</li>
      <li>I love the smell</li>
      <li>I reach for this pomade more than my Layrite.</li>
      <li>Better for longer hair.</li>
      <li>I still feel some day are better than others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:1d2b8fd7ecefef008ed5a36168acda36]]I like it for my first time using a water based pomades. My only complaint is some small inconsistencies. I have 3-5 inch thick hair. I started with one finger for a week, then two fingers. I still feel some day are better than others. Yes I have tried applying bone dry and with the smallest bit of dampness.  I use standard message in and brush back technique.    I have started to use this for the majority of my hair, but still using a bit of cheap Murray&#x27;s to get my part down nice and some stand by hair paste for fly always. If you&#x27;re outside a lot in wind or anything, wouldn&#x27;t strongly recommend. Oh, does a have a nice scent as many have said.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold or lasts as the hype promised. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the weather (humid).</li>
    <li> Definitely lives up to the &amp;#34;Firme Hold&amp;#34; that reads on the container.  I am beginning an undercut hairstyle so this gave a strong hold to my long hair. One of the top products I have been using. Minus 1 star for the after-residue it leaves on my hand, even after a nice hand-wash. Also, to some, depending on the leng of your hair, this might be a little TOO firm of a hold. All in all, great product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very thick/wavy hair and this product keeps my hair straight and in place the entire day. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because this stuff sets pretty fast and I usually take my time combing my hair. All in all, it&#x27;s a very good product and I&#x27;d most likely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, old school hold, works like it&#x27;s supposed to, and washes out with ease with water and shampoo. Enough said. Get this pomade, and never go back to that cheap junk again.</li>
    <li> Was a crew M hold M shine man for years.  Just tried this product so far so good, only reason I will not give it a 5 star.  Smells good, seems very comparable to Crew.</li>
    <li> Works great. nice smell. wont get a better bang for your buck</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Best pomade I&#x27;ve used this far. Pleasant smell and because it&#x27;s water soluble, it&#x27;s easy to wash away with just water. Five stars for sure!</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Good choice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very very sticky, has a very cheap strong cologne smell and dries out your hair so much over the course of the day your hair looks like straw, very unhealthy. Tres Flores Moulding pomade is a much better water-based pomade option.</li>
    <li> I am a forty five year old greaser an suavecito is a must don&#x27;t accept anything else!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Suavecito for about a year and a half after my barber showed it to me, and fell in love with it pretty quickly. It&#x27;s not too stiff, though applying a bit more than suggested gives it the firm hold of a gel. I apply just a bit while my hair is still wet and it keeps it all in place without too much shine or gloss. The product is also great because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which is a big selling point for me. Prior to this I had always used American Crew, and while I liked the texture better I prefer the smell and flexibility of Suavecito, since it is really easy to adapt.</li>
    <li> Great hold but and really firm</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son. He seems to like it.</li>
    <li> The best product for my son with stick straight stubborn hair!</li>
    <li> Best pomade your going to get on the market. If your looking for that classy look this will give u it and great for the customers at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Great pomade. Literally The only thing that will make my hair do what i want</li>
    <li> It does the job well compared to my usual product Layrite BUT Suavecito smells like cheap cologne/old mans aftershave.</li>
    <li> Used to be a fan of Layrite Superhold, that is until i found Suavecito Firme.  Works just as well as Layrite, but has a great scent!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this product.  I have been using Layrite original and Dapper Dan pomades, both of which are the original medium hold formula, and like them very much.  I figured I would give the strong (firme) hold Suavecito a try since the other two are medium.  It is a very good product, but a little too strong for my hair type.  It spreads very easily and smell very good.  Not quite how I thought it would, but very masculine and pleasant.  I would recommend this product for someone with very thick hair.  Otherwise, go probably best to go with the original formula.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is the only pomade that works for my hair.  Very easy to re-work and wash out.  It also has a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Smells really good.</li>
    <li> My favorite pomade!  I have both tried Layrite as well, but this will always be the best.  It stays in place even if you put a hat on.  If you need to reshape your hair, just put a little water on it and shape it with your hands.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so nicely! It&#x27;s perfect for my son and husbands hair and smells great! It&#x27;s does leave hair stiff but still keeps it in place. Really nice!</li>
    <li> Only pomade that holds my Son&#x27;s hair back.</li>
    <li> Firm hold is better for longer hair. Washes out easy.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Layrite brand of pomade and I decided to buy this one for him to try. He wears his hair about 2 -3 inch long on top, and he said he has to use more to get his hair to stay. He says it is a bit stickier than Layrite brand, and he actually uses more to get it to work for his hairstyle. But I think it smells good! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;m a wax pomade user but I really love the ease of use suavecito has, and the smell is outta sight!!!!!</li>
    <li> When my hair was long, I threw some of this on my hair and it stuck exactly in the position I wanted to style it in. Was perfect. I used to use gel and my hair would never be as stiff as I needed it (my hair is very thick), so my hair would always flop over. With this product, it sticks perfectly the way I want it. If you want your hair to be very stiff, I would recommend having damp hair first. If you want to have a fluffier look, apply it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Best pomade for great height and all day hold</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what was in the picture &amp; how was  described . i love the item is very nice thank you so much</li>
    <li> Good product and a good hold. Washes out real easy too</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever come across for a waxed moustache. It was recommended by a customer in my shop who complimented me on my generous handlebars. Suavecito shapes quickly and the hold lasts all day. The pleasant scent under the nose is a plus.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff all the time it holds very well, if you happen to have hard to mange hair like I do and you need a pomade to keep it in place I recommend this one. I use it with a little of the light mixed in for my part and areas that want to feather but not stick up.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and wavy hair that is roughly 4 inches long on top.  I can either put this pomade in with my hair very damp and get a good hold but flexible with low shine or slightly damp/dry for a really firm hold.  It really all depends on the look you want.  I love the smell, it&#x27;s almost like wearing a cologne.  I will definitely stick with Suavecito products except next time I may try the creme since it may be more along the lines of what I need.</li>
    <li> At first when I used it, I thought it didn&#x27;t work well. I was really frustrated because I haven&#x27;t really found many products that work with my hair because my hair&#x27;s so damn stubborn. This applies to a lot of asians. I&#x27;m asian myself. Then I watched some tutorials and realized that you want to just towel dry your hair first and let it be a little bit damp. After that, you clear out any knots in your hair (if you have long hair like me) and scoop an index tip finger&#x27;s full of the product and you start rubbing it in from the back of your head and work your way up to the front. A helpful tip is that you REALLY want to and I mean really want to get it all in your hair, root, EVERYWHERE. After getting it all in good, graze one hand over the sink to get some excess water and run all of that in your hair as well to make the pomade a little more flexible. After that, I take another scoop of the same amount I used in the first step and repeat the first process. You can then use your hands to style it in whichever direction you wish and you may also use a comb for assistance if you&#x27;d like (more of a slickback style). I learned that with water based pomade, more is better than less (I know people always say less is more but NOT in this case). So don&#x27;t be afraid to use a little more if you feel like it&#x27;s not strong enough. Trust me, if this product can hold my hair, it&#x27;ll hold yours. After you&#x27;re done, your hair should be nice and shiny and give it a little while to completely dry and that&#x27;ll do it for the rest of your day ! Guys, it also makes you smell really good and the ladies will be happy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really great.  Holds like a champ, even in the crazy NYC wind and rain.  I accidentally got this Firm Hold version this time (I usually get the regular) and it really is even more firm - I prefer the original actually, but that&#x27;s just due to my hair.  I first came by it at a trendy barber shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and they also sell it at another very highly-rated barber shop right near my office in midtown.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a slick look and tons of hold.</li>
    <li> They need to make different scents because it is a great product with subpar smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different hair products and this is by far the best for the pomp hairstyle, smells great and the hold is awesome.</li>
    <li> A good water soluble pomade, not too stiff yet has hold.</li>
    <li> Used to use Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sumo paste, but as my hair got longer I need to find something new. This really holds all day and applies easily. Best thing is that it rinses from your hands super easy after applying to your hair, and easily washes out of your hair at the end of the day. No residue. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Hands down this product is just what I needed to control my hair. Dime size amount goes a long way all day just press down on my hair groves it back to maintain desired  look wash off easily  great product  also smell amazing ladies love it..</li>
    <li> A little overpriced for what it gives you. It&#x27;s smells a lot and doesn&#x27;t hold for a whole day. It&#x27;s ok but I would not pay more than 3-4$ for it.</li>
    <li> Suavecito is a fantastic water based pomade. It holds my side part combover all day. It also has a strong manly scent. It is best applied with damp hair and maybe some hair tonic to soften the pomade a tad. Will purchase again. I reach for this pomade more than my Layrite.</li>
    <li> after trying Layrite strong hold pomade I decided to buy this and try it.. Suavecito Firme hold is more manageable and it holds better with more flexibility in my opinion. Layrite is good too but I seem to use more of it to hold my hair and the texture is a little bit hard or dry but doesn&#x27;t really hold my hair that great as this one. I always have to keep adding more to keep it together compared to the Suav Firme. I&#x27;ve also tried the Suavecito original hold but I like the hold of this Firme one better! it holds my hair well slick back, comb to the side, and etc. my barber uses this stuff and i&#x27;m glad he introduced me to Suavecito. I also like the smell and creamy consistency compared to Layrite. Also it&#x27;s a little cheaper. I&#x27;ve also bought the 3-pack deal from amazon and gave it to family members as a gift and they like it! I just wish they make an in between size (4oz - 32oz).</li>
    <li> The product was already opened when I received it, making it harder than what it is suppose to be. Literally, I could not even dig my finger into the cream/gel.</li>
    <li> This is not a pomade but a different kind of hair gel. Has a weird but pleasant scent. Easy to apply, ( there is a science to it, the right amount of hair dampness will provide the kind of result I want and there are many results depending on the timing and comb/hand strokes ) Washes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every gentleman should get something like this (whichever brand works for you) and know the skills to a handsome hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product lives up to my needs, I prefer another product (Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Hair Products) for better scent, better hair health benefit (organic and herbal ingredients) and realistic looking styling. It also lasts longer on the shelf even when used on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Suavecito, I am just frustrated that I have to use more than the amount I need for styling. So, It ran out even though I wear the other brand mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No harm in trying both.</li>
    <li> Great as ever. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My favorite pomade. Great hold, easy wash out and smells good too.</li>
    <li> It has a good hold, but it takes a while for it to take place which allows your styled hair to drift (depends what you&#x27;re doing with it). It functions more like a gel than a pomade, because it gets hard. It&#x27;s think, heavy, but mixes in well. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to style as other ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, you might like how it works but the smell might kill it for you. I sniffed it, it wasn&#x27;t bad but after wearing it you can&#x27;t get away from the smell. It&#x27;s a clean (more like a cleaner) smell. Not cologne like some say. If you think this smells like cologne you need to stop shopping in the discount bin at wal mart.  Tl;dr  -smell might be gross to you -gets hard like gel -weird initial phase of styling lacks good control/hair placement. -overall still has a good hold.</li>
    <li> was perfect, exactly what i expected</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the product works great</li>
    <li> It was a amazing transition from gel to pomade. I have really curly hair like super thick curly hair and gel stopped working for my come over. Now I can comb it in witch ever way I please. I&#x27;m buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> Smell is awesome, hold is right and lasts long !!!! A lil expensive but cheaper and better than layrite! over all good</li>
    <li> This is recommended by me for people with relatively long hair but if u have short bushy hair I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> Surprisely effective!!!</li>
    <li> WAYYYYY Stickier then it said it was. I tried to return this product since it will get no use, and it was denied.</li>
    <li> Holds well and smells great</li>
    <li> My husband used my brother&#x27;s Suavecito while we were home for the holidays and demanded I buy him some. Both dudes have fairly fine hair that&#x27;s easily weighed down by products. My hubby had been using gel and hairspray and was frustrated with not being able to get his hair to stick where he wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade smells decent, holds nicely, and sculpts well. Once it&#x27;s dry, though, it&#x27;s hard to manipulate without washing and starting over. It washes out cleanly without any extra effort. It doesn&#x27;t leave any flakes in the hair once it dries. And the price is right!</li>
    <li> 2nd time buying it, this is definitely my favorite pomade ive ever used, i have curly hair and i make a Pompadour</li>
    <li> Not bad, but I just started to hate the smell ...</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works much better than expected!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping, holds hair really well, rinses off hands with water, resets with just a little water and re-comb.</li>
    <li> Smells good, holds fast, looks suave</li>
    <li> Meh, This stuff was not that great, all the other reviews made me think it would be fantastic, maybe it will work for you. I have a tin of it sitting in my cupboard collecting dust.</li>
    <li> Great I prefer it to Tres flores. great pomade.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold and smells great. Don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the look you want. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like layrite, and suavecito is a superior product. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair jelly.  There&#x27;s a lot of good water soluble pomades out there.  I&#x27;d just as easily give Shiner Gold and Admiral 5 stars just the same.  Some people get a little too particular about the differences.  For the most part, the ingredients are the same.  Some are thicker than others, and of course the smell is different.  I really like Suavecito&#x27;s fragrance.  It&#x27;s masculine, unique, and not over powering.  Plus it&#x27;s fun to say....Suavecito...hehehe.  I&#x27;ve found that I kind of enjoy using the different pomades out there, as opposed to getting married to just one brand.  For some reason the prices seem to fluctuate between brands....I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive ones....not all that different and not worth the extra $$$.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with Suavecito.</li>
    <li> Great product that really makes my hair stay in place! (what little there is).</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Works for me! Me like!</li>
    <li> great product. washes out great</li>
    <li> It works great for styling my hair, and is easy to wash out. It lasts through out the whole day</li>
    <li> Bought this with og way to strong of a hold for my hair but definitely my go to product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want fop, I want suavecito! Great stuff, smells good, holds good, I definitely recommend  firme hold for longer hair, and when its gone your left with a pretty good smelling change jar!</li>
    <li> Smells good, washes out really easy and holds up way better than most other water soluble pomades. Best one I&#x27;ve found so far. Doesn&#x27;t even leave a stain on the pillow.</li>
    <li> good smell good hold. FYI stay away from the shaving stuff</li>
    <li> I bought some Layrite superb hold water soluable..and this some of the Suavecito Fire hold. The Layrite, smells good and holds good, washes out great. Recommend it for shorter loose or fly aways. SUAVECITO IS THE TRUTH. Better for longer hair. I SLICK mine back and into a ponytail. Nice shine and has a unique smell that I love. Like barbershop smell. Reminds me of a fresh cut. Easy to work into hair. No greasy mess or residue left on the pillow or couch after a nap like murrays. Doesn&#x27;t melt down your forehead in hot weather. Overall very pleased with this product and will buy more soon. I&#x27;m running low buy it ships fast so no worries.</li>
    <li> For the times the regular Suavecito won&#x27;t hold my thinning hair the way I want it (thin hair gets stubborn too!) the Suavecito Firme tames it every time!  I love Suavecito products and won&#x27;t use any other.  Just like the regular it acts like a wax and washes out easily like a gel with just warm water! Not as much shine as the regular but then I use a little regular with the Firme to get more shine! I put on the regular (about a nickle size dot in my palm} on top of the firm then comb both through my hair as I style it and get the firm hold of the Firme and the shine of the regular.  Again; I have thin hair on top and Suavecito hold the style I comb it in even in strong winds. I always buy both the regular and the Firme; but then I love Suavecito products and buy amost all their stuff and keep it on hand.  They have the best Bay Rum after shave IMHO and I love their little unbreakable combs too! All priced for the working man! I can always afford to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Try Suavecito and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The best hair product I&#x27;ve tried. Smells pleasant, stays on all day and my fav  washes right off in the shower! Awesome</li>
    <li> I absolutely liked the product although I doesn&#x27;t really have that &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34; touch. Throughout the day it becomes &#x27;hard&#x27; like hair gel would but overall I give it four stars because it does, indeed have a great hold and smells great! I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Found this at my local barber shop and have used it ever since.  It does not leave a greasy residue and it holds great.</li>
    <li> its was fast shipping. the smell is great and it is a water base that hardens!  i would be buying from top shelf again.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. If you are looking for a low shine/firm hold but not or your hair to be rock solid this is for you. A little pricey but worth every penny</li>
    <li> The product works fantastic, especially if you use water to comb it through your hair.  However, the smell is very reminiscent of axe body products ... it is supposed to be very manly, I would guess, but it is way too strong and too much like something from the grocery store deodorant aisle for my tastes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to tame and slick back my extremely thick, wavy, and frizzy hair. I am trying to let my short hair grow out for the first time, and i need some control. Suavecito Firme is perfect! Smells great and holds very well. Smells clean, but also a little musky. Reminds me of an old spice deodorant. Humidity does lose some of the hold, but a little water helps to reactivate this pomade. It does dry up 10 minutes or so after application, which may be a con to some people, however, I quite enjoy this as it keeps my hair under control for my entire work day. I do have to use quite a bit more than most people say to use, which is a bit of a bummer. I just got this tin a few days ago, and am a little concerned about how quickly it is going. But once I am done with this first tin, I will certainly be ordering a second one!</li>
    <li> My hair has a thin texture. My usual gripe about products is that it weighs down my hair, looks/feels greasy, makes my hair look even thinner, or flakes. Not this stuff. I&#x27;m able to blow dry my hair up and style it into a pompadour or &amp;#34;messily&amp;#34; toss it to the side with volume, all with this pomade. It has great hold, gives great shine even with blow dried hair. Washes out easily during my daily showers. After trying countless styling products from salons and drug stores, this stuff is the best for my hair by far!</li>
    <li> Holds hair and smells great! Does the job!&lt;br /&gt;...cd juarez chihuahua mexico , and el paso texas!</li>
    <li> The hold is unmatched and after work it washes right out with a shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the normal Suavecito for a few months and it has worked great. I have thicker curly hair, so after a few hours the hold would start to loosen and my hair would start to curl again. I recently switched to the firme hold and keeps my hair perfectly in place the whole day. The only downside is my hair is a little stiffer than I would like. Either way both Suavecito products are great.</li>
    <li> good product,&lt;br /&gt;smells nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but have been using Suavecito for over a year. I keep going back to it!</li>
    <li> Really like this pomade and it smells awesome. I can&#x27;t wait to try the brilliantcream.</li>
    <li> Holds as well as Layrite Super Hold but I prefer Layrite&#x27;s vanilla scent over Suavecito&#x27;s cologne scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I recommend to anyone with crazy thick hair. This product did the job in molding and holding my hair in my desired style.</li>
    <li> Been using Gatsby products for 8 years before this. Glad I made the switch.</li>
    <li> This has great hold, I compared it with Layrite strong hold side by side and the layrite holds better, but this is no slouch and both products do what they are intended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging (logo) on this tub and the product does smell quite nice and clean.  For the price difference between layrite and Suave, I would take this product as I feel it represents a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes out super easy, I sometimes just rinse my hair after the gym and apply more...no need to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair doesn&#x27;t get crispy like with gel, but it is not quite as pliable as a petro based product like murrays.</li>
    <li> After using Murray&#x27;s pomade for the past 2 years, I decided to change it up with this and despite the rave reviews, I am not entirely impressed. My hair isn&#x27;t as moldable after putting this in as Murray&#x27;s, although it does wash out much easier. It works more like gel than a pomade. For best results, put it in almost fully dry hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best!  My son won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Not to thick not to thin...just right. Not to mention great smell!</li>
    <li> Best scented pomade ever! Fantastic hold.</li>
