      <li>, I&#x27;m not noticing any differences, but that&#x27;s OK!  </li>
      <li>I love the way this makes my skin look and feel!  </li>
      <li>I love it; you will too!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product and buying these sample bottles is preferable (to me) over buying a large bottle.</li>
      <li>This one is in a class of it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best deal on these products.  </li>
      <li>The best approach I believe is to use several good products and keep it up.</li>
      <li>This is almo more convenient and cost effective because if you drop the bottle, you are bpnot out over one hundred dollars.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best skin product that I have used.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin feel</li>
      <li>Smoother skin texture, brighter complexion and more even skin tone.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m okay with it.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my skin looks.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I am using this and the Hydrating B5 Gel as a wonder-duo per many skin professionals&#x27; reviews.  </li>
      <li>but my skin has been neglected for many years.</li>
      <li>Skinceuticals has SCIENCE not just promises which is why it is carried by so many md&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>After cleansing and using a toner adding this to my beauty regimen adds a bit more protection to my skin.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and swear by it.</li>
      <li>I can be more generous with my application.  </li>
      <li>and I am satisfied with both.</li>
      <li>They have a good,&lt;br /&gt;clean line that many Spas carry and endorse.</li>
      <li>I love this product and buying it in the mini bottles saves me a ton of money.</li>
      <li>I love it and buying it this way</li>
      <li>Based on the science it may very well be great as a preventive.</li>
      <li>It gives my face a youthful healthy glo.</li>
      <li>Just wondering how this business is able to sell this.</li>
      <li>Even my husband remarked for the first time in our marriage that my skin looked \\&quot;particularly good . . .</li>
      <li>I am very fair and had more than my share of sunburns and teenage brakouts</li>
      <li>it original?!?</li>
      <li>Retinol, obviously, is magic for fine eye lines.  </li>
      <li>the vials are the perfect size for travel and I can reuse them to put other moisturizers and when I travel.</li>
      <li>It is such a good feeling!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Expecting the price to get lower.</li>
      <li>YOU MUST MAKE IT FRESH IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THIS FABULOUS AND EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT.  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a strong smell</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of early for a product review, but since Amazon asked, I think the product is nice.  </li>
      <li>This package was very securely wrapped and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>For a fraction of the price for the full size bottle, I was able to try this on my finicky skin.</li>
      <li>I read in the Allure magazine about some new break through&#x27;s and some good products that they recommended.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully it is very inexpensive and easy to make your own.  </li>
      <li>The results are phenomenal and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Great in combination with a sunscreen or topical lotion.</li>
      <li>skin looks fantastic, and I haven&#x27;t even finished one vial!&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The small bottles are great to keep the product from reacting to the sunlight and the air. Great price, too.</li>
    <li> The first time i ever tried this product was due to a sample the esthetician gave me after finishing my micro-dermabrasion. I loved it, after noticing how much smoother my skin was and how my natural glowy skin was coming back. I called her and inquired about the price, and of course was in shock for 5 seconds, a one-ounce bottle was $125.00 plus tax. I figured it was a great product and was about to buy it over the phone but i decided to wait. Im glad i waited because i only spent maybe 1/3 of that with this sample trial size bottles. Its a great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I use this product so it seems too early for me to comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness.      As for the product itself, it is clear in colour so it&#x27;s fresh.  I love that it can be absorbed quickly.  The smell is quite strong like other reviews said but I&#x27;m okay with it.  Just that I&#x27;m an overseas buyer, I paid $29 something for the postage but the actual postage on the parcel was only $4 something.</li>
    <li> I bought two because of the savings.  Six smaller bottles at a discounted price.</li>
    <li> Having small bottles for travel is great, but they are marked \\&quot;Sample Only, Not for Resale.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of early for a product review, but since Amazon asked, I think the product is nice.  I am using this and the Hydrating B5 Gel as a wonder-duo per many skin professionals&#x27; reviews.  I think my pores may look a bit smaller.  Other than that, I&#x27;m not noticing any differences, but that&#x27;s OK!  As I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my face, my skin looks good for 36, and I want to keep it that way &#x27;cause I ain&#x27;t getting any younger.    I read in a previous review that it kind of smelled like hot dogs.  I had forgotten about that until I started applying the product and instantly smelled carnival food.  It does indeed remind me of a beef weiner, but perhaps with a hint of mint!  I DO consider myself very sensitive to smell and would normally have a hard time with something like that, but honestly, it dissipated pretty quickly and I was not offended my own scent like I have been in the past by other products I&#x27;ve tried.  (I just wait a few minutes before I kiss the dog as she gets this look like she is torn between kissing me and eating me. But she&#x27;s little, I can take her...).    BTW - I have rosacea but I would not consider my skin sensitive as it&#x27;s only aggravated by food and the sun/heat, never anything I&#x27;ve applied topically.  This product also didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.    1/1/2011 UPDATE: Changed to 5 stars.  Still using this with the B5 gel. No problems at all.  I use this combo in the AM under sunscreen, while using a retinol (SkinCeuticals) and an anti-ox (Revale Skin) at night. For 37, I get only compliments so I have NO complaints!  ;)</li>
    <li> Someone actually said that to me today, 57 year old me whose acne scars are coalescing with my wrinkles causing Arlen-Specterish sorts of pouches to appear at the corners of my mouth.  \\&quot;Great color,\\&quot; she continued. \\&quot;You look healthy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This three weeks after I began using Skinceuticals C E Ferulic.  I knew that topical vitamin C had been shown in clinical trials to improve collagen production in aging skin.  A little Internet research, however, suggested that mostly vitamin C serum does not penetrate the skin.  On further investigation, I discovered a hint at TheDermblog.com that a fern-derived anti-oxidant known as ferulic helped topical C and E penetrate the skin to enhance collagen strength below.  Collagen: the fibrous stuff that keeps your cheeks off your chin and your neck off your collar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, a fantastic bargain in these cute little sample bottles where 6 bottles at 5 ml. per bottle equals the big old 30 ml. size for $100 dollars less!  A little goes a long way--one daily application apparently keeps on promoting that youthful glow for 24 hours.  I love it; you will too!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife. She says she sees visible results and that it is a great product.  The only complaint is that the sample size bottles tip over easily and spill.  With that being said, she said the price is great so she will probably buy them again anyway.</li>
    <li> I love this product and buying it in the mini bottles saves me a ton of money. I swear it&#x27;s helped take years off my face. I stopped using it for a year and saw a big difference. Now using it again, people comment all the time on how good my skin looks and I&#x27;m almost 40.</li>
    <li> For those who can&#x27;t afford to get a peel every six months, this is a great alternative.  After 3 weeks the large sun spots on my face were faded to the point that I no longer have to cover with makeup.  Works great around the eyes and smoothes out the crows feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I am over 60yrs old and I would not live without it. It gives my face a youthful healthy glo.</li>
    <li> Just wondering how this business is able to sell this. I just received my SAMPLES ONLY--NOT FOR RESALE order. How is it that I pay for samples?</li>
    <li> Recomended by my dermathologist, I use it everyday, before my usual lotion/spf.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Expecting the price to get lower.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the product.  It is a product I have used before.  The product has always been brown in color and the bottle was completely sealed.  This is 6 small \\&quot;sample\\&quot; bottles, unsealed, and clear in color.  I have not used the product and wish to return it to the vendor, but I do not know the name/address of the vendor.  Would you please supply these so I may return the product for credit?  I am uncertain that this is, in fact, the product Skinceuticals supplies or whether it is something else.  And I cannot understand why \\&quot;sample\\&quot; products would be sent for a rather expensive price($73.75).  My expectations were not met at all.    In advance, thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using skinceuticals CE ferulic for about two years now, some times I purchase the large vile while other times I purchase the small viles. My tone is more even, I break out less, the wrinkles that were beginning to form have stopped, and most importantly this is preventative anti-oxidant care.    My only compliant is that the small bottles do not add up to the amount of a large 30 mL bottle, it takes about 8 little bottle to fill a large vile. I have measured myself and they do not equal one another. However, my job requires nearly 80% travel and these are more convenient. I would suggest people splurge for the larger vile, even though it costs slightly more unless you have to travel frequently.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and you can&#x27;t beat the price of the travel size offer! I like to share with my friends and family also!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff does?  But, my wife thinks it great!  She says that it fights \\&quot;Free Radicals\\&quot; what ever that is?  All I know is that she looks great and her skin is beautiful.  If this keeps her away from Botox and surgical procedures I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size if you travel a lot  Great product been using it for years</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am 47 and am constantly being told I look 30. This definitely helps that.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001804EPS Skinceuticals CE / C E Ferulic NIB - 6*5ml Sample / Travel Size]]&lt;br /&gt;I have used skin ceutical products for 20 years. My dermatologist had a display in her office and I asked her about the product and she gave me samples of the Serum 10 , the B5 hydrating gel, and the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an improvement in my 33 year old skin after about 2 weeks. I went back and bought full size containers of all 3 products. It was very expensive for me, the most I had ever spent on anything for my skin but it was well worth it. Everyone I meet tells me I have beautiful skin and cannot believe that I am in my fifties. I am very fair and had more than my share of sunburns and teenage brakouts so it&#x27;s not just good genes. I am now using CE Ferulic, B5 hydrating gel, the same sunscreen and have added an eye cream. The products as you can see are expensive. I buy them from Amazon now, not my dermatologist and it saves me about 50 percent for the exact same product.  Skinceuticals has SCIENCE not just promises which is why it is carried by so many md&#x27;s. Doctors want to know the science behind the product if they are going to display it in their office. I have tried other products once in a while, doing my own experiment of putting the Skin ceuticals on one side and the other product on the other side of my face. It doesnt take long to see the difference.</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully every morning - it took me a few months to use up all 6 vials - and I noticed no difference in my skin. I&#x27;m 49 and getting saggy and have some wrinkling. I rated it two stars because it was expensive and didn&#x27;t noticably improve my skin. But it did no harm either.</li>
    <li> this stuff makes my skin look great!! the vials are the perfect size for travel and I can reuse them to put other moisturizers and when I travel. a little bit goes such a long way in each vial last about 2 weeks. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a strong smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks fantastic, and I haven&#x27;t even finished one vial!&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got these small \\&quot;samplers\\&quot;. A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Ten stars!</li>
    <li> I learned to use this product from a Dermatoligist I worked for years ago.  It is still the best under eye wrinkle prevention I&#x27;ve ever found.  AND YES, I still tan at the tanning salon! But my eye area never gives my age away!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product recently and am not sure how I lived without it before!  The results are phenomenal and I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.  You really save a bundle by buying the samples.  I think the cost of 30ml in the store was $82.00!  I was put off by the price but decided to try the samples which are significantly less expensive.  Very happy I did!</li>
    <li> #1:  Each bottle is labelled \\&quot;SAMPLE ONLY  NOT FOR RESALE\\&quot;  #2:  I used a 5 ml syringe to measure the volume of the bottles.  They each hold 4 ml, completely full, without the eye dropper.  But if they are samples only, made for giving away, Skinceuticals likely didn&#x27;t care how precise the bottles are.&lt;br /&gt;What is going on?  Are these some sales representative&#x27;s hand-out samples that they are illegally selling?  Does Amazon condone this practice?  I&#x27;m going back to the real thing, no questionable practices to worry about.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery.  The serum is clear and smells like it is suppose to smell.  I love how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Works beautifly.  Like the smaller sizes for 2 reasons.  1)great for travelling 2)you&#x27;re not opening a larger bottle and exposing it to the air.</li>
    <li> I use one and keep the rest in the frig to keep them fresh. They last for a long time.</li>
    <li> They are light colored, fresh, the small size I feel lets you put one in your gym bag, at home, then they stay fresher, love this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product from skinceuticals I use it with the face cream and I do see improvement in my skin. Buying the travel size saves money and it is convenient.</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this product - I never leave home traveling without it and this size is so perfect.  I use this product daily and my skin has never looked better - not greasy at all - my skin feel and looks amazing after this using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least 6 weeks, granted have missed a day or two in this time frame. I don&#x27;t see any results that are noticeable. I tired a Vitamin C serum that I did see result that worked better then this. I think your money would be better spent on any Vitamin C serum over this product. If you really want to save money, google homemade Vitamin C serums and make your own. Much cheaper with results, since Vit C serums can expire and not have the effect as newly made serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received my Skinceutical C E Ferulic order promptly and am very pleased with the product.  I have been using it for almost a year and have had great results!</li>
    <li> Since there are so many other reviews already, I don&#x27;t think I have to repeat them. This is a great product and deserves 5 stars. But the poor description for this product automatically deducts some points. The description states that each sample bottle is 5mL, but the actual volume is not even close. When I first opened the pack, I realized how small each bottle was and that no volume or weight was printed onto the glass. So I decided to experiment. I emptied the contents of a new sample bottle into an almost empty regular-sized bottle, measured the change in height of the liquid with a ruler, and multiplied by 6. With my measurements, the 6 sample bottles would only reach up to about 3/5 of the bottle. My measurements may not have been completely accurate, but I also noticed that another reviewer commented on this, so I am sure that the claimed volume is false. Because of the convenience of the small bottles and good price, I may still buy this in the future. The serum might stay fresher because they are all individually sealed, and you might even be able to share a few bottles with friends. But I want to let future buyers know that they are only getting a good deal instead of a great deal (currently the 1 oz bottle is selling for about $88 on Amazon). I bought this from APFD Beauty Supply through Amazon for about $40 with shipping, and the serum came clear (meaning that is is fresh). Shipping was also very fast.    Edit(#2): My first edit recommended the generic CE Ferulic by Cosmetic Solutions. However, after a period of use, I realized that results are not exactly the same. It comes out to about half the price of Skinceuticals and includes mostly the same ingredients. Unlike me, most reviewers find that results are the same, so it may be worth a try if you are looking to save money.</li>
    <li> I ordered the sample size to try the product and it is too soon to tell how the long term reaction of my skin will be. So far, it seems as if my skin is looking better and firmer, especially under my eyes.  A small downside is the smell, but everything for a better looking skin!</li>
    <li> I have to laugh at all of the people who waste their money on this product. At least here on Amazon the price is not too bad but on other sites people pay something like $146 for this!!  Here is a little tip for you all:  YOU CAN BUY \\&quot;L-ascorbic acid\\&quot; ONLINE FOR CHEAP!!!  You can mix up your own serum fresh daily or weekly and get all the benefits of this and actually better benefits because it will be fresh.  Also, the little product info that states that if the product turns yellow or orange it is OK?  WRONG!!!!!  Once it is \\&quot;oxidized\\&quot; it contains free radicals and is worse for your skin than using nothing.  In fact, free radicals will age your skin so it should be discarded the moment it turns yellow or orange.  The manufacturer won&#x27;t admit this because they know that their is absolutely no possible way to make L-ascorbic acid stable in a formula.  YOU MUST MAKE IT FRESH IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THIS FABULOUS AND EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT.  Thankfully it is very inexpensive and easy to make your own.  Please check out the DIY recipes all over the web; your skin and your pocketbook will thank you!</li>
    <li> My skin was inflamed after using the product. Skinceuticals products are very good but this particular one caused me have an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I agree with all the other reviewers that this product gives your skin a healthy glow and improves texture and decreases wrinkles.  It does smell like pulled pork but for just a few seconds when you apply it.  The savings with the travel size can not be beat compared to the full size bottle.  You will not be disappointed....</li>
    <li> I is written that it is samples and not for sale...????&lt;br /&gt;And the liquid is clear!? And as I know the ferulic has a honey color...&lt;br /&gt;Is it original?!?</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best deal on these products.  All three of Skin Ceuticals -- Retinol, CE Ferulic, B Gel -- are fantastic for anyone over 40.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many of such products and this really gets results.  Even my husband remarked for the first time in our marriage that my skin looked \\&quot;particularly good . . . brighter.\\&quot;  The CE Ferulic was recommended to me by an excellent dermatologist who said they use it for their $40 microderm facials.  The moisturizing gel is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.  Retinol, obviously, is magic for fine eye lines.  Can&#x27;t beat this grouping.  The only thing you need other than these three is an  exfoliating cleanser (the best for me is Zhen Papaya Face Scrub).</li>
    <li> Do not use too much (oil skin) I did not use on my chin. but I like it very!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and find it noticeably improves the condition of my skin. The small bottles are a good buy, although I don&#x27;t think they contain as much of the product as the larger bottle despite the fact that they are supposed to be an eqivalent number of ounces.</li>
    <li> This is great for your skin. My Dr. recommended it but it&#x27;s very expensive. Once it&#x27;s exposed to air, the color goes from clear to an orange color, after about 2 or 3 weeks which is normal, so buying the travel size bottles lasts just as long as the large bottle and a smaller portion turns orange at a time verses buying a much larger bottle for more money and having the whole product turn orange quickly. I love the way my skin looks. I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it. It took about 10 days before I noticed but my skin has been neglected for many years. I have lots of sun damage and I never used much to wash my face other than soap. This travel pack lasted about 8 months so a very good investment in yourself.</li>
    <li> After cleansing and using a toner adding this to my beauty regimen adds a bit more protection to my skin.</li>
    <li> For a fraction of the price for the full size bottle, I was able to try this on my finicky skin. It&#x27;s very potent. I wound up using it every other day. My skin became clear, almost radiant. And the ferulic acid is an excellent sunscreen I&#x27;m told.</li>
    <li> It did improve the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m still in the process of using it so I will evaluate it in time.</li>
    <li> A good antioxidant blend that when applied to CLEAN skin and allowed to &#x27;set&#x27;, soaks deep into the epidermis. It will remain active and help stabilize your sunscreen, which you would then apply over it.&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 4-stars because it has a STONG odor that does not seem to dissipate. I never wear it if I know I will be greeting/hugging friends. I will buy this again to add to my sun protection protocol.</li>
    <li> great product, love that its small so i only open what i need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also its encased in glass, so it&#x27;s definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent hydrating product perfect for long trips and flights,worth the price!!! Great in combination with a sunscreen or topical lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used SkinCeuticals C E ferulic for several years now with noticeable improvement in pigmentation problems.  I had a spot on my nose the size of a large pea that was very dark that has completely disappeared along with others on my cheeks.  I bought the samples less than a year ago for $35.00 online if you can believe that.  The year before for $29.99 a set of 6.  Unfortunately the company no longer carries them and with the economy in such bad shape prices have soared.  One reason I liked the samples besides the price was that the color stayed clear and not yellow because you were only opening one little bottle at a time thus not exposing the other 5 bottles to the elements.  When I first started buying the product in the full size bottle it would turn yellow halfway through because I was exposing such a large amount every day.  From what I understand, it was getting old and losing its potency.  Also, a great trick I have learned is to put all of the SkinCeutical products in the refrigerator as soon as I received them.  You will notice that the C E ferulic will always be clear.  If you have the large bottle, put enough ferulic for only 2 weeks in a dark glass bottle (small preferably) and add as needed, always keeping the full size one in the fridge. This will work with all the products to keep them fresh. If the C E ferulic is yellow when you receive it, I would return it.</li>
    <li> excellent price, packaging and prompt service...this is my 2nd time ordering from this seller and have been consistently pleased with service</li>
    <li> I definitely feel this is an excellent product and was very happy with the service I received in getting the product.  I would recomnmend it to anyone who wants to have younger  looking skin, as well as all the other products from them I use such as the Age Interrupter eye and face cream.</li>
    <li> Another great product recommended by my doctor.  It smells a little odd, but is really good for your skin.  My physician&#x27;s staff call this &amp;#34;liquid gold.&amp;#34;  It is rather expensive, but the travel size bottles are convenient and affordable.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this based on girlfriends feedback and magazines etc. I love it and buying it this way seems to be a great value!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product at a great price with wonderful, prompt service - can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years since age 40.  I feel it has had good results especially under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have aging skin and began using this only a few years ago. Used after cleansing, this product has a moisturizing effect, at least on me.  Some say the order is offensive; I can tolerate a brief little order for what it does for my skin.  Its called a &amp;#34;Prevent&amp;#34; but I think it is also a &amp;#34;Correct&amp;#34;.  After crashing the larger size bottle on my quartz top vanity, I decided to minimize the loss with the smaller bottles.  They are also nice for trips and perhaps also a saving!</li>
    <li> The Doc prescribed Skinceuticals Phloretin CF.  I thought I was ordering same.  What I got was \\&quot;Ferulic CE\\&quot; yet it was also labeled as coming from Skinceuticals.  It smelled differently, but close enough, I tried it.    I emailed the business that sold the new stuff to me, and they swore it was fresh, and that was probably why it smelled different.    They also said their 6 tiny vials equaled contents in a 1-ounce bottle.     I seriously doubt that.    When I have en empty vial, I will measure that.    It DOES seem to do what the original stuff supplied by the Doc did.  But if it costs same price, or more,via Amazon.com, as it costs to get it from the Doc, what&#x27;s the point?    I was VERY UNhappy with the bait-and-switch sales tactics used by the business selling the product via Amazon.       Jury still out.</li>
    <li> Ir seems to repair your skin.. it has a very \\&quot;funny\\&quot; smell, not nice but almost neutral, I don&#x27;t care as soon as it works. I really recommend this product if you want to give a boost to your face.. I have bought it twice because I use it 2 times per week seems to be enoguh for me, I&#x27;m 37. At the beginig I used it every day for a month... Very effective for wrinkles and tired looiking face, the size is very small but you need just a few drops to cover all your face, It last long.</li>
    <li> I am 48, with oily, light skin, min wrinkles but have had sun damage from just driving around in sunny Florida for the last 25 years. The worse ones were on my left cheek bone (drivers side - go figure!).  I am not, nor have ever been much of a sun bather!  Until 7 years ago I never used sunscreen on my face before leaving the house. Bad plan er no planning I should say.  NOTE: USE SUN SCREEN, and start young. The last couple of years I have spent over $3500 on derma-abrasion &amp; laser treatments (and professional skin bleach) for my dark spots/ sun damage on my face and had very little success.  To add insult to injury I found that the laser treatments actually made the spots worse.  Well . . .  I read in the Allure magazine about some new break through&#x27;s and some good products that they recommended.  Skinceuticals C E, Ferulic was said to rejuvenate the skin and a new Vivite product called Vibrance Therapy was reported as worked better then products that had hydroquinone in it (which may cause cancer) to fade sun damage. Hydroquinone I understand just retards the hyper-pigmentation, and takes up to 3 months to get good results but the bad news is the spots can come back if you are in the sun a little. (Great for Florida! - Not!)  The experts claimed the hyper-pigmentation was removed and more permanent with this new product. So what the heck, what&#x27;s a little more $ thrown at my face - you only have one and everyone sees it!  I started using Vibrance Therapy about 3 weeks ago, in the morning, when I got home from work &amp; before bed time.  I am very happy to say my spots have faded almost away!  I feel for the first time in years I can leave home without tons of base make-up!  It is such a good feeling!  I also have been using Skinceuticals C E with Ferulic (acid) in the eve or at bed time, ROC Deep Wrinkle Overnight Repair treatment every night - and a weekly acid peel for added rejuvenation. The Vivite &amp; Skinceuticals is a little expensive but way worth it.  I boughtThe Vivite Vibrance Therapy &amp; Skinceuticals C E, Ferulic at Amazon &amp; the ROC at Costco Club.  The best approach I believe is to use several good products and keep it up.</li>
    <li> These are a bargain at this price compared with the larger bottles. More bang for your buck! And they shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> And these samples ate the same formulation only at this price I can be more generous with my application.  This is almo more convenient and cost effective because if you drop the bottle, you are bpnot out over one hundred dollars.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and buying these sample bottles is preferable (to me) over buying a large bottle. I tipped one over one time and spilled a good amount, so the little bottles are the way to go for me. This is a great skin tightener. This package was very securely wrapped and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I kind of expected this stuff to be amazing after some of the professional reviews I read about it. Based on the science it may very well be great as a preventive. I, however was hoping to see corrective results in the areas of tone &amp; texture...Nada.  Believe me, I know results take time but I&#x27;ve used enough products to know if something is really good right away. I hate the smell (like smoked meat) and it gave me a sticky, dehydrated feeling that made me sad lol.  I&#x27;m know there is an arsenal of other products in this line that are supposed to be used for a zillion individual purposes but I think I&#x27;ll stick with something that addresses more in one product and shows me something (anything!) that makes me feel like it&#x27;s fixing problems right away.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin product that I have used. It replaces several other products that I had been using (not cheap ones either) and makes my skin look younger, fresher, and less reactive. I absolutely love it and swear by it. I am middle-aged, and have FINALLY found a product that works--thank goodness! It has even stopped my adult acne--hurray!</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product for exfoliation. I have been using it for years. It evens skin tone and moisturizes</li>
    <li> I look this product for how it brightens my skin. Buying the sample packs is perfect because one sample bottle is easy to carry and provides me with 4-5 days of applications.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  The best anti aging product on the market.  These are great for travel and also have the larger size for at home.</li>
    <li> I am not seeing any results after weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt; It smells like my sesame oil body spray............. just saying. And they are samples that are not for resale. I feel ripped-off&lt;br /&gt; I will not purchase again. Will stick to brick and mortar stores for my skin care purchases.</li>
    <li> I think this was a very good product and I will buy it again if I can get a good price on it. Only problem, I did have is that while storing it in the refrigerator to maintain freshness as recommended, one of the bottles burst, shattered the glass in pieces. I contacted the seller and they will replace it however, they said I will need to remind them in mid February (6 weeks from contact) when they have restocked the item.</li>
    <li> This was really a waste. It does noting. Another phoney product. I don&#x27;t see the purpose. I hope they will improve.</li>
    <li> I used this in combination with derma e peptides plus double action wrinkle reverse creme and WOW what a difference it has made!  Im looking younger every day!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  I noticed difference in first week.  No breakout for sensitive skin. Great ingredients in product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for years and I love it.  I esp. like these small bottles.  They are great for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for a couple of years.  People tell me I look younger than my age.  I&#x27;ll attribute this to my daily use of CE Ferulic...</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin look and feel!  Buying the sample sizes was a lot less expensive than buying just one bottle with equivalent amount.</li>
    <li> I buy these travel sizes to refill my bottle of skinceuticals. It costs less and works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Their stuff is expensive--however, it lasts a long time because it&#x27;s meant to put on sparingly.  They have a good,&lt;br /&gt;clean line that many Spas carry and endorse.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, but my skin did not like the Vitamin E and had some tiny breakouts.  I bought the 6-pack of the Phloretin C F, from the same seller, and now everything is fine. I am using the leftover CE Ferulic to treat my neck and it seems to be working well.  So, I don&#x27;t recommend this for oily skin people, but I do recommend it for dryer skin and I do recommend the seller.  Two orders now and I am satisfied with both. The price of the small bottles compared to the large is a great value.  Even if it is not exactly equivalent, the discount is totally worth it. Very glad I found this option.</li>
    <li> Smoother skin texture, brighter complexion and more even skin tone. CE Ferluric does it all. I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have tried all Vit C serums. This one is in a class of it&#x27;s own.</li>
