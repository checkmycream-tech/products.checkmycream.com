      <li>This timeless scent is perfect after a bath or shower.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>The price is excellent for the size.</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;ve never used it, it is an awesome memory creator as well. :D</li>
      <li>The perfect scent for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like perfume.  </li>
      <li>smells great and feels delicious.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy we&#x27;re all happy to get it.</li>
      <li>For her I must say great job</li>
      <li>Great paired with the splash.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I loved this ..grew up as a kid thinking</li>
      <li>Smells soo good.</li>
      <li>Good size and excellent price, soft puff and wonderful product.</li>
      <li>Best part of getting out of a bath or shower is spoiing yourself with a powder puff covered in lightly perfumed powder.</li>
      <li>Great smell, handy puff, nothing better to put on a damp body after the shower.</li>
      <li>My mother has used Jean Nate products since I was a child (around 50 years ago) and it has always been her favorite scent because it is not an overpowering scent like a perfume.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>Jean Nate powder has always been my favorite dusting powder.</li>
      <li>I love the powder but wish refills were available without the plastic case.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and lasts through the day without being offensive to innocent bystanders.</li>
      <li>It comes in a good size to last quite awhile and if you don&#x27;t have your own powder puff, it comes with one included.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is light and crisp great for hot days...and it comes with a refill for the powder.</li>
      <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering; I have two dogs and two cats who are always around underfoot, and this powder doesn&#x27;t even make them sneeze which is a huge blessing.</li>
      <li>Accurate and prompt shipment.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Love fresh clean smell</li>
      <li>I love how the scent is so fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing for some people - everyone has different taste.  </li>
      <li>It is much stronger, and stands out much more.  </li>
      <li>For me it brings back wonderful memories or younger days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been hoarding my precious, tiny supply of Jean Nate body powder since the eighties, when I found it wasn&#x27;t widely available in the UK.</li>
      <li>The new scent is much stronger, and does not have that sweet, ladylike quality that I always enjoyed.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews which mostly said it didn&#x27;t smell the same, and I bought it</li>
      <li>Jean Nate&#x60; powder always had a gentle, sweet scent that never overpowered, in fact it was just barely there.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy the smell, the coolness to the body, and the lasting smell as the day go on.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think she has had any on hand for quite a while, so this will be a real treat for her.</li>
      <li>I wore 30 years ago to the new one.</li>
      <li>Nate since Revlon came out with it, and have never tired of it, and just lately, my daughter told me that is one of her favorite scents also, so it appeals to all ages.</li>
      <li>more frequent people stand closer than usual, and some will ask what you are wearing.</li>
      <li>And silky soft</li>
      <li>The other reviewers were correct - it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and I don&#x27;t like the new smell as well as the old smell.  </li>
      <li>But it arrived fast and intact, with just slight damage to package.</li>

    <li> I love how the scent is so fresh and clean. Doesn&#x27;t over power, but you can smell it all throughout the day. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love fresh clean smell</li>
    <li> I read the reviews which mostly said it didn&#x27;t smell the same, and I bought it anyway - thinking maybe they were wrong.  The other reviewers were correct - it doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and I don&#x27;t like the new smell as well as the old smell.  Jean Nate&#x60; powder always had a gentle, sweet scent that never overpowered, in fact it was just barely there.  The perfect scent for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like perfume.  The new scent is much stronger, and does not have that sweet, ladylike quality that I always enjoyed.  It is much stronger, and stands out much more.  Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing for some people - everyone has different taste.  But I prefer the Jean Nate&#x60; I wore 30 years ago to the new one.</li>
    <li> My mother has used Jean Nate products since I was a child (around 50 years ago) and it has always been her favorite scent because it is not an overpowering scent like a perfume.  I&#x27;m getting this for her for Christmas this year and a bottle of after-bath splash.  I don&#x27;t think she has had any on hand for quite a while, so this will be a real treat for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hoarding my precious, tiny supply of Jean Nate body powder since the eighties, when I found it wasn&#x27;t widely available in the UK. Bought this when I was in the USA recently but am very disappointed: it isn&#x27;t even close to the original that I remember (and still have a bit of) -- you know how an odor can bring back a whole time in your life. But as some other reviewers have commented, this new one has a rather harsh, chemical smell -- not at all one I would choose. I wonder if the vehicle used is to blame, or if the formulation of the scent itself has changed. Whatever, it shouldn&#x27;t even be sold under the same name.</li>
    <li> This timeless scent is perfect after a bath or shower. The fragrance is light and lasts through the day without being offensive to innocent bystanders. more frequent people stand closer than usual, and some will ask what you are wearing. I&#x27;ve been using&lt;br /&gt;Jean Nate since Revlon came out with it, and have never tired of it, and just lately, my daughter told me that is one of her favorite scents also, so it appeals to all ages.</li>
    <li> Thank you just what I was searching.</li>
    <li> Great paired with the splash.  Affordable, too.</li>
    <li> Jean Nate powder has always been my favorite dusting powder. Best part of getting out of a bath or shower is spoiing yourself with a powder puff covered in lightly perfumed powder. It comes in a good size to last quite awhile and if you don&#x27;t have your own powder puff, it comes with one included. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering; I have two dogs and two cats who are always around underfoot, and this powder doesn&#x27;t even make them sneeze which is a huge blessing. The price is excellent for the size. For me it brings back wonderful memories or younger days but if you&#x27;ve never used it, it is an awesome memory creator as well. :D</li>
    <li> I loved this ..grew up as a kid thinking I was a movie star with the powder puff thing. This fragrance is light and crisp great for hot days...and it comes with a refill for the powder.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Accurate and prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> smells great and feels delicious.</li>
    <li> Great smell, handy puff, nothing better to put on a damp body after the shower.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell, the coolness to the body, and the lasting smell as the day go on.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Smells soo good. And silky soft</li>
    <li> I bought the Jean Nate by Revlon Body Powder for my mom as a present for her birthday. She is in her seventies and just loves the power.  For her I must say great job Jean Nate</li>
    <li> My mom loves this powder!</li>
    <li> I love the powder but wish refills were available without the plastic case.  I hate having to throw out a perfectly useful container with each order.  Haven&#x27;t the manufacturers heard of reduce, reuse and recycle.  I would prefer to reuse and not have to dispose of the container.</li>
    <li> Used this brand for years.</li>
    <li> Good size and excellent price, soft puff and wonderful product. I really enjoy the smell. The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, which I sent on to some one else.  But it arrived fast and intact, with just slight damage to package.</li>
    <li> Since this product is getting difficult to fins in stores I am happy to have found it on Amazon. I bought this for my wife. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy we&#x27;re all happy to get it.</li>
