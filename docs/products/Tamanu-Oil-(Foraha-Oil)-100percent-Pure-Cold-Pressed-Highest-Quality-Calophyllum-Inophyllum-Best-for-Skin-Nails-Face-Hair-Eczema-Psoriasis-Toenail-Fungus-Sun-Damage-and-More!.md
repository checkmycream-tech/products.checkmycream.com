<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cannot fairly review this product since I have decided that I have the world&#x27;s worst psoriasis skin and scalp - I could use almost any moisturizer and get the same result, depending on how many times a day I use it. As it is, I keep this product on my PC desk and when I feel my hairline and around my ears drying out, I put on more and it&#x27;s a bit expensive for this frequent usage. I had SO wanted it to work as I have almost anything else I have tried and have just about given up - RX products are no better and sometimes worse except with my Rx plan do not often have a co-pay - thus I can treat for &#x27;free&#x27; (thanks to my husband&#x27;s 28 years of military service) or I can keep on trying &#x27;new&#x27; products. I just know that I cannot continue to use a product that works similar to others that costs less. Each time I am SO disappointed but I am getting used to that too.</li>
    <li> Tamanu Oil is great for your hair, nails, skin,eczema,psoriasis,toenail fungus, sun damage and more. It is free from Paraben, Alcohol, Fragrance and Additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a few drops a day to help with any of these problems below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;acne&lt;br /&gt;age spots&lt;br /&gt;diaper rash&lt;br /&gt;shingles&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;ulcers&lt;br /&gt;herpes sores&lt;br /&gt;dry itchy skin&lt;br /&gt;psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;burns&lt;br /&gt;insect bites&lt;br /&gt;stings&lt;br /&gt;foot odor&lt;br /&gt;athletes foot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is good for a lot of different things. .Tamanu Oil is 100% natural and pure, cold-pressed to achieve maximum potency. I truly like using this oil is really different than the others. I can even use this on my chapped lips and it lasts all day no t like the other ones. I am so glad that I recieved this for free in exchage for me testing and my unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only. I highly recommend that you give this oil a try.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! It has help fade acne and age spots since I&#x27;ve start using it just a couple days ago. I&#x27;m amazed at the results so far!</li>
    <li> Did not use yet. But it smells like sunflower oil I used for cooking.</li>
    <li> The oil just arrived...so no results to report yet.  I am hopeful that the oil will do great things for my skin--feeling positive--thanks!</li>
    <li> The only con is the strong nutty smell. I will probably have to blend it with a carrier oil to mask the odor.  It absorbs well and leaves skin felling soft</li>
    <li> I love essentials and am always so excited to receive a different one. I have never tried using Tamanu Oil before.  Today when I received the package I tore into it. The Tamanu Oil is pleasant smelling, not overpowering.  The Tamanu oil is said to be very good for skin conditions, such as rashes, sun burns, and insect bites.  I actually have a bug bite on my ankle from playing out in the yard with my nephew.  I applied the Tamanu Oil on the bug bite about 5 hours ago.  It is no longer itching so I feel it is working.  I plan on using this oil to see if it will remove stretchmarks, I so hope it does.  I am pleased with this essential oil, it is useful, and effective. Oh, this is made in the USA, so you can feel good about helping our local businesses.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in return for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> So the smell brings me back a few years in my life, it reminds me of being at the fair around the chainsaws cutting maple wood. I personally love the smell. The oil comes out as a green color but absorbs into the skin very fast and leaves my skin shiny. High-quality tamanu oil is a rich, dark green liquid that’s easily absorbed by the skin. So you know you are getting a high quality when you buy this product. Pressing and grinding produces heat through friction, the temperature must not rise above 120°F (49°C) for any oil to be considered cold pressed. Cold pressed oils are produced at even lower temperatures. Cold pressed oils retain all of their flavor, aroma, and nutritional value. Tamanu oil derived from the large, blonde nuts of the Ati tree has been used by natives of South East Asia and the Pacific Islands for centuries as a cure-all for any kind of skin problem. Traditionally tamanu oil has been used to combat a whole range of skin problems and is highly beneficial as an antioxidant, antibacterial, and an anti-inflammatory.  I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this tamanu oil! Best oil I&#x27;ve found for dry facial skin. My skin looks fabulous - smoother and poors smaller after just a week of daily use. The I&#x27;ve tried many, many oils (marula, argon, grapeseed, apricot kernel, olive, coconut and on and on).Tamanu is a drier oil than some so I mix with a little jojoba oil. The smell is a bit woody but it fades.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice quality tamanu oil. I&#x27;ve been using this for my skin ever since I found out about it&#x27;s benefits. I haven&#x27;t been using it that long but it&#x27;s suppose to help lighten scars and help with eczema. It comes in a nice dark brown glass bottle with it&#x27;s own pump. Using the pump makes applying it so much easier than using a glass dropper. I usually apply this oil to my face after washing my face and applying toner. The oil is thick so apply sparingly but it definitely does not make you feel greasy. I&#x27;m hoping this lightens a couple of scars I have on my cheek but so far it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I will be updating with results later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product free for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This oil is really nice when applied to raw and itching psoriasis.  I really like this oil..feels healing when rubbed in.  It has a kind of strong scent, but it is not bad to me.  Thank you for a great oil for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying Tamanu Oil. I read that this oil is good for acne fast, acne scarring, burns &amp; blisters, psoriasis, diabetic sores, sunburn, dry or scaly skin, eczema,&lt;br /&gt; athletes foot, the relief of neuralgia, sciatica &amp; rheumatism, foot odor and body odor, unsightly age spots and insect bites. I used it for my dry skin. I have dry patches on my face.  But, my face is always oily. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. I use a very small amount and put it all over my face. The dry patches are gone. Greater product</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I like the results so far. Can&#x27;t wait to read the PDFs file I got as a bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never heard if this product before but it was worth taking a chance on it because it was inexpensive.  The product arrived exactly on time.  The oil is heavily concentrated and a few drops pairs well with a good moisturizer or skin firming lotion.  You can use just the oil to spot treat certain areas.  My skin looks like it&#x27;s glowing after less than a week of use.  No breakouts, absorbs fast.  Seller was very thorough and reached out to see if I was&lt;br /&gt;happy with my purchase and made me feel comfortable that I could return the product if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied,  I love it and wish I bought more than 2 vials! Great for an overnight hair treatment too! It&#x27;s like the &amp;#34;all-purpose&amp;#34; cosmetic product.  I recommend it to everyone no matter what condition your skin and hair are in👍👍</li>
    <li> I use oils daily and have been looking for a good reliable brand of tamanu oil because I have read about it&#x27;s healing properties and benefits for the skin! Tamanu oil is derived from a tree and naturally helps to reform and renew the skin. My husband has very bad skin eczema and when I was offered a free sample of tamanu oil by Skinzeal, I was beyond thrilled! The oil arrived quickly and well packaged in a dark glass bottle that helps to preserve the freshness and purity of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a very strong &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent, the scent is hard to describe but it is very similar to shae butter and walnuts. The oil is a dark thick substance and is very easy to apply and spread on the skin. I love that the bottle includes a very easy to use pump which helps to dispense the right amount of oil. The oil is very comforting on the skin and I enjoy the soothing effect the oil has on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying 2-4 pumps of tamanu oil on my husband&#x27;s eczema infected skin and I have seen a huge improvement on his skin! His skin is less itchy and his skin has begun to regenerate and grow healthy and eczema free! I also use this tamanu oil on acne, blisters, sun burns and irritated skin and this oil is simply great. It is quickly absorbed and does not leave the skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I do not really care for the scent, the oil is very powerful! It has saved my husband&#x27;s skin and also clears acne and evens out the skin naturally. I love that the oil is 100% pure and undiluted and the size is perfect for my travel bag! I would highly recommend this powerful natural skin healer to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Product delivered as promised--no problems. I would have appreciated some product information with the shipment. 4 stars</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it with essential oils to create my own moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love this tamamu oil, it has been an amazing addition to my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Eversince I started using it, I definitely feel my skin&#x27;s texture is smoother than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I use a pump of it and mix it with my daily moisturizer and apply as usual.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is moisturized the whole day, I did not feel any stickiness at all.&lt;br /&gt;My skin getting a bit dry as it is the summer time already, but this oil saved me from more damage.&lt;br /&gt;It healed my skin and made it more supple than usual.&lt;br /&gt;It is silky and fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it is naturally sourced, our skin will benefit more from natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> According to the current literature in both podiatry and internal medicine, no topical cream or oil gives a 100% cure for toenail fungus. Neither does the more expensive Jublia nor Difflucan. Only combined treatment by a podiatrist including surgery and a prescription medicine like Penlac produces a complete cure...and that may take nine months. This is a promising product with highly favorable literature reviews.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, packaged securely, and as described. Convenient pump-spray bottle makes application a breeze. The oil is absorbed into my skin quickly without being oily. Too early to judge results as I have only just discovered Tamanu Oil, but I look forward to seeing for myself. Very good seller.</li>
    <li> I just tried this oil.  The main reason I purchased it was for eye wrinkles.  Nowhere does it say in the description not to use in this area.  Trust me, do not put on your eyelids. It does sting. Also, the pump does not work. The oil just sits in the tube and nothing comes out.  It also leaks all over.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have some acne scars,sun spots, and eczema.  It made them look so much better. I like that this absorbs into my skin really quickly, I only use a few drops at a time in the area I want it in. I love that this formula doesn&#x27;t have a powerful smell like many other oils, the scent smells good to me. I like that this oil is 100% tamanu oil and it doesn&#x27;t have fillers. I also like that it has a 30-day money back guarantee. I like that it is cruelty-free and not tested on animals. I recommend this for sure.&lt;br /&gt; I got this product in exchange for giving my honest opinion, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Just not good, did not work for me</li>
