      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it has really helped me to not develop any more spots on my face.</li>
      <li>I can dab this on my lips and on the outside of my lips and it will absorb nicely into my skin EVEN THROUGH MAKEUP!).</li>

      <li>Overall, I have found that my complexion has evened out and my face has a nice glow to it.</li>
      <li>As soon as I received Derma e, I tried to put three coats on, because it is quickly absorbed.  </li>
      <li>My face always feels really soft and plump in the morning after putting this on at bed time :)</li>
      <li>Simple day cream, good quality and gentle.</li>
      <li>The smell can be strong at first, but it fades quickly and I find it very fresh, reminiscent of cucumbers.</li>
      <li>This cream is absolute luxury for your skin!  </li>
      <li>We have been using this product for several years and we haven&#x27;t found any better.</li>
      <li>I love it and the only downside is that I have no idea what to do with the other moisturizers I own.</li>
      <li>The cream is full bodied, but soaks into my skin well rather than staying on the surface as a greasy coating like so many other creams do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, keeps my skin soft and smells lightly of cucumbers.</li>
      <li>Very much worth it, especially if you have be gluten free.</li>

      <li>I really like this cream.</li>
      <li>, it smells like candy and fades away fast.</li>
      <li>I have severe psoriasis and this gives me more relief than any other product on the market.  </li>
      <li>This is a heavy moisturizer and great for my dry skin in Chicago winter.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs so well that I carry some in my purse at all times to use as a lip balm (my lips get dry on the outside and using lip balm that has to stay in the lines isn&#x27;t effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a heavy moisturizer and great for my dry skin in Chicago winter.  The ingredients are natural/vegan, no parabens, etc, the amount you get is a ton, and the price is great! LOVE</li>
    <li> I have been using this creme for years. It&#x27;s moisturizing without being too heavy, good for day or night and free of the nasty ingredients do many products have. Had a very pleasant, very light scent as well. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. Only cream I can use on my face. I have been buying for years! A 1!</li>
    <li> This is one of the richest, most hydrating moisturizers I have ever used. I have been using it for about a year now and in the summer I use it at night 2-3 nights a week. During the winter I can use it during the day since the elements are so much more harsh. The combination of oils and vitamins in this cream make it a winner. I actually like the smell, it smells like candy and fades away fast. I notice how plump my face is the morning after I use this. A must try. Plus it is not tested on animals or made with any animal ingredients.</li>
    <li> This cream is absolute luxury for your skin!  I have dry skin and after my nightly skincare routine this is the last step.  It feels cooling and extremely hydrating to my skin.  I also use as a mask (heavier application).  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Ooh, I really love this creme. I&#x27;ve been using Derma E products for what must be 20 years now. It&#x27;s very creamy, keeps my skin soft and smells lightly of cucumbers. A great winter face cream, if not all year.</li>
    <li> Mixed with coconut oil and baby lotion to make the best body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I always come back to this cream, even after bouts of temptation with more expensive, brand-name lotions and moisturizers. I love how light it is in texture, how clean the smell is, and how fresh my face feels long after I apply it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Jason 25000U Vit E cream, and was very pleasantly surprised. The smell can be strong at first, but it fades quickly and I find it very fresh, reminiscent of cucumbers. The cream is full bodied, but soaks into my skin well rather than staying on the surface as a greasy coating like so many other creams do. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight or dry anymore and my fine lines are starting to plump in again. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I Love it ... I always use it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a thick creamy lotion that goes on smooth and really works well for dry skin, leaving a moisturized or &#x27;dewey&#x27; look after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is awesome for the dry, winter months, but slightly too heavy for the hot humid summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works very well at diminishing pervious acne scars, and worked in no time to heal a really dry patch of skin I had around my chin.  Does not clog my pores or cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant, like an aloe-ey mild flower type, but dissapears quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cr&amp;egrave;me for a while now and when I moved wasn&#x27;t able to find it any more. But I tried looking on Amazon and voila there it was. It is the best dry skin cream I&#x27;ve ever tried! It works on my face and on the extra dry skin on the eczema on my legs. I love it and hope to never have to do without it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I love it and the only downside is that I have no idea what to do with the other moisturizers I own. I am sold on this product!    It is very creamy and a little goes a long way. I start off by dabbing a tiny amount all over my cleansed face and then work it into my skin using circular motions. It blends well and feels really good. The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t bother me a bit.     Overall, I have found that my complexion has evened out and my face has a nice glow to it. I highly recommend this product. It will not work miracles but if you are looking for a bit of a boost and want to avoid harsh chemicals than give this product a try!</li>
    <li> Received scarccream instead of the vit E crime ordered.</li>
    <li> Very excellent cream for dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the department store high end names for years and this is better than any others for a fraction of the price. My skin is smoother and I love the slight fragrance and feel of derma e. I also like that it is not greasy and my foundation goes on very smooth after letting the derma e soak in - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for very dry skin especially in the winter.  It does not leave a greasy feeling on your hands.  It blends well.</li>
    <li> This is gets five stars.  I will never use anything else.  It&#x27;s for very dry skin.  I used it on my knee when I had surgery.  I rubbed it in 2 or 3 times a day.  Great cream... Excellent.</li>
    <li> Gluten Free...Yes..Excellent for dry skin and you don&#x27;t have the greasy feeling that comes with a lot of moisturizers.  Very much worth it, especially if you have be gluten free.</li>
    <li> My husband fights cracked hands all spring and summer and this cream works amazing... it is the only thing we&#x27;ve found that helps him.</li>
    <li> I like very much derma e product, the cream is smooth, and leave the skin like silk. Smell very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about other products from this brand but this particular product is wonderful. The fragrance is subtle and not over powering. It is extremely moisturizing without feeling thick or oily. I use a small amount after my serum in the day time and for night time I use twice the amount. Thanks to this my skin is not dry anymore and when I wear bb creams or foundation I don&#x27;t get dry patches.</li>
    <li> I initially found this cream at CVS--which no longer carries it., so was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It deeply penetrates but is also very light--no greasy feel. And my skin loves it-I can use it in winter, when I want more moisturizing, and summer too because it is to light.  And I can&#x27;t believe how affordable it is!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times in the past - my skin likes Vitamin E. It&#x27;s a natural product and inexpensive. I like just about all the Derma e products I&#x27;ve tried and use several regularly.</li>
    <li> I have severe psoriasis and this gives me more relief than any other product on the market.  My doctor recommended a vitamin  E cream and I just picked this up at the pharmacy.  I can buy it for half the price on Amazon.  This stuff is not greasy, soothes my skin, helps it heal and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too greasy, doesn&#x27;t absorb well.  Too early to tell if it is diminishing lines.  If you put it on overnight, then wash off in the morning, it would work as a moisturizer.  Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, unless in time it does smooth wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have been cheated by so many expensive products online and in the drug stores, no kidding.  After I turned 60, I guess the skin simply is no longer the same as it was.  When my husband told me that he notices my smiling lines on my cheeks; I became self-conscious; decided to try many natural products, skin soften products, and expensive products at the drugstores as well.  After the years of trying various products, I am skeptical when I saw 1 4-oz cream costs the same as 0.5 oz or 1 oz beauty product.  As soon as I received Derma e, I tried to put three coats on, because it is quickly absorbed.  After 4 days, I smiled at the mirror.  Gee, this is the first time, the fine lines actually appear to be less visible, and almost no trace!  That is a fine product with reasonable price yet it works!  The other all natural products either don&#x27;t do a thing, or even moisturizing the skin.  I generally apply the ineffective cream or lotion on my feet or arms; not the hands.  The hands do so much work, expose to so much chemicals(without rubber gloves) and those products are NOT fit to help your hands!  Take it from an honest evaluator and consumer!</li>
    <li> Love this cream for dry skin! Extremely hydrating and healing!</li>
    <li> Love this cream ! I use it on my hands and legs. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> vitamin e is a naturally cosmetology</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for my hands for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much it can be greasy at first but it absorbs into the skin making it&lt;br /&gt;very soft and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I work a lot with paper so by the end of the day my hands are still soft and conditioned.</li>
    <li> I am acne-prone and the day after using this I had a few small pimples.  I had not had one pimple for weeks.  It seems like it is a good product, though, and many people report success with it.</li>
    <li> Simple day cream, good quality and gentle. Light feeling and gentle scent.</li>
    <li> I started using this face cream when I heard that Vitamin E helps get rid of age spots. I had started to develop quite a few spots on my face and didn&#x27;t want to end up like my sister who had to have hers removed twice. When it came I really liked the smell, it reminded me of cucumbers. I have used it for quite a while now and I&#x27;m sure it has really helped me to not develop any more spots on my face. I also have really dry skin and it keep me moisturized too. I really like this cream.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s psoriasis demands this product.  He&#x27;s tried a million of them, but this is so effective that we now subscribe.  He&#x27;s delighted with a fresh jar each month--no more flaking and his skin is baby smooth.</li>
    <li> I love the Derma E skincare line. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months of my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks. Approaching the eighth month and not a single sign of a stretch mark - highly recommend! Not to mention a little goes a long way, so the jar lasts a long time. Good price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Just purchased and am in love with it!!!  It smells great, my skin feels amazing &amp; cruelty-free.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores I shop.  Found it online and bought several jars of it.  It is the best vitamin E cream on the market.  I doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, goes on smoothly and softens my skin.  Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good face cream.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it keeps my hand soft and is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  I use it every night on my hands and my feet.  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had abnormally dry skin on my forehead/nose since I went through puberty (22 now) and this is the only thing that&#x27;s consistently cleared it up.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for my face but also use it on my arms and hands as it feels and moisturizes great!  Was shipped quickly and I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick. If your skin is on the dry side, it is good. It has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> my husband does a lot of outside work and his hands were dry and sore, I have had this before and ordered it for him and he is using it daily and it works good</li>
    <li> It is a little different from what I ordered a few years ago.  This creme has an odor that is not very pleasant.  However, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The product from Derma e is one of the best Vitamin E creme on the market. We have been using this product for several years and we haven&#x27;t found any better.</li>
    <li> the best lotion around</li>
    <li> love this product I use with anadlou naturals tumeric plus C enlighten serum and the results have been remarkable. I am no spring chicken, but my kids tell me my skins looks great.  For birthdays and xmas I am buying both of these products for my daughter in laws and daughter, they don&#x27;t break the bank either.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s so nourishing and pampering. The texture is perfect and smooth and it smells very light and fresh (I don&#x27;t know where the other person got that its sickening sweet and too strong, they must be extremely sensitive to scents) but overall I love this product. I have bad acne and acne scars and this doesn&#x27;t break me out and has seemed to help fade my scars. My face always feels really soft and plump in the morning after putting this on at bed time :)</li>
    <li> Very hard to find moisturizer. Works really well with very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s really helping severe eczema on my hands. I&#x27;m on my second jar now.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I use a small amount on the areas where I&#x27;ve broken out after washing with the Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face tea tree cleanser and it works great. My skin feels really smooth afterward without feeling oily. I&#x27;ve found that it helps reduce the redness/acne scars without chemicals like hydroquinone. The tub lasts a long time, too, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Since trying this product in January 2012 I have used no other moisturizer. My skin is acne prone and dry (and aging). I was using a dermatologist brand facial care system that I had to purchase through an MD and was spending hundreds of dollars on each month. That MD system worked great until my skin suddenly rejected it. Through much trial and error, I now cleanse my skin with olive oil and use this moisturizer day and night. It absorbs so well that I carry some in my purse at all times to use as a lip balm (my lips get dry on the outside and using lip balm that has to stay in the lines isn&#x27;t effective. I can dab this on my lips and on the outside of my lips and it will absorb nicely into my skin EVEN THROUGH MAKEUP!). I do a lot of stage performing and can also dab this on over stage makeup if needed. My makeup stays in tact and I can spot-moisturize! My skin looks great and FEELS great. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This cream is so nice! I love that it contains Vitamin E! It is light and smells great! It has replaced all my other body lotions.</li>
    <li> My skin is super dry , plus I had a bad dermatologist who overdid steroids &amp; caused my skin to become thin . If I don&#x27;t use derma e vitamin crème I&#x27;m chafed in the groin without it.  I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; it makes a difference.  It also does not stain nor is it greasy.</li>
    <li> great item love the smell.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my face as smooth as baby&#x27;s</li>
