      <li>Could tell a difference after the first wash.  </li>
      <li>My children&#x27;s hair has been transformed since we started using Hot Tot Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I appreciate that the product is gluten and dairy free as my girl has sensitive skin and allergies.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the complete line of Hot Tot Shampoo and service provided by supplier.</li>
    <li> Suds up nicely, without the sulfates! Rinses out easily. Love the results in conjunction w/ Hot Tot Conditioner. We finish off w/ the Conditioning Detangler as well to help prevent bed head. And scent is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> We saw these products on Shark Tank and decided to give them a try. We loved them so much that we haven&#x27;t used anything else since. I have two daughters with completely different hair types and it works great on both. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have asked the company to stop selling their products as &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and they haven&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.....these products are not organic and are no better than other products that cost half as much.  Nothing wrong with premium products that are formulated to be safe for kids and come at a premium price but there is something wrong with a company that represents itself as something that they are not.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!! By far the best shampoo ever...</li>
    <li> Saw this product advertised on Shark Tank.  Was willing to take a risk as hairdressers commented on how brittle my sons&#x27; hair was after using over the counter baby shampoo.  Could tell a difference after the first wash.  My boys have soft shiny hair without a fruity smell.  I also use the corresponding conditioner.  Works well with all types of hair.  Have since ordered this product for my infant twin sons.</li>
    <li> The best and the only brand I will use going forward for my daughter</li>
    <li> Lathers well and rinses out quickly.</li>
    <li> I hated trying to find something that would clean my daughters fine hair AND rinse out without the smells, colors, chemicals and other things that typical drug store shampoos use. They were horrible to wash with and seemed to take forever to try and rinse out. We took a gamble on this and I cannot imagine ever using anything else! Washing hair is no longer a hassle and my kids know it will be quick and fast since it does not take long to rinse out, AND their hair will be shiney and clean! I could not be happier and to know that my kids no longer dread baths makes out life that much easier in the evenings. Thank you Hot Tot! The best thing a friend ever told me about!</li>
    <li> after seeing this gentle hair care line for kids on shark tank, I knew I had to try it.  It&#x27;s not sold in our state so I have to order it online, but I love the product.  It smells so good and I can definitely tell the difference in my sons fine, curly hair.  you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It smells amazing. It is not super sudsy so it was very easy to wash out of my daughters hair. We didn&#x27;t have any issues with it causing any irritation to her eyes either. I followed with the conditioner (which is amazing as well) and couldn&#x27;t stop smelling her hair all day!</li>
    <li> This works really nicely and does not over dry or weigh down my toddlers longish, baby fine, curly hair or my preschoolers shorter, layered medium adult texture hair. My one complaint is that it is not totally tearless. If it gets in their eyes it doesn&#x27;t make them red but it does make them sting briefly. Perhaps there is not way to fix this with a non baby shampoo formula. The smell is pleasant for boy or girl. It works well but, I must be very careful when I use it. It&#x27;s a nice step between adult and baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. After using for a few days, her hair will look greasy and...kinda grungy. I really like the smell, though, and wonder if the results would be better on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Love the Hot Tot shampoo!  It works like a charm on my daughter&#x27;s hair, while being safe and chemical-free and smelling GREAT!  I&#x27;m picky about shampoos because of my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin and this is a great option.  I think the packaging is really cute.  Obviously very secondary to the quality of the shampoo, but as an added bonus, I bathe my daughter in the tub in our nicely decorated bathroom and these bottles look pretty around our tub rather than the ridiculous kiddy packaging of other brands.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works so well on my 2 and 11 year olds hair. I am glad I seen it on Shark Tank. You  Will love it when you try it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It rinses out very cleanly in the tub, there is very little residue. My daughter&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t tangle nearly as much, and her scalp is clear of flakes. I fully recommend this shampoo. My daughter loves the smell and loves the \\&quot;teera\\&quot; on the bottle.</li>
    <li> We tried Hot Tot Shampoo after loving Hot Tot Spotless Tot.  I have 2 daughters with very different hair.  One is fine and super straight, it is very prone to fly-aways and never really lays smooth.  And the other is fine and curly and prone to poufy frizz.  Amazingly, Hot Tot shampoo works perfectly for both of them.  The straight-haired daughter&#x27;s hair lays smooth and shiny but still has good body.  The curly haired daughter&#x27;s curls are defined, springy and smooth.  No frizz at all.  The bonus to having more manageable hair is the delicious smell.  It&#x27;s sweet and fresh, and just what kiddies heads should smell like.</li>
    <li> Love Hot Tot. Gentle on my kids sensitive skin and gets their clean and soft. Really recommend getting the conditioner with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Product is good but the packaging/bottle pump not working very well.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Shark Tank and bought some for my two sons.  I have to say it is the best shampoo and conditioner we have ever bought.  It does not weigh down their hair like other junky kids shampoos I have bought them or leave them tangled.  Their hair is clean, shiny and smells great!!  I am a loyal customer for life!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with Hot Tot products. I recommend them to anyone with &amp;#34;Hot Tots&amp;#34;. They smell delicious and are amazing. A little bit of the shampoo goes a long way. Makes lots of suds.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to review this product for my blog and really loved it! My toddler&#x27;s hair was SO silky and smooth! Oh and the smell!!! Sooo sweet and heavenly. I love burying my nose in her soft bouncy curls! The only downside is that its a bit pricey, but you need so little so the bottle lasts for months! Read my full review here:[...]</li>
    <li> I love this and the conditioner! My daughter has thin hair and this make it look beautiful! We have always had great service and both love the smell!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome Product I love the way it smells. It cleans my little girls hair so well with all the hairspray and everything else that gets into a little girls hair during the day it is awesome!!! I also love the conditioner and the dangler spray as well. My little girl has a very sensitive head and it removes the toughest tangles with ease.</li>
    <li> Did not do what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so good, she looks forward to washing her hair, and leaves her hair so clean and soft. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo. My daughter has very sensitive skin and allergies to many things. I have to be careful about scents and what&#x27;s in the products we use. So nice to find a whole line of baby products for my sweet girl. You can&#x27;t beat organic and mild products for babies!</li>
    <li> This product meets my needs for a hypoallergenic shampoo; I love it!  I have allergies to nearly every shampoo that I have tried....this one works for me!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is much more tame after using this product! Smells lovely and leaves hair so soft. I used the detangler after instead of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite kids shampoo.  I use it on my 1 year old and my 3 year old.  It doesn&#x27;t dry their little scalps out, it leaves their hair soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  The smell is so sweet too!  This is the only product I have found that is truly designed for baby and toddler hair.  Love it and can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner for little kids hair. I have tried everything for my daughter with long but very fine hair. this keeps away tangles and keeps her hair manageable not to mention it smells lovely!</li>
    <li> We love Hot Tot products, we exclusively use their shampoo, conditioner, styling gel and serum. They are all amazing and smell great too! I will be trying their styling spray next. Their products are great for kids with sensitive skin as their is no harsh chemicals in them. My two year old is very sensitive to products and also has eczema due to this we are only able to use certain products otherwise he will break out. He hasn&#x27;t had any breakouts since we&#x27;ve been using Hot Tot for close to a year now.</li>
    <li> Natural Ingredients and NO Harsh Chemicals--made HOT TOT a winner in my book before I even tried it. First of all let me just state how much I LOVE the smell of the Shampoo and Conditioner-it is impossible to not cuddle up and sniff your child&#x27;s hair after using Hot Tot products. The scent is fresh and reminds me of childhood-I love it!  My children&#x27;s hair has been transformed since we started using Hot Tot Shampoo and Conditioner. My son and daughter&#x27;s hair is shiny, tangle free and frizz free. My daughter can finally let me brush her long hair after a shower without any tears. So grateful I found these wonderful products!</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and recently received the shampoo and conditioner. I was AMAZED at what this product did for my 5 year old daughters hair! Most salon products I have tried on my daughters hair would weigh it down and even the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; formulated salon products were hard to rinse out. I have to say it is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my 5 year old daughter! The smell is AMAZING! A little bit goes a long way, when I pumped some into my hand I thought\\&quot; there is no way that is going to be enough for her entire head\\&quot; but to my surprise it was Plenty! After rinsing her hair you could feel how clean it had made her hair and then the conditioner was equally as AMAZING! I again thought \\&quot; that is not going to be enough for her whole head\\&quot; an again to my surprise it was plenty. I am SO impressed by this hair product line! My daughter has very fine hair as well and some curl and this leaves her hair soft, and manageable and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. The way her hair smelled afterwards was awesome! I absolutely recommend this product to all parents with children ages 2-10 not only as a cosmetologist, but as a parent who wants to put quality products that are created specifically for children and their hair which is different than a teen or adults hair.I am not in any way being paid to write this review. These are my true and honest feelings about this wonderful hair care line.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products for my kids. They&#x27;re gentle and safe and they smell so good. My kids refuse to use anything else!</li>
    <li> I bought this because my 2 year old daughter has a lot of curly hair and it tangles easily. I heard about this shampoo and thought I&#x27;d try it and it works better than I ever expected. I was hesitant at first because of the price since I don&#x27;t spend that much on shampoo and conditioner for myself but it has made her hair so soft, shiny, and most importantly, manageable. I would strongly suggest to buy both the shampoo and conditioner and see for yourself how great this product is.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but I haven&#x27;t noticed the great results others write about.  I&#x27;m not impressed, and I&#x27;m not a picky person.  I have found no improvements over the basic drug store products (J&amp;J type stuff).</li>
    <li> The smell reminds me of pet shampoo- once past that, the shampoo itself works marvelously!&lt;br /&gt;Loreal and J&amp;J were not strong enough and required several washes on the extra warm or playful days outdoors-&lt;br /&gt;With one wash, this shampoo does the trick. Our little girl loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I bought it when I was looking for safe to use on my 10 month old daughter&#x27;s CRAZY hair. I appreciate that the product is gluten and dairy free as my girl has sensitive skin and allergies. It smells AWESOME. I have tried several products on her hair and this is the first one I found that I will buy again...it definitely won&#x27;t collect dust under the sink. It leaves her hair clean, soft, and easy to style. Thanks for an amazing product that works well and is safe for my little one!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonderful on my son&#x27;s wavy hair. It also makes his hair smell wonderful and it feels so soft!</li>
