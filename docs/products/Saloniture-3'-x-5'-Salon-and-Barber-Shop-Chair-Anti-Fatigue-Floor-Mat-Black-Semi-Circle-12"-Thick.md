    <li> I think this mat is a leg and foot saver. I could not work without one..</li>
    <li> The product is not made well. It said that when you stand on it you can wear heels. That is the first thing I tried with a thick heel and it poked a hole right away. I would not recommend anybody to purchase it. Now, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth sending it back for what day charge for shipping fees. So I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Perfect for salon and feels great under my feet.</li>
    <li> I like this chair pad! very cushy!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. It was too big for my space. MY miscalculation, not theirs. I returned it . The company made it simple. Thank you</li>
    <li> i love this item my feet don&#x27;t hurt while standing on it very comfortable</li>
    <li> Shipped in great condition. Love the mat and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and cheap. Tried to return 3 unopened /unused mats out of seven and no one would return my request.</li>
    <li> My feet and legs say thank you!</li>
    <li> This mat is nice and cushy but tears easily, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The mat is the perfect size and comfort for my long days in the salon. I highly recommend this product! It said it would deliver in 7-10 days and I got it in 6!</li>
    <li> Love it just what I expected. Thank you.</li>

    <li> Great mat for a fantastic price</li>
    <li> ARRIVED ON TIME AND IS AS ADVERTISED.</li>
    <li> Excellent product  great for long standing</li>
    <li> Horrible, ugly and worst thing ever. It was discribed as color black but I received gray. Texture of the mat is like sponge . Soon as I steped on it ripped off and it makes foot prints. You literally have to wipe it with wet mop.  Edge of the mats doesn&#x27;t lay flat it lifts so you can trip over. So thin cheap rubber.Not only that it has glue mark all around the edges. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do with this ugly thing. I bought 6 of them and they are just sitting in my storage taking up my room. Never ever bye this item. I&#x27;ve got fooled.</li>
    <li> Nice pad. so soft to stand on</li>
    <li> Really pleased with delivery and the product is perfect, just what i wanted.....5 stars</li>
    <li> I purchased this mat approximately 3 weeks ago and it has been in use at my salon. It looks great but I&#x27;m concerned because 4 bubbles have started to appear on the mat. Not sure how well this will hold up.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made. Poor quality. Knock off. Bought the same one on ebay and they look totally different</li>
    <li> It feels so good under my feet</li>
    <li> Love it very well made. Very comfortable</li>
