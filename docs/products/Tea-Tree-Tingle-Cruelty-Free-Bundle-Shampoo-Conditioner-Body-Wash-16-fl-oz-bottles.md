<li> I almost suspect it might be grey</li>
<li> Not a happy customer right now.</li>
<li> Would recommend tea tree for anyone with dry or acne prone skin.</li>
<li> It has helped with my dry and itchy scalp.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not great but a decent shampoo.</li>
<li> Other items were sticky and about 1/4 of the body wash had leaked out.  </li>
<li> I was looking for a replacement for the Wen due to cost and having to always order on line.</li>
<li> I would definitely give as a gift for a hard to shop for person.</li>
<li> The conditioner just felt like dollar store conditioner and it smells a little like cigarettes to me.</li>
<li> Struggled with terrible dandruff this winter and tried many products.</li>
<li> Was not impressed with the conditioner.</li>
<li> shampoo - is useless, it just makes knots in my hair, like it’s impossible to WASH hair with this stuff, even without product for the day in my hair</li>

    <li> works well enough, and i like the fact that it has tea tree oil in all 3 items, plus the price is very good</li>
    <li> These products rock! The body wash makes your skin tingle when used. The shampoo and conditioner tingles when in hair and for a bit when rinsed out. It has made my hair soft and more manageable. It has helped with my dry and itchy scalp. It smells awesome. I will be getting more when I run out for sure. :-)</li>
    <li> very strong peppermint smelling, avoid sensitive areas as they will begin to feel very cool when using this wash.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the smell and way it makes my hair smell. I also love that it is free from harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use the shampoo &amp; conditioner before; still love it. The body wash was just as good. I used it on my face w/ sugar as a facial scrub.</li>
    <li> I love these products and they arrived just when I had run out!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves them! Tea tree smells nice and has antifungal properties.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> Struggled with terrible dandruff this winter and tried many products. Tried this out and within days it was gone! Smells great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff but a little pricey</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay, not as good as the Wen Tea Tree. I was looking for a replacement for the Wen due to cost and having to always order on line. I have gone back to Wen.</li>
    <li> I love these products for their light scent, the tingling sensation they give.  The shampoo sucks the moisture out of my hair, the conditioner leaves my hair (which is very short, growing out highlights, fine) tangled, and the body wash leaves my skin feeling a bit dried out.  I like that there&#x27;s no animal testing on these products.  I like that my scalp is no longer itchy and flaky.  I would buy these products again, despite the drawbacks, as on the whole I think I&#x27;m better off on the whole now than I was using other products.</li>
    <li> Really like the body wash, leaves you feeling refresh. Still trying out shampoo. Does leave scalp invigorated.</li>
    <li> I used my mom&#x27;s and knew I needed to get my own. Not only did I get the shampoo and conditioner but also the body wash. I feel clean and invigorated after using these products. They smell good too!</li>
    <li> Love these products but don&#x27;t have a Trader Joe&#x27;s near me.  The product quality is great as always, but my box arrived with the body wash leaking from a cracked top. Other items were sticky and about 1/4 of the body wash had leaked out.  This was during the big holiday rush, so I understand &amp;#34;things happen&amp;#34;.  Still love the product and the fact that I can order it.</li>
    <li> Nice tingle fast shipping great product thank you</li>
    <li> These three items were wrapped so securely, there was no chance they would spill. There&#x27;s a fresh, healthy scent, and a cool, invigorating feel that leaves your scalp and skin fresh. It&#x27;s a bit less sudsy than many other shampoos, but that&#x27;s a good indication that the produce is free of unhealthy chemicals that strip your hair and can be hazardous to your health. A real beauty product that&#x27;s cruelty free - and a great price, too!</li>
    <li> All three of these are a staple now in my routine. I love this product because of the pure ingredients, the tingle and the aroma.  It&#x27;s also cruelty free. Thanks Trader Joe for producing it and thanks Amazon for supplying it for those of us who don&#x27;t have a store near us!</li>
    <li> Great product, great store. These products really does tingle! WOW! I wish there were a Trader Joe&#x27;s nearer my house.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband to try because it was a better deal than his shampoo. He currently uses Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo and Conditioner because of the tingle effect. He says Trader Joe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have the tingle effect he was hoping for. I used it just to see and after about 30 seconds I noticed a lot of tingling! It gave my hair a lot of volume and I love the fact that it is cruelty free but I believe my Husband and I will both stick with our current brand of shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I love the tingle I felt in my hair when I conditioned and shampooed my hair. This product made my 4c natural hair so much more manageable!!</li>
    <li> the shampoo seems different than what I purchased in the store. it&#x27;s even a different color!</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift.  My son was pleased with the products.</li>
    <li> Nice tingly sensation with the shampoo and body wash. Was not impressed with the conditioner. Feels great on my scalp even use either shampoo or body wash to wash face.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo keeps my hair in great shape.  Just trying the Conditioner for the firs time and like it a lot.  Love the Body Wash, they all smell good and feel good.  They really do tingle!!</li>
    <li> Buy at the store if you possibly can. They are totally worth the price there ($3 each!) They are a great alternative to traditional dandruff shampoo that test on animals and has a ton of chemicals. The body wash is also great for dry skin, and is simply invigorating. My husband and I both use it, even though he has dandruff and I don&#x27;t. for my hair, it gives me a lot of volume and just a really great deep clean that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the price is right. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is exactly as described</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for this trio and only received the shampoo and conditioner only!! Not a happy customer right now.</li>
    <li> The conditioner - is WONDERFUL. it’s the best conditioner I’ve ever used, it both feels great and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo - is useless, it just makes knots in my hair, like it’s impossible to WASH hair with this stuff, even without product for the day in my hair it actually makes it more difficult than using water, strange stuff that doesn’t tingle or smell nice - I almost suspect it might be grey-market.&lt;br /&gt;Body Wash - Meh - because it lacks that key ingredient (laurel sulfate) it doesn’t suds up, it’s like washing with nothing and leaves my skin feeling rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly buy their conditioner again, but never again to the shampoo and body wash.</li>
    <li> Great smelling shampoo but it is very abrasive and after using it everyday my hair felt like straw and was always tangled. I&#x27;ve cut back to using it once and awhile because I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is similar, it makes my skin feel sticky but I think its because it doesn&#x27;t have all the extra additives most body washes have. I still use it daily and love the smell.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this was a grocery store product as we do not have this retailer in our area. The product was cheap and didn&#x27;t lather well. The conditioner just felt like dollar store conditioner and it smells a little like cigarettes to me. It may not to you, my husband said he liked the smell.</li>
    <li> I like the tingly feeling it leaves all over when you are done..the fact that it leaves no fragrance after is puzzling to me</li>
    <li> This bundle is great.  The shampoo and body wash both lather nicely and leave a fresh minty sensation, and the conditioner works well.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and liked it so much I had to get the set. The shampoo really helps dry scalp due to winter weather or dry heat in you house which always is very drying to scalp and skin! The body wash was great for me cause I get acne on my back, and is very minty refreshing! Would recommend tea tree for anyone with dry or acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I like body wash, shampoo &amp;  conditioner. It does nothing for my itchy head but it smells nice. It&#x27;s not great but a decent shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been so soft!</li>
