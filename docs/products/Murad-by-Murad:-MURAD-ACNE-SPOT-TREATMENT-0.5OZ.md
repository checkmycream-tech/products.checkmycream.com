      <li>amazing product would recommend to anyone at any age</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s anti-aging and healing properties of that oil is truly amazing,</li>
      <li>However, this one seems to be a nice balance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for occaisonal breakouts and really isn&#x27;t drying (I have combination skin).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own but is supercharged when used with the exfoliating treatment gel.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get acne often, but would have liked a product that expedited the process of healing/clearing.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s most effective is using it at night before you go to bed.</li>
      <li>but when she runs out she makes me buy more.</li>
      <li>no wonder so many celebrities swear by it.</li>
      <li>I also use the acne gel for more my forehead, where I tend to get most pimples.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>This is ok.</li>
      <li>my skin b/c that&#x27;ll just cause more.</li>
      <li>I have tried SO many products for my acne.  </li>
      <li>If I get a blemish that may turn into acne, I use Murad and most of them are gone overnight.</li>
      <li>In about two days your acne will be better.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>The very best spot treatment, look no further.</li>
      <li>I had used a mask type product from murad before and it seemed to work better.</li>
      <li>Since I do not get many flare ups anymore, I don&#x27;t go through the tube very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Glad I am able to buy this for my child at a Cheap price.</li>
      <li>This Murad Acne Spot Treatment is an excellent product for any type of breakout, I couldn&#x27;t find any other product that works so well..</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I decided this product would fit my needs.</li>
      <li>Great for blackheads and deep pimples.</li>
      <li>The Murad skin care line products can be quite costly, but I was pleased to be able to order this item at a reasonable price from this seller.</li>
      <li>I originally picked it up at Sephora, then reordered again from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Cannot return as I did not save an original package.</li>
      <li>FOR ME this doesn&#x27;t do anything special over a store brand.  </li>
      <li>So far, this stuff is amazing...</li>
      <li>But when they do happen I love to use murad products because there really gentle.</li>
      <li>I still have an almost full tube</li>
      <li>I ended up returning the product before I even tried it because after a quick call to Murad</li>
      <li>If you experience this I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but if you have regular breakouts I&#x27;m sure this will work to reduce and protect you from more breakouts.</li>
      <li>I like this product more than clean and clear.</li>
      <li>It does tingle when you first apply but you will have noticeable results the morning after!</li>
      <li>and I rarely have breakouts anymore.</li>
      <li>It remained the same until the blemish cleared up on its own.</li>
      <li>I make sure to keep my skin moisturized when I use it b/c of the sulfur, but I was pleasantly surprised that it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While benzoyl peroxide is far better at clearing up acne than salicylic acid is, neither have the spot treatment or weekly mask abilities that sulphur has.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this Murad Acne Spot  Treatment every time I clean my face, as same as many of my family members.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with the PMD personal microdermabrasion system for acne.</li>
      <li>When I first got it, I would put it on, than immediately moisturize.  </li>
      <li>another one and those weeks demonstrated how my face really missed this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>I stopped to use it because: first, it does not help at all.</li>
      <li>that have no pressure and a more solid type of extraction.</li>
      <li>It really zaps zits--overnight!</li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works on acne below the skin.</li>
      <li>That blemish would scab up and around it 2 or 3 new blemishes would appear, and they were the kind that would feel a lot of pressure, develop a head, and if I used an aestheticians tool on them, yellow pus would come out.</li>
      <li>If I consistently use this, it pretty much takes care of all my acne.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely has prevented any pimples for 3+ years.</li>
      <li>Gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>It works fairly fast.....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why murad is changing to the fast acne spot cream.</li>
      <li>I tried to just apply a tiny amount to each blemish and the same kind of thing would happen.</li>
      <li>I use it in the early afternoon, evening, and then right before bed.</li>
      <li>When you have dry skin, it is important to exfoliate because flaking skin will clog your pores and cause the acne.  </li>
      <li>MORE OR LESS CORRECT BUT BURNED THE SKIN</li>
      <li>I will be sticking with this particular one</li>
      <li>I rated 4 stars because of the high price.</li>
      <li>I can still use it, it just takes a little more treatment and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, when applied it does leave an off white residue on you, meaning it really is only going to go on during night, which is fine for me at least.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said, sulphur is a new component of acne care that&#x27;s just coming into the mainstream now.  </li>
      <li>I use a light application on my entire face daily.</li>
      <li>The first stage of the acne passed, where it is oily and sore and produces white heads, but now I have the pigmented darker colored spots where the acne was and some raised bumps that just won&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>I was so disappointed because I read all these reviews and searched online for a good product, and I love the facial mask I use from them, which is a sulfur based product.</li>
      <li>It works extremely well to quickly eliminate zits.  </li>
      <li>It controls the acnefrom redness to inflamation, leaving the clean skin and acnes are gone in 1 to 2 days with minimun appearance, less noticeable.</li>
      <li>See a dermatologist with professional, medical-grade products.</li>
      <li>I used to get frequent breakouts across my chin area.</li>
      <li>but well worth the investment due to the amount of time it lasts..</li>
      <li>I have been trying out different spot treatments recently and what seems to be the most common problems is that they either aren&#x27;t effective enough or are too harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the investment and will last a long time though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it: most high-end products are worthless, they have the same ingredients that middle-range products at the drugstore have.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Check out thebeautybrains dot com.  Cosmetic scientists tell us what we&#x27;ve known all along: high end products are no different than mid-range ones.      That said, sulphur is a new component of acne care that&#x27;s just coming into the mainstream now.  While benzoyl peroxide is far better at clearing up acne than salicylic acid is, neither have the spot treatment or weekly mask abilities that sulphur has.  Murad is the only spot treatment I&#x27;ve found with sulphur; I also often use Proactiv&#x27;s refining mask, which also has sulphur in it.  Murad&#x27;s spot treatment works like a dream.  If you get it on the skin around the acne, it won&#x27;t burn and peel, like using 10% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment would.  It shrinks the pimple without sucking it dry, either.  Be sure you shop around for the best price, too - I got mine for $9, with shipping, on ebay.  It looks like it&#x27;s a lotta money, but the spot treatment is runny - this will last me years, or until it goes rancid.</li>
    <li> My go-to for on-the-spot acne treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Murad Acne Spot  Treatment every time I clean my face, as same as many of my family members. It controls the acnefrom redness to inflamation, leaving the clean skin and acnes are gone in 1 to 2 days with minimun appearance, less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works for me.  I have had acne since I was a teenager.  I still have it, and I&#x27;m 31.  If I consistently use this, it pretty much takes care of all my acne.  I am not an extreme case, but I average about five or six noticeable pimples on any given day.  This reduces them down to a minimally noticeable two or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry/combination skin. If any of you have skin like mine, here is my acne advice.  Hot wet washcloth scrub every morning and night.  Use moisturizer with some alpha hydroxy.  When you have dry skin, it is important to exfoliate because flaking skin will clog your pores and cause the acne.  But don&#x27;t be too harsh.  Change your pillowcase!  If you have long hair and don&#x27;t wash it at night, put it back in a ponytail before going to bed.  Exercise.  It helps circulation under the skin and destresses.  Stress can also cause acne, so find other ways to destress.  Drink lots of water and get good sleep.  I&#x27;ve also found that vitamins and fish oil pills help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please please use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years.  It works extremely well to quickly eliminate zits.  I swear by it.</li>
    <li> I stopped to use it because: first, it does not help at all. second, When I woke up in the morning I noticed that on the same place where I put a creme some new acnes appeared. Cannot return as I did not save an original package. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Price is good and quality is excellent! I used that for some time and lost. Only few weeks past until I got another one and those weeks demonstrated how my face really missed this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried SO many products for my acne.  I have whiteheads, blackheads, cysts - you name it, I have it.  Nothing seems to work...I decided to order this product to see if it would work.  I just received it yesterday.  I had about four big pimples so I applied the treatment to them about three times yesterday.  This morning, they are almost gone!  So far, this stuff is amazing...I hope it stays that way!</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff for my daughter. She uses it sparingly, but she swears buy it. I don&#x27;t have to buy it too often, as a little does wonders - but when she runs out she makes me buy more. I can&#x27;t think of a better endorsement than that!</li>
    <li> I picked this up in a store without having read any reviews, I just needed something for  on-the-spot treatment. With a little bit of commitment this stuff can change your acne outlook! It says you can use it 1-3 times a day, and I have been. What&#x27;s most effective is using it at night before you go to bed. It&#x27;s a sulfur-based product (which complements the salycic acid wash and pore therapy I use [Obagi]) and doesn&#x27;t cause the skin to dry out for me. I use it in the early afternoon, evening, and then right before bed. Before bed I always pile it on on zits instead of rubbing it in. In the morning you might have some crusty stuff but it washes or peels off (and doesn&#x27;t stain sheets and pillowcases like I&#x27;ve read with some benzoyl peroxide solutions). It doesn&#x27;t make them disappear overnight but greatly reduces them, and helps them disappear in a day or two. This works well for zits that are under the skin and whiteheads. Not sure how it would work on blackheads.   I have normal to oily skin and am experiencing nasty breakouts since stopping birth control a few months ago.   Another tip, I always wash my hair and pull it back before bed to keep it off my face.  I rated 4 stars because of the high price. I think it&#x27;s worth the investment and will last a long time though.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning the product before I even tried it because after a quick call to Murad I learned the tube I received had been expired since last year. No good at all. Just be wary if you purchase this from anywhere except Murad.</li>
    <li> The Murad Acne Spot Treatment is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  You put it on a problem area you see starting to form, and within about 2 to 3 days there is no sign of the problem spot anymore.  The one thing I did notice, is you have to put it on and let it dry for it to work.  When I first got it, I would put it on, than immediately moisturize.  That didn&#x27;t do anything.  You need to wait about 10 minutes or so and the add your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Murad acne spots treatment is a good product, just in a week you will see the results.  Try it you won&#x27;t bee disappointed! yes I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used to get frequent breakouts across my chin area. It was the bane of my life, and I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on various cleansers and acne treatments with disappointing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this. I originally picked it up at Sephora, then reordered again from Amazon. This is the only treatment that has gotten my breakouts under control. I actually have clear skin! It&#x27;s amazing! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, thousands of dollars on trial and error and I finally found my holy grail of acne treatments.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best place to shop, best prices and quickest delivery. This Murad Acne Spot Treatment is an excellent product for any type of breakout, I couldn&#x27;t find any other product that works so well..and I do try a lot of products. I broke out horribly when my landlord sprayed her garden and MY ac unit, it looked like chicken pox all over my face, I was really fearful I would be scarred for life, then I tried this product and after 1 week, it all cleared away and I am as beautiful as ever!! I keep 1 in my purse at all times.</li>
    <li> I like this product more than clean and clear. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make my skin tight. However, when applied it does leave an off white residue on you, meaning it really is only going to go on during night, which is fine for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product will last a month or two, if not more. This is a good duration for me and I have no regrets paying for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a thin amount mostly to my forehead area (combination skin!), and I can&#x27;t give a proper review on if the product works well or not. For me, I have post-acne acne, at least that&#x27;s what I like to call it. The first stage of the acne passed, where it is oily and sore and produces white heads, but now I have the pigmented darker colored spots where the acne was and some raised bumps that just won&#x27;t go away. This product hasn&#x27;t seemed to help them go away, but no new acne has appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have darker skin (Romanian-born), and have always had these acne scar-type after effects that stay on for months. If you experience this I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but if you have regular breakouts I&#x27;m sure this will work to reduce and protect you from more breakouts.</li>
    <li> I had a flurry of little pimples on my forehead and a large one on my chin.  Put this on last night and this morning my forehead is clear and my chin is much smaller. YAY!!</li>
    <li> Reading all these positive reviews , I ordered this costly product for my wife who has an acne coming up on face every other day But found it as not useful at all. I do not know why why people pay so much for such crap products. hate it</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago. I have combination skin, and because this has sulfur, I was worried it would dry my skin out. I used it as a spot treatment, but then began to spread a tiny bit all over my face at night (then putting lotion on to avoid over drying/flaking). It&#x27;s worked pretty well. I make sure to keep my skin moisturized when I use it b/c of the sulfur, but I was pleasantly surprised that it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my blackheads (and I have to be careful not to over dry my skin b/c that&#x27;ll just cause more. But whenever I feel a pimple coming up (I dont have cystic acne but sometimes ill get some deep pimples) I put it on for a few days and it&#x27;s gone. I&#x27;ll admit that I sometimes pick at my skin, and obviously the sulfur will burn a little on any open parts, but I feel that it does actually speed up the healing process. $18 is pricey but I&#x27;m usually open to trying something new to see if it will help my acne. I also use it on any breakouts that occur on my chest or back area and it works there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I was using this product for about a month and then starting using it along with the [[ASIN:B00260GSJO DDF Glycolic 10% Toning Complex, 8.45-Ounce Bottle]]. The Murad solution still works the same as it had before I started using the toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with the PMD personal microdermabrasion system for acne. I purchased this as a spot treatment and had a few pimples clear up but then I started using the PMD PRO Personal Microdermabrasion system and I rarely have breakouts anymore. It&#x27;s made a big difference.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and read up on the different forms of acne before treating yourself.  For so long I&#x27;ve been using Murad and being frustrated because some blemishes were persistent and Murad did nothing for it.  The problem areas for me are nodular acne (not whiteheads or blackheads).  I&#x27;ve noticed that this spot treatment does moderately work overnight on whiteheads, but that&#x27;s the extent.  I&#x27;m going to try a specialized treatment for cystic pimples that may work on the nodular acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is sufficient, but it&#x27;s not a one-size-fits-all.  Do your research!</li>
    <li> I now know why you don&#x27;t buy products that state on their website not to. The quality just isn&#x27;t there. Must be old/ tampered with</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Murad spot treatment for several years know and it works great on drying out the nasty pimples that come out particularly before my period. I also use the acne gel for more my forehead, where I tend to get most pimples. Beside Murad, I also use Peter Thomas Roth, which I alternate. Like with any acne creme/gel, it does make my skin quite dry. To balance out, I also us the Vitaville Argan oil. For centuries, Moroccan and India women have used Argan oil to keep their skin and hair hydrated. It&#x27;s anti-aging and healing properties of that oil is truly amazing, no wonder so many celebrities swear by it.</li>
    <li> I use a light application on my entire face daily. Absolutely has prevented any pimples for 3+ years. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This works great on it&#x27;s own but is supercharged when used with the exfoliating treatment gel.  It is perfect for occaisonal breakouts and really isn&#x27;t drying (I have combination skin).</li>
    <li> I was kinda unsure when I brought this product I&#x27;ve had it when I 1st started using makeup. This treatment to my surprise blasts away any pimples you may get within 2 days. I didn&#x27;t know such things exists I will be sticking with this particular one but man are they pricey for their size but well worth the investment due to the amount of time it lasts..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had expected. It&#x27;s no different than putting toothpaste on a pimple. Probably will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed because I read all these reviews and searched online for a good product, and I love the facial mask I use from them, which is a sulfur based product. This spot treatment is nice and thin, and since I was really breaking out in a few areas around my chin and cheeks I put a thin layer on the area. Those blemishes scabbed up and I broke out in a bunch more! I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I have tried it over and over and each time I have had the same reaction. I tried to just apply a tiny amount to each blemish and the same kind of thing would happen. That blemish would scab up and around it 2 or 3 new blemishes would appear, and they were the kind that would feel a lot of pressure, develop a head, and if I used an aestheticians tool on them, yellow pus would come out. That is not even the type of blemish I normally get!!&lt;br /&gt;I usually get whiteheads, that have no pressure and a more solid type of extraction. Sorry to be so descriptive here, but it is worth noting, I think. I still have an almost full tube but I think I give up with this, sadly. It has made a mountain out of a molehill on my face :( BOO. I should also note I have combination skin and my breakouts are part hormonal, and part reaction from sweating (go away if I do not exercise). I have tried evert OTC &amp; Rx treatment and not found any one that works great but currently and doing well with Bliss Clog Dissolving Cleansing Milk, using a Clarisonic once daily, and either the Bliss Steep Clean Facial Mask or bliss triple oxygen instant energizing mask. Still breaking out though. If anyone has great ideas for my type of skin PLEASE reply to comment I will love you!!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product would recommend to anyone at any age</li>
    <li> I put a little on my acnes on my face and the next morning, I see redness on where I put this on. The red marks are bigger than the acne.. it looks as if it burns my face where I put it. It took aobut 3 days for the redness to go away. Wouldn&#x27;t be using this anymore.  I used to use the sulfur one and I loved it. I bought this thinking it was the sulfur one.</li>
    <li> i get cystic acne in areas of my face that move a lot(t zone) which is very painful. this product makes them go away in a quarter of the time, and makes them hurt much less. also works wonders on white heads and black heads, but be careful not to use too much, it can get grainy if you use too much at once</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne flairs all my life basically and while planning my wedding my stress level went through the roof! Then my sister gave me a vile of this stuff and I was literally amazed!! Proactive is way too harsh for my skin and since I&#x27;ve been using this, I hardly ever get acne. If I get a blemish that may turn into acne, I use Murad and most of them are gone overnight. I use it as a preventive measure too. Maybe I&#x27;m finally outgrowing acne (at almost 40 years old) but I&#x27;ve never used anything that worked so well! You won&#x27;t use anything else after using Murad!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I decided this product would fit my needs. However, when I used it, the product did not do what I expected. The product did not extinguish or make the blemish smaller. It remained the same until the blemish cleared up on its own. It took the same amount of time as the blemishes that I didn&#x27;t apply it to. I had a couple on my jaw line. I don&#x27;t get acne often, but would have liked a product that expedited the process of healing/clearing. I had used a mask type product from murad before and it seemed to work better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Murad Acne Spot Treatment for a long time.  It works fairly fast.....Pimple usually gone in 3-4 days....</li>
    <li> After running the gamut of products, all of which caused reactions on my skin, I finally found Murad. This stuff is awesome. I had a deep pimple that had been there for over a month. After only two days with the Murad, it is noticeably smaller and I can tell it is finally going to go away. Gentle to the skin. Great for blackheads and deep pimples.</li>
    <li> MORE OR LESS CORRECT BUT BURNED THE SKIN</li>
    <li> This product works and makes your pimples look less noticalble the next morning but it&#x27;s messy so I suggest putting a towel over your pillow.</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;m a teen in highschool and there is no way to stop breakouts; there gonna happen. But when they do happen I love to use murad products because there really gentle. My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive but it can get red sometimes when i over use multiple products a day. I was using the murad 30 day acne complex and everything in there was great but the spot treatment was amazing! You can actually feel it working and in ten minutes the blemish will be BARLEY red. Use it 3 times daily and it will be gone, not a dried up acne scar; but actually gone. I probably was a little obsessive over it because this was the first thing to go out of my control kit, partly because it came with the .25 oz one. It is really expensive plus the oz is about half as much as drug store ones for about 3 times the price. But sulfur works great and if you are a teen i guarantee it will work!</li>
    <li> This is ok. In about two days your acne will be better. But it&#x27;s not a fast process at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to help with acne spots.  It does tingle when you first apply but you will have noticeable results the morning after!</li>
    <li> This product is part of my daily skin care regimen.  The Murad skin care line products can be quite costly, but I was pleased to be able to order this item at a reasonable price from this seller.</li>
    <li> FOR ME this doesn&#x27;t do anything special over a store brand.  I do have a lot of faith in Murad though and just ordered the all over acne gel.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it performs the way I want it too.</li>
    <li> This garbage does not work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money. See a dermatologist with professional, medical-grade products.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know why murad is changing to the fast acne spot cream.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, hurry and order it now. It really zaps zits--overnight! I have used it with a particularly difficult acne problem and it has been miraculous.</li>
    <li> Glad I am able to buy this for my child at a Cheap price. He uses it on a regular basis and it can be expensive. Not here though</li>
    <li> I have been trying out different spot treatments recently and what seems to be the most common problems is that they either aren&#x27;t effective enough or are too harsh on my skin. However, this one seems to be a nice balance. It&#x27;s effective, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My only real complaint is it leaves a somewhat noticeable film/residue, at least for me. Since I only really use it before I go to bed, this isn&#x27;t really a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice product. Not too expensive either. I&#x27;ll be ordering some more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years.  I have suffered from painful cystic acne for more than 20 years and not much worked on it until a Sephora employee turned me onto this Murad product.  I have oily skin and while I do not get flare ups as often as when I was younger I still get them along my jawline about 4 to 5 times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I catch it early, when I first start feeling the painful bump coming on, and put some of the treatment on prior to going to bed, the bump is usually almost or completely gone when I wake up.  If I don&#x27;t catch it soon enough it sometimes takes 2 days of treatment 2 or 3 times a day to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have noticed it that the product begins to lose its effectiveness after about a year or so.  Since I do not get many flare ups anymore, I don&#x27;t go through the tube very quickly.  I can still use it, it just takes a little more treatment and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said in my title, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  I have read some reviews here where it did not work on cystic acne for the reviewer, or it did not work at all for someone and they blasted the product.  No need to blast a product and its users just because it didn&#x27;t work for you - especially a product that deals with someone&#x27;s physical make up.  This product does work incredibly well for many people and I would hate to see a narrow negative review cause someone to not try it.  Hopefully it will work for you if you give it a chance.</li>
    <li> what I do like, is that it does not dry your skin out like other creams. I actually lost it, and orderd another one. I will give another review when get that one in the mail this week.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU OUR ACNE PRONE.&lt;br /&gt;AT LEAST IT WORKS WELL FOR OUR SON WHO HAS&lt;br /&gt;BEEN BATTLING ACNE FOR 5 YEARS. THIS IS A REPEAT PURCHASE BECAUSE IT WORKS WELL FOR HIM</li>
    <li> The very best spot treatment, look no further.</li>
    <li> This product contains only 2% sulfur which is less than Bye Bye Blemish and Kate Somerville acne spot treatment which contain 8-10% sulfur. For the mild acne like small whitehead, I just need to pop it and dab a little bit of this product on. The next day, they are gone. But for the nodular acne (see Google). They are not like white head or black head, but they are more of a severe type of acne because of their swelling, redness, painful when touch/press. These nodular acne don&#x27;t seem to work well with this product for me. I have used this product on those nodular acne for almost a week. What happened for me was the acne spots became so dried due to prolonged exposure of sulfur and red with flakiness. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again since it didn&#x27;t help me getting rid of nodular acne.</li>
    <li> Just works wonders...cannot do without it...Thank you Murad</li>
    <li> One of the few products that work for acne, etc.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but considering how little you actually need for this product to work it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works on acne below the skin. It lasts a long time when I use it once or twice a day.</li>
