### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Scytera is great stuff!</li>
      <li>Perfect solution if coal tar works on your psoriasis.</li>
      <li>It really is good stuff!</li>
      <li>The product itself was working great.  </li>
      <li>This product works great for scalp psoriasis.</li>
      <li>The results were amazing!  </li>
      <li>It has a very strong, coal tar odor!  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff for excema and psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>good service</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I have never had results this good.</li>
      <li>Does a good job of sealing in the moisture to aid in the healing.</li>
      <li>I find that very interesting since their mission statement says, \\&quot;Pharma will provide unsurpassed customer service\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 44 years, and the most effective (and safest!)</li>
      <li>the best answer that I have received is that \\&quot;we do not know why it is not available, but we have been told that it should be available again around December!!!  </li>
      <li>Like most of yo, I tried everything - tars, treatments and tannning.</li>
      <li>TO tell you the truth, until now my best defence was practicing yoga 3 times a week while tanning 3 times those same weeks (a combination of blood-floow, oxagine and thew UV rays.</li>
      <li>most of the time, and I think that the ease of use and the consistent effectiveness of Scytera has a good deal to do with that.</li>
      <li>It is true that in addition to staining everything from sheets, underclothing, and sometimes even outer clothing, coal tar products have a very strong odor.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
      <li>The foam is easy to use and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>It help relieve me of my psoriasis symptoms and went on smooth not greasy.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommend product to get faster UV absorption rate while under UV light treatment.</li>
      <li>With the help of my Dermatologist, I have found another product, Psorant, that is made by Neostrata, that has basically the same ingredients, and good reviews.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist prescribed several topicals, but they worked only marginally at best.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and dries with no discoloration.</li>
      <li>Scytera&#x27;s rather mild odor, however, is one of its pros.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had severe psoriasis most of my life, but these days, my skin stays mostly clear (using almost NO steroids!)</li>
      <li>Therefore I have a very large area to cover.</li>
      <li>For some unknown reason (even their own customer service department does not know what is going on), they stopped producing Scytera.  </li>
      <li>what it usualy takes 3 months of tanning 3 times a week to acomplish - it is the first week of Summer</li>
      <li>Even after washing my hair, the odor will last for two more days.</li>
      <li>This means that I&#x27;ve stuck with a coal tar skin care regimen for many years despite the obvious drawbacks.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and effective to control the itch and flaking that is so common with psoriasis.</li>
      <li>Surprised it is not distributed more widely.</li>
      <li>Used alone or in combination with other medications and/or creams, Scytera is easy to apply, dries quite quickly, is only minimally staining, and is VERY effective at quickly reducing both the inflammation and scaling of psoriasis spots large and small.  </li>
      <li>to has has had varying degrees of success with different things.</li>
      <li>I dealt with the pain and itching for several years and this stuff cleared it right up.</li>
      <li>This goes on easily, quickly, and it lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
      <li>I am new to the product.</li>
      <li>I have been fighting my war with Psoriasis for 20 years - I am only 40 and had my first outbreak when I was 18.</li>
      <li>The Scytera Foam is a new spin on an old remedy.  </li>
      <li>After using these treatments for about 9 months, my psoriasis has completely cleared up and haven&#x27;t had to use any medication for almost a year now.</li>
      <li>Scytera did for me in the early Spring</li>
      <li>Can seemed to be full, but didnt prove so, because use was limited, compared to trial size previously used, Didnt last as long as it should have.</li>
      <li>For people who use coal tar products for their psoriasis this is a good product, a little expensive, but I find it works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Helped stop my mom&#x27;s psoriasis from head to toe.</li>
    <li> Scytera is great stuff! It keeps my flaking to a minimum and calms the angry red flareups, and it also keeps my skin moisturized. I have guttate psoriasis - the scattered thumbnail sized lesions that occur all over my body. Therefore I have a very large area to cover. This goes on easily, quickly, and it lasts a surprisingly long time. The peppermint oil masks the tar odor quite well and it actually cools and soothes the lesions. I love this stuff and hope it&#x27;s always available.</li>
    <li> I am new to the product. My dermatologist recommend product to get faster UV absorption rate while under UV light treatment. Product arrived and work as expected. Only one minor complaint is the tar smell at application. Smell dissipate after an hour.</li>
    <li> This foam does soothe the psoriasis on my fingers. It stops the burning and dryness. Does a good job of sealing in the moisture to aid in the healing. Also, this was difficult to find. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting my war with Psoriasis for 20 years - I am only 40 and had my first outbreak when I was 18. Like most of yo, I tried everything - tars, treatments and tannning. Hundres and thousands of dolors on \\&quot;miracle cures\\&quot; and books and doctors (who seem to know the absolute least). Then a friend stumbled upon Scytera.    Scytera did for me in the early Spring what it usualy takes 3 months of tanning 3 times a week to acomplish - it is the first week of Summer and I am wearing shorts and a short sleeved t-shirt! I donn&#x27;t have words for what this means to me.    Every pne aflicted with Psoriasis I have ever spoen to has has had varying degrees of success with different things. TO tell you the truth, until now my best defence was practicing yoga 3 times a week while tanning 3 times those same weeks (a combination of blood-floow, oxagine and thew UV rays. The results I got from Scytera werre noticiable in 1 week, and after a month it has changed my life.     All I can say is, I am wearing shorts in June!!!</li>
    <li> Did not really help my psoriasis, and I thought this was unscented.  It has a very strong, coal tar odor!  Even after washing my hair, the odor will last for two more days.</li>
    <li> The product itself was working great.  Cleaned up the dry skin behind my husband&#x27;s ears in a short time.  What was frustrating was the foam jammed the dispensing mechanism on the can and we broke the tip off trying to get the product out.  We looked up the mfg. (Promius(sp)), called them and they sent us a will-call pick-up tag from UPS to pick up the can so they could inspect it.  Long story short, 3 months later they sent us a refund check.  We have tried to shop this product but cannot find any pharmacy that carries it, or has even heard of it!  Concur with Hard to find.</li>
    <li> For people who use coal tar products for their psoriasis this is a good product, a little expensive, but I find it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 44 years, and the most effective (and safest!) long term treatment i&#x27;ve known has been the use of coal tar preparations. This means that I&#x27;ve stuck with a coal tar skin care regimen for many years despite the obvious drawbacks.  It is true that in addition to staining everything from sheets, underclothing, and sometimes even outer clothing, coal tar products have a very strong odor.  Scytera&#x27;s rather mild odor, however, is one of its pros.  While I do not use it on my scalp, I do use it on my body as part of my morning grooming routine (in combination with a tar body cream preparation I make for myself), and by the time I&#x27;ve finished dressing and doing my hair, I no longer detect even the faintest whiff of tar.  Used alone or in combination with other medications and/or creams, Scytera is easy to apply, dries quite quickly, is only minimally staining, and is VERY effective at quickly reducing both the inflammation and scaling of psoriasis spots large and small.  I&#x27;ve had severe psoriasis most of my life, but these days, my skin stays mostly clear (using almost NO steroids!) most of the time, and I think that the ease of use and the consistent effectiveness of Scytera has a good deal to do with that.</li>
    <li> The Scytera Foam is a new spin on an old remedy.  The foam is easy to use and not greasy.  It won&#x27;t leave grease or stains on you clothing like ointments will do. It absorbs quickly and dries with no discoloration.</li>
    <li> Can seemed to be full, but didnt prove so, because use was limited, compared to trial size previously used, Didnt last as long as it should have.</li>
    <li> This product works great for scalp psoriasis. It is easy to apply and effective to control the itch and flaking that is so common with psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This Coal Tar product works wonders on Psoriasis.  I have used it to get rid of the red patches on my skin and then lay out in the sun and it helps the patches disappear.  I have never had results this good.</li>
    <li> This was a God send. It help relieve me of my psoriasis symptoms and went on smooth not greasy. Smells like peppermint to mask the coal tar.  Only con is it doesn&#x27;t last too long :-/</li>
    <li> Scytera works for my husband when other products don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> After suffering from psoriasis for over ten years, and trying the usual very expensive prescription creams, with no significant results, I tried Scytera.  The results were amazing!  Unfortunately, the manufacturer of Scytera, Promius Pharma is obviously a company that does not care about their customers. For some unknown reason (even their own customer service department does not know what is going on), they stopped producing Scytera.  I find that very interesting since their mission statement says, \\&quot;Pharma will provide unsurpassed customer service\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;After numerous calls, the best answer that I have received is that \\&quot;we do not know why it is not available, but we have been told that it should be available again around December!!!  It is impossible to speak to anyone who really knows anything with any certainty. Their attitude seemed totally apathetic.  This is the second time in about two years that they have pulled this same ploy.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has psoriasis knows that you cannot go without treatment for 5 or 6 months. With the help of my Dermatologist, I have found another product, Psorant, that is made by Neostrata, that has basically the same ingredients, and good reviews.  I have already ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;I feel badly that I have encouraged numerous other psoriasis sufferers to use Scytera, and will make sure they know there is an alternative!</li>
    <li> Good product. good service</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for excema and psoriasis.  use it every few days after showering.  Limited availability at local drug stores.</li>
    <li> I had psoriasis on both my hands and feet. My dermatologist prescribed several topicals, but they worked only marginally at best. Then she told me about Scytera foam and the healing properties of coal tar and gave me some to try. What a difference! Within 8 weeks, the cracking and scaling on hands and feet were totally gone! I dealt with the pain and itching for several years and this stuff cleared it right up. My dermatologist also prescribed Vectical for use in conjunction with Scytera. After using these treatments for about 9 months, my psoriasis has completely cleared up and haven&#x27;t had to use any medication for almost a year now. I would use Scytera again in a heartbeat if I had to and would recommend it to anyone who suffers from psoriasis. Too bad it seems to be in short supply again. It really is good stuff!</li>
    <li> Perfect solution if coal tar works on your psoriasis. Surprised it is not distributed more widely. Seems to be working for me on my scalp and elbows</li>
    <li> Expensive mixed results</li>
</ol>
