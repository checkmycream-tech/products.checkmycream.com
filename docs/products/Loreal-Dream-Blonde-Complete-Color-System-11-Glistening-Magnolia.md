      <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!</li>
      <li>The results are just as good as going to a high end salon!</li>
      <li>I ordered Loreal Dream Blonde many times and I am usually happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>the great i love it.it dont leave red in your hair nor does it leave brazziness</li>
      <li>ITS SO STRONG</li>
      <li>I love how light my hair is now :) also the shampoo and conditioner and hair moisturizer made my hair so soft and shiny and my dead ends are gone :) I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants a great hair dye at a great price that makes your hair even more beautiful than it was before you dyed it :)</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it was going to work any better</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what happened but instead of light brown</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this item is no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>it was cheap</li>
      <li>I love the dream blonde line, they are a complete coloring system and smell fantastic and leave your hair feeling great!  </li>
      <li>This is easy and the color is true, I hope Loreal will not change it.</li>
      <li>This is the quick and easy way of getting what you want when you want it.</li>
      <li>Well, sure enough, the Clairol product gave a bit more orange hue than I was looking for!  </li>
      <li>This is BY FAR the best blonde hair dye that exists out there.</li>
      <li>but it was strawberry blonde , gorgeous color</li>
      <li>This box has such nice additional products such as a cream to protect the ends while doing touch ups plus a great smelling continuous shine creme to add after drying my hair.</li>
      <li>it looks and feels better than when I had a salon dye my hair, not to mention much lighter as well.</li>
      <li>Then, thanks to Amazon (my favorite go to source), there it was</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found this works best with a ultra light blonde toner over it...looks just like the blonde shade on the box when done.</li>
      <li>but it was not bad, but I just prefer the results that I am use to.</li>
      <li>Rare to find a product this complete and effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a poor college student, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for about 2 years now for the perfect box dye- and after much searching, I&#x27;ve found my champion!!!</li>
      <li>I really was amazed how light it turned out</li>
      <li>What I really needed was the Light Ash blond (Orchid something or another).</li>
      <li>I received it yesterday and used it right away.</li>
      <li>Right now nothing on the market I know of.</li>
      <li>This actually gets you to the shade on the box, and it&#x27;s a beautiful blonde with no brassiness</li>
      <li>The color is light and vibrant.</li>
      <li>Have tried many other Loreal tints in the past and this was my best experience</li>
      <li>This hair dye took my dark brown hair to a beautiful light blonde.</li>
      <li>, reminds me of my Cosmetologist Days, includes good maintenance products as well, did not leave hair feeling dry or damaged, they got it right this time, and this is a decent price, too.</li>
      <li>B001KYS20K L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference Dream Blonde Complete Color &amp; Care System, Ultra Lightening 100 1 ea]].</li>
      <li>but this leaves a sort of pearly light yellow sheen to your hair if it&#x27;s already light.  </li>
      <li>this product lightened my roots to exactly what I wanted, and it even added a slight strawberry blond effect in a good way.</li>
      <li>First let me say you will probably ONLY get the color results on the box if you have bleached hair or very very light hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered Loreal Dream Blonde many times and I am usually happy with the results. I could not find the one I usually use so I tried this one. The color did not turn out the exact same that I was expecting but it was not bad, but I just prefer the results that I am use to.</li>
    <li> found this color I get alot of compliments on it stopped going to beauty salon they alway try to make it darker I dont know about you but I like my hair blond and 250.00 for someone to color what they they you should have... forget it this is a muliti faucets color and is gorgeous no ash... I have problems with brass so this really lightens it the only thing better would be lightern but it looks very natural try it I love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this item is no longer available in stores. I used it all the time. Best home hair color out there. The key is the pre-color treatment...not a lot of home hair color kits have this, but it makes a huge difference. My hair looks and feels healthier post-color than it did before. Also included in the kit is some shampoo and conditioner to use after coloring your hair that smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this color and could no longer get it from Loreal or Walgreens so I started to panic. Then, thanks to Amazon (my favorite go to source), there it was so I hope I can always order it here.  This box has such nice additional products such as a cream to protect the ends while doing touch ups plus a great smelling continuous shine creme to add after drying my hair. THANKS AGAIN TO AMAZON!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001EXJPIU L&#x27;Oréal Dream Blondes Hair Color - Extra Light Blonde 11]] This is an excellent hair color and excellent value. The product lightens and evens out tone beautifully. It is a little more expensive for good reason. The application tip is refined and perfect. Comes with pre-conditioner. Also comes with shampoo, conditioner and finishing product that will last between coloring. Live and learn...the conditioner with this product works better than the REALLY expensive ones I have been buying. Rare to find a product this complete and effective.</li>
    <li> I used to get my hair \\&quot;done\\&quot;, but in this economy.... I used to be blonde a very long time ago and now it&#x27;s a horrible darker brown with a few grays.  Plus with box color my hair tends to redden to almost orange. I bought this product at a Walgreens in AZ. I needed to recolor and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere here in MN.  So I bought L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde. Now I look like a scary tabby cat. I have hair of every color...just about. Once it&#x27;s safe to color it again, I&#x27;m using this. The color is Magnolia.  I hope it works as well for everyone else!!!</li>
    <li> This is, bar none, the best boxed hair dye I have ever used. It is gentle. It left my hair in what seems like better condition than it was before I dyed it. But, as someone else said, this particular shade is only for the thoroughly bleached head of hair. If your hair is not already nearly platinum, then you need to bleach. You may even need to bleach 2 or 3 times in order to get the shade on the box. That is not the fault of the dye, that is the nature of hair dying reality. If your hair is darker than the shades shown on the starting shade/expected result chart, you must bleach. You must bleach until you are one of those shades or this dye will not work for you.     These dyes are designed to be as fool proof as possible. Unfortunately, when I saw this at Walgreens I could not locate a more appropriate shade and foolishly chose this one. What I really needed was the Light Ash blond (Orchid something or another). Despite it being not the right shade, it turned out reasonably well. I&#x27;m actually impressed. I have since bought the correct shade and will be using it as soon as my roots look like they need retouched.</li>
    <li> My kids say my hair is less orange this time with this product, but I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;not overly impressed. Wish it could have looked like the box more.&lt;br /&gt;I did get a lot of freebies with this hair dye. The shine cream was neat,&lt;br /&gt;made my hair look like liquid gold. I guess I would order again. My hair is&lt;br /&gt;a dark blonde, with light ends, and I only dye it every 6 months, so it takes&lt;br /&gt;to any color well.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that you can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore which is really too bad.  Don&#x27;t understand why manufacturers do that.  Would highly recommend this hair color.</li>
    <li> i have used this hair die for years the great i love it.it dont leave red in your hair nor does it leave brazziness i will continue useing tghis product for years to come thank you loreal</li>
    <li> I started feeling guilty for all the money Ive spent over the years for salon highlights (time to save some money for the kids&#x27; college funds)so I decided to give this a try after reading all the great reviews. I am a 30 year old natural medium to dark ash blonde but I like the beachy blonde look.... this product lightened my roots to exactly what I wanted, and it even added a slight strawberry blond effect in a good way. Not in a brassy way at all.... just a slightly diffent effect that I always wanted to achieve. I actually LOVE this product and no one has noticed that I dyed my hair, which is a good thing. My only complaint is that it seems to fade after about 3 weeks, but what can you expect from color in a box. $12.00 is so much better than $160.00 plus 20% tip!!! Wish I could find it in stores!!!!! Please don&#x27;t stop making this product Loreal!</li>
    <li> This hair dye took my dark brown hair to a beautiful light blonde. The color is light and vibrant. it looks and feels better than when I had a salon dye my hair, not to mention much lighter as well. I will defiantly be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I love the dream blonde line, they are a complete coloring system and smell fantastic and leave your hair feeling great!  I didn&#x27;t quite get the color indicated on the side of the box (I was going from the darkest color pictured and my hair turned out pretty reddish orange which was a big bummer.</li>
    <li> This is a really great kit and comes with end protector, shampoo, conditioner and the coloring solutions. It is a great color without brassiness. What a shame it is going away.</li>
    <li> I heard that Loreal is not making this product any longer. I don&#x27;t know what we are going to do because this is a wonderful product and the ABSOLUTE BEST ON THE MARKET.</li>
    <li> did not help out my color at all and was not good.  other brands are far way better as this is a ripoff</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed the Loreal decided to discontinue this product.  It was the best haircolor that I have ever used.  It kept my hair looking and feeling healthy and shiny.  Trying to find something to replace it.  Loreal suggests Preference LB01 Extra Light Ash Blonde.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> First let me say you will probably ONLY get the color results on the box if you have bleached hair or very very light hair. I bleach mine and not only does this product give you gorgeous almost platinum blonde hair, but tones whatever yellowness OUT from bleaching. The results are just as good as going to a high end salon! Love this product</li>
    <li> This is thevonlynplace I can find my hair color. Please keep selling as long as you can it&#x27;s the only color that works for me</li>
    <li> This is BY FAR the best blonde hair dye that exists out there. All the others either leave you ashy, trashy or blah. Loreal.....bad move discontinuing this product. Thank you Liquidators for keeping it available to me as long as you can. I will keep buying til it&#x27;s gone for good.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair.  I wanted a change last year and decided to go darker, I wanted a pretty light brown. I don&#x27;t know what happened but instead of light brown it was a ghastly dark combo of orange and brown. I tried a lighter color still way too dark and so much red in it. I thought just forget it and wanted to go back to blonde, no easy task with dark hair, I know. So I bought Loreal Dream Blonde Complete Color System - #11 Glistening Magnolia. I really was amazed how light it turned out but it was strawberry blonde , gorgeous color but I wasn&#x27;t going for that. I did end up buying a stripping product that worked great. Then I tried another box of Loreal Dream Blonde Complete Color System - #11 Glistening Magnolia. It&#x27;s perfect, it&#x27;s close to platinum just like I wanted it, it&#x27;s shiny, it does not look damaged at all. I love it and will continue to use this color although it&#x27;s been discontinued. I do agree with others here unless your hair is blonde to begin with you will not get this light color.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  People always comment on what good condition my hair is.  This is my favorite.  What am I going to do when I can&#x27;t buy it here anymore!!!</li>
    <li> great hair dye. love this stuff. cannot find in stores. palest blonde out of a box ive ever gotten.</li>
    <li> From now on instead of running from store to store trying to find my items I will simple order them from this seller. This is the quick and easy way of getting what you want when you want it.</li>
    <li> Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued! Hard to find. Seems like that happens a lot with box colors. Why do they do that?</li>
    <li> Having used one already, I have no doubt this will turn out just as good, too bad it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> Firstly, this hair dye&#x27;s expiration date ran out 3 years ago. Secondly it didn&#x27;t lighten my hair much at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color I have found to get that beautiful natural blond.  Looks just like my natural blond color when I was young.</li>
    <li> too bad this product is no longer being made, i use it to keep my hair a light brown, not blond</li>
    <li> I love how light my hair is now :) also the shampoo and conditioner and hair moisturizer made my hair so soft and shiny and my dead ends are gone :) I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants a great hair dye at a great price that makes your hair even more beautiful than it was before you dyed it :)</li>
    <li> I know this color has been off the shelves for a year but I can still get it here and I do like the color on me.  Works well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the right color but this leaves a sort of pearly light yellow sheen to your hair if it&#x27;s already light.  It doesn&#x27;t lighten much, but is more of a toner that lasts for a little while, not sure exactly how long, but it takes graying whitish hair and gives it an unusually pretty glow.  I think the lady on the box is a manikin, but it does resemble the luminous look you get with this color.  Hope they can rediscover something similar again sometime.  Right now nothing on the market I know of.</li>
    <li> I gave this hair dye four out of five stars since I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But if it comes out like the picture on the box, I will love it!</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly frustrated. Im already a blonde but its more of a fiery blonde and this was supposed my make it a full on blonde. It did nothing just made my bathroom smell terrible. I would not recommend this product to anybody. EVER</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m a natural blonde but it&#x27;s a dirty blonde &amp; this is THE best box dye!!!! It never makes my hair yellow! I have very long hair &amp; one box is enough. I&#x27;m so sad (&amp; have been) that loreal doesn&#x27;t make it anymore! I hope I can continue to find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> My hair turned completely brassy from this, and I had to have my color professionally fixed before being able to highlight it again.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Beautiful color. Easy to use. Great shampoo and conditioner included. Also a pretreatment and daily sheen cream. I love the way my hair smells after using the sheen cream.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it! Is there any new product in loreal catalog.</li>
    <li> Meh.  This was a lot of hype for a so so product.  I saw no difference other than the price over regular L&#x27;oreal dye.</li>
    <li> Delivered days before expected.  Excellent merchant and product.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! my gross yukky orange blonde hair is...G O N E!!!&lt;br /&gt;BEEN DOING MY HAIR FOR OVER 30 YRS...I ALWAYS ALWAYS NO MATTER WHAT BRAND OR THE LIGHTEST BLONDE COLOR I CHOSE..ALWAYS LEFT THAT YUK ORANGEY COLOR...&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I READ THIS AND IT SAID TAKES AWAY THE BRASSINESS I CLICKED ON...BUY...ASAP...WELL JUST GOT DONE DOING (WATCHING IT GO LIGHTER I WAS GETTING DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE IT WAS CHANGING THE COLOR AT ALL)...BUT JUST LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER...AFTER BLOW DRYING..WOW!!! GORGEOUS COLOR AND...NO YELLOW ORANGE COLOR ANYMORE!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M FREAKING READING THAT ITS BEING..DISCONTINUED?? THE REVIEWER SAID THAT IN 2011 BUT ITS STILL HERE?? THANK GOODNESS!! I&#x27;M GOING TO BUY A FEW BOXES..JUST IN CASE I GET ON AMAZON AND ...POOF..ITS GONE...&lt;br /&gt;THE OTHER AMAZING THING IS...HAD THE EVER SLIGHTEST HINT OF SMELL!! USUALLY YOU CAN BARELY BREATHE DOING YOUR HAIR ITS SO STRONG AND IT STAYS LIKE THAT ON YOUR HAIR TILL THE NEXT  SHAMPOO...THIS JUST SMELLS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SMELLING SHAMPOO!! I LOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT! I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE ALL THAT&#x27;S INCLUDED IN THE BOX!! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!! THANK YOU L&#x27;OREAL!!!</li>
    <li> I get nervous when I feel that a product is going to change.  I have had many of my favorites taken off the market by the producer.  This is easy and the color is true, I hope Loreal will not change it.</li>
    <li> this product only dyed my roots and i had to sit in a salon for 3 hours to have my hair be one solid color</li>
    <li> i love itand it was cheap</li>
    <li> Turned my hair orange! Not the formula for me!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Salon quality.  Get compliments every time I leave the house. Leaves my hair soft and natural looking.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I got the perfect blonde. It also came with shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the product makes my hair closer to a blond with out turning it so brassy looking. It also has a agent that protects your hair from damage before you dye it. I wish it was more like the &amp;#34;L&#x27;oreal Excellence&amp;#34; where it dyes the ends more to match your root job instead of make it whiter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not brassy, lasts long and is easy to apply.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 5 years and have never been disappointed.  If L&#x27;Oreal ever discontinues this, I&#x27;m toast.</li>
    <li> Just used my Dream Blonde #11 Glistening Magnolia today and... wow.  I&#x27;m a natural blonde, but in the winter, I use dye to get my hair to its summer state (light, super highlighted, towhead blonde). I&#x27;m a poor college student, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for about 2 years now for the perfect box dye- and after much searching, I&#x27;ve found my champion!!! No hint of that horrible, cheap-looking gold that I detest, just perfectly dynamic ash blonde. I got highlights, I got lowlights... it&#x27;s incredible.  Yes, it smells horrendous- open a window- and is pretty drying but those are all teeny weeny prices to pay for this incredible color. A+!! I will be stocking up...</li>
    <li> Leaves puke smell in your hair for months. Don&#x27;t buy! Color fades fast and requires two boxes to coverall hair in product.</li>
    <li> If you can not make it to \\&quot;The Salon\\&quot;, this product is the next best thing in my opinion.  Have tried many other Loreal tints in the past and this was my best experience, reminds me of my Cosmetologist Days, includes good maintenance products as well, did not leave hair feeling dry or damaged, they got it right this time, and this is a decent price, too.</li>
    <li> Same kit I&#x27;ve been using and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This hair color is the best ever, but it has been discontinued for some time now. I&#x27;m so sad that I bought 5 boxes! I hope that L&#x27;Oreal comes out with something similar in the future, because I have hated all other hair colors that I&#x27;ve tried. This actually gets you to the shade on the box, and it&#x27;s a beautiful blonde with no brassiness whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I really don&#x27;t think this hair color is meant for super dark hair; I was reading the reviews below with people who are using box dye for black hair....really?! I have natural dirty blonde hair, and I think it would work great on anything down to a medium brown to really get the true tone you are looking for. Definitely do NOT box dye dark brunette/black hair; that is something that should be left to professionals.</li>
    <li> Wonderful bleach! Anyone who wants to be a blonde with a shimmering glow, get this product!!! I am no longer a blonde but was when I ordered this and if I ever decide to go lighter I will be repurchasing this!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and decided to try it. It was amazing. I will definitely order it again if it is available. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Best blonde box dye I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve found this works best with a ultra light blonde toner over it...looks just like the blonde shade on the box when done.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, And I let it stay in for almost an hour. And Nothing had happened, It just made my black hair really really dark brown.. And It totally burns my scalp too.. I regret that I bought this product.. UGH!</li>
    <li> No difference from any other pharmacy color. I have pretty light natural color hair and still came out orangy.</li>
    <li> Since going blonde (which started with three bleachings at the salon in one day, and then three more subsequent lightenings at home), I have tried a LOT of different brands and products. I was hoping this one would get me the platinum blonde shade I coveted, but after I used it, neither I nor anyone else could see any difference in shade in my hair. It dyed my naturally black roots a deep, dark orange, and didn&#x27;t even make my already-yellow-blonde hair whiter or much lighter. Nobody could tell any difference except for the lighter shades of orange (versus my previous black) in my roots. I was trying to get my already-blonde hair whiter/lighter, but it did barely anything to my already blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought THIS, also from Amazon: [[ASIN:B001KYS20K L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference Dream Blonde Complete Color &amp; Care System, Ultra Lightening 100 1 ea]]. See, the Glistening Magnolia, even though it&#x27;s #11 (and technically, the higher the number, the more blonde -- #100 is I think supposed to be a #10 blonde, but forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong), is a COLORING system. The other shade, Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde, is BLEACH (even though it isn&#x27;t blue -- the only actually BLUE bleach I&#x27;ve found in a DIY store box color is L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde #205 SUPER BLEACH BLONDE, which worked well on my hair, but still didn&#x27;t lift it as much as the Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head over to the Baby&#x27;s Breath Blonde to read my review for that one, but that \\&quot;shade\\&quot; (or bleach) finally made my (after 3 bleachings and 4 box colors! stubborn hair...) already light blonde hair WHITE PLATINUM BLONDE (which is what I was aiming for), and turned my very dark orange (after the Glistening Magnolia!) and black roots light orange, almost blonde, which is really good considering my natural hair is PITCH black and it took 4 bleachings to get my whole head to that shade before.</li>
    <li> This is a worthwhile purchase!  Couldnt wait to share a review on this product, although it has been discontinued (available from liquidators only).  I had purchased Clariol &amp;#34;born blonde&amp;#34; to lighten my dark blonde hair.  Some people really have more red or orange pigmentation in thier hair and have to be careful with boxed dyes.  Well, sure enough, the Clairol product gave a bit more orange hue than I was looking for!  After reading reviews on this Loreal product, I decided to use it as a &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; after waiting and living with my orange hues for 2 weeks.  What an amazing result!  Silky, soft, shiny and blonde!  Toned down the orange quite a bit, and almost eliminated it!  Dying my hair twice within a 2 week period was scary, but it worked out perfectly.  No brittle or dry ends and satisfied with the color.  Trying to figure out why this was discontinued by Loreal?</li>
    <li> Just bought 3 love it.. Happy I found it again.. If u buy u will be happy works great. Hope they make a lot more of this brand and #</li>
    <li> This product is my all-time favorite.....please keep it in stock and I will surely keep stocking up as well!!!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered this blonde based on the reviews here on Amazon.  I received it yesterday and used it right away. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it was going to work any better then any other blonde shades I had used.  But once I started blow drying my hair, I really noticed a difference!  Any brassy or yellow tones that I had in my hair had virtually disappeared, leaving a really pretty light blonde shade!  And my hair feels so soft and silky, I love the way it feels.  My husband also noticed right away and said my hair looked really good.  So I am really pleased with this product and will definitely use it again when it&#x27;s time to recolor.  Too bad it&#x27;s not carried in stores, but as long as Amazon carries it I will be getting here!!!</li>
