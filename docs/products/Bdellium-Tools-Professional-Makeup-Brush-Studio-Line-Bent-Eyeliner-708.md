      <li>These brushes last a long time and the angle is perfect so you never loose site when applying.  </li>

      <li>I have always struggled with getting a straight line with my eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Holds its shape very well.</li>
      <li>the bent design makes it so much easier to do a cat eye on clients</li>
      <li>Kind of firm.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Considering this is cheaper than many other eyeliner brushes sold in Sephora &amp; Ulta</li>
      <li>A lot more affordable than other brushes on the market.</li>
      <li>After each use it is necessary to clean the bristles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super easy to control whether I want a thin, defined line or a bold wing with the angled head.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just like the high end ones.</li>

      <li>And it is really easy to use, the brush is also very soft!&lt;br /&gt;Because the small brush head, it drys so fast that I can wash it everyday.</li>
      <li>I always have trouble making a thin perfect line with other brushes,  </li>
      <li>I will recommend this item to everyone who wants definite eye line for thier final touch on the make up.</li>
      <li>but at times it can be hard to make it glide smoothly for a winged look.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the bristles became frayed very shortly after I started using it</li>
      <li>It places eyeliner on so easily and the line is thin..</li>

Think its great that this brush is antibacterial.  I would highly recommend this product, and will be going back for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush solely with my Urban Decay cream eyeliner (Perversion). After each use it is necessary to clean the bristles. If there is any remaining residue it greatly impacts the efficiency for the next use. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the thickness of my eyeliner but at times it can be hard to make it glide smoothly for a winged look.&lt;br /&gt;Considering this is cheaper than many other eyeliner brushes sold in Sephora &amp; Ulta I would give it a try.</li>

    <li> I am new to using gel eyeliner and wasn&#x27;t too sure what kind of brush to use. This works great a creating a small line, especially with my bottom lashes, and not getting to thick! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months, cleaning it weekly and it has held up great!</li>
    <li> great for gel eyeliner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 and must use a magnifying mirror to apply my eye liner.  This tool allows me to get a very thin line close to the lash line.</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least a dozen brushes for eyeliner. And I must say, after buying this, I have FINALLY found the perfect eyeliner brush. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> This product arrived in one day Great shipping!  The handle is a little longer than I am used to but it is perfect for eyeliner; many brushes are too thick and therefore don&#x27;t offer the precision I like.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that the bristles became frayed very shortly after I started using it</li>
    <li> Love love love love . Iv never used anything but liquid in a tube until I got this brush for my Mac eyeliner . And it&#x27;s simply amazing . Makes beyond perfect liner . I bought two</li>

    <li> Love it! Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This tool is great and makes a big difference in my gel liner application.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of cake eye liner and I have tried them all. Gel, Liquid and pencil. This brush lets me get as thin or thick as I want without those little bristles adding what you do not want as well as not to &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t bleed. This is very important as I age. I do love this brush!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner brush!</li>
