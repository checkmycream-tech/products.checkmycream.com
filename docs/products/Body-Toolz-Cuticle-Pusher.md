    <li> This cuticle pusher is definitely a quality tool. The pusher end works very well - much better and longer-lasting than the thicker, plastic pushers you find in most beauty stores. The only reason I did not give this all 5 stars is simply because the pictures provided did not show that the skinnier end was slightly curved. I was hoping it would be sharp and flat since I feel that scrapes the nail better. Overall, it is a good product as long as it serves the purpose you have intended.</li>
    <li> Great tool for cleaning your cuticles.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t know about something like this sooner.</li>
    <li> I got this tool and could barely scrap under my nail without ruining all the skin under there. It was way too sharp. I had to use my knife sharpener to re sculpt the tool head so it works nice as a dirt digger. For a dude looking for a dirt scraper, this tool has a learning curve. After reshaping the tool head and using it for a week, its the best thing ever. At first, I hated it.</li>
    <li> Good little tool and it is very helpful in getting under your nails clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool for male executives who what to keep their fingers looking healthy and professional-- and I&#x27;m sure the ladies would like it as well.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to grip and perfectly shaped, this cuticle pusher is exactly what I needed but couldn&#x27;t find in a store.</li>
    <li> I do my own gel nails at home and this is a great professional quality cuticle pusher and cleaner.  I use it with a cuticle dissolver and it cleans everything so well!  I use it every time I do my own mani&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Finally a cuticle pusher that is the right width and shape. Wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> This is a handy tool to have in your nail care arsenal.  It can be used to push back cuticles, clean nail beds, or even to apply nail stickers.  I completely love its versatility.</li>
    <li> I love my product! The Cuticle pusher style is perfect! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great cuticle tool, I use it on a regular basis. Don&#x27;t be too aggressive! Your nails will look better after using this.</li>
    <li> Just like going to the salon!!!  Professional quality.</li>
    <li> This is great for pushing back cuticles and scraping your nails clean of any debris or left over nail polish stuck on the edges...also great for cleaning under nails. I use this every time I give myself a manicure or pedicure, and it makes it look like I got them done at a salon - this is key for DIY manis and pedis!!</li>
    <li> This Cuticle Pusher by Body Tools has a great design, and works wonderfully with many different nail sizes. The edges are smooth so it doesn&#x27;t cut the cuticle as is pushes. The stainless steel is easy to clean. Great for personal use as well as professional.</li>
    <li> Very useful for pushing back cuticles and cleaning under nails.  This is a sturdy product in a good size--fits the hand well and does a good job cleaning up the nail beds.  Just like the one my manicurist uses.  Now if I could only get something that would give me a hand massage, too.</li>
    <li> Totally love it. Able to remove those tough dry skin on the side of my great toes with ease</li>
    <li> Throw away any other store bought nail tools! I have never used a nail tool that worked as well as this one does! Professional grade and it shows!</li>
    <li> Good quality tool. I get a lot of skin under my nails and the small edge is perfect for removing it gently and without a lot of pain.</li>
    <li> Good product. The curved end is a bit too sharp. Its hard to really work that end of the tool (under your toenails) because of how sharp it is. To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used the cuticle pusher end of it. I was told by a professional manicurist never to push your cuticles. you screw them up that way and they end up ripping and tearing. Bases on my experience, I believe her. I haven&#x27;t had a problem in years!&lt;br /&gt;But its a good product that well made.</li>
    <li> This works very well to push back softened cuticles without damaging your nails.  Very easy to clean and disinfect, too, which is important in nail care.  I would buy again and recommend it to those who want to save money by doing their own manicures at home.</li>
    <li> It is a smooth end that is not sharp. Pushes the cuticles. But does not really scrape the cuticle off the nail.</li>
    <li> The pusher arrived quickly and works well.  The cuticle pusher is rather large and doesn&#x27;t work great for my small hands, but the cleaning end works very nicely.</li>
    <li> Not too sharp but removes cuticles wonderfully.  I use this also when I apply shellac to remove any excess polish with either end of the pusher.  Great tool for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these about a year ago in store and it has become my most used tool other than a nail file. I have a similar tool from another brand but find the scraper too rough for fingernails thus it has been resigned to my pedicure kit. The shape of the scraper on this is better suited to getting the tough bits released from the side of the nail where the cuticle curves up. So glad to see it on amazon now i can have one for my purse as well! Another plus is that its easy to sanitize so its safe to share if you have to.</li>

Thanks so much !!!</li>
    <li> Came just as described.  Works really well to push back cuticles and to peel off gel polish.  I got this along with the Gel Nail Manicure kit.</li>
    <li> The only one that works</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d had this years ago.  Used carefully, it helps push back stubborn cuticles.  I use it after a shower when the skin is softened and it has greatly enhanced the look of my fingernails and toenails.  The pointed end is also very useful for freeing up the sharp edge of an ingrown nail.</li>
    <li> Great tool for manicuring! Not cheaply made...I would recommend this tool to anyone wanting to have nice cuticles! I love this!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a tool like this to have in my home manicure kit and could not find one anywhere except amazon of course!.  My manicurist uses this same tool at the salon,but most of the ones I have found have a stright edge at the opposite end of the cuticle pusher, which to me is useless.  This one as the little scoop tool that works great for cleaning under nails espcially after you have buffed and filed.  It works great for pedicures too!  The fact that is is stainless steel makes cleaning and sanitizing a breeze.</li>
    <li> The rounded end does not scrape anything off the nail. I am definitely returning this item. There are better cuticle pushers on the market.</li>
    <li> I just got this cuticle pusher today, and I&#x27;ve already used it, finding it to be fantastic.  It has a different tool on each end and when you&#x27;re in between manicures when the excess cuticle is actually cut off by the manicurist, it pushes the cuticle painlessly, effortlessly out of the way to provide a palette for a great manicure.  This is a great tool that is going to come in very handy all the time.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d give it as a gift unless I knew the person was trying to amass manicuring tools, but it&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like getting manicures though I like having well-polished nails all the time so I prefer to maintain them at home. This is perfect for my cuticles. I don&#x27;t trim my cuticles because I have very thin skin and that causes many hangnails. Good price, sturdy product.</li>
    <li> I actually sat and watched my nail technician use the exact same cuticle pusher on me today. The price is right and the quality is definitely present.</li>
    <li> I love this tool.  I use a cuticle remover and let it soak in for a little.  Then I use this took to gently push my cuticles back.  I used to cut my cuticles, but they I&#x27;d get hang nails and have to touch it up all this mess.  Now it&#x27;s so much easier and healthier to just push them back.  Now my cuticles look even better.  Just make sure to be gentle as this tool is metal and you don&#x27;t want to scrap off the top layer of your nail.</li>
