      <li>Amazingly balancing to my skin.</li>
      <li>the two together are just amazing.</li>
      <li>It honestly took about two or three weeks before I could tell any difference</li>
      <li>This is an honest product.</li>
      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t seen this kind of glow.</li>
      <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel nice but does not play well with gel moisturizers.</li>
      <li>My face feels nice to the touch.</li>
      <li>After one use I could tell my skin was so much smoother and makeup went on flawlessly!</li>
      <li>but i loved the cleanser the most.</li>
      <li>would, however, LOVE to hear if anyone has any recommendations for a good Serum/Day Cream &amp;/or Night Cream.  </li>
      <li>It has a good texture that makes it easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love this better then my Clinique products!</li>
      <li>The best part is that it has a subtle mattifying effect which is perfect for me because my skin can get oily.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be amazing but its okay.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin clear and a perfect balance of hydration.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t find a better product on the market.</li>

      <li>HOPE THIS HELPS..... :)</li>
      <li>THIS SERUM IS MORE TO SOFTEN YOUR LOOK</li>
      <li>Probably because I need more than it could give.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will keep using it until it&#x27;s out, just because it does make my face feel extremely smooth and allows my BB cream to just kind of glide on, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>

      <li>Others may like it better.</li>

      <li>Might work better for some people.</li>

      <li>I do think you will be pleased</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love the product, and i love the way my skin feels after.</li>
      <li>I could tell because the box it came in looked worn, and the top of the bottle looked worn again.  </li>

      <li>and my makeup looks so much better since using it.</li>

      <li>I think the company just repackaged their product in an attempt to get more money for it.</li>
      <li>Those of us with more wear and tear seem to get the most benefit from the product.  </li>
      <li>Younger women who report no results probably have great skin to start with!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and haven&#x27;t gotten much love from aging-skin products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Still applying. Will know outcome soon</li>
    <li> Amazingly balancing to my skin. I always feel refreshed after using...</li>
    <li> It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING</li>
    <li> Amazing! One of the only skin products I&#x27;ve bought more that once. Keeps my skin clear and a perfect balance of hydration. When I run out and don&#x27;t use it for a while I difiantly notice!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and smells really good.  I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the texture of my skin from it though.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this serum. I use it both AM and PM, and have seen a great improvement in the texture of my skin. While my pores are still visible, their appearance has minimized, and my makeup goes on much more smoothly without settling into my pores. I haven&#x27;t seen a great improvement in fine lines, but there is progress there and I am sure will see more results over time. Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel luxurious! Texture does improve over time (this is after 2 months of use)</li>
    <li> Not even to exaggerate I am completely OBSESSED with this product! After using it for 2 days I was hooked and couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my face so I could put this on! I have been using it consistently now for about 2 weeks straight, every morning and every night and I hope to NEVER have to not have this in my skin regimen! After the first two days seeing the difference it has made I went and got the Day/Night cream from the same line and the two together are just amazing. I plan to also purchase the face wash as well! I have very acne prone, sensitive, combination oily skin so it is very hard for me to find products that work and for the first time in my adult life my skin is bright and soft and ACNE FREE and moisturized all the time! I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t moisturize enough or would make me break out and I was completely wrong! I don&#x27;t think that it is supposed to clear up acne but it did for me and it gives just the right amount of moisture that I don&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky... just soft and flawless! I love looking at my naked skin now (Without a ton of makeup) and I have NEVER felt this way about my face! This is an amazing product, so worth the money. You will LOVE your skin!</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t find a better product on the market. THE SMELL is my favorite part. But it goes on my face every morning before foundation and I&#x27;ve notice it has visibly helped decrease my pores. I have horrible acne and this really helps correct the tones of redness on my cheeks. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> Had high expectations, but fell a little flat. Probably because I need more than it could give. Others may like it better.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have tried tons of different things like derma rollers, masks, bb-creams, murad, scrubs, expensive microdermabrasion and chemical peels, etc. to try and lessen my hormonal acne scars/pock marks, and have always gotten little to no results; especially with the burning chemical peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to purchase another youth code product since the others I tried did not really wow me, but I found the texture perfector on sale locally and tried it anyway. Very glad I got it. It&#x27;s been about a month and I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle. I&#x27;ve noticed that the pores/marks in between my eyebrows have significantly shrunk in size and the ones on my cheeks that were a little deeper, are smoothing out.  It&#x27;s really the first time in a long time that I have looked at my skin in the mirror and didn&#x27;t walk away in disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint granny/floral smell to it that I do not care for but can live with. Usually the perfumed products give me breakouts but so far so good. One thing I noticed was- a little goes a long way. When I put it on my skin heavy, the excess gets gummy and balls up. If you figure out the right amount that your skin will absorb, you are left with a soft satin feel.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a whirl, along with their foaming gel cleanser, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to work because nothing works on my problem-combo-insane skin. THIS DID! I&#x27;m shocked, but my skin is clearing up, looking good, not too oily nor dry. My skin tone looks more even and make-up goes on easier, too. I&#x27;m a happy camper and plan on trying more items from this line.</li>
    <li> Instant results.  Smells like an expensive cologne.  A little goes a long way, no greasy feeling, and feels great</li>
    <li> I tried a sample from a magazine, &amp; HAD to run to the store to purchase it.  I noticed that my face was luminous, refreshed, &amp; lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> This serum and the corresponding Pore Vanisher from the same L&#x27;Oreal line are amazing.  They are real &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; winners, and I prefer using them to higher end specialty products.  This serum is very lightweight and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I use this in the evening.  However, it wears well under makeup too, so it can definitely be part of a morning routine.  This serum should be the first product you put on your face after cleansing/toning.</li>
    <li> It is the generic version of Lancôme&#x27;s Vissionnaire at a third of the price!  So far so good, the only objectionable thing is the perfume smell in it, I do not see why they have to put that in a skin care product!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of L&#x27;Oreal facial moisturizers. I discovered how wonderful they were when I first tried the Youth Code Luminize serum. My skin was acting up during the winter so I started looking for the Youth Code serum when I saw reviews for this texture perfector. I decided to give it a try and I AM IN LOVE. It&#x27;s been exactly one month since I bought it and my pores are gone. For reference, I have dark brown, combination skin (non sensitive). My skin is pretty good most of the time and my pores stay minimal with consistent exfoliation. I&#x27;ve been using my facial scrub 50% less than I usually do because my skin looks so smooth now. The best part is that it has a subtle mattifying effect which is perfect for me because my skin can get oily. I use it under my usual moisturizer (LUSH Enzymion) and I&#x27;m good to go all day. And because my skin looks smoother, my makeup looks flawless. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s only been a month and I&#x27;m not even 1/4 through the bottle yet. I&#x27;ve only been using it once in the morning however. People with problem skin might be better off using it twice per day. I&#x27;m definitely making this a staple. Love it!</li>
    <li> Okay, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When do I use it? - In the morning, after my face is clean and after I&#x27;ve put toner on, but before any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS - Instantly makes my face feel so smooth and nice and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS - It&#x27;s been 3 weeks of using this product every single morning and I haven&#x27;t noticed any longer-term effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it until it&#x27;s out, just because it does make my face feel extremely smooth and allows my BB cream to just kind of glide on, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Ive seen some negative reviews stating it never sinks in to your skin. I have to disagree. It goes on flawlessly and disappears flawlessly. Absolutely love this. My skin was silky smooth and soft the first time i used it. And my pores were smoother and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I was really upset when I received this.  It was packaged messy with tape and when I finally got all the tape off, the damn bottle looked like it had been used.  I could tell because the box it came in looked worn, and the top of the bottle looked worn again.  I absolutely love Amazon, but I know what to purchase and not to purchase from the  website.  If you want this product, go to Walgreens, or CVS.</li>
    <li> Youth Code Texture Serum works after the first use!  You will notice fewer lines and pores will be tighter and less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Works very nicely. Everyone thinks I am 40 and not 57. Boosts my personal image of myself, even though I act 25. Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I totally understand where people are coming from when they say it smells floral and old-lady-like but I really like the smell and out of this line of products, the serum probably has the least noticable fragrance. In general, it reminds me of the beauty department at a high end store. I&#x27;m using this product, the day/night cream and the facial soap and it&#x27;s been about a month and oh boy what a difference! It honestly took about two or three weeks before I could tell any difference and I was actually about to give up with it but I figured I&#x27;d finish the bottles and then decide and I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it! I&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; acne but I HAD a few acne scars on my cheeks that never seemed to fade no matter how many different lotions I&#x27;ve tried. With this system, my scars/raised areas where the acne flared up have disappeared! My skin tone is more even and I&#x27;m even noticing that the blackheads that have been on my nose since my early teens are slowly fading! I would highly recommend this system, it&#x27;s a little pricey to get started but well worth the money and the products last a lot longer than you would think because you only need a little bit at a time!</li>
    <li> This product has done nothing for me and I still have half the bottle left . . .  may have to come back and \\&quot;review\\&quot; it again.</li>
    <li> i was really looking forward to use this, since a lot of youtubers love it, but unfortunately this broke me out and left my skin feeling sticky, my skin is not sensitive nor have i found a product that breaks me out, i guess there is a first time for everything.. maybe is just my skin..  so i wont purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing several makeup artists on YouTube use it. It is one of the best serums of used probably ever! It&#x27;s very light, and not overly drying (though I usually apply moisturizer over right after). I&#x27;ve noticed results in the overall appearance of my skin. It is softer, brighter, and smoother!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product three times and I use it every morning before applying my makeup. It reduces my pores and leaves my skin flawless for applying makeup. It keeps my skin moist.</li>
    <li> This product contains alcohol .... And you can smell it and fell the burn. I wanted to like this product so much and hoping to replace Lancôme version but oh so disappointed.</li>
    <li> It has the feel of a serum, which I love.  But that&#x27;s to be expected.  I don&#x27;t know if it has anti-aging properties because with my first use it smelled horrible and pungent but I put it on anyway and it made my face smell intensely musky.  I researched this before I bought it, but was not prepared for the smell.  If you like Chanel No 5 or any markedly musky scent, you will love this.  I used it today but will not use it again.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice but does not play well with gel moisturizers. It starts to solidify and crumble off my face. If you use this with a regular moisturizer I think you&#x27;ll be fine but know it doesn&#x27;t do well with all products. It has a sister moisturizer so maybe they made it just to be used with that.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it is NOT a quick fix to uneven skin tone. Some people are so impatient to achieve healthy skin that they don&#x27;t realize that the fast working stuff is so bad for your skin. I got so many compliments on my skin from using this product. People said I was glowing as if I was pregnant. Funny because I wasn&#x27;t pregnant at all. I will be repurchasing this item.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works or not. My face feels nice to the touch. It smells nice to me, it felt smooth going on... BUT DOES NO ONE ELSE FEEL THE BURNING!?!?</li>
    <li> good product and convenient way to purchase it.  It is hard to find specific products at the store.  I was happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Really I like this stuff and will order again later,Thanks in advance for more of the same in the future.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample of this out of my Allure magazine (actually stretched it out to use for 3 days), and I liked the feel of it.  Smells okay.  I purchased a bottle and have been using twice a day like the instructions and it seems to be working well.  Its definitely cheaper than some of the department store serums I had been using. Based on the on the other reviewer saying its no different from the non-concentrate version, perhaps I&#x27;ll try that next.</li>
    <li> Just the smell will win you over.&lt;br /&gt; Makes my face feel smooth and gives it a healthy look. Great find.</li>
    <li> it is a real good serum, you can feel the difference. light and smooth. And it goes on and on.. this product lasts quite a while</li>
    <li> This serum is so incredible! I&#x27;m on my second bottle will almost be on my third. I started using this serum in January. My skin prior to using this serum was not entirely problematic, but could definitely use some fixing. I had redness, uneven skin tone, sallow skin, medium sized pores and I had these bumps around my cheeks and on my forehead that I could not remove. The bumps were so annoying because they just didn&#x27;t give you a fresh appearance with foundation on and it ruined the appearance of having a flawless face. I tried popping them, but they were just really small whiteheads or just annoying bumps that had no underlying drainage. The first two nights I applied this serum, I noticed immediate results. The bumps diminished and after a month, disappeared or showed up once in a blue moon. I use this serum in conjunction with Benzoyl Peroxide to prevent acne and let me tell you, the only acne I get is from my menstrual cycle. Even then, I get pimples once or twice a month. I went without pimples for a short time as well. Anyway, this serum is just absolutely amazing. It made my skin baby bottom smooth, pores tightened and were smaller, and helped to get rid of those annoying bumps/ whiteheads on my face. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from coworkers for having such a &amp;#34;clear face&amp;#34; as if I was born without skin problems. I cannot go a day without serum. I use it twice a day, during the daytime under makeup and at bedtime. The serum smells luxurious, feels smooth upon application and isn&#x27;t oily or sticky. This product is a miracle worker for my skin!</li>
    <li> It makes you face feel n look much better I look like I have foundation on with out even putting it on!</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this especially for $25 from CVS but Nicole Guerriero highly recommended it so I gave it and try and I am in love. This has really helped my skin to have a smooth surface and my makeup looks so much better since using it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and this is definitely my go-to serum. I use it morning and night right after washing my face. Truthfully, I don&#x27;t even know what it&#x27;s &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to do, but I like what it&#x27;s done to my face!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I can&#x27;t say much about it as I only use it for the last 2 weeks. I didn&#x27;t really notice huge difference in my skin but my skin is definitely smoother and softer. I use it together with youth code day/night cream. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but honestly I don&#x27;t like the smell. Overall, product is good.</li>
    <li> This serum (and all of the youth code line moisturizers) contains an insane amount of dimethicone. Which is why so many people think it leaves their face smooth. Of course it does, it&#x27;s pure silicone! This stuff will likely break you out and is not a good moisturizer unless you enjoy the waxy, filmy, cakey feel that it leaves. $20 for a little bottle and they used the CHEAPEST ingredients they could find. Don&#x27;t be tricked by the packaging, yuck.</li>
    <li> This is not like other creams I&#x27;ve tried that leave your face feeling greasy. It has a great smooth texture that is light and just awesome! I have used it for about a week and I love it so far :)</li>
    <li> I really do like this product and definitely notice improvement in the texture of my skin. Only downside is that immediately after you stop using the serum your skin just reverts back to what it was before.</li>
    <li> It made me break out so I gave it to my boyfriend. He&#x27;s been using it once a day for a month or so and is halfway through the bottle. His pores look smaller to me so if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love or hate this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and a half and haven&#x27;t really seen any changes to the texture of my skin or shrinking of my pores.  On the flip side it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.  I purchased this product on a blog recommendation and found it on sale so I bought 3 bottles (I figured 1 bottle would probably last a month and 3 months usage would be a good test to see if I like the product) and had hoped to see at least some results by now.  Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t really meet the expectations that I had of it.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with the fragrance or texture of this product like some of the other reviewers and I would recommend this product for a young teenage girl as a starter serum but I think us ladies need to be a little more indulgent with the products we place on our beautiful faces :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, however, LOVE to hear if anyone has any recommendations for a good Serum/Day Cream &amp;/or Night Cream.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Ive tried several different products and lines ansd have worked in spas so lets say i know enough to know about skin care. This is an honest product. It does make your skin smoother, softer, and a little more even. Pores look a tad bit softer. Mind you this is my third day using it. I could touch bases in a mouth to give you a better review and results. Its always good to give your product 30 days. I do say I love the soft rose smell. Not to over powering. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WRINKLE FIGHTER THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU. TRY NUETROGENA RAPID WRINKLE REPAIR NIGHT CREAM. THIS DOES WORK FOR THAT. THIS SERUM IS MORE TO SOFTEN YOUR LOOK LIKE IT SAYS TEXTURE PERFECTOR NOT WRINKLE. HOPE THIS HELPS..... :)&lt;br /&gt;Giving it a 3 until a month in and then will see.</li>
    <li> Works really quickly .none greasy and after a few days I can see an improvement in the  firmness of my skin</li>
    <li> I purchased and used this with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Texture Perfector Day/Night Cream and my skin tone did improve and my pores seemed smaller.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the company that owns this owns Lancôme and the share similar ingredients ...not the price. However with this product. DO NOT USE With makeup or any other product. It balls up like rubber cement . I have so e other products I&#x27;m and trying at night and put this on the back burner.  It does go on nice and the skin felt smooth but did I not notice any difference in my pores.</li>
    <li> My must have in my skin care if you have texture problems such as small bumps or big pores you need this I love it been using for months and I no longer need pore filling primer like I used to! I will always repurches love it!!</li>
    <li> It broke my skin out.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It&#x27;s a bit pricey for a drugstore product but I believe it&#x27;s worth it. Product smells amazing and it is good for my acne prone skin. Doesn&#x27;t break me out at all and gives my face a smoother appearance.</li>
    <li> It just arrived--can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it.  It comes very highly rated.</li>
    <li> After getting the near 40 skin change, i wasnt sure something could help me. I had smoked for ten years and the pores to prove it. I also started getting fine lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The key thing to remember with this product is that it is a serum, It is not a moisturizer. A little goes a long way. If you use too much product or do not let it dry before applying make up it will give you a flakey look. I only use two pumps. I use it on my cheeks with large pores and under my eyes carefully.&lt;br /&gt;I have had really good results. It tightens my eye area so the lines are bearly visible. The pores are shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;My results didnt happen with the first use. It took me a few weeks to start seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars because I don&#x27;t know if these results are as permanent as the ad proclaims. It could be just a tightening product. When i don&#x27;t use it my skin isnt as taut.</li>
    <li> So I am 17 turning 18 and I never really used any skincare products daily (I would use them for about a week then never touch em again). I was looking at some old pictures and it smacked me in the face that my skin looked sooo much better a few years back. I decided I need a daily skin care routine so I started my research. I was looking in the price range of not CVS brand but not department store either. I found the L&#x27;Oreal youth code line and thought it was perfect. The reviews were great and the packaging was ADORABLE! I went over to the store and surprisingly it was on sale for $19, plus if I spent more than $50 of L&#x27;Oreal products I get a $10 Store wide coupon next time I come.  I ended up buying the Texture Perfector Serum ($19) , the Texture Perfector Night/Day Moisturizer ($19)  and the Youth Code Gel Foaming Cleanser ($(9.50).  As soon as I came home I ran to the bathroom to wash my face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture perfecter serum smells great. It has a pearl color and pinkish in the light. It goes on really smooth and instantly my skin feels hydrated. I have dry skin near my eyes and the rest of my face is somewhat sensitive/normal. Overall the product is okay and I will finish it all but next time I might try something else. I thought it would be amazing but its okay. The night/day moisturizer burned the hell out of my cheeks but i loved the cleanser the most. Might work better for some people.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a skin texture corrector for a while and while eat CVS one day I came across this product and decided I would give it a try. For the $25 dollars I spent on it it was well worth every cent! I love this better then my Clinique products! After one use I could tell my skin was so much smoother and makeup went on flawlessly! You don&#x27;t need much of this and it sinks in to your skin quick so it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy! After a week I can tell my face looks so much better and I am in love with this stuff! I will def buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s and haven&#x27;t gotten much love from aging-skin products. I found this on sale so figured I&#x27;d try it... and WOW. I could watch in the mirror while it worked. It refined my pores and retexturized my face. Most dramatic improvement I&#x27;ve ever had from a product. And the effect lasts for at least 2 days, through more face-cleanings and use of other skin products. It&#x27;s a bit harsh on older skin, so after I put it on I put Olay sensitive skin hydrating lotion on top, as well as my usual makeup. I can&#x27;t wear anything with sunblock in it, but so far I&#x27;ve had no reactions in the sun, wind, and extreme cold while using this serum.  Mine smells like rubbing alcohol, with barely noticeable floral fragrance. I don&#x27;t know if this means that the product expired (hence the sale price).  Younger women who report no results probably have great skin to start with! Those of us with more wear and tear seem to get the most benefit from the product.  And as for breakouts... I also have a few scattered pinprick breakouts on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m waiting to see if they&#x27;ll resolve as I use the product for a while. They&#x27;re barely noticeable and well worth it for the overall improvement.  5/29/15: The cheek breakout didn&#x27;t go away, and in fact got worse--the red spots got a bit bigger and stayed that way, even after I stopped using the serum for a few days. But I found something that cured it: Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer (tube version), which seems to have amazing healing powers overall. So now I&#x27;m using both of these products with fantastic results.</li>
    <li> I do not know what this is doing pore wise, but my skin is incredibly soft after less than a month of use! Very moisturizing, so much so that I only use it at night and with nothing else, because I have oily skin and something else on top will be too much. Fast absorbing, too!</li>
    <li> My face feels very smooth after applying it.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders. I saw results within a week of using. I am brown skinned with hormonal acne and this helped to smooth my skin back to &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; again. When I stopped using it, I did notice a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my skin and i&#x27;ve noticed some changes in my skin and it&#x27;s only been a few days. This product is a game changer!</li>
    <li> Great product! its light, not greasy and makes my face smooth, even toned the next day. I wish they&amp;#34;ll make it in a a bigger size. The price is not bad either, when you think of it. Its made by the same people who own Lancome.i just bought it again!!</li>
    <li> I got this because I had heard good reviews about it and that it&#x27;s good to use before a primer and foundation. I also bought it because I want to be more conscious of my skin care to help out when I get older (22 now but many years in aquatics will fast forward my fair skin). So far, I have only used it for a few days at night and in the morning. I haven&#x27;t used it specifically before my make-up just because I haven&#x27;t worn any since I bought this. It&#x27;s very light feeling and non-greasy. At night, i follow with an Olay night cream I use and it doesn&#x27;t react badly to that and my face feels fresh in the AM.  I noticed that it definitely helps with redness and discolorations on my face. I will continue to use. Also, I had bought this at Target but it was $19.99 so I plan on buying it from here since it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth, skin seems bright, stings nothing (and I live in S. Florida where there is high humidity as well so having perspired while wearing, it stung nothing and, yes a bit got in my eyes as well) don&#x27;t be scared away. In my opinion it&#x27;s a fine product and a little goes a long way. Everyone is different. For me this stuff is great, it works.</li>
    <li> The wrong product was sent? I got the pore blurring not the serum. The price was very low so I guess I&#x27;ll go with it.</li>
    <li> I fail to see why this product is so much more expensive than the previous Youth code serum. I have used both and this appears to work just like the other, except this version is thicker, irritates my eyes more, and is four times the price. I&#x27;ve used it 2 weeks now, and yes my skin is very smooth, (i&#x27;m sure partly due to my nars moisturizer), fine lines and skin texture are what they were with the old serum. It works like any other serum to me. I think the company just repackaged their product in an attempt to get more money for it. No miracle here, sorry. If my opinion changes I will update.</li>
    <li> Good for my dry skin,,great moisturizer. ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It changed my skin. I&#x27;ve been using youth code for about two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.  My dark spots are disappearing, my skin is so smooth and I have no more bumps around my chin area. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants clear smooth skin. OH and it smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. My skin hasn&#x27;t seen this kind of glow. It works fast and I noticed results within two weeks. Great product</li>
    <li> I WILL BE BUYING THIS SERUM AGAIN AND AGAIN! It has done WONDERS for my skin! I use it every time I wash my face before I apply moisturizer. The smell is addicting as well as the texture. I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff. YOU NEED IT IN YOUR LIFE!</li>
    <li> i use it before my make up and i realy like it it is not oily  and it would go smoothly</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Meh...&amp;#34; is the best description I can give for this this product. I am 37 years old and was really hoping that this would be my &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34; to help wake up my skin and help diminish the fine lines around my eyes in the mornings. At my age, I should know better - there is no such thing as a miracle in a bottle!! While this did provide a little moisture during the winter months for my combination skin, it really lacked any other benefits. I think I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena&#x27;s Clear Face, ultra-light with SPF, which is really more important anyway!</li>
    <li> It stinks and it made my face really oily. I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of it and when I woke up in the morning and my face was so oily.</li>
    <li> I know that this product doesn&#x27;t claim to help with acne but it has helped smooth out my skin tremendously. I wish I could explain it but it&#x27;s just a really great product. also, it feels so luxurious!</li>
    <li> This definitely smoothes the look of your skin and pores.  Let it sit a bit before putting on other creams or makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly not impressed by this product. It is basically just a non-greasy, good facial lotion. It doesnt do anything for evening texture, lines, dark spots.</li>
    <li> This is a good &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; option if you do not want to splurge on department store brands. The only complaint I have is that it contains alcohol which can dry out your skin. I haven&#x27;t had that issue yet and will continue to use until I replace it with my department store serum. I do think you will be pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this serum from Amazon twice, after buying it the first time from Target. It&#x27;s great. It works really well to keep my skin looking beautiful and healthy. It has a good texture that makes it easy to apply. It has an iridescent quality which is not necessary but it is pretty. There is a light fragrance but I don&#x27;t mind it. The package is really pretty, it is a glass package with a pump. I liked the pump, it made it easy to apply sparingly (as you should with a serum) and also not waste a lot of product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the lack of performance and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, love the product, and i love the way my skin feels after. However I am not sure but think it may break me out a little.</li>
    <li> Just okay, Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Oil shrunk my pores better than this did</li>
</ol>
