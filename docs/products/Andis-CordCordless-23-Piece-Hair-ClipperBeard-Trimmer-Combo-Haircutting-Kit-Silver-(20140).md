      <li>Good price, if your only going to use the clippers.</li>
      <li>I quickly needed to order some cheap trimmers for work when my favorite ones unexpectedly died, so Since these had clippers too I thought why not.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Clippers are great!</li>
    <li> The trimmer stopped working after a few months.</li>
    <li> Used the clippers a few times mayb 5 and they are terrible.  They do not cut. I am a stylist and I guess you get what you pay for. I had to go back to my old ones and i&#x27;ll be shopping around for new clippers again. I would not give these clippers any stars. Horrible.</li>
    <li> looks better in the photo, not impressed</li>
    <li> Heavy, noisy, pulling the hair rather than cutting it, cut the hain unevenly, strong vibration. It is the worst hair cliper I bought.</li>
    <li> The price was right and the shipping time very good.  This brand trimmer has always been reliable.  I also have one to trim my dog wtih.</li>
    <li> The liners didn&#x27;t do a good job edging up my hair line and the clippers are very very dull..and doesn&#x27;t cut good at all</li>
    <li> great to help my husband keep his beard and hair groomed</li>
    <li> These Andis hair clippers work like a dream.I have a pair of professonal andis clippers and these work just as good.The only thing is the hair guards are made with cheap plastic and are flimsy but I just use the harder plastic ones from the professonal one.Now for the wireless trimer, its not a bad little trimmer but I did have difficulty getting a sharp stright edge. They work great clearing the brush but to get a fine fine line I recommend using a mini handheld trimmer or a profsonal trimmer.Overall for the price of $30 bucks this is a clipper combo set that worth the price.</li>
    <li> love it...im so cheap..so i always find ways to save and cutting my hair is one of thm..im a female by the way and they also do great design...</li>
    <li> they combo works great almost silent it does not ever heat for a long time. Wish the trimmer was not using batteries.</li>
    <li> The small clipper requires bateries, but once in last dam long, i used it to shave and shape my self and frends up, stay fresh get these clippers, it came makein a little noise put the oil it came with on perfect smooth cut, dose fades lots of different leghths great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever used.  And that of itself is saying a lot.  Being a female - The hold is just right for me.      Now my husband love for me to cut his hair -- now that he has a personal barber he think he is going to get a hair cut every week.  A trim - that will work![[ASIN:B0016C0SYO Andis 20140 Hair Clipper/Trimmer Combo Pack]</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby and he loves it! Great product.</li>
    <li> Really cheap product. The trimmers cannot be adjusted for a sharper trim. They feel really light and fragile. Would not recommend these particular clippers.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great value. The small trimmer uses standard batteries so I love that there is no cord and no recharging. The big clippers do not get as close to the scalp on the lowest setting as I would like but did come with tons of attachments. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great price for great product</li>
    <li> Trimmer may be one of the worst ive ever used in 10 years of cutting hair professionally. Both clipper and trimmer blades were dull although they were brand new, especially the trimmer which was also misaligned. When extended, the clipper blade stops cutting and instead pulls the hair. A value priced set that isnt even worth the cheaper price.</li>
    <li> Disappointed by opening the package.  Seems to be old and damaged one sent to me. Some components are missing which are listed.</li>
    <li> but the big one is OK, used twice, works well&lt;br /&gt;the gauge is nice for users to work their own hair</li>
    <li> Broke after 5 mins.  The trimmer never worked.  Total waste of money.  Save your money and buy a better quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but is quite loud compared to my old trimmer.  Good quality, solid feel and does not pull at the hairs when cutting.  I use it to trim my beard and cut my son&#x27;s hair - outside of the noise it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> one of the pieces came broken but works great</li>
    <li> Trimmer does not work!</li>
    <li> It looks like they decided to include alot of Junky addons to make up for the fact that these clippers suck. they hardly cut and when they do cut they pull the hair out rather than evenly cutting I would avoid this one</li>
    <li> It gets the job done very well!</li>
    <li> 12/02/13: 5 Star rating is based on item received as described but since it is a gift for Christmas, product review/performance has not yet been determined.</li>
    <li> Clippers are good with fading the guides where cheap and flimsy so get better ones if your looking for a good clean cut</li>
    <li> My husband owned a pair of Andis which broke just recently. He loved the pair he had so he decided to buy the same brand. I don&#x27;t know if this specific product was defective or if it&#x27;s just the quality of the product being made these days. Needless, to say they don&#x27;t smoothly go through his hair causing the blades to catch and pull on his hairs. Ouch! Had to buy a Conair brand, they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great quality clippers &amp; they came on time . They really get the job done. Glad to have gotten 2 in 1 for a great price .</li>
    <li> Nice package. Clippers work good when it turns on since it came with a power button deffect and I&#x27;m past the return period to get a replacement. I expected better quality from Andis.</li>
    <li> great product i received</li>
    <li> The master clipper is just OK, not very impressive. Good to buy in offer. But am not completely satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product, have cut my and several friends hair many times with this product.</li>
    <li> The Best deal out there hands down! Cuts closer than ALL the other brands.  Lasts long as well and simple to clean.</li>
    <li> Awful.  One star is being generous.  They don&#x27;t work hardly at all.  I have had them three weeks and they are going in the trash.  I&#x27;m using clippers I bought 3 years ago over these.   do not buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best clippers out there.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my daughter.  She said lining and trimming makes the styling complete.  She is very happy with the trimmers.</li>
    <li> Order# 108-8524549-8806637 Shall not I have received the product, please trace this product. Thank You</li>
    <li> I was sent a defective product, I had to return it, I would not recommend this clipper and trimmer!</li>
    <li> This is not a good clipper I will not recommend it to anyone. I tried it just once and the next time I want to use it I could not because it was not working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very happy. The power of the machine is not good. In fact since the switch fails to turn on</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have only used these twice, but had a great cut both times.  I use these on my 4 year old son.</li>
    <li> Andis 23-Piece Clipper and Trimmer Combo Pack (20140), is Very nice item to multi use in head, work really fine.&lt;br /&gt;you can buy it with confidence.</li>
    <li> I quickly needed to order some cheap trimmers for work when my favorite ones unexpectedly died, so Since these had clippers too I thought why not.  I must not have read the description I guess because I never noticed that the trimmers take AA batteries. and are not rechargeable, so that doesn&#x27;t last more than a week for me.Plus they are so LOUD, and they catch hair which caused it to pull and bite it.The clippers only turn on half the time. It seems like something doesn&#x27;t catch with the on switch. Overall if your a professional no good- But like I said I needed something cheap and on the quick. Ive experienced this is the past with Andis before.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT...PURCHASED THIS BACK IN 2011 AND ITS STILL WORKING GREAT! A MUST BUY! BEST BRAND AROUND!</li>
    <li> cheap...did not work well at all...</li>
    <li> Price seemed good. But he wireless trimmer was not the quality model I was looking for. It was NOT rechargeable. It used AA battery. So I returned the product</li>
    <li> It arrived few days ago as a present for my father. I really liked it seems quality product. Trimmer works on AA batteries (not included), also it seems plastic but not cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is sturdy and built quality is really good. also it has screw on one side and doesn&#x27;t look that great at all.&lt;br /&gt;there was no information about product voltage, so it appears that it can only support 120v. that&#x27;s not comfy (we use 220-240 voltage sockets. so now I have to buy extra voltage converter if we won&#x27;t to use product</li>
    <li> Quality of the product is poor</li>
    <li> All that was promised.</li>
    <li> I truely loved them.  They work perfectly so far and loved the price that I paid for them.  I would recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> I returned this. The trimmer did not provide a close shave. Recommend a rechargeable instead.</li>
    <li> I used for 3 times and the clipper pick not to cut  my hair</li>
    <li> Great clippers at an affordable price. I just wish that the trimmer was rechargeable and not needing double A&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I had a $40 Andis clipper in the past and loved it. The old one I had worked great until I dropped it one day and broke it. I was looking for a replacement and thought by choosing Andis again, I would find a similar quality clipper. I was a little apprehensive since these were less expensive than my previous model. I used this clipper with the 1/4 (attachment 2)to give my son a buzz cut. My son has coarse straight hair. The clipper keeps pulling his hair and made him cry everytime. I&#x27;ve tried oiling the clippers and spraying the Andis lubricant to see if it would help. It didn&#x27;t. The cordless trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull my son&#x27;s hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting a fine line. I&#x27;m not sure if this Andis model I have is just a lemon. I&#x27;m now looking for another clipper to replace this piece of junk. I may buy another Andis clipper, but will shop for a better model. Sometimes, you just get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Works great. The wife is a stylist and usually goes to her supply house to buy everything at a discounted rate. The last several sets of trimmers we have purchased on amazon to save the cash. These were a great buy for the price</li>
    <li> Before today, i don&#x27;t think I have ever given a product one star. I bought these since my husband and son trim their hair at home. We have had them for just 2 months, and tonight we just threw them in the trash. They are a complete waste of money. They cut hair very unevenly, and I end up having to trim all the random hairs that are longer with scissors. These clippers trip the breaker all the time, it was extremely annoying, so i ended up having to go to a non-GFI plug in the house just to avoid this. The clippers also make an awful noise off and on, and it scares my son. Far as how the clippers feel from a 13 year old&#x27;s point of view, he says these clippers hurt when I use them on his hair. I will never purchase this brand again. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on these clippers, they will only disappoint you.</li>
    <li> Wish it were sharper, but it works</li>
    <li> Did not like it:&lt;br /&gt;too havy, to noisy, not functional always when you turn it on: sometimes needs to be tturned on and off in order to start. Secondary batery operated unit is useless (should have been done with rechargable batery).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut a smooth bald head, and they are very loud. The trimmers doesn&#x27;t cut like I expected either.</li>
    <li> So far these are awesome! So much better than our old pair. Smooth and quiet, no pulling. Almost makes me enjoy cutting hair. ;)</li>
    <li> Great deal on the best clippers I have used.</li>
    <li> The small trimmer hasn&#x27;t worked once but the clippers work pretty well although they are very noisy. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
    <li> Works great compared to my beard trimmer I was using to cut my hair. Great set for the money.</li>
    <li> Cheap.dont buy,broke the same week!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I tried it and loved it, I can not ask for more, is what I was expecting. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This set is terrible.the clippers keep turning on and off. Not consistent. The cord for the clippers is way too short. &amp; the trimmers arent sharp enough</li>
    <li> It pulls so much power that it shorted my bathroom wall socket and broke mid haircut, first use. I sent it back through amazon and got another one that tripped the breaker again, but didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;Both are absolutely too loud, but I must say that it is fairly heavy duty. I use a power surge strip now every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that saves the review from one star is the additional beard trimmer. It works alright, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer sounds like a damn chainsaw and is nearly the same decibel level. All joking aside, this thing is WAYY too loud and putting it next to your ears might actually do real hearing damage</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present for my father. Everything in this set is fantastic. It comes with a cleaning set and all the attachments. The trimmers themselves are heavy and excellent quality. A perfect gift for that handsome guy in your life if you don&#x27;t want to pay the expensive prices for a set from Sears or Dillard&#x27;s! I love it!</li>
    <li> well enough with clippers works fine have any problems of all good long time</li>
    <li> Product broke one month later and couldn&#x27;t returned for a replacement. Don&#x27;t purchase this machine!!! 1star</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been a gift giving fool thanks to the great deals found on Amazon.com, so my brother made the suggestion for this brand so I figured let me see the prices.....I lucked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual great Amazon service they arrived as promised and in the condition stated at a price point my brother approved of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now based on the feedback I got from the recipient they are great clippers, but they simply don&#x27;t get add close as he would like for his clean Kojak look, he still has to go in with a razor. But alp isn&#x27;t lost the trimmer is apparently everything and works like a charm. So I think 3 stars is fair for great pricing and delivery.</li>
    <li> Small trimmer is basically useless. Large clipper clatters like crazy and the guards are chintzy. Useless for maintaining facial hair. For head hear, you are better off buying two haircuts at Supercuts. The scissors are fine.</li>
    <li> got it as a Black Friday deal.  I have to say I would have bought these at regular price. Great product.</li>
    <li> This machine don&#x27;t cut hair it rather pull your hair, it&#x27;s heavy and noisy I wasted my money for nothing. Now I have to go to the barber for a hair cut for $21. It pain my I bought this thinking it was gonna work I would have use that money for the hair cut instead.</li>
    <li> 2nd time using it  the clippers broke and the trimmer is battery operated and never makes a good connection</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real sure why this has bad reviews.  It is kinda heavy but it&#x27;s made out of metal so there&#x27;s that.  It&#x27;s always cut great for me.  I shave my head with it about once a week.  It&#x27;s never pulled any hair and it cuts evenly with ease.  I don&#x27;t find it loud either.  The precision trimmer is just a nice bonus.  Nothing real great about it, but it does it&#x27;s job fine.</li>
    <li> Clipper works trimmer sucks</li>
    <li> it works pretty well, my only issue with it is that it tends to overheat a little more than normal. And for the price and all accessories that come with it i would say it&#x27;s not too bad...</li>
    <li> I purchased this combo pack, and so far its been great. Hair Clippers, Trimmer, and accessories at that price, you cant beat a deal like that.</li>
    <li> The clippers work great.  The blades are sharp and quiet.  The trimmer is battery operated and, even with fresh batteries, it sounds and feels like it&#x27;s about to run out of power.  Overall, it was a good purchase</li>
    <li> Had to return these. They didn&#x27;t work well at all. I had to use the pair I was planning to throw out, in order to finish the haircut I was in the middle of.</li>
    <li> Every detail that was said about the item was true plus having to sets of machine is a bonus instead of one doing all the work</li>
    <li> Very upset that I ordered this and only on of the clippers where in the box, don&#x27;t like false advertising.</li>
    <li> Poor, poor quality of the battery unit, did not notice about how cheap it is until I got it unfortunately. So I won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Main machine is fine but not the other one. Do not get trapped. Amalia H.</li>
    <li> works like a boss, love it</li>
    <li> Power switch broke first time it was used.  It was duller than the 2yr old Wahl we just threw away.</li>
    <li> These are really good products.</li>
    <li> My brother loves to cut hair. He loved this gift. It came in nice cases and looks good. I mostly bought if for the edger but found this was the best value. He loves them.</li>
    <li> Product delivered as promised. Trimmer works great. First clipper arrived and worked about 10  seconds. Returned product and received second unit. Clipper worked for about 10 seconds. Hopefully 3rd time  will be a charm. Really like the trimmer and the price. And of course Amazon customer service.</li>
    <li> I ordered this love the edger but the clipper I used on a little boy for the first time and it pulled his hair out.</li>
    <li> took me forever to adjust and the noise will tear down my eardrums,,had only to settle for the trimmer an give away the clippers</li>
    <li> These things are the worst, the power switch started shorting out after a month and I would have to play with them to get them to work.. Save yourself the time and don&#x27;t buy them..</li>
    <li> I want to return it I am a professional and it isnt the quality Im use to..</li>
    <li> Brought this about 3 months ago.. I shouldve invested a little more for a better product.. Like the saying always goes &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; simple as that. Will work nice for about a month..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you going to use at least once a week I don&#x27;t recommend this unit .. If u going to use it once a month then its OK for $25</li>
    <li> CHEAP ATTACHMENTS !!!!! ALSO, IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN CHINA VS. ANDIS CLIPPERS PURCHASED A FEW YEARS AGO. SORRY I KEPT THESE CLIPPERS.</li>
    <li> Oil them and they work like they&#x27;re supposed to! For the money even if they breakdown after several uses , of which they show no signs ,  they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought it here and it&#x27;s totally worthless, It&#x27;s very heavy, and makes noise like you are cutting your hair with grass trimmer</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it as soon as I got it. I read the instructions and already knew how to cut hair but read it anyway. The blade was dull and didn&#x27;t cut hair but actually got stuck to the hair. I HATE this and paid for it too. 25 dollars out of the window.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have been told they&#x27;d pay me more just so they can have the set. My answer NO. But this is how I ordered mine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the first set had a defect and got a replacement set.  Got the replacement and it worked for the first two cuts now its acting like the first set I received.  Someone tell me what is a good pair of clippers.  I need help.  Desperately needing a decent pair of clippers at least</li>
    <li> Order delivered within the time they mentioned, product was cool</li>
    <li> does a nice even ceasar</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my fiancé for our 2 year anniversary. He loves these, and I even helped him use them for the first time. These are perfect for beginner&#x27;s cutter&#x27;s, and if you like sturdy and reliable these are the clippers for you</li>
    <li> Timmer sucks, clipper makes a ton of noise and very heavy</li>
    <li> The smaller machine suckssss! Doesnt work even with new battery</li>
    <li> This one doesn&#x27;t cut very well. I have an original andis it just need a new blade. Saw this one and thought it would work just as well being from the same maker. I bought it for my husband but he hates it.</li>
    <li> This product was worthless the clippers don&#x27;t cut and the trimmers don&#x27;t trim, it was a total waste of my money</li>
    <li> didnt like how these cut at all ...bought brand new and they do not give a good shape up (very dull)and seem to have a shortage in the off and on button ...very disappointed</li>
    <li> We love this so far!  For cutting baby&#x27;s hair to husbands hair!</li>
    <li> Worst hair clip i ever used.Very dull blades as well should get a refund back.I have use andis before but this one is the worst ibhave ever experience</li>
    <li> It works fine, brings many attachment or combs and one small shaver razor blade and works with batteries.</li>
    <li> Good price, if your only going to use the clippers. Once you put the clipper guards it tends to cut un-even, and sometime leaving bald spots. The trimmer is pretty weak, but it serves its purpose.</li>
