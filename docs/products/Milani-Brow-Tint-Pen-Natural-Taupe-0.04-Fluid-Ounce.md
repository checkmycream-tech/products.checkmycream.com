      <li>Great price too.  </li>
      <li>is a great concept for those of us who are eyebrow challenged.  </li>

      <li>Good transaction.</li>
      <li>Loved my milani liner.  </li>
      <li>This may not work well for true brunettes, but, for a redhead like myself, it is the PERFECT color match.</li>
      <li>For me the NYX Medium 01 shade is perfect because it has a tiny amount of redness to it which is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>this product is amazing..</li>
      <li>Its amazing.</li>
      <li>It does not come off like the powder make-up did on me when I got warm or rubbed or touched my brows.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find products that make life easier.</li>
      <li>liked the color didn&#x27;t like the way it applied ...</li>
      <li>Great product, great price &amp; extremely fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and they pair nicely.</li>
      <li>Basically too light to do any good for me.</li>
      <li>Perfect color for me, and looks natural, if I could just get more then 2 strokes at a time.</li>
      <li>good product, easy to apply artistically, wears well, removes easily.</li>
      <li>Love this marker-type brow pen.</li>
      <li>This is the next best thing to getting tattooed eyebrows .</li>
      <li>I love this product and have in fact ordered more.  </li>
      <li>I do use a Sephora pencil to soften up the lines a bit but, for the most part, this is the product I&#x27;ll use from now on.  </li>
      <li>I love this concept.  </li>
      <li>My fear is that it will become unavailable as it seems many of the things I like do.  </li>
      <li>This is so much better than any pencil or powder.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I found it here at Amazon and ordered 2 more for fear that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again.</li>
      <li>works better for me than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this pen, and I hope they never discontinue it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a felt tip pen, way better than a pencil.</li>
      <li>Love how it goes on.  </li>
      <li>I love the product itself.</li>
      <li>It might work better on hair</li>
      <li>I love this product..</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re both excellent products especially for the price.</li>
      <li>You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure when using it</li>
      <li>my original review, I have discovered that, when I ordered, the product title and description for the pen (what I wanted and thought I would get) had been mismatched with a pic and \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; link for Milani&#x27;s Eyebrow Pencil!</li>
      <li>Bought a cheap  pencil at the store  works much better  </li>
      <li>after reading the reviews of this and other products it seemed like the best bet that this pen would not be so reddish.  </li>
      <li>Plus I sweat easily..</li>
      <li>And when that happens, I just pat my face with a tissue and it does not come off easily.</li>
      <li>As most cosmetics contain Titanium dioxide, this was a great find for me to darken up my light blonde eye brows.</li>
      <li>This really stays put well, it&#x27;s very easy to apply, just make sure and keep the pin stored horizontal.</li>
      <li>This is basically a felt tip pen with a fine point.  </li>
      <li>I bought it specifically because I thought I was getting a fine line marker or pen-type product that would stay put all day.</li>
      <li>This product probably would have worked fine</li>
      <li>I have another color, darker brown, and it is just fine,</li>
      <li>Because of its fine tip, it takes a fine touch to get the desired effect.  </li>
      <li>The color is light and it goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>it does do a nice job of blending the crayon, so that it looks more natural.</li>
      <li>Both are taupe brow pens with detailed points.</li>
      <li>so I use taupe for color and blend lightly with brow brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was SO excited to find this pen on Amazon!&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Milani is perhaps slightly more rigid, but both allow precise, more natural looking strokes.</li>
      <li>I would keep a clean mascara brush on hand and get a bargain brand eyebrow pencil.</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I liked it--it filled in any gaps (including ones</li>
      <li>This is a true situation where</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to those that have brow problems or those that want nice and natural looking brows.</li>
      <li>Great color even for dark hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply but dries out fast.</li>
      <li>I love this product in that it allows me to literally draw &#x27;hairs&#x27; into my brows for a very natural look vs. what one gets when one uses an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to use than any pencil; you can make fine, natural-looking lines.  </li>
      <li>Very vey light  </li>
      <li>This product saves me so much time, goes on smoothly, and stays on--even overnight.  </li>
      <li>its not as good as expected.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pen works so well and produces a more natural effect..  </li>
      <li>but ya gotta have fun</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair complected with light eyes and hair, and usually find a taupe shade to look most natural.</li>
      <li>As it dried it blended very nicely with my brows.</li>
      <li>It is the right shade and works as described</li>
      <li>The color lightens up as it dries, so my days of trying to find the right color are over.  </li>
      <li>The pen went on so easily and it was a breeze to apply a very natural looking brow .</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>pen I originally bought in store has lasted me a year and is still going strong, but I only wear makeup a couple of days a week if that.</li>
      <li>This has made my morning eyebrow application much faster and more natural looking.  </li>
      <li>really looks more natural than pencil</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get the pen to work after the first use.</li>
      <li>I ordered taupe because my eyebrows (what is actually left of them) are taupe-colored, although my hair is mostly silver.  </li>
      <li>I see that they have corrected their mistake, so I&#x27;ll order the pen again, and hopefully THAT&#x27;S what I&#x27;ll get this time ;-)</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and right where my T-zone is.</li>
      <li>If the tip filled a little better I would give this a 5.</li>
      <li>A nice aspect is the brush on the other end.</li>
      <li>Product is actually lighter than I expected, making it a happy surprise.  </li>
      <li>However, being more grey, this is warmer than my hair color; however, there is no brow pen with that coloration availalbe to my knowledge.</li>
      <li>Plus the tip always stays fine since it&#x27;s a marker, so you can be really precise and light with it, which helps to make it look natural because it doesn&#x27;t go all over the place and look too heavy.</li>
      <li>lasting and easy to use</li>
      <li>Started to love this brow pen, but seemed to dry out too fast-out of the pen that is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not waxy as most are and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to become very proficient at using them.  </li>
      <li>It makes lines similar to a sharpie regardless of how light a hand you apply it with.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for me.  Eyebrows with ease.!!!  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Loved my milani liner.  Stays over night if you dont remove you brow tint. Its amazing. Might be good to swim with or on sweaty days.</li>
    <li> I at first hated this. It went on really red, I looked awful. As it dried it blended very nicely with my brows. I love it. It&#x27;s now a makeup staple. I use it with my brow kit from Too Faced and they pair nicely. A must have into opinion.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much to fill in my sparse brows. Maybe that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for.</li>
    <li> Finding a product without irritants is quite a chore, I have a long list of chemical sensitivities. This goes on very well, does not need a heavy application, stays on for the day and does not cause irritation. I&#x27;m sensitive to titanium dioxide which causes itching and burning on my skin. As most cosmetics contain Titanium dioxide, this was a great find for me to darken up my light blonde eye brows. Yay!</li>
    <li> Great Item, works great!</li>
    <li> My brows are blonde and I have always had a problem finding brow make-up that looked natural with my blonde hair.  I love this product and have in fact ordered more.  It is easy to apply and looks very natural.  It does not come off like the powder make-up did on me when I got warm or rubbed or touched my brows.  I recommend this product to those that have brow problems or those that want nice and natural looking brows.</li>
    <li> This is basically a felt tip pen with a fine point.  It is fine enough to make single strokes, hair by hair.  The color is just enough for my very pale brows (I&#x27;m a redhead).  The only drawback is that the felt tip dries out too quickly. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m ordering another.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews of this and other products it seemed like the best bet that this pen would not be so reddish.  It&#x27;s pretty red and my hair isn&#x27;t.  I really want semi-permanent brow color in an ashy tone and NOT RED....sigh</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to take the place of powder and pencils that really doesn&#x27;t stay put well in Arizona heat. This really stays put well, it&#x27;s very easy to apply, just make sure and keep the pin stored horizontal. The only drawback is that sometimes the pin skips while applying and it does not put out any color</li>
    <li> Barely worked the first time, gpt about 6 strokes. From then on, drys up after about 2 strokes. Doesnt work at all. I wish it did. Perfect color for me, and looks natural, if I could just get more then 2 strokes at a time. I really wanted this to work.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that match my color needs. Easy to apply but dries out fast.</li>
    <li> This is nice and stays in place for a long time, I would purchase this product in the future, it also came in record time.</li>
    <li> It seems to have good staying power, and is a good way for me to fill-in a tattooed brow that has lost some color. Overall, though, it&#x27;s a little too dark for me. Wish there was one shade lighter. Love the sharp tip.</li>
    <li> good product, easy to apply artistically, wears well, removes easily.</li>
    <li> Way too dark and unnatural looking</li>
    <li> I wanted something that would stay on.  This stuff is for a person who has eyebrows to begin with.</li>
    <li> Great color even for dark hair.  Great price too.  The color lasts until you are ready to take it off.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this makes my brow look. I am a senior and hate the line drawn look on brows. This makes my brows look natural and the bonus it lasts for days! I have gotten compliments from friends and family. I have gray, white and brown hair so I use taupe for color and blend lightly with brow brush. I need to fill in spaces on brow. Try it I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have no eyebrows at all &amp; this works perfect for me.  It stays on, easy to use &amp; it lasts a very long time &amp; I use it everyday.  I would of given it 5 stars if it was just a little lighter.  You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure when using it or it comes on too dark, at least for me.  Great product, great price &amp; extremely fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the product itself. The only problem I have, being extremely nearsighted, is that the tube is a bit too long for me to get close enough to the mirror to apply the tint! Magnifying mirrors do help, however, they are not always close at hand. This is a true situation where &amp;#34;less is (could be) more&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have a disorder that&#x27;s made my eyebrows very skimpy.  This has made my morning eyebrow application much faster and more natural looking.  You have much more control with this product than with any other eyebrow pencil.  It&#x27;s not waxy as most are and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to become very proficient at using them.  I keep one in my purse, one in my bathroom, and one in my travel makeup kit.</li>
    <li> As always, the star system is dumb.  Product is actually lighter than I expected, making it a happy surprise.  I&#x27;m surprised there are low reviews but, of course, you can&#x27;t please everyone.  I have silver-gray hair and the taupe works better for me than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It&#x27;s light and blends in with my brows which are actually partially dark since I originally had dark hair.  It does appear to be drying up during use but you just have to press it a little bit to get it flowing again.  Much easier to use than any pencil; you can make fine, natural-looking lines.  My fear is that it will become unavailable as it seems many of the things I like do.  As for not being gray enough, gray hair makes women look old and drab enough without adding gray eyebrows to add another ten years.  Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> is a great concept for those of us who are eyebrow challenged.  it lasts 2 or 3 days.  color just a bit red for me (going grey) and the marker dries up too fast.&lt;br /&gt;I make my own by mixing outlast brownish lipstick with a tiny touch of green eyeliner in it (gets rid of red), and a bit of outlast gold 535.  it looks wonderful and I have eybrows without worry for 4 weeks!  feel like a mad scientist but ya gotta have fun some way lol</li>
    <li> I love this product in that it allows me to literally draw &#x27;hairs&#x27; into my brows for a very natural look vs. what one gets when one uses an eyebrow pencil.  Because of its fine tip, it takes a fine touch to get the desired effect.  I ordered taupe because my eyebrows (what is actually left of them) are taupe-colored, although my hair is mostly silver.  Prior to turning silver, I had medium-brown-to-dishwater-blonde hair, the color of my remaining eyebrows.  I call it &amp;#34;taupe.&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product five stars if it were more permanent; however, considering the longevity of eyebrow pencil, this pen last every bit as long, perhaps longer.  The idea is to keep the fingers off of the brows!&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, I have not used in summer, I have not noticed any color change after applying, nor can I comment on how long the product lasts as I just received it.  Whatever, YMMV.)</li>
    <li> Very vey light  Bought a cheap  pencil at the store  works much better  but I don&#x27;t have any eyebrows  It might work better on hair</li>
    <li> This is awful. I tried making pencil thin feather strokes to mimic the 1/2 an eyebrow I lost to skin cancer but this sucked. It makes lines similar to a sharpie regardless of how light a hand you apply it with. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Love this marker-type brow pen. It is a little reddish-brown (vs. taupe) but I have natural auburn highlights in my hair so works great for me!</li>
    <li> Basically too light to do any good for me.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply as the other brand I bought .... liked the color didn&#x27;t like the way it applied ...</li>
    <li> This product probably would have worked fine but after I used it one time it became to dry to use.</li>
    <li> really easy to apply if you need a little or a lot really looks more natural than pencil</li>
    <li> I love this concept.  The pen makes the nicest brow fill in, they look so natural.  However, I don&#x27;t know if this particular pen was just faulty but there seems to be very little product in the pen.  I have to wait between eyes and shake the pen to have the tip fill up with product again and often have to do each brow twice.  If the tip filled a little better I would give this a 5.</li>
    <li> My sister purchased this eyebrow pen in 01-Natural Taupe. She wanted a lighter brown without any reddish tones. She said it&#x27;s perfect for her. For me the NYX Medium 01 shade is perfect because it has a tiny amount of redness to it which is perfect for me. It&#x27;s almost identical to the Milani pen, same sharp tip that&#x27;s easy to apply. They&#x27;re both excellent products especially for the price. I thought this might be helpful for someone.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the pen to work after the first use.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but the color looks a little too reddish on me. I was hoping for a medium brown (as the dark brown is too dark), and I like this enough to use it anyway...no clumping or waxy residue like a lot of brow pencils. But especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun for a while, it has too much of a reddish tint...maybe it&#x27;s just me?</li>
    <li> It  came and was Black and I wanted TAUPE!  No phone number!!</li>
    <li> I really like this brow tint pen.  My eyebrows are really getting thin, and this fills them out and they look very natural.</li>
    <li> I have to draw on (not fill in) my eyebrows and it&#x27;s become quite frustrating lately.  I&#x27;ve tried MANY eyebrow pencils and pens of which most get thrown out due poor coverage or incorrect color.  This product saves me so much time, goes on smoothly, and stays on--even overnight.  The color lightens up as it dries, so my days of trying to find the right color are over.  I do use a Sephora pencil to soften up the lines a bit but, for the most part, this is the product I&#x27;ll use from now on.  It&#x27;s so nice to find products that make life easier.</li>
    <li> its not as good as expected. I guess this is meant to be used without any moisturizer and foundation because the tip picks up the product under it and starts to not work. However, the color comes back to the tip after awhile.</li>
    <li> Good transaction. Have used this in the past. Like it.</li>
    <li> Could of been a little lighter in color.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of the savings from using Anastasia. Both are taupe brow pens with detailed points. The Milani is perhaps slightly more rigid, but both allow precise, more natural looking strokes. Some have commented about color. Application pressure can be adjusted to lighten the shade. However, being more grey, this is warmer than my hair color; however, there is no brow pen with that coloration availalbe to my knowledge. Regarding having received a dry pen, that has happened with Anastasia also. I dampened that pen and it began to work...not sure if that will always happen. With the savings, Milani will be the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand.</li>
    <li> It is the right shade and works as described</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product, but ended up completely disappointed!  I have very sparse brows and am tired of unnatural looking, drawn on brows.  This pen from Milani seemed to fit the bill, until I looked in the mirror at the end of the day and was horrified to see GREEN brows!!  The pen went on so easily and it was a breeze to apply a very natural looking brow . Usually I have to apply my entire face so that my brow makeup doesn&#x27;t look like brow makeup - but with this pen my brows looked natural even with nothing else on.  However, fading to a green tint ruined it and in the garbage the pen went...</li>
    <li> Started to love this brow pen, but seemed to dry out too fast-out of the pen that is. I have another color, darker brown, and it is just fine, hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
    <li> This is described as a brow \\&quot;tint pen\\&quot;. It is not. It&#x27;s basically a brow crayon pencil. I bought it specifically because I thought I was getting a fine line marker or pen-type product that would stay put all day. This is a waxy pencil that will rub off. A nice aspect is the brush on the other end. it does do a nice job of blending the crayon, so that it looks more natural. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again. I would keep a clean mascara brush on hand and get a bargain brand eyebrow pencil. Still looking for that fine-line pen.&lt;br /&gt;**********************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;Since my original review, I have discovered that, when I ordered, the product title and description for the pen (what I wanted and thought I would get) had been mismatched with a pic and \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot; link for Milani&#x27;s Eyebrow Pencil! http://www.amazon.com/Milani-Easy-Automatic-Pencil-Brown/dp/B00392FQ00/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361929490&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;milani+brow+pencil This is why my review automatically showed up in the \\&quot;Pen\\&quot; reviews! As an eyebrow PENCIL, I must give it an extra star... it stays put quite a while, and the brush does a great job. I would&#x27;ve have preferred to get the product I was told I was ordering. I see that they have corrected their mistake, so I&#x27;ll order the pen again, and hopefully THAT&#x27;S what I&#x27;ll get this time ;-)</li>
    <li> The pen seems to dry up quickly.  Not sure if this was old product that I received.  Have used this pencil for awhile when I purchased at local drug store.  These pens seem to be empty much faster.  Love how it goes on.  The color is not a true blonde, has a bit of red cast to it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this is stores anymore, thank god amazon had it, I wouldn&#x27;t have eyebrows without it!  It&#x27;s like a felt tip pen, way better than a pencil.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST brow product I have ever purchased.  I used it for the first time and thought it was awful. It was very dry and didn&#x27;t do much for my brows. I tried it again on the second day and it was BONE DRY!!!  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I found this brow pen at Target about a year ago and bought it on a whim. I was surprised how much I liked it--it filled in any gaps (including ones I didn&#x27;t know I had), looked very natural, and didn&#x27;t fade until I washed off my makeup. You can imagine my disappointment when I couldn&#x27;t find another in any store ANYWHERE!!! I tried replacing it with a Clinique brow pen, and, while it worked as well, the color was too dark.  You see, as some reviewers have noted, the Milani brow pen is closer to copper than a taupe. This may not work well for true brunettes, but, for a redhead like myself, it is the PERFECT color match. Where most brow pencils and pens look too dark, the Milani pen is just copper enough to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was SO excited to find this pen on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;The pen I originally bought in store has lasted me a year and is still going strong, but I only wear makeup a couple of days a week if that. I haven&#x27;t open my new pen yet, but hopefully it works just as well!</li>
    <li> The color is light and it goes on easily.  I draw feather lines so its a natural look.  This is the next best thing to getting tattooed eyebrows .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair complected with light eyes and hair, and usually find a taupe shade to look most natural. Unfortunately, this brow pen is a much warmer, deeper hue than the light grayish brown I was expecting.</li>
    <li> The worst. no product in this item.  threw it away</li>
    <li> nice.some time tho the ink is hard to flow.</li>
    <li> Amazon, I hate your star system...2 stars out of 5 means 2 stars out of 5.... not &#x27;I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;...... irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milani, I expect to get what I order and &#x27;taupe&#x27; is &#x27;brownish gray&#x27;.....i mean, look at the paint chips in the stores!  This pen/pencil is medium brown with absolutely NO gray in it.</li>
    <li> The color of this pen in Natural Taupe is somewhat translucent, and red.  Also, the flow is inconsistent.  I still use it on occasion but prefer others.</li>
    <li> I like the product when it&#x27;s on, but the pen itself doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I&#x27;m on my second one after only a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I love this pen, and I hope they never discontinue it.  I had surgery for skin cancer on my forehead&lt;br /&gt;and use the pen to fill in areas of my eyebrow which had been affected.&lt;br /&gt;The pen works so well and produces a more natural effect..  I will be placing other orders in the future.  Thanks,  Jacqui</li>
    <li> lasting and easy to use</li>
    <li> After buying this at the drugstore, I&#x27;m hooked. I found it here at Amazon and ordered 2 more for fear that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it again. This is so much better than any pencil or powder. It tints your skin so it looks completely natural, even close up, and even filling in big areas. AND it stays on all day. I&#x27;ve even forgotten to take it off and slept in it, and it was still there in the morning and looked normal. It doesn&#x27;t rub off or flake off or get greasy or any of the things a pencil will do. Plus the tip always stays fine since it&#x27;s a marker, so you can be really precise and light with it, which helps to make it look natural because it doesn&#x27;t go all over the place and look too heavy.</li>
    <li> I am a very HAPPY CUSTOMER!!! this product is amazing.. I have very oily skin and right where my T-zone is. Plus I sweat easily.. and I use to use the eyebrow pencil liner and it would always smudge or start to come off within a few hours, especially if I started sweating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for this Milani Brow Tint Pen, I am so amazed on how it doesn&#x27;t smudge or start to wear off.. I would start in the morning and it would last me all day, even if I sweat or my face gets oily. And when that happens, I just pat my face with a tissue and it does not come off easily. It&#x27;s almost like its tattooed type of ink. And the beauty thing of it is that if comes off when you wash your face using a face towel and your facial wash. Cuz even if you just wiped it off with a tissue it would still have a lot on your eyebrow. I love this product.. Thank God for who ever invented it. LOL!</li>
