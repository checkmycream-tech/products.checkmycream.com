      <li>The concealer itself is very nice ,the correct color and is</li>
      <li>However, this one is really effective!  </li>

      <li>very is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not been happy with most concealers, and I have a cosmetic bag full of half-used containers to prove it.</li>
      <li>and if they all are of this quality, I may begin thinking of using more of the product line.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of her better products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t settle in my lines like most concealers.</li>
      <li>Love Mally&#x27;s makeup for it&#x27;s staying power.</li>
      <li>They should have put more work on the product itself not the packaging...</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I see more flaws and discolored skin</li>
      <li>Love this concealer.  </li>
      <li>Saw it on QVC, but got a better price here.</li>
      <li>I love Mally products and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>Just wish there was more setting powder in Mally&#x27;s kits or that it could be purchased separately.</li>
      <li>Great for concealer.....and live the powder...</li>
      <li>Great for hiding darkness of inner-corners and under-eyes using a light tough with Mally&#x27;s great brush!</li>
      <li>also found it works best if I apply the concealer directly to my under eye area with my ring finger, as opposed to brushing it on first.  </li>
      <li>perfect to use over dark circles</li>
      <li>less is best.  </li>
      <li>Color is not a match...it is too light.  </li>
      <li>It last all day and looks great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I had read about.</li>
      <li>Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used; the setting powder really makes the concealer last.  </li>
      <li>So excited that Amazon carries the line.  </li>
      <li>It covers great without looking dry and unatural.  </li>
      <li>Works great for under eye circles (I&#x27;m olive skin, dark haired</li>
      <li>My new favorite concealer.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but not as much coverage as I&#x27;d like for blemishes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would totally recommend this concealer, perfect coverage last all day long.</li>
      <li>I picked this up at QVC last year and love it -- it really does the job in \\&quot;covering\\&quot; up my undereye \\&quot;thinning\\&quot; skin.   </li>
      <li>The light is too light and the tan is too dark for me.</li>
      <li>I really hate that when it&#x27;s such a wonderful product and all your customers love it - and then they go and discontinue it!</li>
      <li>Just remember not to use too much powder.  </li>
      <li>Concealer can be really obvious if too light.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Mally.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover</li>
      <li>If you really want to try a Mally Beauty product, I recommend her mascara.  </li>
      <li>Still love the staying power under my eye (the powder really does make it &amp;#34;bulletproof&amp;#34;) and gives me enough coverage to last the day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a make up artist and have yet to find a better product to conceal dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I usually do not use concealers, but as I am getting older</li>
      <li>I ordered my new kits from Amazon because there is no shipping charge.   </li>
      <li>It took me a little while to get the hang of it - but it was worth the effort.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with it helping me to look little less tired when I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep.</li>
      <li>It did not &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; on but actually was pretty stiff and the brushes that came with</li>

<li> I like this product - but you cannot put it on too thick or it does makes creases.  </li>
<li> To make matters worse, it has no staying power.  </li>
<li> After I became addicted to Mally&#x27;s eyeliner I decided to try her concealer system.  </li>
<li> Way to thick!!  </li>
<li> Waste of money:-( can&#x27;t even return it because I tried it already.  </li>
<li> Tried it and it looks awful, too obvious.</li>
<li> The brush arrived bent and beyond repair, this was a disappointment.</li>
<li> Really disappointed in this.  </li>

    <li> Love Mally products!  So excited that Amazon carries the line.  Top of the line products will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Color is not a match...it is too light.  Tried it and it looks awful, too obvious. They should have put more work on the product itself not the packaging...Waste of money:-( can&#x27;t even return it because I tried it already.  I should have bought it from QVC!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great set. I usually do not use concealers, but as I am getting older I see more flaws and discolored skin so this is great and it has staying power. This product is also great as it does not need a lot to cover. I use the brush, smug with my fingers and then add the powder to set it. It last all day and looks great. The color matches my skin perfect too. I use a medium. Love Mally&#x27;s makeup for it&#x27;s staying power. It is the only reason why I use it.</li>
    <li> In the demo Mally shows her putting the product on her hand then trying to rub it off. This is bull. If fades and comes off even with the powder in minutes. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been happy with most concealers, and I have a cosmetic bag full of half-used containers to prove it. However, this one is really effective!  It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover, it&#x27;s blendable, and the setting powder makes it last all day. I would advise (1) to avoid the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; shade unless you are VERY pale. Concealer can be really obvious if too light.  (2)to apply this OVER your foundation; that way it takes less product to cover.</li>
    <li> This is not worth trying.  It&#x27;s takes a lot to blend, but it still looks like reverse raccoon eyes.  To make matters worse, it has no staying power.  Save your money.  If you really want to try a Mally Beauty product, I recommend her mascara.  It&#x27;s one of her better products. Her eyeliners are descent too.</li>
    <li> This concealer is portable and packaged nicely.  It does conceal some of your dark circles but don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with it helping me to look little less tired when I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at QVC last year and love it -- it really does the job in \\&quot;covering\\&quot; up my undereye \\&quot;thinning\\&quot; skin.   I ordered my new kits from Amazon because there is no shipping charge.   Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Best concealer!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, baby doll! Use this all the time - great product - helps keep me looking fresh and awake!  Great for hiding darkness of inner-corners and under-eyes using a light tough with Mally&#x27;s great brush!</li>
    <li> I love Mally products and this one is no exception. This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used and hopefully they won&#x27;t discontinue it like they always do! I really hate that when it&#x27;s such a wonderful product and all your customers love it - and then they go and discontinue it!</li>
    <li> The best under eye concealer ever. Have been using product for a couple years now and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Mally&#x27;s products are all wonderful.  I like to try whatever she is selling.  Saw it on QVC, but got a better price here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Mally product before and if they all are of this quality, I may begin thinking of using more of the product line.  I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> Great for concealer.....and live the powder...doesn&#x27;t cake up AROUND your eyes</li>
    <li> The brush arrived bent and beyond repair, this was a disappointment. The concealer itself is very nice ,the correct color and is very is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My new favorite concealer. I won&#x27;t  be buying any other brand from now on. Stays on all day and I have recieved numerous compliments on how well it works when my friends watch me put on my make up. I have even had several ask what brand it is so they could get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is not about the product itself, but the color choices. I think there needs to be a color in between light/med and tan. The light is too light and the tan is too dark for me.</li>
    <li> Love,love,LOVE this concealer.  I&#x27;m a make up artist and have yet to find a better product to conceal dark circles.  Word to the wise...less is best.  Just wish there was more setting powder in Mally&#x27;s kits or that it could be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> Would totally recommend this concealer, perfect coverage last all day long. And would definitely buy again... Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> great concealer and I used alot of Mally products....last all day and&lt;br /&gt;it perfect to use over dark circles...love it&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
    <li> After I became addicted to Mally&#x27;s eyeliner I decided to try her concealer system.  Works great for under eye circles (I&#x27;m olive skin, dark haired so I&#x27;m constantly battling looking tired all the time), not as much for concealing blemishes or other flaws.  Not bad, but not as much coverage as I&#x27;d like for blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it works best if I apply the concealer directly to my under eye area with my ring finger, as opposed to brushing it on first.  But that&#x27;s personal preference.  Still love the staying power under my eye (the powder really does make it &amp;#34;bulletproof&amp;#34;) and gives me enough coverage to last the day.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed in this.  It did not &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; on but actually was pretty stiff and the brushes that came with it didn&#x27;t move it at all.  Waste of money.  Won&#x27;t take a chance online with makeup again.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer.  It covers great without looking dry and unatural.  The setting powder keeps it lasing for hours.  Just remember not to use too much powder.  A little goes a long way.  The only concealer I will now use.  Thanks Mally.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It covers my bags under my eyes well and conceals all day long.</li>
    <li> I like this product - but you cannot put it on too thick or it does makes creases.  I watched the video of Mally applying it and tried it.  Way to thick!!  It took me a little while to get the hang of it - but it was worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used; the setting powder really makes the concealer last.  Doesn&#x27;t settle in my lines like most concealers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I had read about. Not to happy with it and may return it.</li>
