<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have only been able to purchase this product from my hairdresser in the past.  I am so glad I was able to purchase it this way.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have problems with smells and allergies. This product is the best I have found to date. It also holds well but does not way down your hair. Anyone who purchases this product would be happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife looks more beautiful after using it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all time hair spray!   The shipment was super fast! Seemed like it arrived the next day after I ordered it...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 18 months now and love it!  It&#x27;s a good hold without any smell or sticky / stiff feeling.  Not the cheapest stuff but when compared to other professional products and even some of the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; stuff at the stores, the price is not so bad.</li>
    <li> I never used this before, but I did use other Aquage products and just loved them.  Now I love this too.  Gives a nice hair spray hold, but without that clumpy look that you get from other products.  Also gives you a nice sheen to your hair.  Very hard to find, so thank you AMAZON!</li>
    <li> The best hairspray for fine hair!</li>
    <li> I used to be a Sebastian faithful until I   Found this product. This hairspray goes   On light but firmly holds your hair in place  Without weighing your hair down.</li>
    <li> This finishing spray (hair spray) is what we all like here in our household. We used to be able to get it at our hairdresser only. Then they stopped carrying it. Thank goodness for Amazon where you can find usually anything you are looking for.  This spray is light but has great holding power. Not heavy or sticky like some major brands. As long as I can find it on you web site I will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses and recommended.  Holds hair without stiffness.  Best hairspray I have found</li>
    <li> The smell of it bothers me, but others may like it.</li>
    <li> best hairspray i&#x27;ve ever used.  holds great with no residue or stickiness.  it&#x27;s the only hairspray i&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
    <li> Hairspray that does not make your hair sticky, even when it gets wet!  It brushes right out, does not build up, and right after you spray, you can use your fingers to style your hair for a few seconds.  My hair is always shiny when I use this spray, too.</li>
    <li> Very Pleased will definitely buy from them again</li>
    <li> AQUAGE IS THE BEST!!!!! I have the foam and the hairspray, love them both, I have been using them for almost 1 year. I will never use another product!</li>
    <li> Love this spray for my pixie cut</li>
    <li> When my hair dresser asked why I preferred this spray I had to think....and realized...it does not dry out my fine hair like most other sprays.  If I run out of this and use anything else it takes about a month for my hair to get dry....took me awhile to figure out it was the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey here so I asked my hair dresser if she&#x27;d order 3 or 4 of them for me and give me a break on the price.  She was more then willing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the reviews....it would appear Amazon is showing the same reviews for the &#x27;finishing spray&#x27; too.  They are not the same, this one holds better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I have a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; spray cap on this product or it is meant to come out so much less than other Hair Sprays. The holding power is good but I&#x27;d rather have a misty wide spray over this thin &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; type.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite hairspray.  It&#x27;s an aerosol, so it sprays on in a very fine, even mist.  It holds my hair all day without being stiff and stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it only 4 stars because it is advertised as an \\&quot;ultra-firm\\&quot; hairspray.  No.  Even if you sprayed layer upon layer, it may be stiff at first, but it will soon soften up.  This is fine for my purposes, but if you need a spray so that your hair doesn&#x27;t move, you will be disappointed.  (If you really do need extra-firm hold, try Aveda&#x27;s Firmata.  Hoo-boy, that&#x27;s about as laquered as they come.)</li>
    <li> This is a staple for me. Gives my fine hair lift and body and leaves zero residue. Love it and always have an additional can waiting in case I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair too stiff.</li>
    <li> I adore this hairspray and have been using it for many years.  I love the smell of this product, not perfumy, but rich and clean.  Leaves no gluey residue and does not leave your hair stiff as a board. If Aquage continues to make this great product, I will continue to buy it!!!</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find.  I love this hairspray.  Light hold and fragrant.</li>
    <li> Love it!:-)&lt;br /&gt;Great product&#x27;s best hairspray I have ever used. Great hold power but not sticky and doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair. It even has a nice scent not overpowering. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair spray I have ever used.  It holds well, but it doesn&#x27;t gum up your hair.  Your hair still has a nice, natural feel to it. I was first introduced to this hairspray by my hair stylist, but I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy it from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> I bought this previously from my salon and love it! It holds great without being so stiff. The product came quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife when she saw the price she likes this product a lot and thought the price was good .</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s light so you don&#x27;t have that sticky feeling in your hair.  Your hair will still have nice movement.  Very hard to find in the stores.  Thankfully, I can still purchase on Amazon</li>
    <li> Excellent hair spray. I have always used this and ran out.  Bought some cheap stuff and that did not work.  Found this on Amazon.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is the only hair spray that holds without weighting it down.</li>
    <li> great hold, not too stiff, scent is fresh but not too strong.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have no reason to change</li>
    <li> I like firm hold -  why bother to use hairspray if you aren&#x27;t seeking to set a style. But there are other hairsprays that give firm hold without sticky frozen hair. Even a very light squirt leaves my hair sticky. Impossible not to wash my hair after sleeping on it. I&#x27;m going back to my other soft touch firm hairspray.</li>
    <li> Who knows if this spray is good or not? Not me.The nozzle sprays all over my face, the mirror, etc.  It was packaged in a box that was too big and it must have rolled around or gotten tossed around quite a bit.  The plastic top was cracked and in two pieces so I assume the nozzle was damaged in transit.  I should have returned it for my money back or an exchange, but it was too much trouble. Have no idea if this is a good product. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never spent so much for hairspray before.  I like this brand and bought because of the great reviews.  It holds nicely, but isn&#x27;t too stiff.  There isn&#x27;t any residue that shows up on my hair like I&#x27;ve found in other brands.</li>
    <li> Twice now the nozzle stops working &amp; the bottle is full. I have not gotten a response from supplier.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 10.6 cans of Pravada Super Shape hair spray and received 3 cans of Aquage hair spray.  I want my credit card reimbursed</li>
    <li> For an Ultra-firm hold spray, I say this lacks greatly in this area. It barely holds long enough to get outside.</li>
    <li> Aquage is my favorite hair care line but it is expensive even on amazon! worth the money if your budget allows it. This spray holds but you can run your fingers through if you want to! This smells great too!</li>
    <li> Before I even think of buying something from a store I usually start looking for it on Amazon. However, for things like this I probably would have just gone out and bought it...but I wasn&#x27;t able to because it&#x27;s only available at speciality stores for hairdressers as far as I could tell. My hairdresser actually introduced me to this hair/finishing spray and although it&#x27;s a bit pricey, I love it because it smells great and it&#x27;s not sticky like hair spray can be. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff either and it does the job that you need it to do! If you need a good hairspray- this is it!</li>
    <li> Just exactlywhat my wife wanted.  Came on time, couldn&#x27;t be better</li>
    <li> I love Aquage Finishing Spray. I have used it for years. It holds well even through humidity, but without the stiffness. Even my husband uses it now.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair spray I have ever used and I was so glad I was able to get it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I love this product. It holds my hair in place and has a fabulous smell!</li>
    <li> I have to order more as I keep some ahead just in case.  No sticky mess, just holds your hair in place.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Weightless and no smell.  Holds even after combing.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it does seem to make my hair seem more flat on the second day.  So I have to use it again on the roots.</li>
    <li> This product does not measure up to what I have been using. I will finish using what I have but will not be buying anymore!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful finishing spray.  It is workable if you do not wash your hair everyday.  After using many, many sprays I found that this one does not dry my hair out.  I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of spray.</li>
    <li> I love this finishing spray! It is the best on the market. It is a bit pricey and I use it sparingly. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of hairsprays usually but this aerosol really dispenses a very light mist that holds my hair in place!  Recommended to me by a fan who is a stylist, it&#x27;s perfect to hold everything in place after I have used a curling iron on my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
    <li> the best hairspray hands down. I will never buy another brand or formula. It has holding power but isnt stiff or sticky and it smells really good. Its pricey but I dont use hairspray everyday , only once a month or so if I curl my hair so this will last forever! A great buy</li>
    <li> I really like the hold this hairspray has on my fine hair.  My only complaint is that the nozzle continually keeps getting clogged. I thought perhaps I just got a bad can, but other reviewers also have mentioned the nozzle clogging.</li>
    <li> I like this hair spray because no matter how much you spray on your hair it does not get sticky. Other sprays leave your hair sticky which I do not like.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray. Still pretty soft but holds. Lasts quite a long time. Even in Hawaii where it is humid, works well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my hair from frizz ing without my hair being overly stiff and non-moving. Have been using this product for over 10 years. Noticed several reviews mentioning clogged spray. Yes, this has happened to me, but I&#x27;ve found that if I run the nozzle under a quick stream of water after each use of the product I don&#x27;t have that difficulty. Love this product too much to give it up.</li>
    <li> Nice hold, hair is still soft, and does not coat everything in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> Will use nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;you can style your hair, theres not a heavy plastered down feeling.  Your hair looks great and feels good to.&lt;br /&gt;Your style will stay in place all day.</li>
    <li> Best hairspray light and holds very well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  I like that it does not leave the hair stiff and there is no scent, yet it holds my style while looking natural and with nice movement.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of hairsprays in the last 20 years and this is the best one I have ever used! It holds my hair (which is thick) even in the Texas heat, humidity and wind. It leaves my hair clean and brushable even at the end of the day. I love how fine the mist sprays so it doesn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;hair helmet&amp;#34;, (something we&#x27;ve all experienced!) all this and it is virtually scent free too.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price.  Works great and very flexible product.  Would recommend this to everyone.  Thank you -- love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hairspray for awhile. It offers great hold, it&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s odorless. All features I look for. I can recommend this product. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> I like the soft feel I get rather than the feel of hair clued together from other sprays. Unfortunately, the Aquage brand isn&#x27;t easy to find in hair salons.</li>
    <li> Never disappointed with this spray!  Works well, even in humidity, on my frizzy hair.  Highly recommended.  Wipe off nozzle after use and maintain upright position when storing.</li>
    <li> I love the product. You can style your hair and if you do not like it just brush it out.</li>
    <li> Hairspray is great, but nozzle tends to get clogged.  I just use a pin or paper clip to clean it out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray on the market.  Tried them all.  Does not leave your hair stickey. My hair loves it.</li>
    <li> love this hairspray,  I have fine straight hair, and it is not too heavy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for several years. It does a great job of holding my hair in place without being stiff or sticky. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find in my part of the country, so I&#x27;m really glad that it&#x27;s sold here.  I&#x27;m not crazy that the cap is shipped with packing tape holding it in place, but no big deal. Otherwise, the can always arrives in great shape.</li>
    <li> REALLY NOW ! WHAT CAN YOU SAY ON A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY ....WORKS FINE!!!</li>
    <li> This spray does not build up, brushes out and holds great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS HAIRSPRAY!  YES IT IS EXPENSIVE (APPROX. $20. A BOTTLE) BUT WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TRIED A LESS EXPENSIVE BRAND, THAT HAD GOOD RATINGS, BUT THE HAIR SPRAY DID NOT LAST THE DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEAUTY OF &amp;#34;AQUAGE&amp;#34; IS THAT THE HAIRSPRAY STAYS THE WHOLE DAY AND THEN BRUSHES OUT WITHOUT&lt;br /&gt;A TRACE.</li>
    <li> My wife Linda loves this product. Gives body and a firm hold to thin hair. Price was a bit higher, however, then at her hair salon. Not the best on-line buy.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray, but I am not sure it is good at controlling the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever used. Love it! I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but use a straightening iron on it every day. The hair spray from the day before doesn&#x27;t interfere with the straightening.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product line!  It works beautifully and smells DIVINE!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray - and I&#x27;ve tried many!  It&#x27;s very good for fine, thin hair that needs a little more oomph and hold.  It works well in any climate, but especially in high humidity areas.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this finishing spray holds styling naturally and softly.  I also enjoy that the spray does not have an odor that conflicts with perfume I may be wearing. I have tried other finishing sprays and always come back to Aquage .</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  I have on occasion tried going back to something a little less expensive but I always come back to this product.  The hold is great....not too firm....yet a good hold.  One of the main reasons I like this product is that there is no white build up like I have had with other store bought products over time.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to frizz up. This helps keep it smooth! I got the big can since it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product - your hair is flexible and moveable without losing the style - very workable the next morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing it given great review on a beauty guru&#x27;s video.  It did not disappoint.  One of the comments was that it doesn&#x27;t turn on you, and it&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of root lifting products, only to find that to use enough for it to work, it made my hair oily and heavy, kind of negating what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing.  This is lighter than regular mousse and I&#x27;ve not had any issues with product build up or heaviness at all.  After shampooing, I squeeze dry my hair in a towel, let it air dry for a little then apply Aquage just before using my hair dryer.  I&#x27;m always very happy with the results I receive using this product.  I&#x27;m thinking there are a number of other people who have watched the same guru, since most times I buy it it always says there&#x27;s only a few left in stock!</li>
    <li> Aquage always lives up to my expectations for touchable hair that doesn&#x27;t like to feel sticky.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best finishing spray on the market. It doesn&#x27;t damage hair, holds the style beautifully, isn&#x27;t overly scented and is easily brushed out of hair.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and got me hooked on the freezing spray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is light and has almost no fragrance at all. It holds very well and combs out at the end of the day easily.</li>
    <li> Love this flexible spray!! Leaves my hair soft, just the way I like it!!</li>
    <li> Yes, Yes, Yes great product, but does cost more then most, but worth it! I struggle with products that have smells, it is scent free. I also found this product to not be sticky when applying to my hair. My style last the day with no reapplying, I have very heavy, thick hair. No need to over  spray, a little goes a long way. Look at other products this company has, a large variety of types of hair spray.</li>
    <li> She likes it. I pay for it. What a sweet deal. I wished they sold scotch because I like it,</li>
    <li> This product is especially good for my hair and having it available from Amazon is definitely a convenience.  Love it.</li>
    <li> There are better sprays out there for the price. Hold is good but too much shine for my taste. Also has a plastic-y, sticky hold to it. Didn&#x27;t care for that. I will stick the Neuma line for spray products.</li>
    <li> This is the worst.  It doesn&#x27;t fit or hold the piece to your ear do not waste you money!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Aquage hair products for a long time and have trouble finding the hair spray in the small town where I live.  So now O order it online.  Works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.. Haven&#x27;t really found any hairspray that works on my hair</li>
    <li> Likes the product a lot, but had to throw away after using only half because nozzle stopped working. From the second use, I had trouble with the nozzle. Product is too expensive to waste like that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money. It stays almost all day long and does NOT have a strong &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; like scent. (at least, to me.)&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend. I have thin hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how well this hairspray will hold your hair if it&#x27;s thick, but if you have fine hair like me it will be the right hairspray for you. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all!!! This is the best.</li>
