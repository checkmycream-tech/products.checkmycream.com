      <li>This was perfect for our 90 year old grandpa who is blind.</li>

      <li>I have since gone through at least 4 more of the watches.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t hear a regular watch alarm because of high frequency roll-off, but this talking watch is a recording of a human voice, which I can hear clearly.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is, it does not have a light.</li>
      <li>The sameness is very important as I gave it to my father, who is legally blind.  </li>
      <li>wear it occasionally and find it works well, certainly a LOT easier to set/adjust than the more expensive one that needed replacerment after only a few months!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

<li> wear it occasionally and find it works well, certainly a LOT easier to set/adjust than the more expensive one that needed replacerment after only a few months!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
<li> and even though their prices are usually lower than others I&#x27;m willing to pay a few extra $$ if necessary to give me trust and confidence that I will receive</li>
<li> but they only last for a few months and one or two stems that control different functions quit working</li>
<li> I use the alarm feature all the time (up to 4 alarms per day) to remind me to do something, and also the stopwatch to know how long my food has been on the BQ.   </li>
<li> I was disappointed to find this a much cheaper version of my original watch.</li>
<li> Our local jeweler suggested we mail it back to the seller for repair, but it seemed like an excessive investment of time/money for a $15.00 watch.    </li>
<li> They all fail within weeks, you&#x27;re lucky if they continue working for 2-3 months.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve owned a watch very similar to this one before so ordered this one to replace the  other when it gave out after a few years.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ordered other products from this company before only to be disappointed by the cheap  craftsmanship of the product.</li>
<li> my other watch - high pitched Casio 5 alarm was no use to me - could not hear the alarm from 6 inches away although it annoyed a lot of people in restaurants etc.</li>
<li> I guess it&#x27;s one or the other.</li>
<li> Other than that I like it.  </li>
<li> The only downside is that the back is very hard to remove/replace for battery replacement.</li>
<li> my blind mother in law really likes this watch</li>
<li> Being blind, I am very dependent on watches like this during my day-to-day living.</li>
<li> Still looking for one that will last at least two months I guess.</li>
<li> It stopped announcing the time when pressed after less than 3 weeks of use.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had 5 of these watches in less than a year and 4 of them are not working correctly.</li>
<li> Being 86 and legally blind, I can not use a normal watch.  </li>
<li> at least I&#x27;ve never seen the area the band is connect to the watch be so narrow.</li>
<li> But the wrist band came off and was difficult to put back on.</li>
<li> Helps elderly folks stay less confused about the time of day.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;voice\\&quot; of the watch is hard to understand and the buttons on the watch are hard on the fingers to push.</li>
<li> They were late with delivery and have no return policy.</li>
<li> I have purchased at least 5 of these VoiceZone watches.</li>
<li> I am tempted to buy one of the more expensive versions, but, would be really disappointed if a 90.00 alarm watch failed.  </li>
<li> a noisy outdoor setting I find it difficult to hear reliably but indoors no problem hearing it although it has an odd &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Finally, the biggest disappointment ... the watch stopped working within two weeks!</li>
<li> Poor quality watch and poor quality control from manufacturer.</li>
<li> The band came broken and still falls off when I try to wear it.</li>
<li> When the 1st watch failed, I ordered batteries from ebay.</li>
<li> I am visually impaired and need this type but the quality on this one is horrible.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it looks like this band can&#x27;t be replaced on this watch...</li>
<li> Stopped working 34 days after I gave it to my blind neighbor.  </li>
<li> I bought this as a gift for my son who is blind.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m having a difficult time receiving a refund from the company.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simplicity at it&#x27;s finest!</li>
    <li> Watch died within weeks of purchase. Sent back for replacement. Replacement died within weeks of arrival. It&#x27;s a turkey. Spend money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The product was defective. I&#x27;m having a difficult time receiving a refund from the company.</li>
    <li> Being 86 and legally blind, I can not use a normal watch.  This talking watch is the perfect solution.  I can find the button easily and use it with no help from others.  This watch has a clear, distinct voice.  It was delivered quickly and I was very pleased with the packaging.</li>
    <li> Actually I bought this product for a friend who already had the same item and wanted to give it for a Christmas present. He is more that pleased with his.</li>
    <li> This watch provides good funtionality and is easy to set all the alarms.  The band and watch appearance is acceptable but nothing to brag about.  Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> A high-quality product delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son who is blind.  Radio Shack has discontinued carrying these, but they are reasonable quality at a very good price; I was glad to find them through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a similar watch. The 4-alarms are very helpful for me since I have tasks that need to be done at certain times. Hopefully this watch band won&#x27;t crack apart like the prior watch band. Unfortunately, it looks like this band can&#x27;t be replaced on this watch... at least I&#x27;ve never seen the area the band is connect to the watch be so narrow.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father who has alzheimers disease. When it goes off hourly it reminds him he is wearing a watch and it brightens his day!</li>
    <li> The voice is clear.    It appears to be very accurate.    The band broke on one side before I could even get it out of the box.  Our local jeweler suggested we mail it back to the seller for repair, but it seemed like an excessive investment of time/money for a $15.00 watch.    We use it as a clock in the extra bathroom.</li>
    <li> The watch went blank and Didn&#x27;t work after tried to set it.  company would not send a replacement, I had to pay for another watch and was told to ship it back afterards.  The second watch didn&#x27;t work either, I couldn&#x27;t reach the company afterwards and am left with two watches that I paid for and they don&#x27;t Work!!!!</li>
    <li> This was perfect for our 90 year old grandpa who is blind. GREAT CLEAR VOICE!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased at least 5 of these VoiceZone watches. I read an earlier review about the watch failing within a month or 2; so, I decided to buy a couple/5 of back up watches, on ebay at about 10.00 a watch. Also, thought I could give them away as gifts. When the 1st watch failed, I ordered batteries from ebay. I changed the battery. The watch works, but would not talk, so, that defeated the purpose of the talking alarms . I have since gone through at least 4 more of the watches. They all fail within weeks, you&#x27;re lucky if they continue working for 2-3 months.  The watches are cute, but, are cheap and a piece of junk. Save your money. I am tempted to buy one of the more expensive versions, but, would be really disappointed if a 90.00 alarm watch failed.  Just my opinion of my experience. Hope this helps!!</li>
    <li> Did not work , a blank screen.try to contact seller no answer.amazon made it good.</li>
    <li> I am giving it two stars  right now, because it came without any battery and I have to take the band off to replace the battery. Either that or the battery is dead, but I can&#x27;t tell without taking the whole thing apart. It is for my 95 year old father, to make things more convenient for him but I&#x27;m really irritated right now since we can&#x27;t take it right out of the box and use it</li>
    <li> My father who has parkinsons, alzheimers and macular degeneration loves this watch as it is easy to use for him.  The womans voice that was used is also easy for him to hear.  A new battery makes the watch like new again.  We bought 2 so he always has one that is working.</li>
    <li> my blind mother in law really likes this watch</li>
    <li> I received the watch within a couple of days of ordering. I&#x27;ve owned a watch very similar to this one before so ordered this one to replace the  other when it gave out after a few years. I was disappointed to find this a much cheaper version of my original watch. Being blind, I am very dependent on watches like this during my day-to-day living. The \\&quot;voice\\&quot; of the watch is hard to understand and the buttons on the watch are hard on the fingers to push. Finally, the biggest disappointment ... the watch stopped working within two weeks! I&#x27;ve ordered other products from this company before only to be disappointed by the cheap  craftsmanship of the product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Does exactly what I wanted.  My only complaint is, it does not have a light. When taking my medications I ofter need a light. The alarms are great. Keeps me on my meds schedules. Easy to read and set. Thanks</li>
    <li> After two weeks, I had to replace battery.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it works fine and sometimes it does not work and the screen fades out.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, its ok; but the battery should have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t hear a regular watch alarm because of high frequency roll-off, but this talking watch is a recording of a human voice, which I can hear clearly. I use the alarm feature all the time (up to 4 alarms per day) to remind me to do something, and also the stopwatch to know how long my food has been on the BQ.   Also use it to wake me up on trips instead of taking an alarm clock.</li>
    <li> Stopped working 34 days after I gave it to my blind neighbor.  Still looking for one that will last at least two months I guess.</li>
    <li> My watch arrived on time, It talks and you can hear it tell the time very well. But the wrist band came off and was difficult to put back on. Other than that I like it.  Once I got the wrist band back on I set it and it works just fine. I did not even know how to turn it on, as it had no  time on the watch when it arrived. I accidentally hit something and it turned itself on.</li>
    <li> Not very pretty or stylish.  No one is going to say, hey nice watch.  But the functionality was what I was after and it does provide it.</li>
    <li> The button broke off in the first day of Use.</li>
    <li> A necessary item for anyone who has memory or sight problems. It will tell you the time and date. Helps elderly folks stay less confused about the time of day.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and was really well received.  Worked really well, is comfortable to wear and easy to program (alarms etc)</li>
    <li> It has coming out use that I do. I use it alot at night.  When at night I can&#x27;t see the clock I depend on the watch.</li>
    <li> I bought a relative an analogue talking watch that had to be returned for replacement so &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it occasionally and find it works well, certainly a LOT easier to set/adjust than the more expensive one that needed replacerment after only a few months!&lt;br /&gt;In a noisy outdoor setting I find it difficult to hear reliably but indoors no problem hearing it although it has an odd &amp;#34;accent&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is unusual is the &amp;#34;date&amp;#34; function, I prefer a talking watch state the day of the week but this one states the number.... &amp;#34;today is the 22nd&amp;#34; I have another talking digital watch that states the day of week instead  &amp; I prefer it to this method but this one is sleeker/better looking so I guess it&#x27;s one or the other.</li>
    <li> This watch lasted several months and no longer works.  I bought a similar talking watch from Radio Shack over two years ago, and the watch works well.  All it needed was one battery replacement after almost two years.</li>
    <li> I gave this watch to my husband for Christmas. It stopped announcing the time when pressed after less than 3 weeks of use. There was no aper in the packaging box for any kind of warranty.lila is the seller so I would give them a 1 star. They were late with delivery and have no return policy. Thank goodness the watches time display is so big you can read it without glasses.</li>
    <li> I like the features on these watches but they only last for a few months and one or two stems that control different functions quit working and the whole watch goes dead.  I am visually impaired and need this type but the quality on this one is horrible. I&#x27;ve had 5 of these watches in less than a year and 4 of them are not working correctly.</li>
    <li> Excellent watch, easy to use</li>
    <li> Very easy to set time, and set other  times and alarms.  Price is right and received it on schedule.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Radio Shack talking watch because Radio Shack no longer sells them.  To my delight, it has all the same functions and all the same buttons in all the same places.  The sameness is very important as I gave it to my father, who is legally blind.  The only downside is that the back is very hard to remove/replace for battery replacement.</li>
    <li> The band came broken and still falls off when I try to wear it. Poor quality watch and poor quality control from manufacturer. I will never buy another watch from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use. This is the 2nd one I have purchased, the 1st quit working after 9 months. I bought the 2nd because my Dad couldn&#x27;t function without it. Loud voice, large clock display. If this one breaks again in 9 months, I will be buying another</li>
    <li> My new OVO  Man&#x27;s talking watch came quickly in the mail. So far so good - it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and have 3 of the 4 programmable alarms set daily to remind me of medications. I try to leave it on my wrist but if it&#x27;s in the bathroom I can still hear the audible voice in the living room. I have severe high frequency hearing loss and my other watch - high pitched Casio 5 alarm was no use to me - could not hear the alarm from 6 inches away although it annoyed a lot of people in restaurants etc. My only concern was reading a review or two where it stated this watch &#x27;died&#x27; after a year - at $20 a pop I&#x27;ll plan to get one each year and if it last longer it&#x27;ll be a bonus. As always Amazon does a great job of shipping etc. and even though their prices are usually lower than others I&#x27;m willing to pay a few extra $$ if necessary to give me trust and confidence that I will receive a product.&lt;br /&gt;Ken Griffiths, San Diego CA</li>
