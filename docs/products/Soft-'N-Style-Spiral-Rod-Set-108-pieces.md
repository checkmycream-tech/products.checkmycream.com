      <li>These perm rods were really easy to use.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s important to have the correct colors of clips to ensure you had the correct size AND correct spiral direction so that they would fit the rods properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A clue that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase is that I keep it, when I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll send it back.</li>
      <li>Probably will never use because they don&#x27;t seem that user friendly.</li>
      <li>she love it and the curls held very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh,  and this too, after about an hour of having 3 of these in my hair, I looked in the mirror, and sure enough, they were unraveling from the top part closest to the root.</li>

      <li>This spiral rod came as soon as i ordered it which i am very impress but the bag is very cheap because the zipper broke from me unzipping it the first time i unzipped it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product even though the rods are not at all soft.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>At first confusing on how to wrap the hair but end result very satisfying!</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>first time wa in the 80&#x27;s when my mom gave me a spiral perm.</li>
      <li>perhaps you can imagine how much weight was on my head by the time we were done.  </li>
      <li>My daughter did manage to curl my hair with the rods fairly easily though, it did not take a long time to do it either.</li>
      <li>They do not have instructions, but by looking at them, and finding 1 video on Youtube of more or less the same product, but in a soft-rubber (which must be much better than this hard plastic)</li>
      <li>Make sure you wrap tight to garrentee the curl and try to wrap close to head for a longer lasting curl.</li>
      <li>for natural hair spiral sets</li>
      <li>I was thinking that the rods were made of a soft or atleast a plyable material.</li>
      <li>they were ordered for my daughter she used them in her hair, she has natural curly hair  from her self</li>
      <li>I have natural hair.</li>
      <li>that would only fit one color of the large rods and one color of the small rods and none for the medium rods.</li>
      <li>There is a small piece of plastic that hangs down at one end of the rod- kind of like the clip on the end of a pen that you use to keep your pen on your shirt pocket.</li>
      <li>We both love them with exception that hard to fix into short hair &amp; ended up using fuzzy pipe cleaners/ Fab price tho&#x27; for just busted open bag holder.</li>
      <li>Not only does the items curl my hair very well, the curls actually last for an entire week.</li>
      <li>keep right on browsing past this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made. No where in the description tells you that these are hard plastic. They do not come with instructions AT ALL!!! I bought these to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair when she went to bed. There are these points at the end of them that would put an eye out.</li>
    <li> I only recommend these for stylists who know how to use them because either something is wrong with me or these are not very user-friendly.</li>
    <li> This product is too complicated to use.  It took me well over an over to finish setting my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product. However it would have been great if an instruction guide book came along with it.</li>
    <li> This is a neat product. It comes in a nice plastic container. It is helpful for curls. Your hair should be of average or long length to truly benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> No instructions included. Unable to get the spirals to lock/anchor to hair</li>
    <li> These perm rods were really easy to use. My daughters had a great time using them.</li>
    <li> I want to love these curlers, but the clips don&#x27;t work.  Can anyone advise me how to secure them in my hair?</li>
    <li> This may be one of the worst purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.These are ridiculously difficult to use.They do not have instructions, but by looking at them, and finding 1 video on Youtube of more or less the same product, but in a soft-rubber (which must be much better than this hard plastic) I can figure out what to do. There is a small piece of plastic that hangs down at one end of the rod- kind of like the clip on the end of a pen that you use to keep your pen on your shirt pocket. You somehow get some-a small amount- of hair close to the root, and try to slide it under this clip so as to \\&quot;secure\\&quot; it (not really) and then start to wrap your hair around the spiral. Then there are these very cheap clips that actually snap(kind of) over your hair. Frustrating.  Also, the clip is too close to the beginning groove of the spiral on the rod, making it even harder to get your hair in place. I have long, thick hair, and I can see that it would take me forever to get these in, because you have to use such small sections. I ended up buying the Curl Forms from the Sally website, along with some Flexirods. If you get them on Amazon, they go via Sally and charge s&amp;h, but on Sally&#x27;s site, if you spend $50. ,you get free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave you with this thought: You could go ahead and buy these, like I did, figuring, \\&quot;Well, they can&#x27;t be that bad, some people like them, maybe I can get them to work for me as extra pieces for some other type of set (Curl rods/Flex).  Don&#x27;t bother.  Save some time, cut out the middle man and just take a 20 dollar bill from your wallet and set it on fire. Then go get a mule to kick you in the **s and call it a day. Same end result--wasted time,wasted  money and a feeling of total annoyance and frustration. It&#x27;s too late for me, but you still have a choice....keep right on browsing past this product. At least, that was my experience, anyway.Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;Update**  1 hour later...&lt;br /&gt;Oh,  and this too, after about an hour of having 3 of these in my hair, I looked in the mirror, and sure enough, they were unraveling from the top part closest to the root.

The Flexrods are pretty good, but the Curlformers are just so simple to use and the results are great.

    <li> I used this to curl my niece hair she love it and the curls held very well. I took some getting use to but once i got the flow i was making good time.</li>
    <li> Not a product of my liking.  I ain&#x27;t happy! The product did not meet my expectations.  A clue that I&#x27;m happy with my purchase is that I keep it, when I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll send it back. Now that I know that you require a specific number of words to write a review these five will be my last time completing a review... this is crazy!</li>
    <li> I will YouTube for instructions 😀</li>
    <li> they were ordered for my daughter she used them in her hair, she has natural curly hair  from her self however WHY she wanted this is Way beyond me i&#x27;m just her Father.</li>
    <li> These rods are a little hard to use, however once you get the hang of using them, they create really pretty curls.</li>
    <li> The minute this product arrived I opened the package and the zipper on the bag immediately broke on me. I couldn&#x27;t understand how to even use the curlers. I thought maybe they would come with some sort of directions, but they didn&#x27;t. They just sat in my closet for about 2 months before I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to use them and just threw them out. Waste of my money. Maybe they could be more useful to someone with more experience with this kind of product, but I just couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used spiral rods like these in the past....first time wa in the 80&#x27;s when my mom gave me a spiral perm. These worked great on my daughter&#x27;s which s to her mid back. If you have never used spiral rods, you may need to google how to because these did not come with instructions.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time trying to install these. Some of the hooks were broken off when I got the package. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Got for doll hair use for great niece as she&#x27;s too young to use curling iron. We both love them with exception that hard to fix into short hair &amp; ended up using fuzzy pipe cleaners/ Fab price tho&#x27; for just busted open bag holder.</li>
    <li> This spiral rod came as soon as i ordered it which i am very impress but the bag is very cheap because the zipper broke from me unzipping it the first time i unzipped it but beside that it is great!!!!</li>
    <li> The title of the rods indicated that they were &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; but they are hard as a rock.  I can&#x27;t use these and have no idea how to return to amazon.</li>
    <li> work great!&lt;br /&gt;use for natural hair spiral sets</li>
    <li> I have natural hair. Not only does the items curl my hair very well, the curls actually last for an entire week. I am very pleased with this product. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> No instructions included. Probably will never use because they don&#x27;t seem that user friendly.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for people who have long hair, want a perm(since these seem to be perm rods not actual curlers). Plus the directions didn&#x27;t come with it and I have no idea how to contact the manufacturer to get the directions(like I was told to do).</li>
    <li> These are not curlers, people.  I did a search for \\&quot;perm rods\\&quot; and these showed up.  They&#x27;re for setting your hair for a spiral permanent wave.  I repeat, they are not curlers.  Don&#x27;t buy them for that purpose.</li>
    <li> They gave me the wrong clip to close off one of the rods.  Even still the product works like it should</li>
    <li> I was excited about these when I ordered them, but then was disappointed and had to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were six colors (2 small sets of rods with opposite spirals; 2 medium sets of rods with opposite spirals; and 2 large sets of rods with opposite spirals) and there was supposed to be color coordinating plastic clips for clipping the ends of the hair in place.  It&#x27;s important to have the correct colors of clips to ensure you had the correct size AND correct spiral direction so that they would fit the rods properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sent an assortment of clips.... that would only fit one color of the large rods and one color of the small rods and none for the medium rods.</li>
    <li> I was thinking that the rods were made of a soft or atleast a plyable material. They are not. They do not bend or flex at all. If this is what you are thinking you have misunderstood the product as a did. My daughter did manage to curl my hair with the rods fairly easily though, it did not take a long time to do it either. I plan to get a perm with these rods as soon as I can get time to do so. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied with the product even though the rods are not at all soft.</li>
    <li> they worked perfectly!! love my curls!!</li>
    <li> I bought two packs of these because I have a massive amount of hair.  It was nice to have plenty of rods for once and a nice carrying case for them. My husband helped me to do the perm which in and of itself was a trial.  It took him about an hour to figure out how these things worked and to develop a technique for rolling up the hair.  This time drain could have been avoided with a few instructions from the company.  Also, they did not include enough clips and the things were hard to use and did a bad job of securing the rollers anyway.  All in all it took about 9 hours to roll up my hair.. and virtually all of the rollers in those two packs--consider that these things are made of hard plastic and perhaps you can imagine how much weight was on my head by the time we were done.  I had a serious neck ache the next day.  I would give these things a horrible review except the curls actually were spiral curls and looked beautiful (except for the ends which had to be trimmed). It has been about 8 months so now I am going back to do another perm but I won&#x27;t use these rods again. Guess I am going to sell them on Ebay--but I feel sort of guilty about doing it! Haha!</li>
    <li> Very good product. At first confusing on how to wrap the hair but end result very satisfying! Make sure you wrap tight to garrentee the curl and try to wrap close to head for a longer lasting curl.</li>
