      <li>I use one razor a week, but now that I&#x27;ve taken to drying the razor after shaving, I may be able go two weeks before changing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It wasn&#x27;t beginner&#x27;s luck: after weeks of use, still no nicks, shaving bumps or razor burn.  </li>
      <li>Much better than I anticipated.</li>
      <li>and i was so glad that i updated to this one.  </li>
      <li>OK since then.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with the one Merkur blade that came with the razor and decided if I was going to have to order blades</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It now looks even better than how it did originally and now, it has a non-slip grip!</li>
      <li>It has a very comfortable handle, which is easy to hold.</li>
      <li>As far as quality, this is a beautiful, well crafted razor that has allowed me to achieve that BBS shave, even for a novice like myself.</li>
      <li>I really like the shave I get from this razor its very comfortable in the hand and has good weight to it</li>
      <li>The weight of the razor is awesome, but I really wish the head were stainless and not just the handle.</li>
      <li>A wise choice, after using the 43C, I am certain that my cartridge days are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives me both a smoother and more comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was 90% as close of a shave as a mach 3, and one million times more comfortable, and one million times cheaper to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read all the reviews about how much more comfortable this style of shaving is over the multi blade disposables.</li>
      <li>Hefty but easy to handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this type razor before and the weight makes it easy to use.</li>
      <li>It has strong heat-retention.</li>
      <li>My first shaving experience was with my mother&#x27;s safety razor (which may have belonged to my dad) and it worked amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice looking and the most heaviest razor made from a high quality material.</li>
      <li>He loves this razor and is very happy with it,.. he talks about it whenever the subject of shaving comes up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean, and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Although I liked the wood better this one cut just like my old razor.    </li>
      <li>It cuts so smoothly that it had me thinking</li>
      <li>So I started using my wifes cheap razor to finish the job.  </li>
      <li>Great handle for big hands..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and well balanced.</li>
      <li>my rugged face was a smooth as a baby&#x27;s hiney.</li>
      <li>I also made my own stand out of 3/16 inch stainless steel rod ( you could use bonze etc )  </li>
      <li>He barely applies pressure and its gives a remarkable shave.</li>
      <li>and it is worth the price for sure.</li>
      <li>Fantastic in every respect.</li>
      <li>I have not used it because I don&#x27;t feel I could get a positive grip to safely shave.</li>
      <li>This does that job very well and very consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Iam a big guy [6&#x27;2\\&quot;, 300#, with good sized hands] and it is comfortable in the hand with a nice \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it.</li>
      <li>and I have yet to nick, scratch or full on cut either my head or face since I got this things.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t ask much more from a razor.</li>
      <li>But upon rinsing the razor, the sink was full of removed hair.  </li>
      <li>Overall build quality is good chrome is good on outside surface areas but the inner are not so good (Edwin Jaggar has me spoiled) but it has it where it counts</li>
      <li>That said, the quality of this razor is second to none and way,way better than most DE razors on the market today.  </li>
      <li>The handle can get a bit slippery too, but a quick rinse takes care of that no problem.</li>
      <li>High quality razor that I get a better shave from than those multi-blade disposables.</li>
      <li>This is a great razor and is less aggressive than the Futur.</li>
      <li>Razor is advertised as a long handle, the handle is at best standard length.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months with great results.  </li>
      <li>Great heavy razor.....</li>
      <li>The shave is SOOOO much better than with the &#x27;modern improvement&#x27; of disposable cartridges, not to mention SOOOO much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I topped off each corner of my mouth during shaving with my old Mach 3, until I&#x27;m more comfy shaving</li>
      <li>Quality worth my money.</li>
      <li>Makes you more conscious of not applying a lot of pressure.</li>
      <li>Well worth purchasing.</li>
      <li>My first DE safety razor, and not a bad start.  </li>
      <li>Took awhile to get the technique down (and find a good blade,) but it is making shaving as exciting as when I was 14 and didn&#x27;t realize it was something I would have to do every day for the rest of my life at the expense of morning sleep.  </li>
      <li>Preliminary  hot-warm water skin preparation and high quality blades are important too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a REAL man Razor. It&#x27;s long and heavy, and does the job it was made for. It&#x27;s clean and classic look is sometime I really like about it.</li>
    <li> Great quality razor that gives a close, smooth shave.  I&#x27;ll never buy another disposable razor for myself.</li>
    <li> Razor is advertised as a long handle, the handle is at best standard length. Very disappointed as I need a long handle. Razor feels unbalanced due to the handle. I have not used it because I don&#x27;t feel I could get a positive grip to safely shave. In addition, the seller does not accept returns, I am stuck with this razor, unless I can find someone to buy it.</li>
    <li> This is one VERY HEAVY razor!! That said, the quality of this razor is second to none and way,way better than most DE razors on the market today.  The long handle (3 3/4\\&quot;) is just right to balance the weight for fine touch control of the blade. If it&#x27;s a long handle razor you need this razor deserves a long look towards buying one.    After shaving with this razor I find it to be very forgiving of beginner mistakes while I re-learn wet shaving after 40+ years of electric shaving !!</li>
    <li> the best double edage razor on the market this is a must have for every man and women.....save tons on shaving blades</li>
    <li> Heavier than my other DE razor. Excellent balance. Gives a great shave. Well worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet - the Merkur 43c was my first DE razor. I&#x27;ve purchased others since (including the Merkur Futur) but I still reach for the 43c on a regular basis. It&#x27;s a very non-aggressive shaving razor - an excellent model to use while building your skill and developing your technique. The weight of the razor is awesome, but I really wish the head were stainless and not just the handle. Buy this razor, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> One of the best shaves ever. Solid construction. Great handle for big hands..</li>
    <li> After years of shaving with a multi-blade, and eventually finding it difficult to find cartridges for my Gillette Sensor, I decided to go \\&quot;old-school\\&quot; and shave like my grandfather... so, I took it one step further and went straight-blade.  I did pretty well and only cut myself a few times, though they bled pretty good. I went with a Parker SR1 with disposable blades since I didn&#x27;t want to face the hassle of honing and stropping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, my sweet bride decided she would also like to change over to the single blade, so I bought her an Edwin Jagger DE 89lbl Safety Razor. She raved about it from the beginning and still loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year, I got tired of the time commitment to shaving with a straight razor, so I broke down and tried my wife&#x27;s DE Safety. It did great!  Much better than I anticipated. Close shave, not a nick. I immediately began my search for my own, and after a few days research, decided on this quality instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with the purchase. It is exactly what I was hoping for. It is heavy. It feels good in the hand. It is consistent - cuts well on both sides, with no surface abnormalities.  I have used it with a variety of blade brands (great deals to be found on Amazon.com for variety packs!)  I saw no concerns with the manufacturing (checked all joints with it dismantled, etc.). It is a well-made quality shaving instrument. The only minor dislike I have is that it is not 100% stainless... but I knew that going in to the purchase. I have gotten the closest shaves ever using this instrument. And, a few days ago, I went ahead and shaved a 2nd time \\&quot;up\\&quot; after the first time \\&quot;down\\&quot;... my rugged face was a smooth as a baby&#x27;s hiney. This is a quality piece of manly equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few further bits if information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  The razor does not cut... the blade does. The razor&#x27;s job is to hold the blade and hold it well. This does that job very well and very consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Iam a big guy [6&#x27;2\\&quot;, 300#, with good sized hands] and it is comfortable in the hand with a nice \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it. You know you are holding something of substance when you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  It has strong heat-retention. When you rinse the head under hot water, that heat WILL transfer to your face, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  If you are expecting to have an out-of-body experience or the heavens to part and angels to sing when you shave, you are probably overestimating the importance of the shave experience. It is a shave. Period. But it is nostalgic nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this razor!  If they end up making an all-stainless version, I will probably eventually buy it, but I don&#x27;t see this one wearing out in my lifetime or my kids&#x27; lifetimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift for graduation.  I love it.  I got really bad razor burn with a standard cartridge razor, razor burn is all but gone with this.  The razor is well-made, featuring a hefty, reassuring weight in the hand.  The plating on the razor is well-done, and the stainless part of the handle is finely brushed, making for a handsome razor.  This razor performs as well as it looks, too.  The curved head above where the blade sits gives you a perfect angle to achieve a good shave.  If you purchase this razor, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the old razors with a sterile sharp blade every tine without the old dirty disposable one hanging around,</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. Very close shave. Extremely high quality. This is going to be the last razor my husband will buy and will never use any other!!!</li>
    <li> High quality razor that I get a better shave from than those multi-blade disposables. My only complaint is that is really heavy and when shaving cream is on my hands it&#x27;s slippery.</li>
    <li> Great razor. No razor burn at all! I should have bought this a long time ago. I do not even want to think about how much money I wasted on those multi blade disposables over the years! This is built like a tank!</li>
    <li> This is the first DE razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (still is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months with great results.  I really like the weight of it.  It certainly feels sturdy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean, and easy to use.  I really can&#x27;t ask much more from a razor.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this safety razor to work for me. Yes, I am a woman who purchased this for herself. My first shaving experience was with my mother&#x27;s safety razor (which may have belonged to my dad) and it worked amazing. However, this one did not work, perhaps maybe it was the long handle and should have been short? I had to go over my legs several times to get the hair off and it still left a few areas with hair. Maybe it was my angle? Should I have held it at a 45 degree angle instead of 35? I am not sure. I have done a lot  of research on safety razors from maintenance, to weight to how to hold a safety razor. It really should not be complicated, especially when I have used one in the past at the age of 17 and now I&#x27;m 40!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I did like the look and the feel of this razor, it looked well made, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I will try another.</li>
    <li> This is a stainless razor which makes it heavy and never pulls or tugs while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor now for about 6 months and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it with feather blades as well as a Parker brush which have all worked flawlessly together.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore like weight of razor and length of handle nice quality stainless should last a long time more environmentally friendly than throwing plastic ones away every week</li>
    <li> This razor is a masterpiece.  It solves the problem of head-heavyness by inserting a 3&amp;#34; spacer within the handle. The bottom knob tightens the head together and the bottom plate is attached to the handle. Disappears while shaving! It&#x27;s so smooth and well balanced. This is my fav of all time. Wispy smooth shave with pol/silver blade and use Feather to up the deal and get a little closer.</li>
    <li> About 5 years ago I purchased a Merkur 43c mahagony razor.  It was awesome!  I loved it.  It was 90% as close of a shave as a mach 3, and one million times more comfortable, and one million times cheaper to use.  I was hooked.  Then one day I lost!!!!    So I ordered the chapter Merkur long handled razor.  It was crap.  No weight and was always missing hairs on my face.  I would say 1 out of ten hairs would just fold down and go under the blade.  So I started using my wifes cheap razor to finish the job.  Finally she got after me and I went looking for my old razor.  I then found a stainless 43c.  Although I liked the wood better this one cut just like my old razor.    clif notes...    crap: http://amzn.com/B000NL0T1G  good: http://amzn.com/B004C6DTZ6</li>
    <li> I really like this razor.  Some time ago I decided to get away from spending about $5.00/ week on cartridge razor blades and go back to a safety razor.  Living in a small town there was no selection.  You could buy the blades all day long but not the razor.  I went online and started shopping.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot for a &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; razor and settled on a $20.00 Parker.  It was a nice razor and gave me an OK shave.  After using it for some time, a friend told me about his Merkur.  I looked at the razor and could see the quality in it.  My wife talked me into spending the money on myself and I ordered this Merkur.  I absolutely love it.  I don&#x27;t even mind shaving anymore.  It gives me both a smoother and more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, the exact second I got my new Merkur razor double edge razor blades became hard to find in this town.  I fell in love with the one Merkur blade that came with the razor and decided if I was going to have to order blades I was going to get what I want.  You can get cheaper blades but at $0.50/ blade why order something else.  Just be careful to have pleanty of blades so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> My first DE safety razor, and not a bad start.  Took awhile to get the technique down (and find a good blade,) but it is making shaving as exciting as when I was 14 and didn&#x27;t realize it was something I would have to do every day for the rest of my life at the expense of morning sleep.  The shave is SOOOO much better than with the &#x27;modern improvement&#x27; of disposable cartridges, not to mention SOOOO much cheaper.  My only negative is the finish has a flaw/chip in it which I would expect to morph into flaking metal finish (some others have complained about) in a year or two, but otherwise I fully endorse getting this razor.  It is super heavy (I prefer heavier, some don&#x27;t) and the longer handle makes some shaving passes a bit more difficult so my next razor will be the traditional 3 inch handle, but this is not a huge deal to adjust to.  The handle can get a bit slippery too, but a quick rinse takes care of that no problem.</li>
    <li> Feels hefty in your hand and shaves very well. I&#x27;ve used this type razor before and the weight makes it easy to use. There is nothing &amp;#34;dainty&amp;#34; about this razor,,,,,</li>
    <li> I decided to try shaving with a razor like my dad used. I&#x27;ve read all the reviews about how much more comfortable this style of shaving is over the multi blade disposables. I ordered this razor and a variety pack of blades. I also ordered the Proraso Eucalyptus and Menthol shaving soap. I used the Feather brand blade first due to its good reviews. I have a heavy stubble face and the weight of this razor handle seems to really help it power through the beard stubble. I have to say that after four shaves, I am thoroughly impressed. I haven&#x27;t nicked myself yet, the shave is very close, and I have no razor burn like I did with the disposables. I highly recommend this if you are thinking about trying to ditch the disposable razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day because of the great ratings and reviews.  While I agree that it is a very high quality razor I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think that the handle should have some kind of edging on it to make it less slippery, but I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Precision tool that is very well made.  Been using it for almost two months and no sign of wear or rust.  Perfect for large hands and has a great weight to it, easy to just let glide against your skin.  If you haven&#x27;t figured out this about DE razors yet, if you can let the weight of the razor do the work, that pretty much equals less cuts and scrapes.  I highly recommend it, worth the money over the $30 razors.</li>
    <li> This safety razor feels great... the weight is awesome, it feels great in your hands.  I have spent the last couple of years using a cheaper Merkur razor and i was so glad that i updated to this one.  The weight helps you when shaving as you pull down and up your face.  I really love the feel of this piece and it is worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> I really like the shave I get from this razor its very comfortable in the hand and has good weight to it so I don&#x27;t have to press when I shave. Overall build quality is good chrome is good on outside surface areas but the inner are not so good (Edwin Jaggar has me spoiled) but it has it where it counts so I&#x27;m happy. The razor for a closed comb is I would say on the aggressive side but I got no razor burns at all on a two pass with and against the grain. As for the one blade you get I think it was a let down considering it comes from the blade capitol of the world. One side was very sharp and the other was not so sharp(pulled). I usually use Personna and Feather blades. Finally I think its safer than my other razors except for my old Gillette because it has a longer bolt on the head that you unscrew from the bottom of the handle not the handle itself so changing out the blades is safer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift. He is 75 years old and shaves regularly. He kept finding that he couldn&#x27;t get a close enough shave, even with the high quality disposable razors. He said he had to use his fingers to push down on the blade! He loves this razor and is very happy with it,.. he talks about it whenever the subject of shaving comes up.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy feel  razor gives a close shave</li>
    <li> Handle a little too heavy for optimum balance and in it&#x27;s first two months of use, the tightening know at the end of the handle came off and was NOT easy to reattach.  OK since then.  Cosmetically, the finish on the underside of the head is pretty rough and for more $$, nowhere near the finish quality of my Jagger 89 BL.</li>
    <li> Fantastic in every respect. Excellent weight distribution and a pleasure to shave with. The comb spacing is perfect and allows for a very close shave. Definitely a superior instrument.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy. Good for beginners. Makes you more conscious of not applying a lot of pressure.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for several weeks now.  It is solidly made,  It is heavy, I like that.  I am not sure I would consider the handle \\&quot;long\\&quot;.    On DE shaving:  I am baffled that people cut themselves.  I am not even all that careful and I have yet to nick, scratch or full on cut either my head or face since I got this things.  I use canned shaving cream (a gel).  While some folks may find whipping up old school shaving cream therapeutic, life changing, zen-like, I find it boring and a waste of time and it didn&#x27;t affect my shave at all.  However, I do use a bowl and brush to get an even coat of shaving cream on my face and head (i.e. 3 seconds to whip the gel to cream).  Youtube and other websites seem to say you have to shave 2 or 3 times.  I shave the same amount of times I did with my Mach 3, i.e. correct the missed spots.  One key thing I have followed as per recommendations - let the razor do the work, no need to press hard.    I would wish folks \\&quot;luck\\&quot; with returning to DE shaving, but that seems silly in light of my experience since it just works fine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as I hated the results I was getting with disposables. I kept getting razor burn and ingrown hairs. Now my dreaded necessary daily torture routine has turned into a man pampering spa treatment! What a simple luxury shaving can be with the right equipment. I only wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> I love this razor! It feels great in the hand. Quality worth my money.</li>
    <li> This is the first and likely last D\E razor I&#x27;ll have to buy.  Since I intend to use this for years to come, I opted to buy once and went with a higher end product.  A wise choice, after using the 43C, I am certain that my cartridge days are over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a reassuring heft.  The heaviness allows me to let the razor&#x27;s weight and the blade work in tandem for a very smooth shave - I simply guide it along my face without pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my research I came across the term &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; being used to describe razors.  Thankfully the 43C does not fall into this category.  I&#x27;ve been able to get a close shave without sacrificing my skin during the process.  It cuts so smoothly that it had me thinking I was holding the razor at the wrong angle.  But upon rinsing the razor, the sink was full of removed hair.  In fact, it cuts so gently that when I apply my post-shave witch hazel there is minimal burn, nor have I experienced any post-shave facial irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I withheld a star because the handle can be slippery if your hands are damp - this can be scary for a rookie.  While a towel drying one&#x27;s hands does address this, I feel that a bit of texture is warranted for grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy to have abandoned the cartridge cartel, and this has proven to be a fine tool with which to do so.  I use one razor a week, but now that I&#x27;ve taken to drying the razor after shaving, I may be able go two weeks before changing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It wasn&#x27;t beginner&#x27;s luck: after weeks of use, still no nicks, shaving bumps or razor burn.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #2: Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been two years... this is still the razor that gets used when I want to go for an all out shave.  It looks and works like new - truly a quality piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and the most heaviest razor made from a high quality material. It has a very comfortable handle, which is easy to hold. Also is not as aggressive as some other razors are and brings less skin irritation.  Still needs to hold it with a care because of the weight of the razor for preventing to cut your self. Wet shaving is an art and should not be done fast and not only in one direction. An almond sized portion of shaving paste \\&quot;Cremo Cream\\&quot; place into shaving bowl and mix with a small amount of hot water(4-5 drops) , then with shaving brush create a nice dense foam in it . Place that foam by using a brush on a shaving surface.  Preliminary  hot-warm water skin preparation and high quality blades are important too. In comparison to other creams and soaps \\&quot;Cremo Cream\\&quot; by using that way is easy to rinse from the razor and blades and it does not leave a lot of white films (prints) on a razor surface as other soaps do. One small advise - between the blade and plateau sit attached to the handle put through the screw a very thin rubberized washer. It will prevent soapy water to run inside of empty handle.</li>
    <li> I should have returned to double edge (DE) shaving years ago. My electric razor - a good one, is shelved for trims or maybe travel, but my go-to is this razor. Takes only slightly longer than an electric, and shaves so much better around my neck and really everywhere, with no sign of ingrown whiskers. Electric and disposable manufacturers definitely don&#x27;t want you to know about these. And the Merkur build quality is outstanding. I really like the heavier weight and longer handle, though I&#x27;m sure I could live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Also really like the stainless satin finish. I didn&#x27;t want shiny chrome.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Hefty but easy to handle. The weight of it helps take down that stuble with ease. Feels really solid and well made. I use it with a Feather blade so I use very little added pressure because the blade will get you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Merkur Futur that I&#x27;ve been using for the past two years and I love it. I decided to get a second Merkur and I bought this one. This is a great razor and is less aggressive than the Futur. I highly recommend this razor especially if you are new to shaving with a double edge safety razor.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Other Merkur are better. ESP 34.</li>
    <li> I am new to wet shaving.  I am comparing this product to the Edwin Jagger and Parker.  Compared to the two, this one is noticeably much heavier.  I&#x27;m still deciding how I feel about it.  As far as quality, this is a beautiful, well crafted razor that has allowed me to achieve that BBS shave, even for a novice like myself.</li>
    <li> I was one of those who purchased the Gillette Mach 3 package and continued using it for years.  I thought it would be the best shaving tool I could ever get.  That has changed!  I was reluctant to purchase a DE razor, because there was a concern about lots of nicks. The weight of the Merkur 43C is heavier than that of a Gillette disposable razor.  Only a fraction of the pressure against the skin is needed when shaving with the Merkur 43C.  I topped off each corner of my mouth during shaving with my old Mach 3, until I&#x27;m more comfy shaving those spots with the Merkur 43C. My skin felt softer after using this DE razor.  One DE blade comes with this razor and I would recommended this product to anyone willing to transition to a DE razor.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> Hold nice in the hand.  With a new blade, the weight of the razor gives a excellent shave.</li>
    <li> Great heavy razor.....</li>
    <li> Excellent quality razor!  It is a bit heavy and I need time to get used to that.  No knicks or cuts and I am a newbie to this DE shaving!    I am very pleased with this razor.    The only real problem I have with this razor is the handle is a bit slippery and so I applied 4 thin coats of \\&quot;Dip-It\\&quot; grey spray over the middle portion of the handle to give it more grip. I of course masked off all the areas that I did not want to spray.    It now looks even better than how it did originally and now, it has a non-slip grip! If ever I want to remove it, it will peel off!      I also made my own stand out of 3/16 inch stainless steel rod ( you could use bonze etc )  Simply take a metal rod about 21-23\\&quot; inches long and then bend with your hands, pliers and vise grips.  Practice with a coat hanger first till you get what you want.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and very stable and just what I needed.    If you&#x27;d like to make your own and want to see what it looks like,  Send an email to:   ds5487 at yahoo dot com   and ask for a couple pictures and I will send them to you.  I tried loading them onto this site but it appears that Amazon did not approve of that?</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby as a birthday present and he absolutely loves it. He is a big guy (6&#x27;3) and he says that it feels substantial, weight wise, but he does wish the handle was longer. He barely applies pressure and its gives a remarkable shave.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shaver it looks great and is well balanced and fits perfect in my hand. If you looking for a good shaver this is the one.</li>
