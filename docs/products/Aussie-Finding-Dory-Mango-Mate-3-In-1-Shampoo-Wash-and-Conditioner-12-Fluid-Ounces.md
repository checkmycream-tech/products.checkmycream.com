    <li> I usually love Aussie products but I&#x27;m really disappointed in this one. Although it does smell good, I can&#x27;t say it really smells like mango. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel real clean after using this product. I won&#x27;t be making this mistake again.</li>
    <li> My daughter like the smell</li>
    <li> For us was not good. Its not tears free. My daugther has 3 y</li>
    <li> My son loves this 2-in-1 product and I have to admit that it is much easier for him to use on his own.  He&#x27;s 4 and pretty independent already, so at least I know that he&#x27;s applying to correct product in the correct places</li>
    <li> My kids really like the scent and it cleans really well!</li>
    <li> Very good Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I have always gotten the detangle spray in this brand so I wanted to try a shampoo/conditioner as well. This leaves my daughters hair smelling sooo good all day! good for her curly thick hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Mild, no stimulation, my kids really like the taste.</li>
    <li> Another fine Aussie hair care product.  My children like this shampoo.  We have bought Aussie products for years and have always been satisfied.</li>

    <li> I love the product, it is very good!</li>
    <li> I love Aussie&#x27;s 2 in 1&#x27;s for kids!  I got tired of my girls&#x27; hair looking less shiny and feeling less soft and lustrous than it should.  They are healthy and they eat healthy foods.  Their hair has never been colored or processed.  Why shouldn&#x27;t their hair be more beautiful, I thought?  We had always used the popular 3 in 1 brand, and when I saw Aussie&#x27;s 2 in 1 I decided to give it a try even though it cost a bit more.  Voila!  Shine, luster, and softness problem solved!  I think the fact that this 2 in 1 is made for the hair not the hair AND body (would you wash your hair with your body wash?) makes all the difference.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh their hair down or leave a residue behind.  I will never go back to buying the popular 3 in 1 brand.  I&#x27;m sticking with Aussie.  However I prefer the Surfin&#x27; Strawberry to the Mango Mate.  The strawberry has a much more noticeable smell, and that smell stays in their hair until I wash it again!  I love it!  It&#x27;s what little girls&#x27; hair should smell like!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter,She is very like it</li>
    <li> It is shampoo... um...</li>
    <li> The mango smell is very good my daughter likes this smell.</li>
    <li> Smells nice!  My kids say this works great and they love it.  Purple  is what it is purple ! thanks</li>
