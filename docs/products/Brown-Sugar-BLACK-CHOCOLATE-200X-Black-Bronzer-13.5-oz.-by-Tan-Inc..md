      <li>Got here quickly.</li>
      <li>Stellar product!</li>
      <li>i will keep this very simple and say I LOVE this lotion!</li>
      <li>but I put it 3rd cause to be honest</li>
      <li>I used every last drop of this tanning lotion because I loved it so much.</li>
      <li>and I actually have a really nice tan..</li>
      <li>DEF WORTH BUYING.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a lotion that would make me darker and this worked for the first couple of times I tanned.  </li>
      <li>Mostly when i only tan like 2-3 times a week.</li>
      <li>Maybe better for someone just starting out to tan.  </li>
      <li>This product left me with noticeable color which is great because recently I have been tanning in a high pressure bed</li>
      <li>This lotion created a nice, dark brown color, not the oompa-loompa orange that some lotions leave.</li>
      <li>Buy Moisturizer to keep a nice dark tan</li>
      <li>A nice dark brown.</li>
      <li>Brown Sugar Black Chocolate 200x Black Bronzer by Tan Inc. is awesome !</li>
      <li>and I was very allergic to the product after using 3x.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb very well either.</li>
      <li>Again as ive posted before im very picky about my tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>Very please with the service and product.</li>

    <li> Good tanning lotion. Cannot beat the price. It smells great and it gave me color quickly. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I used every last drop of this tanning lotion because I loved it so much. It gave me great instant color and the smell was nice. I will be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought and I was very allergic to the product after using 3x.</li>
    <li> One 2 best selling lotion in USA&lt;br /&gt;I second that&lt;br /&gt;Love it no smell</li>
    <li> Stellar product! I tried this product for the first time in a trial package from my tanning salon. This has been one of the best lotions I have ever used! The color of the lotion comes out dark which lead me to believe the lotion would provide good color. This product left me with noticeable color which is great because recently I have been tanning in a high pressure bed &amp; I am already pretty dark. This lotion created a nice, dark brown color, not the oompa-loompa orange that some lotions leave. This product leaves a light coconut, perfume scent that smells good even after tanning. No burnt skin smell. Now that I have another good lotion at an affordable price, I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> i will keep this very simple and say I LOVE this lotion! i am on my 3rd bottle! :D&lt;br /&gt;I tried many different tanning lotions, but this one is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;One advice to people who buy things based on reviews, well just BUY IT!  :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product  , good service, will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have used it about 9 times and I tan pretty easily and I do see a little difference but not as much as I was expecting. It smells and feels great though.  Other lotions brands like Snooki or luminary have given me a better tan and lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Super dark yummy bronze.. I love it. I will not use anything else ever! I&#x27;m obsessed with this.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Great lotion!</li>
    <li> Love the smell... and I&#x27;ve only used 3x so far but I can already see a difference. :).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get as much color as I expected. Doesn&#x27;t absorb very well either. It&#x27;s ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  Got dark real fast and amazing color</li>
    <li> Very please with the service and product. Will order again in the near future. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I loved this tanning lotion. I can use it one time and already see that i&#x27;m shades darker. This is the only tanning lotion that has worked on me this good. Mostly when i only tan like 2-3 times a week. it will turn you a brownish no orangish.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great bronzer. Smells great too! I should have bought more! This is now my go to lotion!</li>
    <li> Again as ive posted before im very picky about my tanning lotion. This is the best bronzer ive ever used. It goes on smooth and i love the smell i love the no burnt skin after odor i love my besutiful tan i get from using this product. No stain no streaks no funky discolorations. I alt this with lotion that is a accleration. Most important its easy shopping for me because i always know what lotion im going to buy.</li>
    <li> Wife has tried many different kinds for tanning bed use and likes this one the best.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is a knock off or the real brand name lotion but I love it.  I am already tan but was just looking for something to enhance my tan and this was it.  I noticed a lot of new color after just one tan and also got a few positive comments the next day.  The lotion itself is much darker than my usual tanning lotion and a little goes a long way.  Be sure to clean your hands well before you tan.</li>
    <li> Works great! Just what I needed. As soon as I used this lotion I noticed a difference. Very good price!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND SMELLS REALLY GOOD. MY BOYFRIEND AND I BOTH USE AND GIVES US BOTH GOOD COLOR. DEF WORTH BUYING. NO ORANGE HANDS WITH THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Nice scent. Bronzer is not overpowering. Don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion a great bargain for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me look brown instead or red... Buy Moisturizer to keep a nice dark tan</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed a darker tan an hour or so after tanning but seems to wash away after showering.</li>
    <li> Jwow works the best. A nice dark brown. Brown sugar has a horrible bronzer that turned my skin orange. I am naturally dark skinned so nothing turns me orange. Except for this product.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this tanning lotion!! I noticed big difference a few times after using it. I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell afterwards, but this stuff if AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Dont be fooled by &amp;#34; dark&amp;#34; they all say that.</li>
    <li> Great product, highly recommend this product for a deep dark tan!  Smells great works better.</li>
    <li> The lotion does give you some color but your not super dark after using it a couple times. I probably would say this would work for people with very pale skin other than that people who do tan .. don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on my skin, and really took dark to a new level.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells and works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this product before and loved it but this is turning my hands and tan orange and the first bottle didn&#x27;t do that from a different vendor. Knock off.</li>
    <li> Like this product, nice smell</li>
    <li> This is the most awesome tanning lotion!! I love it thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion... best around</li>
    <li> Brown Sugar Black Chocolate 200x Black Bronzer by Tan Inc. is awesome ! I use this lotion when I upgrade to the FGT Tanning Bed. I come out DARK !!! It has a wonderful scent and a little bit goes a long way. The price is excellent for the product !!!!</li>
    <li> Good color tans evenly worth the money.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used in the last 4 years actually it&#x27;s the worst</li>
    <li> Love it!  No streaking and very nice golden tan.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! I have a hard time tanning so when I seen it had 200x bronzer and I&#x27;ve heard this is a great brand, I had to buy it.  Super cheap compared to in any stores around here.  Made me dark very fast and it smells amazing.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> In a week of using black chocolate I saw a difference.. it works great you should try it you will be very happy</li>
    <li> worked great !  less then half the price of my tanning salon same lotion</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lotion that would make me darker and this worked for the first couple of times I tanned.  I was already pretty tanned but wanted to get really dark...this doesn&#x27;t do it.  Maybe if I were starting out, it would work, but not after I&#x27;m already tanned.  Still looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Had a nice smell, but did not work at all for me.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin either. I tan a lot and have color, wanted to get a darker color and this just did not do it.  I did not see any difference at all.  Maybe better for someone just starting out to tan.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever there&#x27;s a lot of things that I like about this lotion. 1st is the scent of the lotion is smells really good like a coconut smell. 2nd is the smooth texture that makes it easy to spread and apply. 3rd is the darkness it leaves you dark but I put it 3rd cause to be honest I always think I can go a bit darker. 4th the bottle presentation is nice and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Immediate results with this lotion!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best tanning lotion I have ever used!!! I&#x27;m light complected but tan fairly easyily. Just one use for 5 minutes had me hooked.. I don&#x27;t tan often, maybe a couple of 5 minute sessions a week and I actually have a really nice tan.. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
    <li> Loved it and let my friends use it and they loved as well.they&#x27;re wanting me to order them some as well</li>
    <li> great lotion!!!!! will be buying more!!!! great color and smells very good. and i am a guy!!!</li>
    <li> Got here quickly. Great tanning lotion. Very happy.</li>
    <li> awesome tan going here</li>
