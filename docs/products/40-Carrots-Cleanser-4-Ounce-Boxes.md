      <li>okay...</li>
      <li>30 years ago, it might have been a a favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love it &amp; will continue to use forever:)</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
      <li>and my face is probably already 90% better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the 40 Carrots line of Products</li>
      <li>Wish it was in stock more often.</li>
      <li>Just reordered two to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It has been more than three weeks since I have started using 40 Carrots line...</li>
      <li>so I dilute mine and it lasts longer and works as well or better than undiluted.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
      <li>This is my best vegan/paraben free facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use with the pump and cleans skin without drying it.  </li>
      <li>My skin is glowing, smooth and acne free.</li>
      <li>It is fabulous.</li>
      <li>The pump dispenser is handy and works very well.</li>
      <li>I first bought this item at a store,  then ran out, had to find more and</li>
      <li>This face wash leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>MY FAVORITE FACE CLEANSER: feels rich &amp; foams going on, however it&#x27;s the smell that really makes this special.  </li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea and have never found anything that has not broke me out until....</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be great for sensitive skin and sensitive body parts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use many high end products</li>
      <li>I thought this would be good for dry skin, and that it used more Natural products.</li>
      <li>I also feel like my skin is a lot more even after ongoing use, which is a definite plus.</li>
      <li>and then I apply my Sukin all natural moisturizer for sensitive skin (which is also fabulous stuff), and that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>This is a gentle cleanser</li>
      <li>This cleanser works really well for me.</li>
      <li>Cleans pores very well.  </li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to&#x27; do much for my over 60 skin.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost everything you can imagine, and it all either made my skin even nastier or did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I really like the Dr. Hauschka skin care line</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Retin A for blemishes and youthful looking skin, but find that I don&#x27;t need it nearly as much since I discovered 40 Carrots.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other creamy cleanser, it is not  greasy  and leaves your skin super clean AND moisturized.</li>
      <li>Okay, I did what a lot of other people have done and picked this up at Marshall&#x27;s for about $5.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but for this I had to!</li>
      <li>Now, during my TOTM (Yeah, I still have a period at 46), I occasionally get a breakout here and there, but 40 Carrots helps to quickly eliminate them.  </li>
      <li>If you decide to order the Night Cream, please avoid putting it under your eyes at bedtime; it made the thinner, more sensitive skin under my eyes sorta&#x27; dry for about a week, so I began using the Moisture Splurge under my eyes at bedtime and the Night Cream on the rest of my face - It works wonders!!!  </li>
      <li>I normally follow with the Moisture Splurge by 40 C.</li>
      <li>Not sure this is suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>My skin is r-a-d-I-a-n-t  and sooo clear!</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I only need a small amount, and my face feels super clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Most popular acne products were too harsh and only made my acne worse.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it broke me out in a rash, like hives.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product based upon a review suggesting it for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my husband for his sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I mean, it&#x27;s better than it has been in YEARS.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve long had very troublesome skin.</li>
      <li>No other product he&#x27;s ever used that made the claim &amp;#34;reduces redness&amp;#34; ever worked so kudos to &amp;#34;40 Carrots Cleanser&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I looked in the mirror tonight and barely recognized myself.</li>

<li> I have already got 2 of my friends addicted to it</li>
<li> I picked up this cleanser 3 years ago at Marshalls for 5 dollars and have been addicted ever since.</li>
<li> Wrong.</li>
<li> I got to the point where I had gone crazy exfoliating and using peels and masks and my skin was a DISASTER.</li>
<li> , bad thing is the store never carries allot of it.</li>
<li> and it was the worst</li>
<li> And I&#x27;m telling you, the results are SHOCKING.</li>

    <li> This is a gentle cleanser and I&#x27;ve found it to be great for sensitive skin and sensitive body parts. I find it is a bit too thick out of the bottle and the pump never gets all the product out so I dilute mine and it lasts longer and works as well or better than undiluted.</li>
    <li> This is my best vegan/paraben free facial cleanser. Cleanses well without overdrying. I love it &amp; will continue to use forever:)</li>
    <li> This stuff smells  wonderful and 30 years ago, it might have been a a favorite.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem to&#x27; do much for my over 60 skin.</li>
    <li> 40 carrots is great skin cleanser.  Cleans pores very well.  Can see the difference!</li>
    <li> I am a woman in my late 30&#x27;s who has struggled with acne since a preteen.  Most popular acne products were too harsh and only made my acne worse.  I really like the Dr. Hauschka skin care line but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.  40 Carrots is a comparable alternative.  I only use about a dime size of cleanser to remove my makeup and even less in the morning. My skin is glowing, smooth and acne free.</li>
    <li> I first bought this item at a store,  then ran out, had to find more and the best deal was on Amazon.  I will keep buying this it works good for me.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I absolutely LOVE the 40 Carrots line of Products and I recommend that women my age at least give it a try!  I&#x27;ve used Retin A for blemishes and youthful looking skin, but find that I don&#x27;t need it nearly as much since I discovered 40 Carrots.  Now, during my TOTM (Yeah, I still have a period at 46), I occasionally get a breakout here and there, but 40 Carrots helps to quickly eliminate them.  If you&#x27;re wondering (I know some people are), I&#x27;m an African-American woman who used to have an oily T Zone, but with 40 Carrots, I don&#x27;t even have that issue anymore!  One piece of advice... If you decide to order the Night Cream, please avoid putting it under your eyes at bedtime; it made the thinner, more sensitive skin under my eyes sorta&#x27; dry for about a week, so I began using the Moisture Splurge under my eyes at bedtime and the Night Cream on the rest of my face - It works wonders!!!  Let&#x27;s Toast It Up to Youthful Looking, Healthy Skin!!!    Cheers &amp; Happy New Year (2011)!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based upon a review suggesting it for sensitive skin.  NOT suggested.  Burned my skin, peeled for days.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I don&#x27;t use many high end products and I wanted to make the switch from soap for my face.  And this one has made a noticeable difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin. Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works really well for me. I only need a small amount, and my face feels super clean afterwards. I also feel like my skin is a lot more even after ongoing use, which is a definite plus. My only concern is that it burns the skin under my eyes - I just avoid using it there, but that does make me a little nervous.</li>
    <li> Unlike other creamy cleanser, it is not  greasy  and leaves your skin super clean AND moisturized. I normally follow with the Moisture Splurge by 40 C. It has been more than three weeks since I have started using 40 Carrots line...but oh my , the results were already visible in  week 1. My skin is r-a-d-I-a-n-t  and sooo clear!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Just reordered two to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It is easy to use with the pump and cleans skin without drying it.  I recommend it for all skins.</li>
    <li> Okay, I did what a lot of other people have done and picked this up at Marshall&#x27;s for about $5. I&#x27;ve long had very troublesome skin. It&#x27;s always either breaking out, getting all red and irritated, patchy coloring, little tiny bumps all over the place, big pores, you name it. I have tried almost everything you can imagine, and it all either made my skin even nastier or did absolutely nothing. I got to the point where I had gone crazy exfoliating and using peels and masks and my skin was a DISASTER. I was trying to FIX it and it was the worst it had EVER been when I came across this stuff and thought, okay... one last product before I give up and start saving for plastic surgery. And I&#x27;m telling you, the results are SHOCKING. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and my face is probably already 90% better. I mean, it&#x27;s better than it has been in YEARS. NO acne or bumps, NO red patches or areas of irritation, NO gigantic, orange-peel looking pores! I drove back to Marshall&#x27;s over the weekend and bought every package they had of this stuff, no joke. It is fabulous. I use it every time I wash my face, just this stuff with some warm water and my fingertips, rinse well and then I apply my Sukin all natural moisturizer for sensitive skin (which is also fabulous stuff), and that&#x27;s it. My skin looks flawless. I am amazed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cosmetologist  and my 62 year old skin look perfect.All of my dark spots on the side of my face are gone.Must try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but for this I had to! I picked up this cleanser 3 years ago at Marshalls for 5 dollars and have been addicted ever since. I have mild rosacea and have never found anything that has not broke me out until.... This!!!! I have already got 2 of my friends addicted to it, bad thing is the store never carries allot of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for his sensitive skin.  He appreciates that it doesn&#x27;t have any lingering scent to it...but it does have the scent of carrots.  He said it is tingly when using it but he&#x27;s noticed that the redness on his face has diminished quite a bit.  No other product he&#x27;s ever used that made the claim &amp;#34;reduces redness&amp;#34; ever worked so kudos to &amp;#34;40 Carrots Cleanser&amp;#34;.  We&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I am 37 and have had acne since I was a teenager. Even more unfair: I&#x27;ve started to get wrinkles! Wah! My skin is picky, fair, oily and congested--or was, until I got this stuff. I use it alone 3-4 times a week and with an exfoliating scrubber 3-4 times a week. It, followed by the [[ASIN:B003C3U9GW 40 Carrots Retinol-Rich Skin Care Carrot Acai Sleep Cream 2oz.]] every day, has saved my skin. Literally (and I don&#x27;t use that word incorrectly). I despaired of ever finding anything I could afford that would work for me. I looked in the mirror tonight and barely recognized myself. I still get a blemish here and there, but it&#x27;s nothing like before, with the crops of them over my chin and cheeks every week. I hardly ever use foundation anymore. Smells good, too, and no parabens! Looooooove!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE FACE CLEANSER: feels rich &amp; foams going on, however it&#x27;s the smell that really makes this special.  Wish it was in stock more often.</li>
    <li> I bought this project at TJ Maxx.  I have sensitive skin and it broke me out in a rash, like hives.  Not sure this is suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be good for dry skin, and that it used more Natural products. Wrong. It has Fragrance, and Red #40.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized. It has a pleasant smell and texture. The pump dispenser is handy and works very well.</li>
    <li> 40 CARROTS is the best skin care line i have found in years...in just a week, my face feels smoother and firmer...</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Very satisfied.</li>
