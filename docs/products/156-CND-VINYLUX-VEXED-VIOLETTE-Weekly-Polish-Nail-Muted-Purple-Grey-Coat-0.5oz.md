      <li>a perfect combo for a busy mom</li>
      <li>I loved how this polish stayed on for a week, as promised, and looked good the whole time with just some tip wear.</li>
      <li>The color is just ok.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color of the 5 I have.</li>
      <li>I suggest using their top coat also,</li>
      <li>you have healthy nails and never a problem with polish, then go for it.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>this is the best nail polish ever-it will last the entire week even with lots of washing dishes-i was so impressed</li>
      <li>i love this product.  </li>
      <li>I will be getting more colors from this brand :)</li>
      <li>Love the Vinylux Polish.</li>
      <li>Love the color - like a shiny gunmetal.</li>
      <li>Essie polishes work much better than this one.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>This polish is a great product so far.</li>
      <li>a stronger polish to help keep nails strong and resist breaking/ bending.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too dark and with the purple cast to it, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>And, this is a really nice dark purple that is great for the winter months.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick!</li>
      <li>Beautiful muted, easy to wear shade somewhere between brown, grey and purple!  </li>
      <li>Be sure to do 2 coats and also get the top coat by the same brand as it lasts better with their top coat.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Dries super fast!!</li>
      <li>The first coat of some of the vinylux color look streaky after the first coat but look great after another coat and when they dry.</li>
      <li>Gel nails pop right off</li>
      <li>:  goes on evenly and dries super fast.</li>
      <li>it is more durable than regular polish.</li>
      <li>I have purchased another CND product from a different seller and I love the way it looks.  </li>
      <li>its clumpy, difficult to apply, color is awesome though</li>
      <li>I will try using regular nail polish with the vinylux clear on top and see if that is as damaging as the full vinylux regimen.</li>
      <li>great color, long lasting without need to touch up and fast drying.  </li>
      <li>I would probably order it again because I love the color so much, hoping I would not have the same problem.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hooked on the vinylux polish becase pretty much nothing else will stay on my nails.  </li>
      <li>These polishes last over a week, easily.  </li>
      <li>For my money and time, Dazzle Dry is a much better product.</li>
      <li>and I have purchased a few more colors already!</li>
      <li>This vinylux vexed violette was easy to put on and lasts at least a week or more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this color and the bright pink for the last 2 months.</li>
      <li>I was really dissatisfied with the quality and look.</li>
      <li>Vexed Violet is a very wearable color.</li>
      <li>It held up reasonably well, but it didn&#x27;t make it to a week.</li>
      <li>However, the bother of putting on this polish and dealing with the streakiness, etc., is more trouble than it is worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; as it dries very quickly - and lasts longer than my regular enamel polishes.</li>
      <li>I love vinylux and none of the other colors I have, have that problem.</li>
      <li>This polish works so well and lasts me a good 5 days without any chipping and trust me when I tell you that I am very hard on my nails.  </li>
      <li>Love that the color lasts about 2 weeks with little chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  </li>
      <li>This particular polish doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims the manufacturer makes.</li>
      <li>Unless your nails have absolutely no ridges and are perfectly smooth, you will find this comes out streaky</li>
      <li>stained, which is not the biggest deal, but most importantly, so dried out.</li>
      <li>High shine, looks professional.</li>
      <li>I have now ordered about 7 different colors because I like it so much!</li>
      <li>This polish does last longer but u need to put a top coat on to keep it lasting long  and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t get 7 days, the color stays much longer than regular polish.  </li>
      <li>Has enough of glitter effect to make nail imperfections less easy to see.  </li>
      <li>Really look bad compared to the nice nails I had before (which is why I wanted to show them off with long lasting shiny polish to begin with!).</li>

<li> Really look bad compared to the nice nails I had before (which is why I wanted to show them off with long lasting shiny polish to begin with!).</li>
<li> I like the durability of the long lasting Vinylux line.</li>
<li> It stains them bright pink (must be a red base color in there somewhere).</li>
<li> I will only purchase from the other seller or find a store that sells this product.</li>
<li> like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks, and my nails are peeling off layer after layer, they are short, and breaking constantly.</li>
<li> I think it might be an old bottle of polish,  as it also didn&#x27;t stay on past a day on the tip of my nails.  </li>
<li> It also takes MUCH longer to dry as it is rather thick and heavy in consistency.</li>
<li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me</li>
<li> While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does.</li>
<li> Now, does Vinylux hurt your nails more than regular polish that uses a separate base...</li>
<li> Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so</li>
<li> Maybe it&#x27;s from how it was stored by the seller or some other factor.  </li>
<li> The polish actually stays on my nails for at least 5 days.  </li>
<li> Just not worth it for me.</li>
<li> They are slightly discolored and peeling at the tips.</li>
<li> It had clumps in it, like dried nail polish.</li>
<li> and you can see any defects in the nail bed (ridges, bumps, uneven nail texture) through the polish.  </li>
<li> Or maybe wear once and let your nails breathe for a few weeks.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the bottle I got, but when I got it, the polish was not very smooth.  </li>
<li> The consistency of the other product was smoother as I applied it, vs. this product was thick.  </li>
<li> the answer is I&#x27;m not sure</li>
<li> really hard to paint the nail with it, its thick and clumpy and is not going on evenly.</li>
<li> Something that stays on my nails for at least a week or longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This purple has a shimmer in it, is a deep bluish-grayish -purple. Love it.  Added GILDED PLEASURE on the tip of the nail. a great effect. This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!</li>
    <li> Bought this nail polish and it works and looks great.  Holds up for at least a week and it is more durable than regular polish.</li>
    <li> I have purchased another CND product from a different seller and I love the way it looks.  The consistency of the other product was smoother as I applied it, vs. this product was thick.  I think it might be an old bottle of polish,  as it also didn&#x27;t stay on past a day on the tip of my nails.  I contacted the seller, who said they cannot accept any product back, which I understand, but I believe I should have received my money back.  I will only purchase from the other seller or find a store that sells this product.</li>
    <li> Liked this color. This stayed on great. At least 10 days. Its an opaque color. I did put topcoat on again middle of week to  freshen color up. Looks great.</li>
    <li> this is the best nail polish ever-it will last the entire week even with lots of washing dishes-i was so impressed, I will  probably only buy this type from now on</li>
    <li> Application is the same as any other nail polish, the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me (I am VERY hard on my nails). Other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil, which I am not doing so maybe the polish would last longer if I did?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can change my polish weekly without dedicating an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to UV rays. The color selection is fairly vast with this product. I have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so as well as continue to purchase and use the product myself.</li>
    <li> This polish works so well and lasts me a good 5 days without any chipping and trust me when I tell you that I am very hard on my nails.  I wash dishes, I type a lot, I wash my hands a lot too.  Great stuff and I have purchased a few more colors already!</li>
    <li> It was all I had hoped for.  Something that stays on my nails for at least a week or longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on the vinylux polish becase pretty much nothing else will stay on my nails.  And, this is a really nice dark purple that is great for the winter months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the bottle I got, but when I got it, the polish was not very smooth.  It had clumps in it, like dried nail polish. I love vinylux and none of the other colors I have, have that problem. Maybe it&#x27;s from how it was stored by the seller or some other factor.  I would probably order it again because I love the color so much, hoping I would not have the same problem.</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not impressed by this polish. I found it to be difficult to apply, especially without any base coat underneath.  Unless your nails have absolutely no ridges and are perfectly smooth, you will find this comes out streaky and you can see any defects in the nail bed (ridges, bumps, uneven nail texture) through the polish.  It also takes MUCH longer to dry as it is rather thick and heavy in consistency. The CND topcoat is good and does prolong wear. However, the bother of putting on this polish and dealing with the streakiness, etc., is more trouble than it is worth. For my money and time, Dazzle Dry is a much better product.</li>
    <li> Great color,price,product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Vexed Violet is a very wearable color. It held up reasonably well, but it didn&#x27;t make it to a week. Part of the equation that no one thinks about is the quality of the nail. Mine are awful, so if my nail peels, it is going to take the polish right with it!</li>
    <li> i love this product.  great color, long lasting without need to touch up and fast drying.  a perfect combo for a busy mom</li>
    <li> Beautiful rich color, wears nicely with a good top coat</li>
    <li> Beautiful muted, easy to wear shade somewhere between brown, grey and purple!  Has enough of glitter effect to make nail imperfections less easy to see.  Now, does Vinylux hurt your nails more than regular polish that uses a separate base...the answer is I&#x27;m not sure but it&#x27;s possible.  I plan to wear some polish, take a week off to treat my nails, then see how that goes!</li>
    <li> Love the Vinylux Polish. Stays on my nails for 7-10 days. I no longer go to the salon for gel. It has been a money saver for me. I have now ordered about 7 different colors because I like it so much!</li>
    <li> This polish does last longer but u need to put a top coat on to keep it lasting long  and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a stronger polish to help keep nails strong and resist breaking/ bending.</li>
    <li> Great polish in a great color!</li>
    <li> its clumpy, difficult to apply, color is awesome though</li>
    <li> nice color doesn&#x27;t chip</li>
    <li> I like the durability of the long lasting Vinylux line. This is a particularly nice color which has depth and nice sheen. The first coat of some of the vinylux color look streaky after the first coat but look great after another coat and when they dry.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t get 7 days, the color stays much longer than regular polish.  The color looks just like the bottle.</li>
    <li> These polishes last over a week, easily.  I suggest using their top coat also, it is really good, keeps the polish shiny and chip-resistant.  Color is very nice, too.</li>
    <li> I work with my hands so can&#x27;t keep nail polish on without it chipping in a day or two. Gel nails pop right off,  I think I must have oily nails. This polish, with the top coat, stays on almost two weeks!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color of the 5 I have.</li>
    <li> I loved how this polish stayed on for a week, as promised, and looked good the whole time with just some tip wear. Even through hundreds of alcohol washes as an RN. However, when I removed the polish, my nails were a wreck: stained, which is not the biggest deal, but most importantly, so dried out. It&#x27;s been a few weeks, and my nails are peeling off layer after layer, they are short, and breaking constantly. Really look bad compared to the nice nails I had before (which is why I wanted to show them off with long lasting shiny polish to begin with!). It is a &amp;#34;first-world problem&amp;#34;, I know, but disappointing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think when my nails recover (months from now?) I will try using regular nail polish with the vinylux clear on top and see if that is as damaging as the full vinylux regimen.</li>
    <li> This vinylux vexed violette was easy to put on and lasts at least a week or more.  The color is great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the best nails and really knew better. I&#x27;ve used this color and the bright pink for the last 2 months. I never let my nails breathe. Now?  They are slightly discolored and peeling at the tips. I&#x27;ll have to use Nailtiques #2 to get the strength back in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  goes on evenly and dries super fast. Love that the color lasts about 2 weeks with little chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  (for me) nails discolored and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have healthy nails and never a problem with polish, then go for it. Or maybe wear once and let your nails breathe for a few weeks.  Just not worth it for me.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. It stays on for a week without chipping! The color is just ok. Not as purple as I thought it would be. Shipped quick!</li>
    <li> Love the color - like a shiny gunmetal. But this is the only vinylux polish that stains my nails. It stains them bright pink (must be a red base color in there somewhere).</li>
    <li> This particular polish doesn&#x27;t live up to the claims the manufacturer makes. .its really hard to paint the nail with it, its thick and clumpy and is not going on evenly. .I tried myself and took it to the salon to get my manicure done with it. .both results were poor. .it does hold about 3 days without chipping. .but I was really dissatisfied with the quality and look. Essie polishes work much better than this one.</li>
    <li> LOVE this polish! It&#x27;s my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; as it dries very quickly - and lasts longer than my regular enamel polishes. High shine, looks professional. Be sure to do 2 coats and also get the top coat by the same brand as it lasts better with their top coat. I will be getting more colors from this brand :)</li>
    <li> I have use CND shellacs for years and they are the best product on the market. However, Vinilux series are not at all living up to the same standards in it&#x27;s class. While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does. Frankly, I think it is even inferior to a regular OPI  nail polish. Dissappointed.</li>
    <li> Love Vinylux products!  The polish actually stays on my nails for at least 5 days.  I especially love this color.  It&#x27;s not too dark and with the purple cast to it, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
