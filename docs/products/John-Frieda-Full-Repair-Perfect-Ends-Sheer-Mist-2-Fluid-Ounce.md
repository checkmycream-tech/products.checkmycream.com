    <li> I use this product on my daughters hair. She has medium, very wavy hair. The trick is to use it when the hair is dry. In the morning, her hair is difficult to comb. I spray this stuff on and comb it through. Her hair is smooth with a nice wave. When it dries, it isn&#x27;t frizzy. I do recommend this product.</li>
