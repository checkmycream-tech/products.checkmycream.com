<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very refresh,looking good,getting way all &amp;#34;tired face&amp;#34;look!My face look shiny after first use.</li>
    <li> These work well in conjunction with the electrified facial massage masks, although they are just fine on their own too. The 12 piece set had a variety of options and they smell just fine. Sometimes these masks can have a medicinal scent but these did not.</li>
    <li> The masks come out of the bag looking a little bit like a folded wet paper towel, and open up with cutouts for the eyes, nose, and mouth.  I particularly enjoy the smells, and they&#x27;re really nice to use at night when they&#x27;ve been cooled.  These are really lovely and I would recommended having them for a day to relax, or to treat your skin.</li>
    <li> It for 4 seasons, I used twice per week. My skin changed a lot , the masks really moisturizer . Really fit for Asian skin , also the smell is good !</li>
    <li> My face feels very soft and moisturized. They are really cheap with diverse choices. They smell good too! love them</li>
    <li> After recently reading about Facial Sheet Masks, I just had to try them! This is a great variety of masks. I ordered this to take on a family reunion trip for all the teen girls &amp; moms. We had so much fun! Although most of the packaging is in Korean, there are English instructions on the back as well as an English description on the front. This set has 12 different varieties with several of them with similar benefits such as moisturizing. The package is easy to open, but the masks were a little difficult to unfold. The masks were nice &amp; moist and contained plenty of &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; as my teenager said. My cousin is fair skinned &amp; she felt some minor stinging, but it did not leave her face red or irritated at all. We felt silly with our masks on, but we had a lot of fun with them. Since I ordered these, I saw some sheet masks at a popular &amp;#34;hip&amp;#34; clothing store for $3 a piece, so I&#x27;m glad I bought these!</li>
    <li> I actually got these because I had heard about them from a Korean show I was watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really persistent problem with adult acne. Its mostly under control with some other products I use, such as proactive, but every once in a while my face will explode like it was attacked with lasers. I was having one these battles when these masks came in the mail. I put it on for the expected 20 minutes, did not wipe off my face after and then went to sleep. When I woke up not only was my skin really smooth and not dry at all but all the redness had gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using about 2-3 a week and my skin has been great. It does take a bit of time to get them in the mail so I would suggest ordering them before you need them.</li>
    <li> For this price you definitely can not beat it! Use a couple of the masks and gave some to friends and family. Everyone loved the masks!  Great products and a great deal!</li>
    <li> The ONLY complaint I have with these masks is the size doesn&#x27;t quite fit my face. However, I love all of these masks! My favorite one is the vitamin C mask.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think these cheap mask would work! But it actually is very effective at hydrating skin.  One application every other day was all it needs too keep skin nice and soft.  Very pleased, will buy more when price go gown again.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing face masks on Amazon for several years. They are quality masks that are reasonably priced.  There is a variety of masks in each set.  I use many Korean face products because they are all natural. Besides helping your skin, you need to wear a mask for 20 minutes and that is a great way to relax.</li>
    <li> Disappoint again about Korean masks. I saw some recommendation about this kind of masks so I just bought them and have a try. Well, I don&#x27;t like them at all.</li>
    <li> Great price for a package of face masks.  Makes my face feel hydrated, clean, and soft.  Have to hide them from my girls.</li>
    <li> Nice mix of moisturizing masks! I love that every pack is different. I like them my face feels great after using them. great price!</li>
    <li> I love these! So relaxing having them on my face after a shower. Makes me skin feel great! Definitely will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always so if-fy when buying asian skin care products on amazon, cause honestly half the time, they&#x27;re expired. Alot of these sellers, stock pile or buy these items in huge quantities so they dont have to keep ordering/buying them everytime someone orders, so basically they dont buy new ones until what they got runs out. But with these they didnt expire til a year later. Used to live in Korea and I used to use this brand once in a while. They marked up the price a little bit but I guess that counts for the shipping and whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;When people complain that these don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m curious if you&#x27;re using the face mask correctly, like do they wash their face and apply skin conditioner/booster/toner like you&#x27;re supposed to with most face masks?&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t reccommend using if you have oily skin, makes it more oiler (even though it says for all skin types pfft)&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because whoever packed these did a horrible job, some of them were basically forced into the package and ended up with creases and folds on them but thats okay I guess?</li>
    <li> the product amazing !!they are great and are very refreshing! 100% recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My face changed a lot! I really loved them and they was delivered on time</li>
    <li> Am obsessed with these masks</li>
    <li> Bought them hoping for something I could easily do at home.  These are easy (holes are cut for your nose, eyes and mouth).  Mind you they do tingle a little bit, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for sensitive skin.  You cannot wear these unless you are laying down, it recommends for 15-20 minutes, so great for a quick nap or right before bed.  My skin feels refreshed and much better and I love the variety of the pack so I can choose which treatment I want.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love having a variety of masks to use. All of the masks gave my face a lot of moisture and made my face feel very soft afterwards. The masks fit perfectly over my face and felt very nice over my skin. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> They are very saturated and moist. Which I love, they come with more than enough product. The masks themselves however Im not sure if they are good. My skin is a little sensitive and sometimes it leaves a mild burning feeling. Bu these are very fun masks and I would recommend these to people just getting started in masks.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I bought over 100 because of the easiness of use compared to lotion or cream. However, it does not absorb to the skin as well as lotion or cream. Also, it has a variety of different ingredients, but you cannot feel the difference between them. You can buy just one type or mixed ones.</li>
    <li> It will feel like something is on your face when you take them off, but I don&#x27;t think it is bad. But you lightly was your face off in the morning it is a great primer.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the one&#x27;s that i usually buy at the body shop got more expensive so i thought I would try something new. They were not bad, and I will not say anything bad about them, they just werent what I&#x27;m used to and so I wasnt a big fan.</li>
    <li> I have always loved these facial masks from Korea.  I had a neighbor friend from Korea and she introduced me to a whole bunch of Korean beauty products.  She got me hooked on the face masks and since I see results from these, and not from ones locally here, I continue to buy more from this company with continued success.</li>
    <li> not great quality. these make my lips feel numb. not as luxurious and hydrating as other brands.</li>
    <li> I really liked it ~My skin felt soft and looked glowing .The only thing is ,it only lasted for maybe a day ?Maybe it was my fault since I don&#x27;t have a very good skin routine.I definitely recommend it ,though!:D</li>
    <li> Thank you very much !!! I am a customer 100 % satisfied</li>
    <li> Excellent! Improved my skin ^^</li>
    <li> I love them all except the pomegranate one I personally thought it smelled weird , but it made my skin feel great</li>
    <li> Not the best but works OK. It is ok if you need a quick facial. There are better products out there. This one is cheap but you get what you pay.</li>
    <li> Meh. More like putting jelly on my face. The mask is obviously water base, not very moisturizing, but good enough if you want to refresh your face after a tiring day. It did not leave a softer skin after used. The smell is okay.</li>
    <li> These masks are really fun. I&#x27;ve done quit a lot of research on Korean and Japanese beauty regimes and wNted to give the masks a go. It&#x27;s hard to say what effect they had on me, maybe more moisturized? Lots of masks like these are expensive, some cost almost as much as this whole set did for the price of one. So that was nice.</li>
    <li> It was not moisturized the face as I wanted and also I felt some rush on my face. I don&#x27;t recommend this mask if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love these variety masks.  Whenever I get a chance, I use them.  Just wash your face as usual before you go to bed and apply moisturizer/night serum (optional) then put this mask on for at least 15-20 min (fell asleep with it on once - no prob).  I apply the extra liquid left from the mask on my neck... It may not fit quite right over your face but it should be fine unless you have unusually large or small face.... think it was designed for the Asian facial feature...  I found this out on a girls&#x27; weekend out and only Asian face seem to fit perfectly :)&lt;br /&gt;Still, everyone loved the smell of the masks (herb/rose/cucumber/snail/collagen...) and how we looked the next day!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great way to replenish your skin when you lead such a busy life and can&#x27;t get to the spa often!  It&#x27;s so affordable and makes for great stocking stuffers or &#x27;just because&#x27; gifts! Best wishes!</li>
    <li> They get the job done, hydrating and soothing. A good essence mask... I have had better but for the price this is great. Its not as forming to my face as others I have used but honestly its not bad at all.</li>
    <li> The smell of some of the sheets were a bit weird but it&#x27;s overall a great deal for your money.</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast! I have only tried the gold essence mask so far, but I love it!! I love the way my skin looks! I&#x27;m also Asian so it fit my face very well. I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dabbling with sheet masks lately. I really love these. A bit big on my face but the smells are nice and make my skin happy. Each pack has excess product in it which I have been decanting into little plastic travel jars. I put some on my face following the days I use a mask. Just a little bonus tip to get more out of your product. Will definitely buy this variety pack again! Love to share these with my friends.</li>
    <li> The packets came exactly as pictured and bigger than i expected. The masks are heavily saturated with the solution so I used the excess and rubbed it on my neck and arms. It is very refreshing. I kind of feels like that really fresh feeling in your mouth after you chew gum. Your face feels really awake and tingly. I personally love them. I plan to use 2 every week so these 12 will last me 6 weeks and then after that I will buy more!!</li>
    <li> Just getting into beauty masks and these affordable masks are a great start! They came quickly and I enjoy the variety. My skin feels so soft just after my first mask! (It was Rose) There is a lot of liquid in the packets so just be careful when opening them.</li>
    <li> Great products! Delivery was so fast and the masks are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all, and it makes my upper lip sting a lot. It&#x27;s also waaaaay too long for a normal face. Having purchased face masks from Korea before, I thought this would be good but it wasn&#x27;t. No visible effect like the ones from Etude House.</li>
    <li> I actually picked these up at my local Kirean market but I just wanted to write a review for the folks who don&#x27;t have a Korea town nearby. These are really amazing masks, especially on a budget. My local market had them at 50 cents a piece so I picked up 40 for $20 bucks. Only use them twice a week!! They&#x27;re really wonderful for soothing the skin and depuffing. I had no idea I was puffy until the first time after using them. They&#x27;re very relaxing if you&#x27;re looking to fit in a quick pampering session. They stay on great and I&#x27;m able to do housework with them on as well. My favorite is the gold because it is a true skin brightener! Make sure you don&#x27;t rinse after use and just pat in the excess goop until dried and you can use your normal moisturizers over it. A really wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Shipping is fast. Sheets fits my face well.  Stuff is ok for the money. If you expect more, then try some better ones</li>
    <li> So relaxing and refreshing.</li>
    <li> So far I love this mask ; I got a sample mask from A-poly . Green Tea . It smells wonderful and is very moist. It&#x27;s a kinda thick fabric mask. But feels amazing and after I felt tighter and simply enjoyed useing it.</li>
