    <li> I&#x27;m getting another one soon!</li>
    <li> Same scent as at Target or similar stores, but 2.5x the amount for less money. Perfect buy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was at a restaurant the I frequent and the Waiter had this on... Oh my I kept telling my friend that the smell was intoxicating so I ask what the name of the scent he was wearing was and this was it, I ordered some for my Husband for Fathers Day and he has had several compliments on it and now has a few friends wanting to add this scent to their collection.</li>
    <li> It smelled different (not as good) as the one I purchased from Walgreens. It&#x27;s worth about $8 dollars at most.</li>
    <li> everything showed up on time and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Great smell glad I bought it</li>
